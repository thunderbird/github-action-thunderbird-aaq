Moreover, the settings' arguments don't make sense in terms of what I see.  For example, I see the Thread column, whose settings – (""threadCol"":{""visible"":true,""ordinal"":""3""} – make sense since ""visible"" is set to ""true"", but I also see the  Attachments column, whose settings – ""attachmentCol"":{""visible"":false,""ordinal"":""7""} – *don't* make sense because ""visible"" is set to ""false"".  Similar no-sense settings occur in the second setting. </p><p>So there *is* a way to change the default column settings in Config Editor..., which makes a whole lot of sense, but the way the settings are set in these two settings, which apparently are not the ones that fully determine my default settings given the CardBook-related columns that I see, do *not* seem to make sense. </p><p>The ""Folder and its children..."" approach works, but it makes it harder than it should be, and it seems like there must be a way to change the defaults in Config Editor....  If there is, please tell me how.   </p><p>Thanks for any help you can give... </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1700036;,doctorjah1

Thunderbird 128.5.2esr (64-bit); Windows 11 Home, 23H2 Have used Thunderbird and Gmail together for over a decade - various glitches along the way, but nothing for which some solution was not found, at least up until now. </p><p>1)  On Dec 31, 2024, received an error msg ""Unable to write the email to the mailbox. Make sure the file system allows you write privileges, and you have enough disk space to copy the mailbox.""    Thunderbird Inbox for that gmail account had grown bloated - in part because Message Filtering had stopped working (another issue...): moved / deleted a bunch of emails, and was able to receive new ones. </p><p>2)  On Jan 1, 2025, ALL gmail accounts stopped receiving messages, initially with error of ""Connection to server.pop.gmail was reset.""   As of today (Jan 4), all accounts are still non-functioning, but T'bird has given up even throwing up an error when attempting to retrieve messages. Attempting to Send a msg results in: ""An error occurred while sending mail: Outgoing server (SMTP) error. The server responded:  Cannot connect to SMTP server 172.253.113.109 (172.253.113.109:587), connect error 10060."" </p><p>3)  Running Nordvpn and Norton security suite. Have defeated both, to no avail. (With close / reopen T'bird; Reboot system thrown in for good measure.)  Note: Have ran both of those apps, with Thunderbird, literally for years without any known problems due to the combination. </p><p>4)  Confirmed that the Gmail / Thunderbird settings agreed with Gmail recommendations (and each other). </p><p>5)  Removed permission for one of the accounts from google's site, hoping T'bird would prompt for new one: no go.  Then TRIED to Remove the Thunderbird-stored Account Password for that account, but was stymied by a ""Windows Security"" dialog asking for an Account PIN:  Do not recall ever creating such a beast for Thunderbird, and none of the possible stored Passwords proved acceptable. Also wonder why a Windows Security dialog is being tossed up from within T'bird.)   (The dialog box offers up a ""try another way"" option, but that simply calls up a prompt for Username / Password: NO COMBINATION of those worked.  Note that ALL such combos are stored in Bitwarden and eWallet, and work for those same accounts in other access situations.) </p><p>Obviously a frustrating situation. Am posting this in the hope that someone will be able to provide suggestions. In the meantime, have decided that it may be wise to look for alternative email solutions, although that is definitely a Non-Optimal approach: am a fan of Copernic Desktop Search, which only works with either Thunderbird or Outlook, and I have much preferred T'bird over the years. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1700173;1700509;,dierkdk

Please be patient with my long explaining. </p><p>My wife's parents have each their laptops. I had installed Thunderbird to them years a go. They never had a problem receiving their mails until last week. Now they can't receive emails but can send. On the other hand they can receive mails on their cellphones but not send (Android phones, not Thunderbird app). I have checked Thunderbirds setting on their laptops, everything was okay. </p><p>I have 4 laptops my own. I am going to give them numbers that you can follow me better. 1) asus (my daily personal pc) win 10 home. 2) Linux (my bussines pc) Mint 3 &amp;4 ) Fresh windows 10 pro installed unused pc. Only Firefox and Thunderbird are installed as extra. </p><p>I load parents' mail account manually to Thunderbird on my pc 2, 3 and 4. Result is the same, I can send mails but cant receive. I have created another mail account for them (same provider), result was also same (for pc 2,3,4). I have an email account on same provider, I load my account, resul is the same (for pc 2,3,4). I tried my other email accounts from another provider, all of them works perfect (for pc 2,3,4). So, I thought that the problem was on provider side. I called them and explained the problem. They said that all is ok on their side and I should contact to Thunderbird support. The name of provider is ""YouSee"" from Denmark. </p><p>But....... As a last thing I add their email account manually to my laptop 1 Asus. Then I started to receive hundreds of emails from their account, so their account worked on pc1. Then I thougth, if I transfer my Thunderbird from my pc 1 to 3 or 4 then problem will be solved. But didn't. After I moved my Thunderbird from pc1 to pc3 and to pc 4 parents account and my account on same provider (YouSee) could not receive mails but could send. All my other accounts from different providers worked perfectly on pc 3 and 4 after moving. </p><p>In some way, something is disturbing communication between Thunderbird and provider YouSee on all 5 laptops. All Thunderbirds on 6 laptops have same last version. I checked firewalls, Thunderbird has been marked on all of them. I blocked windows defender and firewalls, didn't help. I also tried all possible imap, pop3, cofigurations of the provider. I installed older versions of Thunderbird and tried, didn't work either. It can't be windows updates because all Windows pc er up to date. Windows version can't be the problem because my pc1 and parents' laptops have same Win 10 Home. It can't be Thunderbird updates because pc1 has some update as the others. </p><p>Can anybody help me to understand the reason of the problem? An email account can't work properly on 5 laptops but work normaly on the 6th pc while all provider and Thunderbird configurations are completely the same? What should I try more? </p><p><br> </p><p>Thank you all in advance.
