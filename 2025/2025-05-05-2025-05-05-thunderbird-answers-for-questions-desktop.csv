Usually after a power outage or PC crash the prefs.js file in the Thunderbird profile goes havoc and is replaced by a virgin prefs.js file with a size of 5 to 7 kB. This new file doesn't contain account settings, that's why Thunderbird opens an window while asking to ""Set Up your Existing Email address"" (see image) </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
