So I'm not surprised that it works in Outlook. </p><p>If you need to share Excel documents with others via email then use the best method which is attaching the excel document. That means the recipient can use the appropriate software to see the data, but please note not everyone uses Microsoft Office products, so you might want to be sure they can actually open excel documents. I use Open Office which does a reasonable job. </p><p>You can insert data by using Edit &gt;  'Paste without formatting' That works fine if you are only inserting copied text, but since all formattingis removed it's not going to solve a 'table' display issue. </p><p>Another alterative: Create a screendump image of the data in excel sheet and save as a jpg image, then insert the image into email instead either inline or as an attachment.  After all, if you are only displaying data, an image would work perfectly well. It also means anyone can easily open an image to see the information. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

But it did not come from this forum. </p><p>That it is asking for a password and knowing the simplicity of the telstra system.

What does the error message you see actually say.  We know only what you tell us about your setup so right now we know nothing at all about the specific of your issue, only my bias from dealing with bigpod and telstra for 40 years as a customer (They were slow but the PMG did get it done right when they did do things). I still wonder how the call numbers can have exceed those expected for about the last thirty years and no one has been sacked for their failure to get it right just once.  I have managed to reduce my dependence of the big Australian provider to only a mobile service.  But when you live on the first left after the back of beyond your choices for things tend to be very limited. </p><p>It is possible your settings are not correct as Bigpond accounts apparently still have different server settings to general Telstra users.  So  about all I can do it point you to the web page with the settings on and suggest you check them against what you have in account settings in Thunderbird. </p><p><a href=""https://www.telstra.com.au/support/email/imap-pop-smtp-mail-server-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.telstra.com.au/support/email/imap-pop-smtp-mail-server-settings</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Or it could possibly be that the prefs.js file is read-only. That is, it's not the IMAP account, it's that anything you do isn't being saved at shutdown.  If not sure how to access profile, do these steps:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open profile' - you are now in profile and can view the prefs.js file to see when last updated.

Warum ""<strong>inzwischen</strong>"" ein neues Konto einrichten? Was war dem voraus gegangen? Ich habe die Vermutung, dass TB beim Öffnen keine Konten und Ordner mehr angezeigt hat, sondern zum ""Einrichten einer bestehenden E-Mail-Adresse"" aufgefordert hat (see image).  Das passiert nicht selten nach Stromausfall, PC oder Thunderbird Absturz. Dabei wird die zentrale Datei <strong>prefs.js</strong> beschädigt und von TB durch eine neue jungfräuliche prefs.js ersetzt, die keine Konten-Parameter enthält. Deshalb kann TB beim Start keine Konten mehr finden und fordert zum Einrichten eines Kontos auf. </p><p>Um zu überprüfen, ob meine Diagnose stimmt, kannst du im Profilordner von TB nach einer 5 bis 10 kB großen aktuellen prefs.js Datei suchen, gleichzeitig auch nach der alten von TB in prefs-x.js umbenannten Datei, die wesentlich größer ist. Den Profilordner von TB findest du über Hilfe &gt; Informationen zur Fehlerbehebung &gt; Profilordner &gt; ""Ordner öffnen""....
