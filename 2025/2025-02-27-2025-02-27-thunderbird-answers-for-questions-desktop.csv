It is read-only, including it's contents and sometime including it's sub folders.  That may be because the server has it marked that way, or it could be because of the way it is named.  fundamentally I would recommend against any attempt to move entire folders of mail.  I would also recommend against trying to move more than a few hundred emails at a time and I would suggest you make sure there is no antivirus slowing things by trying to scan the emails or the encrypted connection as the process is prone to silent failure, from timeouts mostly, but any outside influence like scanning makes the process even less reliable than in inherently is. </p><p>IMAP is a mail protocol with a focus on syncing mail to a server and is not designed to move entire mail accounts as folk appear to be trying to do these days.
