I would also recommend against trying to move more than a few hundred emails at a time and I would suggest you make sure there is no antivirus slowing things by trying to scan the emails or the encrypted connection as the process is prone to silent failure, from timeouts mostly, but any outside influence like scanning makes the process even less reliable than in inherently is. </p><p>IMAP is a mail protocol with a focus on syncing mail to a server and is not designed to move entire mail accounts as folk appear to be trying to do these days.

There is still no opportunity to use the interface.  I used the following steps for ""not running"".  What else can I do? </p><p>To troubleshoot Thunderbird, you can follow these steps:  If Thunderbird is already running, click ≡ &gt; Help &gt; Troubleshoot Mode... and in the Restart in Troubleshoot Mode prompt, choose Restart. If Thunderbird is not running, hold down the Shift key while starting Thunderbird, hold down the option key while starting Thunderbird, or run this command from Terminal: thunderbird -safe-mode. Start the Thunderbird program and open Thunderbird Menu. Now, click on Help &gt;&gt; Troubleshoot Mode. Select “Restart” to start the “Troubleshoot mode”. Next, select “Reset Toolbars &amp; Controls” or “Disable all add-ons” as per preference. </p>",jfcasey,false,0,0

Some email providers require a different password (called an 'app' password) for use on email clients. If your password works online, but not on Thunderbird, that may be the issue.
