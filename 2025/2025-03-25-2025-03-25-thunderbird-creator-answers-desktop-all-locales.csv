The only option I had was to export to Thunderbird mobile and I downloaded TB mobile to my android Tablet. Now I have a clean install and I need to have my address book back. I have searched high and low on your support pages, Reddit, and others. The only thing that comes close is from your support page that doesn't answer the question as it is circular. how to export to mobile and then import to mobile. How do I import the K9s file my TB mobile exports into my TB desktop? Thank you for your time James Maule </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Corvuscroft
