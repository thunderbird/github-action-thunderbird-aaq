The only option I had was to export to Thunderbird mobile and I downloaded TB mobile to my android Tablet. Now I have a clean install and I need to have my address book back. I have searched high and low on your support pages, Reddit, and others. The only thing that comes close is from your support page that doesn't answer the question as it is circular. how to export to mobile and then import to mobile.

I often need to transfer email from one account to another within the client.  When the message I move contains attachments weighing more than 5MB, Thunderbird crashes and the transfer does not take place.  The only solution found, which I would like to avoid, is to download the message with a <em>save as</em>, then drag the .eml file to the right folder on the different account.  I also tried setting the parameter <em>mailnews.tcptimeout</em> from 100 (default) to 1000. Nothing has changed. Is there a procedure or program setting that allows <em>seamless transfer of messages</em> from one account to another even when it contains attachments?
