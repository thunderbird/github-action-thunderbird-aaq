With my desktop version, I have no trouble sending and receiving emails. I am using version 142.0 (64-bit) of Thunderbird, and the desktop computer is Windows 10.   </p><p>I have 2 issues sending emails.   </p><p>First issue, my Pixel 9 Pro XL does not send emails anymore.  It was working fine until recently.  The email is stalled in the outbox.  I tried reloading the outgoing server settings, I get an error message; see attached error message.  My Android receives emails fine, but will not send them.  My phone syncs well with my desktop.  However, the outbox doesn't sync, so I can't send the stalled emails from the desktop when I'm back in my office.   </p><p>Second issue is my POS program (Windward Software System 5) stopped sending out emails as well.  I worked with the tech department at the software company, and they said it isn't an issue with them, nothing has changed with them, no upgrades or changes on their end.  Some of our older machines here, that haven't received the recent upgrade with Thunderbird, are still sending emails fine.  Just a couple of computers are having this trouble of not sending emails from out POS software, it's the ones that have received the Thunderbird upgrade.     For the outgoing settings, we are using the default port 465, and the connection security is SSL/TLS.  Authentication method: is a normal password.  I am hoping you have an answer for me.   Please don't share the attachment with the community forums.  Everything else will be fine.   </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Kathi McNally </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1760355;,kathi15
