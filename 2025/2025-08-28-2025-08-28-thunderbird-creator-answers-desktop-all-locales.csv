But it looks different. The window is all the incoming list. It used to be divided by the top half showing the list and the bottom half showing whichever message I clicked on. Now I have to double click on the message and it opens a new tab. How do I make it go back to the way it used to display. That was a lot less clunky than opening a new tab. I'm also having trouble finding my calendar and address book. But that's a question for the Geek Squad who told me they backed up all my data. </p>,thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1760129;,JimBit
