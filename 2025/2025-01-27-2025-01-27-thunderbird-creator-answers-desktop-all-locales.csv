Now, I realize the config value is for text only - but just who DOES compose in text only mode? This is on macOS 10.15 (yes, I need to upgrade my system) and T-bird 128.6.0 esr. </p><p>Elsewhere, I have SUGGESTED that T-bird PARTNER with LibreOffice to use a scaled-down Writer FOR composition to provide more robust writing tools for those of us who DO write! </p><p>Doesn't Outlook have something similar? IF so, Thunderbird isn't really competing. </p><p>Still, I'm curious about the wrap at 101 characters! It's clear that it wraps, when I re-size my composition window. </p><p>When I compose, I will at times include inline images and emojis and will use various fonts and bold/underline/italics along with enlarging some words. ALL these things work in LibreOffice Writer - why not in Thunderbird?? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",phubert28

I clicked and unclicked the ""Show only unread messages"" with no effect.  I rebuilt the indexes multiple times, it shows over 1400 messages in that folder but the read messages are still not displaying.
