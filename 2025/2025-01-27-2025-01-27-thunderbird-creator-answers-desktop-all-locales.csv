Now, I realize the config value is for text only - but just who DOES compose in text only mode? This is on macOS 10.15 (yes, I need to upgrade my system) and T-bird 128.6.0 esr. </p><p>Elsewhere, I have SUGGESTED that T-bird PARTNER with LibreOffice to use a scaled-down Writer FOR composition to provide more robust writing tools for those of us who DO write! </p><p>Doesn't Outlook have something similar? IF so, Thunderbird isn't really competing. </p><p>Still, I'm curious about the wrap at 101 characters! It's clear that it wraps, when I re-size my composition window. </p><p>When I compose, I will at times include inline images and emojis and will use various fonts and bold/underline/italics along with enlarging some words. ALL these things work in LibreOffice Writer - why not in Thunderbird?? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",phubert28

So please forgive my ""newbie"" status. I'm trying to add a secondary email account which is from the ""Microsoft"" camp. Yeah! I know, but I needed an email address that hadn't been already taken.  </p><p>I'm following the steps in the FAQs and doing the steps correctly and they have worked in the past. I needed to rebuild my PC again and re-setting up my Thunderbird profiles again. </p><p>The problem I'm having is that I'm getting stuck on step 4. Granting Thunderbird Account Access. Thunderbird opens up the OAuth validation window, but it's completely blank and I've waited to see if it will come good, but nothing even after leaving it open for an hour. I have included a screenshot of the offending window. </p><p>I haven't had this issue before as they just worked. Is there something I have missed this time around? Please help. </p><p>The email domain I'm trying to add is ""&lt;&lt;email address&gt;&gt;@outlook.com.au"" if that helps. Thunderbird finds all the correct configuration settings and tries to ask for access, but Microsoft Server isn't responding correctly I'm gathering. Is there some workaround? </p><p>I'm using Windows 11 Pro for Workstations Version 24H2 OS build 26100.2605 Experience Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.26100.36.0 b I'm enrolled in the Insider Program (Beta Channel). </p><p>I'm using Thunderbird 128.6.0esr (64-Bit) Stock out of the wrapper setup. I hope that helps. </p><p>PS. I have no problem adding Gmail accounts using the same method, and they all work. So not sure why <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> and/or <a href=""http://Outlook.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com.au</a> accounts don't work. </p><p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated.
