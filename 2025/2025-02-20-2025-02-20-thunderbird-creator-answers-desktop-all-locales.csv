Thus while I would take simple and obvious precautions, I wasn't overly concerned with security.  </p><p>Now, I'm connecting Thunderbird to my personal email accounts, including my ProtonMail account that I do use for private information. I'm happy with the ProtonBridge handles encryption and decryption when you send and receive emails but as I understand it, once on the device, all of your emails are just stored in plain text. </p><p>Yes you can put a Password on Thunderbird but that wouldn't deter anyone with any motive. I'm aware many people site FDE as a solution to this problem and while it's part of a solution, I would like an additional layer of security. I would like everything inside of '/home/user/.thunderbird' encrypted at rest. Ideally the Master Password would decrypt it but it's not the end of the world if it's a little more laborious. </p><p>From everything I've seen so far, unless I send and receive all of my emails with PGP, my emails will be stored plain text on my PC. Perhaps installing Thunderbird inside a veracrypt volume is the only option? </p><p>Any advice would be appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1713361;1713362;,chattysiddy
