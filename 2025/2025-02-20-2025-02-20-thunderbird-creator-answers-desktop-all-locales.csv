I have just about tweaked all of the settings to have it just the way I want, but there is one thing I am not able to figure out. </p><p>Each time I open Thunderbird, every folder for every account I have expands all the way down so that every single folder is expanded. I have to go through and collapse probably 50+ folders each time to get it to be manageable. </p><p>I've searched around and not really found anything that has been helpful to address this. I never remember having this issue the last time I was a user, so I assume there has to be a setting I am missing. </p><p>Help please! </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1713282;,cody9
