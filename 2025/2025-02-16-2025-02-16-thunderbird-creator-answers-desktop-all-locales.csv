My name is Gloria but my last name is not Duarte.  These are definitely emails intended for me and are not someone else's.  I can't figure out why the name was changed or how to correct it.  My emails come from <a href=""http://Comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Comcast.net</a> and I've checked that account and it's still in my correct name.  I've changed the password on that account regularly so I don't think it is originating from there.  What do I do to get to the bottom of this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",gloria551

(Note: Neither user is an admin account.) </p><p>Steps: 1. On user 2, launch Thunderbird. 2. Get the dialog that there's an update to 128.7.0esr. 3. Click the Restart to update button. 4. Get the dialog that there's an update to 128.7.0esr. 5. Click the Restart to update button. 6. Get the dialog to enter admin ID and password for installing the Thunderbird helper. 7. Enter the admin ID and password and click OK. 8. Get a (surprise) dialog to authorize Thunderbird to discover my devices. 9. I choose to deny. </p><p>Expected result: Thunderbird relaunches, now with 128.7.0esr. Actual result: Get the dialog to enter admin ID and password for installing the Thunderbird helper. </p><p>10. Log off user 2 and log on to user 1. 11. Download 128.7.0esr from the Mozilla website. 12. Check the hash. 13. Install, choosing to replace the old Thunderbird in the shared Applications folder. 14. System Settings, About, System report, Applications 15. Verify the signature is signed by Mozilla 16. Launch Thunderbird </p><p>Expected and actual result: Thunderbird launches and I can use it normally. </p><p>17. Log out of user 1 and log into user 2. 18. Launch Thunderbird </p><p>Expected result: Thunderbird launches and I can use it normally. Actual result: Get the dialog to enter admin ID and password for installing the Thunderbird helper. </p><p>I'm guessing there's some manner of residual file that's preventing Thunderbird from launching on user 2. I've verified Thunderbird is in the system's Application folder and not in user 1's files. </p><p>How do I clear the pending install from user 2 so that Thunderbird will launch for user 2? </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",cbelov

He used Thunderbird under Win and so I collected all servernames and account data from his three mail-accounts. What I did not mention and what he did not tell me is, that he -over the last 10 years always moved important mails out of his mailboxes and stored them in the so called ""local folder"" (in German ""Lokale Ordner"" at the end of the left window.  </p><p>Of course he was shocked when he mentioned that those content was not there any longer.. after starting Linux for the first time (and after setting up his mailboxes) </p><p>Now, the good thing is, that there is a backup from last October. (made by his 16 years old son - he copied the complete thunderbird folder in the filesystem ... and did not use any internal backup-mechanisms)  Can I use this ""backup"" to restore the ""local folders""&nbsp;?  - if those local files are stored in this backup - and if yes, how I could retrieve them </p><p>I have a ""tree-file"" showing the complete structure of the thunderbird folder... tree.txt... But I am not allowed to upload it here, as there are only images allowed. </p><p>I kindly ask you for help. As mentioned we are talking about 10 years mails frommy friend... Andof course I helped him for free to move from Windows to Linux. </p><p>Yours Karl </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",karl.exler1
