My name is Gloria but my last name is not Duarte.  These are definitely emails intended for me and are not someone else's.  I can't figure out why the name was changed or how to correct it.  My emails come from <a href=""http://Comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Comcast.net</a> and I've checked that account and it's still in my correct name.  I've changed the password on that account regularly so I don't think it is originating from there.  What do I do to get to the bottom of this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",gloria551
