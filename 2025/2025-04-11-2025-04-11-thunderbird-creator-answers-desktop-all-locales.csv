It is now completely useless, I can neither send nor receive email. It was fine this morning, when I presume I still had 128.9.0. My ISP is worse than useless, if you aren't using their lame webmail interface, you don't have a solvable problem. I downgraded back to 128.9.0 by following this post:  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/16jwt7a/%E2%84%B9_how_to_downgrade_from_thunderbird_115_to_102/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/16jwt7a/%E2%84%B9_how_to_downgrade_from_thunderbird_115_to_102/</a> It retrieved email exactly once. I closed and reopened Thunderbird and it hasn't worked since. I've repeatedly deleted the compatibility.ini file. I tried updating to the current version and downgrading again and it isn't working.
