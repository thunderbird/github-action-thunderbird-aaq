It is now completely useless, I can neither send nor receive email. It was fine this morning, when I presume I still had 128.9.0. My ISP is worse than useless, if you aren't using their lame webmail interface, you don't have a solvable problem. I downgraded back to 128.9.0 by following this post:  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/16jwt7a/%E2%84%B9_how_to_downgrade_from_thunderbird_115_to_102/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/16jwt7a/%E2%84%B9_how_to_downgrade_from_thunderbird_115_to_102/</a> It retrieved email exactly once. I closed and reopened Thunderbird and it hasn't worked since. I've repeatedly deleted the compatibility.ini file. I tried updating to the current version and downgrading again and it isn't working. What do I try next? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1724931;,cable198

Sometime after 4/2/2025 my login fails with the message ""Login to server <a href=""http://imap.googlemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.googlemail.com</a>....failed"". I've tried changing the imap server to ""<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>"" but get similar results. For some reason, it appears that something changed on 4/3 that prevents a successful login to the gmail server from Tbird.
