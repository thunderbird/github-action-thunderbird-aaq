All emails were there when I closed Thunderbird , and shut down the laptop before going to bed. I'm told messages are being downloaded, but messages don't appear. </p>",tim320,false,0,0

Instead, create the IMAP account along side of the POP account, Now, since iMAP wasn't designed for high volume uploads, I suggest creating a filter to run manually to COPY the messages from the POP account to the IMAP account. Once you have done that, you can delete the POP account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
