Do NOT copy the msf files, as those index files are automatically recreated.   - if you are uncomfortable with that, you can use the addon, importexporttools, and then highlight Local Folders, rightclick and select the importexport option to import mbox files, and then select those same Mail\&lt;POPaccount&gt; files and the addon will place them in the Local Folders folder for you.   </p><p>If you do not know where the files are, do this - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - exit thunderbird and you are now in the profile where you can see the Mail folder.  </p><p>Let me know if you need assistance there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

All the FBI field offices, DOD, DOJ and others affiliated with other Gov. departments, some State and my personal emails. No I didn't read them all, but I did scan the titles and read selected ones. When they were downloaded from ↝Thunderbird / Yahoo, the online inbox cache completely emptied. You can verify it yourself Just do a search for Frontier / Yahoo mail.
