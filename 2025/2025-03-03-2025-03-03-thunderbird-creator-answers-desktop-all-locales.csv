Today I was deleting emails not needed to free up some space, restarted the computer, and all my open tabs are blank, both the heading on the tab as well as the tab itself.  I have no way to know what those emails were, except to go through a couple months of emails, looking for ones I had open.  Any idea how to restore the text in the blank email tabs? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lloyd27

I usually have a problem finding a MS file - seems to have a number of ""documents"" folder locations. Assume some are ""copy of"" folders. So every copy I could find of the *file* gave an error of ""File name"" ""Not implemented"". I thought at first it was a pseudo-folder issue, why I tried all of them. </p><p>One of the suggestions I read  was to log out and back in to TBird. I x'd out of it, and said yes to save as draft. When I logged back in, the Drafts folder was empty. I did a search all on my account, and found it, with the folder listed as Drafts. But I still couldn't get the Excel to attach (I finally solved it by using Outlook. Not my favorite option, but it seems to have worked. </p><p>I went back to Drafts after sending with Outlook, and I'm not sure what happened, but it was no longer showing in the Drafts, and then I did something else, and it showed up in Drafts. No, not sure what I did. </p><p>Anyone have any ideas?
