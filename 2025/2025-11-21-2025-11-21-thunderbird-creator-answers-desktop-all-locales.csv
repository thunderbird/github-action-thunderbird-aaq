All of those sub folders are automatically listed alphabetically as they're created.  In the last couple days, a fairly random selection of six folders from topline folders, sub folders and subsub folders have been shifted to the end of the alphabetized list and I have absolutely no idea why.  I can manually move them back no problem, but I'd really like to stop it happening again!  Also, I've tried clicking on the topline folder and choosing to sort by subject, but it changes nothing.  Even renaming an mis-listed folder to a new name does not make it move to its correct place in the alphabet.  Any ideas?

I thought I did a better job of backing up my profile using CCC than I actually did. In the migration to the new Mac I lost all my subfolders from the last 20 years.  Apple created a new Profile and 2 restoration Profiles on the new Sequoia based mini-mac. I wasn't familiar with these and panicked. I copied those files, took them back to the original mac and tried to follow Toad-Hall's method of restoring the subfolders recommended to bmack1 on 23/11/22. However, I failed to carry out the step of going up two levels in the path of the Library to copy the entire ""Thunderbird"" file and only copied the Largest restoration file. This in turn, ""contaminated"" the 2014 original Thunderbird mail profile and only an Inbox and Trash subfolder remained.   Today, after 3 weeks of searching and reading the generous contributions of this community, I came across a post explaining that the ""sbd files"" will show the subfolder headings I created in the original sought after Profile. And I found it!!! My problem is I have re-read Toad-Hall's method of re-installing the original Profile and tried to carry that out to the letter by placing the old Profile within a Thunderbird folder and switching it with the current one.  But it's still listed as the ""Restoration qqg...file"" and probably shouldn't be, but I don't want to go any further and risk losing it because I feel I almost have it.  So any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank You. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",jorma12
