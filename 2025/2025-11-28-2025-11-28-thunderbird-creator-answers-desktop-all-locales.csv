I believe I used to do this in account settings, but now it seems that all I find in option to save e-mail on the server is an option to leave messages for ""X"" number of days, OR until I delete them...   which is what I want except I think it used to mean that when I delete them locally, they would automagically delete on the server, also. Now it seems to mean until I specifically delete each of them ON THE SERVER, which is a pain to have to go through deleting e-mails twice, once locally and once again on the server...   I believe there must be some setting I am missing, as I believe I used to have it set up the way I'm asking for, but it is not working now.  </p><pre> I noticed this by having more than 12,000 e-mails on my server and about 90% of them should be erased already...    sad to have to go through them all again   =( </pre> <p>What setting to check?   What to do&nbsp;??    ( I did attempt the ""compact folders"" option that chatgpt suggested, but chatgpt only has access to older versions of the directions, and this is a new issue ) ( another option that seems to exist is to delete all of them in process of downloading them onto my laptop, but I do want to save some of them in both places ) In case it makes a difference, my server is at my webhosting site, it is not an e-mail service like gmail or yahoo. It is at my website on server <a href=""http://hostpoint.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">hostpoint.ch</a> thanks for any direction you can give me! Thanks for being there!
