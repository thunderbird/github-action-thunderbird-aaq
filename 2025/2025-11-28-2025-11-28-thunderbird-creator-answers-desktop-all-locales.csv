Fully removed Thunderbird.app 	2.	Downloaded the correct aarch64 build from the Mozilla CDN 	3.	Renamed the existing profile (…default-release → …default-release-old) 	4.	Started Thunderbird with –ProfileManager to force creation of a new profile 	5.	Thunderbird shows the “Profile missing” dialog but does not automatically generate a new default-release profile 	6.	After manually creating a new profile, the Calendar module is still missing 	7.	No calendar-related files are generated in the new profile either </p><p>My goal is simply to add Google Calendar using the built-in provider, but Thunderbird behaves as if Lightning and all calendar providers are missing. </p><p>Question: How can I force Thunderbird to regenerate the full Lightning/Calendar provider set inside a new profile? Or: Which specific files or modules must exist for the calendar subsystem to load? </p><p>Any help would be appreciated — at the moment Thunderbird cannot create any network calendar at all. </p><p>System diagnostics (Calendar providers missing in Thunderbird 145.0 on macOS 14.8.2) </p><p>macOS version: macOS Sonoma Version 14.8.2 Build 23J126 </p><p>Thunderbird version: Thunderbird 145.0 Executable type from the “file” command: Mach-O universal binary: x86_64 + arm64 The correct universal binary is installed. </p><p>Profile configuration (from profiles.ini): Profile1: default → Profiles/2a3nceor.default (Default=1) Profile0: default-release → Profiles/gpr8c7hb.default-release Install section shows default-release is locked as the default profile </p><p>Problem summary: • Thunderbird reports “Profile missing” • Thunderbird does not auto-create a new default-release profile • Even newly created profiles do not load the calendar subsystem </p><p>Calendar-specific issue: • “New Calendar” only shows “On my computer” • No “On the network” option • No Google / CalDAV / ICS • No Google OAuth login flow • Thunderbird behaves as if Lightning is not present </p><p>Profile folder contents: The profile does not contain: extensions/ Lightning gdata-provider caldav-provider ics-provider calendar-data/ storage.sdb local.sqlite </p><p>prefs.js contains no calendar.* entries. This suggests that the entire calendar subsystem is not being initialized. </p><p>Expected behavior: • A new profile should include Lightning + providers • “On the network” → Google / CalDAV / ICS should appear • Provider modules should be created inside the profile directory </p><p>Actual behavior: • No calendar subsystem • No providers • No way to add any network calendar </p><p>Request: What could prevent Thunderbird 145.0 from generating or loading the Calendar/Lightning subsystem on macOS 14.8.2, even with a completely new profile?
