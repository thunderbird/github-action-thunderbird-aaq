Initially I did not know what you were referring to as I had never seen a Thread toggle.  Eventually I found the setting for it.  After a lot of experimenting I finally wound up with a display that groups together emails with a lot of responses to the same subject at the top of the email list under the Subject heading with the toggle symbol and a carrot to expand/collapse the group.  Annoyingly the groups are not displayed chronologically and the  expanded groups are displayed in ascending order.  New emails are entered before the groups putting the groups between previous emails with no thread and new emails. Really poor and confusing display. This display is not what I hade before but at least now with the responses grouped I do not have all the individual responses displayed along with all the other emails.    </p><p>My original display had only the original email with the return symbol (left arrow).  My reply was not displayed and there was no ""group"" sign.  All emails were displayed in chronological order.  Have no idea why the sudden change.  I had not made any changes to Thunderbird's settings. Was there some recent update that I am not aware of?      </p><p>Bye the way on one of my experiments with different settings I got a display that listed the number of emails received during a specified time period e.g., ""n"" email 2 days ago, ""n"" emails 7 days ago, etc..  No idea how what settings were used and have not been able to recreate it. </p>",wrangler53,false,0,0

This is exactly what I was looking for as I was struggling to get my email accounts set up. Unfortunately it seems that Thunderbird and my web hosting are not compatible, and this is why I an getting problems. We were using Outlook and the email services started to fail a couple of weeks back. I discovered that new systems were implemented by the hosting company. At that time I was using ""identities"" for our admin / sales / support and a few direct mailboxes for me and two other people. I was informed by the hosting company that using an alia (identities) are no longer supported, only actual mailboxes. They advised me to upgrade to Outlook 360 but I did not wish to rent software just for emails, address book and calendar, so I decided to use Thunderbird in the knowledge that it is up to date and I installed v128 Nebula. It looks like Thunderbird allows identities (aliases) but not multiple mailbox accounts and this has scuppered me! I was trying to set up multiple accounts and was confused that they would not appear in the folders pane no matter what I tried. I was very confused that after setting up the incoming server under 'Server Settings' I would go to the 'Outgoing Server (SMTP)' and do the configuration. Then I was not able to go back into the incoming server settings to set up a new account. The number of times and ways I tried to do this you would not believe!  However the information you pointed me to is most useful and I think explains the problem. Your help is very much appreciated Regards Greg </p>",greg239,false,0,0

That takes you to a pane where you enter the basics and thunderbird will automatically define incoming and SMTP servers if from a well-known provider. You can then go back to the main pane and select the 'new account' link to create more accounts. I am unclear on your actual steps. More detail is needed  if you're still having difficulties.

I even tried changing the password on the hosting control for the mailbox and trying again but it makes no difference. Also, again I cannot access and check the smtp because Thunderbird does not respond after the initial setup. I am thinking the problem is that Thunderbird uses ""identities"", as I was using ""aliases"" in Outlook, and my new hosting servers no longer allow this and block outgoing log in. It looks like I will have to resort to one mailbox without identities for all of us. We will all have to work under the ""admin"" mailbox. (Perhaps we should ditch our current hosting company!)

I have three mailboxes on the domain with new passwords set to simplify the setup and make learning how to use Thunderbird a easy as possible. I have found that if I turn off my internet security I can get three accounts set up with the settings required by the hosting company.

As I explained I wanted to have another go from a fresh install now that I have the gist of setting up the accounts. I un-installed via Win10 settings, and deleted all Mozilla from Appdata, local and roaming. There were no Mozilla folders on any users on the machine when I downloaded from Mozilla and re-installed from the new download. I was surprised to find that the profile re-appeared. My intention was to set up the new accounts and save screen shots as I went along in case I ran into problems and needed help, but I did not get that far as I was unable to completely uninstall Thunderbird.

Because your account is highlighted, the new message has your account as the sender and 'reply to', NOT his. And who checks that, anyway, before it goes? Even if you have separate address books.
