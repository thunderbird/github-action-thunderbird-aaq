This is exactly what I was looking for as I was struggling to get my email accounts set up. Unfortunately it seems that Thunderbird and my web hosting are not compatible, and this is why I an getting problems. We were using Outlook and the email services started to fail a couple of weeks back. I discovered that new systems were implemented by the hosting company. At that time I was using ""identities"" for our admin / sales / support and a few direct mailboxes for me and two other people. I was informed by the hosting company that using an alia (identities) are no longer supported, only actual mailboxes. They advised me to upgrade to Outlook 360 but I did not wish to rent software just for emails, address book and calendar, so I decided to use Thunderbird in the knowledge that it is up to date and I installed v128 Nebula. It looks like Thunderbird allows identities (aliases) but not multiple mailbox accounts and this has scuppered me! I was trying to set up multiple accounts and was confused that they would not appear in the folders pane no matter what I tried. I was very confused that after setting up the incoming server under 'Server Settings' I would go to the 'Outgoing Server (SMTP)' and do the configuration. Then I was not able to go back into the incoming server settings to set up a new account. The number of times and ways I tried to do this you would not believe!  However the information you pointed me to is most useful and I think explains the problem. Your help is very much appreciated Regards Greg </p>",greg239,false,0,0

That takes you to a pane where you enter the basics and thunderbird will automatically define incoming and SMTP servers if from a well-known provider. You can then go back to the main pane and select the 'new account' link to create more accounts. I am unclear on your actual steps. More detail is needed  if you're still having difficulties.

I even tried changing the password on the hosting control for the mailbox and trying again but it makes no difference. Also, again I cannot access and check the smtp because Thunderbird does not respond after the initial setup. I am thinking the problem is that Thunderbird uses ""identities"", as I was using ""aliases"" in Outlook, and my new hosting servers no longer allow this and block outgoing log in. It looks like I will have to resort to one mailbox without identities for all of us. We will all have to work under the ""admin"" mailbox. (Perhaps we should ditch our current hosting company!)

I am sure I can get one account working but at the moment it is a mess. Bottom line is I have eight mailboxes on the email servers at the hosting company under one domain One mailbox is a catcher and five of the mailboxes are on re-direct to that one collection mailbox (We were using POP3 but I have set up imap at the moment on the instructions from the hosting company.)

I encourage you to explicitly document each key press you do when leaving SMTP server and are refused access to server setting.

That selection is displayed on the right. 3. Let's suppose that the highlight on the left is under YOUR account. Your husband comes along and thinks 'I need to send a message' so he clicks on '+New Message' and fills in the recipient and so on. 4. Because your account is highlighted, the new message has your account as the sender and 'reply to', NOT his. And who checks that, anyway, before it goes? Even if you have separate address books. It will only ever use the sender's email address from the account that's highlighted. </p><p>Is that making it clearer?
