The first screenshot shows the profile h7xyz etc. and has imapmail and mail folders. The mail folder is 30.6GB and has all the data. I clicked on the Mail button it opens THREE separate folders. balasai is the hosting service we use. It is a POP server. The size is 20.8GB and has all the archived mail. The <a href=""http://mail.accupredict.io"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.accupredict.io</a> is the new email account that has got created in my effort and has the last few days worth of email and all sorts of email in a disorganized mess. When I click the balasai button, it opens the various folders - inbox, archives, sent, drafts, junk etc. Clicking on the Archives.nbd we can see the archived folders from 2021 neatly lined up.
