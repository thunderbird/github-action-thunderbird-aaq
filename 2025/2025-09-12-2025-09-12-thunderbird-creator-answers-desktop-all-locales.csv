I have used all of the incoming server and outgoing server suggestions and have not been able to receive emails with TB on my desktop.  I can send and receive on my iphone but not thru TB.  I have also tried manual config but no cigar.  I was hoping to call TB support but I see that is not possible, only thru community support.   If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.  I guess I will look to see if I get any responses thru my gmail acct which is pfbobbo. </p><p>Thanks so much in helping with this frustrating situation. </p><p>Bob </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",pfbobbo
