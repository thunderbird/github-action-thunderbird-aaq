I have used all of the incoming server and outgoing server suggestions and have not been able to receive emails with TB on my desktop.  I can send and receive on my iphone but not thru TB.  I have also tried manual config but no cigar.  I was hoping to call TB support but I see that is not possible, only thru community support.   If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.  I guess I will look to see if I get any responses thru my gmail acct which is pfbobbo. </p><p>Thanks so much in helping with this frustrating situation. </p><p>Bob </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",pfbobbo

I uncheck the startup page, and when I open both versions of Bird, the startup page is there again.  Same with table/card setup, and other options.  Isn't  there  a ""save"" in Account settings?

In Win11, there's a ""share"" option. To send a file directly, select ""show more options."" The older version's menu will appear, and it will say ""send to -&gt; email recipient."" Is there a way to generate an option to send files faster? When the file sending window appears from the file manager, the cursor in the message writing window doesn't move to the address field (as it does when composing a new message) but somewhere else. This is quite strange, because you automatically start typing the recipient's address, but it doesn't appear in the program. This is probably more a system issue than Mozilla's. Perhaps a registry entry or other action might work. Perhaps the submenu after right-clicking on a file, or the icon at the top next to ""Copy, Paste, Cut"" or in section share it. </p>",thunderbird;attachments;,thunderbird,attachments,en-US,"",noraves99

No name!,"<p>I think there's not much to add past the title line, but I will emphasize that I want to add an account to the program, but have the field for my personal name be left blank from start to finish, and never have it populated. Not even adding an account and then removing the name later. Name never there at all. </p><p>It sure seems like Thunderbird is insisting on a name being given, and won't let me click continue with the field blank, like it ought to.
