In Win11, there's a ""share"" option. To send a file directly, select ""show more options."" The older version's menu will appear, and it will say ""send to -&gt; email recipient."" Is there a way to generate an option to send files faster? When the file sending window appears from the file manager, the cursor in the message writing window doesn't move to the address field (as it does when composing a new message) but somewhere else. This is quite strange, because you automatically start typing the recipient's address, but it doesn't appear in the program. This is probably more a system issue than Mozilla's. Perhaps a registry entry or other action might work. Perhaps the submenu after right-clicking on a file, or the icon at the top next to ""Copy, Paste, Cut"" or in section share it. </p>",thunderbird;attachments;,thunderbird,attachments,en-US,1763712;1763751;1763915;,noraves99

The former is the location where messages to be sent should go, the latter is the location used in previous versions of Thunderbird. Unfortunately Thunderbird is putting messages in the latter. Not only does this mean that my Thunderbird does not match the documentation but also the Send Later addon uses the former and is therefore not working. This seems to be an error in the update process. How can I get Thunderbird to use the correct location (""Outbox"")?

This has been going on for years. Now all of a sudden I don't get those responses. And I would notice, because more times than not i get angry responses from readers who vehemently disagree with me! I wrote to Newsmax to tell then of this problem....they checked, and found what I needed to do to correct it. I did. It must have been some glitch along the way, to change the way things were. </p><p>Anyway....I made the changes necessary, and that mostly had to do with making sure their ""no-reply@newsmax.com was added to all of my address books, and wouldn't make their way to my ""junk' folder etc. When in fact, while checking my address book and junk folder etc, those missing responses never made their way to those folders. They were nowhere to be found at all. So their other direction was to get in touch with TB and find out from this end what might be wrong!  So that's what I'm doing. I miss bantering back and forth with other readers and commenters, but no matter what I do I can't get a response!
