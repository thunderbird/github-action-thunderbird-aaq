If Thunderbird remains hung after the request for password is cleared we have a completely different issue,  quite possible caused by an external source.  My first guess would be an antivirus product that is trying to cover for the deficiencies of a very old operating system or is itself just deficient.  One of the sad things about this type of software is the higher rated and more popular it is the more likely it is to be the root cause of problems. </p><p>Some standard moves are; </p> <ul><li> Set an exclusion in your antivirus for the Thunderbird profile folder.  Thunderbird does not share well and scanning the 10gb inbox at the same time Thunderbird is trying to open it can simply cause instant contention failure. </li><li> Make sure any software firewall is not blocking the exact version of Thunderbird you have.  Sometimes a XX.XX.01 version will be blocked when the XX.XX version was fine. </li><li> Thunderbird stores it's settings in .JS files.  Some antivirus and other so called security software attempt to block access to these.  A good result does not follow. </li></ul> <p>It is always helpful to be able to start the operating system in safe mode with networking as that is a bare bones system loaded just to see if the problem goes aware.  A process of elimination can than occur.  That mode howeve4r requires a wired internet connection as windows does not load WIFI in that mode. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It's an account where you can store emails eg: Imap users may need to get copies of important emails stored in a location that is independent of the server. Pop users may use if they created deferred accounts. Basically anyone can use it to store emails - archived emails - important emails - emails they want to keep but have got rid of the mail account. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I connected to the website you provided and the third party access allowance is checked.</em> </p><p>Good because that proves the password is valid and allowing third party access is a requirement to allow Thunderbird access.  </p><p>re&nbsp;: ""Your IP is on a blocklist or a message ""Server code ALERT, server message ""Temporarily blacklisted IP Address - try again later""."" </p><p>Please note the error message that you're seeing is an internal message from the provider (Comcast). Their own server spam filter has got your IP blacklisted which is odd because maybe they are your ISP or maybe a VPN is operating and has triggered a problem? </p><p>You can check the IP blacklisting using this link: <a href=""https://check.spamhaus.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://check.spamhaus.org/</a> </p><p><strong>VPN</strong> IP issues are very common when the user is using a VPN and useris trying to get mail into an email client.  Servers do not like VPN because they mask the users real computer IP address and use a one provided by the VPN. Servers do not expect anything other than the computers real IP address, so they think you might be a hacker and they auto block access to the account. In other words, your password is ok but server is blocking access.  </p><p>You need to find out if you have deliberately or inadvertantly switched on/enabled a VPN (Virtual Private Network) on your computer.

Maybe you have used up all your server quota. If this is a gmail account and you use POP in Thunderbird - then gmail can get awkward and curtail any downloads until you remove a load of old mail off the server. As POP accounts cannot put deleted messages into the server Trash - you may discover a load of emails in the 'All Mail' folder which do not have 'labels' - emails got archived. Delete those old emails to release space on server. Note: If you use an IMAP account in Thunderbird, then it would be wise to get copies of important old emails in your Imap acount into a folder in your 'Local Folder' account before deleting anything off the server. </p><p>What server are you using&nbsp;? eg: gmail Are you using a Pop or Imap mail account&nbsp;?
