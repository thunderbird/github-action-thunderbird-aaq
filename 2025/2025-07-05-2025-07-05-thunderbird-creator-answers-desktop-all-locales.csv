I enter both and as soon as I click continue it says my username or password is incorrect. I don't get any prompt for password. It hangs and gets stuck here. </p><p>As an alternative I tried entering a made up email address (something like asd@ba.da) and then it gets into manual settings. I thought I could get it sorted that way but I was wrong. After I fill the form and click continue I get the blank error message.  if I click advanced setup it gives me an error about cleanup property. I also get an error message sayign incoming server already exists, that's probably because I have another email account on the same server, but I'm not sure why this is an issue now. Can't I have multiple email accounts on the same mail server? </p><p>Probably this has something to with my mail server's autoconfig setup. However I believe user should be able to manually enter account config, incoming/outgoing server etc. At the moment I'm totally blocked and I can't add my second email account to thunderbird.  </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",ozbahceliler
