But for mail stored locally, the use of <b>Local Folders</b> would be preferable, because mail accounts may come and go, you may want to have several of them, you may want to delete one that's having problems and set it up again, etc. Mail stored within <b>Local Folders</b> isn't affected by any of that. </p><p>I'm not aware of any hard limit on the size of a folder or the number of messages within it, but the more messages you store there and the bigger it becomes, the more likely it is that it may become corrupt and that you may eventually lose access to the mail stored there… to <i>all</i> the mail stored there… </p><p>This is because the contents of each folder are stored in a single text file with one message after another in mbox format. Things like software bugs, hardware failures, or malformed messages, may eventually cause Thunderbird to lose track of where a message ends and the next starts, and this is more likely to happen precisely with <i>Inbox</i>, because of the high number of message additions and deletions that happen there, so keeping that many messages stored in <i>Inbox</i> is definitely a really bad idea. </p><p>I don't know whether this could be the cause of the problem you have, I'd expect Thunderbird to report an error message if it was failing to add new messages to <i>Inbox</i>, but it's certainly a possibility to consider. </p><p>So yes, I would recommend you start by moving all the mail you currently have in <i>Inbox</i> into other folders, and then, when empty, right click on it and choose <b>Compact</b>. Don't compact the folder until all your mail has been moved out of there, because if there is some mbox file corruption, compacting the folder can only make things worse. Compacting is good <i>maintenance</i> practice when things work well to help prevent corruption, but shouldn't be used if there is some corruption already: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/compacting-folders</a> </p><p>I don't really expect this to fix the problem, but is something you better do anyway before trying other things. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
