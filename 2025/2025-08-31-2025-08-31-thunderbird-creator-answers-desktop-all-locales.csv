My account is a Microsoft Exchange Account working with Owl. The emails are also doing the same thing in Outlook too. The only difference is when I reroute the emails back to inbox, in Outlook they go there and you can see them. In Thunderbird, the emails disappear from the subfolder and are nowhere to be found. They don't show in Inbox or anywhere else. </p><p>I have asked Microsoft, in Thunderbird Community before, and Owl, and no one has any help. I finally resorted to AI and it gave me lots of things to try but none worked. I tried repairing folders, making a new profile (problem replicated itself in the new profile as well), and so many things of which nothing helped. I have lots of different folders and message filters and all worked well for years until this update. It's a specific issue with the Inbox because I can forward messages into other folders and they will go and be visible there, but when it comes to inbox, they disappear. </p><p>My AI searches have stated that this has been a known issue, yet Owl seems to be clueless. Usually they will fix things within a few days, but this issue still persists after weeks. Does anyone else have this problem and a solution to try? This is really messing up my workflow and I don't want to miss any important emails. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1760912;,chochian
