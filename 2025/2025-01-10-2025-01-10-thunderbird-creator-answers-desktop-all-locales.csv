The layout looks way too much like Outlook for my liking so I checked my out laptop and About shows it to be 115.18.0 (32-bit) with Supernova icon, Thunderbird is up to date and the same 'You are currently on an esr update channel'.  So, how do I get TB on the new laptop (currently showing 128.6.0esr (64 bit) to be, or at least have the same layout as, my old one showing 115.18.0 (32 bit) that I know and love? Thanks Chris </p><p>p.s. I can take screenshots of both layouts if necessary but if I can get to the same version first that might solve the issue. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1701970;1701977;1701981;,chris119

They all come back as undeliverable, BUT say they're undeliverable to the secondary email I have for her, even though I never sent the email to the secondary address. Even after deleting the secondary address AND deleting and re-entering the main email address for her, no luck. I can send emails from my webmail.shaw account to her without problems. I would love to have this issue fixed ASAP, as I need to email her almost daily.

I changed all of the attribute bytes to write (not ready only) I created a new account with no imports.  It also gets this error.

If I copy my pop account folders to the local folders area, same error (Unable to write to disk) I uninstalled and re-installed, and the profiles were all still there. I would even settle for incoming on an IMAP and moving incoming email to my pop folder, but you can't do that either. </p><p>I fear that the profiles are somehow corrupted.  I have ALL of my email backed up and restore-able.   There are some messages on the server that need to stay there for now. </p><p>Please help.
