The layout looks way too much like Outlook for my liking so I checked my out laptop and About shows it to be 115.18.0 (32-bit) with Supernova icon, Thunderbird is up to date and the same 'You are currently on an esr update channel'.  So, how do I get TB on the new laptop (currently showing 128.6.0esr (64 bit) to be, or at least have the same layout as, my old one showing 115.18.0 (32 bit) that I know and love? Thanks Chris </p><p>p.s. I can take screenshots of both layouts if necessary but if I can get to the same version first that might solve the issue. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1701970;1701977;1701981;,chris119
