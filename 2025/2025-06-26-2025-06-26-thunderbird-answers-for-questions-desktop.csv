You can either disable the email protection component of Kaspersky, or import its root certificate into Thunderbird. They have a support article for this: <a href=""https://support.kaspersky.com/common/compatibility/14620#block2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.kaspersky.com/common/compatibility/14620#block2</a> </p><p>Regards, Bal√°zs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0

I finally managed to get a password reset from my ISP and tried to insert that into the Thunderbird account setup form.  It still fails to connect with the server.  I think it is not worth wasting any more time trying to get this working.  Too techinical for someone older than 16 and too many terms I don't understand. </p><p>I will try to find an alternative email client to handle my emails but keep Thunderbird for the email addresses that still work. </p>,2dave,false,0,0
