Deleting the Thunderbird data solves this, but that is NOT an option as that also deletes address books and current IMAP settings (including which emails have been read). When we were trying to add the new account, Thunderbird tried automagically to use the wrong server.  When we entered the correct server we started to get the error message. Clearly there is a config error regarding the IMAP (incoming) server which total deletion removes (typical Windows fix: reset everything regardless of the collateral damage).

You may find that an unwanted complication you don't have to care about with a POP account, but that's a natural consequence of being able to <i>simultaneously</i> manage mail stored on the server and mail stored locally on your computer with a single mail client, which I personally consider a desirable feature, you just have to get used to it. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,1
