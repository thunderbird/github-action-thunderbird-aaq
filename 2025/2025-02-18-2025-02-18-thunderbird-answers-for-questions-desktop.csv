Recent versions of Thunderbird hide that parent folder from the user in the folder pane, but you may still see the folder hierarchy on the IMAP server when selecting folders in other places. </p><p>Tell Thunderbird to use the same folders that Gmail uses for those purposes in the corresponding panes of the <b>Account Settings</b>, unless you do want Thunderbird to use a different folder on purpose for some reason. You may then delete any <i>other</i> folders with similar names that neither Gmail nor Thunderbird after having made the changes will use. </p><p>As an example of why that matters, Gmail's <i>Bin/Trash</i> is the only way you have in Thunderbird to permanently delete messages from Gmail server. Unless you move a message there first, there is no way for Thunderbird (or any other mail client) to permanently delete a message from the Gmail server. Gmail automatically removes messages from there (and from the server as a result) after 30 days if you don't do it earlier. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

It doesn't tell you those settings are being <i>shared</i> across multiple accounts nor gives you the option to create new separate outgoing server settings specific to the new account during the account setup process, and hence you end up changing the outgoing server settings for all the accounts sharing those settings every time you change the settings for one of the accounts… </p><p>You may create and manage multiple outgoing server settings for the same server, but cannot do it from within the main account settings. You have to do that from a separate <b>Outgoing Server (SMTP) Settings</b> pane you may open by selecting the corresponding option at the bottom of the list of accounts in Account Settings. The following article has a screenshot that shows the SMTP settings pane: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages</a> </p><p>You can add there as many settings for the same outgoing server as you want, with each entry having its own username, and then assign the right outgoing server settings to each account in the main account settings. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Do you have other mail accounts in Thunderbird? Do you see the ""phantom"" account in the folder pane if you choose <b>View &gt; Folders &gt; All Folders</b>? </p><p>Anyway, the place to look for any account and manage it would be the <b>Account Settings</b> rather than the folder pane. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
