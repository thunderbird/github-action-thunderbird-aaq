You may then delete any <i>other</i> folders with similar names that neither Gmail nor Thunderbird after having made the changes will use. </p><p>As an example of why that matters, Gmail's <i>Bin/Trash</i> is the only way you have in Thunderbird to permanently delete messages from Gmail server.

You may find that an unwanted complication you don't have to care about with a POP account, but that's a natural consequence of being able to <i>simultaneously</i> manage mail stored on the server and mail stored locally on your computer with a single mail client, which I personally consider a desirable feature, you just have to get used to it. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

You appear to have somehow set up the same account twice in Thunderbird, and it would seem you were able to do that because the mail server accepts as username both the whole email address and also only the part to the left of the '@'. Can you verify that? Also, you don't have to guess whether the account is POP or IMAP, Thunderbird shows the type of account in <b>Account Settings &gt; Server Settings &gt; Server Type</b>. </p><p>Post a screenshot of your full <b>Account Settings &gt; Server Settings</b> for each. Looks like you've configured them to remove messages from the server after downloading, and hence the messages downloaded with one aren't available to the other. </p><p>Pick one of the accounts as the one to keep (I'd pick the one that uses the full email address as the username), uncheck all the options to check for mail on the other, and check on both the options to leave messages on the server for 30 days or until you delete them in Thunderbird. This should make all your mail go to one of the accounts and not the other unless you manually check for new mail on that. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
