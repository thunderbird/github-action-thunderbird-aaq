It appears the OP has now gone away as there are no more updates. It appears they have either given up or found a solution and not posted it. </p><p>Question: On every start of Thunderbird, I get the popup from Google requesting access for TB to my gmail account that I am using here. I answer yes to allow TB and then this is followed up by an email from Google to my gmail acount and my backup email. Is this correct the correct operation? I personally don't think so as I thought everything should be transparent after setting things up. I don't seem have this probem with my other two gmail accounts either. I have tried repeatedly to find out how to fix this but I have not been successful. I have found numerous articles about this in various forums but they have either been extremely vague or not posted the solution. I am almost sure something changed a while ago but I don't know what it was.  </p><p>I would be very grateful if someone could tell me how to fix this. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1710652;,davejohns61
