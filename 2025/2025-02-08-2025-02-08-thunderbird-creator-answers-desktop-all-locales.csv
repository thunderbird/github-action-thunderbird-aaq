I answer yes to allow TB and then this is followed up by an email from Google to my gmail acount and my backup email. Is this correct the correct operation? I personally don't think so as I thought everything should be transparent after setting things up. I don't seem have this probem with my other two gmail accounts either. I have tried repeatedly to find out how to fix this but I have not been successful. I have found numerous articles about this in various forums but they have either been extremely vague or not posted the solution.
