They told you what to do,  you did it and now they have blocked your account.  What is the next step they suggest .  Not contacting anyone about Thunderbird as the fix has to come from them. </p><p>Basically sitestar have blocked your IP address for to many failed attempts to send your mail. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Waiting to hear from them. I will let you know the results. Thank you so much for responding. </p>",Sunflowr,false,0,0

After several hours of tests, including being able to send mail thru their webmail site and also being able to send mail from my gmail account, they determined that the issue was a Thunderbird issue and I needed 'email app support'. Whether or not this is true will be determined in the future.  </p><p>So the good news is that I have still 2 ways to send out email, which is not very often, although replying to an email does not work either.  </p><p>The option is to uninstall my adorable Thunderbird program and reinstall, but unfortunately when I did that years ago, I lost all my contacts and folders. So I am either going to have to hire someone to do that for me, look on youtube for how to do that, get another email program like Outlook, which I prefer not to do, or just leave it alone.  </p><p>So I am humorously caught in a loop of A says B did it and B says A did it.  If you have any other suggestions, I am very happy to receive.  I do make my yearly donation to Thunderbird as I appreciate the work everyone does. So maybe that good karma will come around. </p>",Sunflowr,false,0,0

One day I forgot I could not send outan email and sent a reply to someone and it went thru. It appears to have fixed itself. I have yet to initiate an email to see if that gets sent out, so we will see what happens then. Thanks for your reply. I am keeping it just in case this happens again. </p>",Sunflowr,false,0,0
