Vysvětlím a dám postup, co zkusit: --- Proč máš dvě Doručené 1. **IMAP server** má svoje složky (Inbox, Drafts, Sent…). Thunderbird si je mapuje na české názvy (Doručená pošta, Koncepty…). 2. Pokud došlo k chybnému mapování, může se stát, že složka „Doručená pošta“ se zobrazí dvakrát – jedna prázdná (nepoužívaná) a druhá aktivní (kam reálně chodí pošta), třeba i pod *Koncepty*. --- Jak to opravit 1. **Zkontroluj nastavení serveru**     * V menu **Nástroje → Nastavení účtů → Nastavení serveru**.    * Tam uvidíš, která složka je nastavená jako *Kořenová složka účtu* a kde je *Doručená pošta*.  2. **Nastavení zvláštních složek**     * V **Nastavení účtů → Kopie a složky** zkontroluj, kam má Thunderbird ukládat Doručenou, Odeslanou, Koncepty atd.    * Pokud tam vidíš, že „Doručená pošta“ je odkazovaná na složku uvnitř *Konceptů*, změň ji na tu správnou (tu v rootu účtu).  3. **Odebrání nechtěné složky**     * Pokud složka vznikla jen chybně na straně Thunderbirdu, můžeš na ni kliknout **pravým → Odstranit**.    * Pokud to nejde, znamená to, že složka fyzicky existuje na serveru (IMAP). Pak se přihlas do webmailu (nebo použij jiného klienta) a tam ji smaž. Po synchronizaci v Thunderbirdu zmizí.  4. **Obnovení struktury**     * Po úpravách je dobré na účtu kliknout pravým → **Odběr…** a odškrtnout složky, které nechceš.    * Nakonec Thunderbird restartuj, a složky by se měly ukázat správně. --- 👉 Nejčastější řešení:  <ul><li> V *Kopie a složky* nastavit Doručenou přímo na `Inbox` v rootu. </li><li> Nesprávnou složku smazat ve webmailu, nebo ji aspoň odhlásit v odběru. </li></ul> --- </blockquote>",poljos-moz,false,0,0

With TB closed, copy the Thunderbird folder from Roaming on the source PC to Roaming on the target PC.  It will work best if the TB version is the same on both computers, but it doesn't matter if the source TB is 32-bit and the target TB is 32 or 64-bit. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

The results of checking that box or leaving it unchecked don't produce the results I was looking for.  The message should show it was read after clicking on it to open it full pane for reading.  Seeing it still in bold as if it hasn't been read after reading makes no sense. </p>,rv4fun,false,0,0

By that I mean only after I click on the message to open it in its own tab. </p><p>You seem to be very specific about what term as opened - but do you have the 'Message Pane enabled&nbsp;? If yes then when you select an email in the Message List and it displays in Message Pane, that means you have opened the email - it is not a preview. If you disable the Message Pane then you can select (single left click or use arrow keys to ) any email in list and nothing alters as you have not opened it. That would mean using a double click to open email in a new tab at which point email is opened. </p><p>So in Settings &gt; General scroll down to 'REading and Display' </p><p>If you have enabled 'Message Pane then this setting will auto mark as read upon opening in Message Pane.
