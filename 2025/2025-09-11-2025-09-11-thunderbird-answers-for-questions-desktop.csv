All info/help you want to locate on how to locate profiles tends to assume you are in the default location if download from Thunderbird directly. </p><p>Then you need to check the following: <strong>Firewall</strong> Access the firewall - it might be controlled by the OS or by an Anti-Virus you installed. You need to set up Thunderbird program as an allowed program otherwise it might get blocked from interent access. Thunderbird program is likely to be here: 64bit version is: ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" </p><p>Please confirm this is set up as allowed. </p><p><strong>VPN</strong> Servers do not like VPN because it hides your IP address and they think you may be a hacker - so they block access. Check your computer to see if a VPN has been installed and switched on. I have seen some mentioning that a VPN is auto installed on some HP laptops. Some Anti-Virus now offer VPN and in some cases I've found it auto enabled. Switch VPN off. </p><p>Please confirm any VPN is switched off. </p><p>When creating a mail account, there are a few things that need to be set up if you are creating an account that needs to use Oauth Authentication such as gmail, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> and yahoo. So we need to know if the mail account needs to connect to any of those servers. Some servers require people to create a 'secure mail key' also called 'app generated password' which is used in replacement in third party apps instead of usual mail account password - again we need to know what server in order to advise. </p><p>What comes after the @ in the email address. When you mention Outlook - that sounds like the email client, so I'm not certain what server you are trying to connect to...is it office365 for a <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> or <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email address or a gmail email address etc&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1

Vysvětlím a dám postup, co zkusit: --- Proč máš dvě Doručené 1. **IMAP server** má svoje složky (Inbox, Drafts, Sent…). Thunderbird si je mapuje na české názvy (Doručená pošta, Koncepty…). 2. Pokud došlo k chybnému mapování, může se stát, že složka „Doručená pošta“ se zobrazí dvakrát – jedna prázdná (nepoužívaná) a druhá aktivní (kam reálně chodí pošta), třeba i pod *Koncepty*. --- Jak to opravit 1. **Zkontroluj nastavení serveru**     * V menu **Nástroje → Nastavení účtů → Nastavení serveru**.    * Tam uvidíš, která složka je nastavená jako *Kořenová složka účtu* a kde je *Doručená pošta*.  2. **Nastavení zvláštních složek**     * V **Nastavení účtů → Kopie a složky** zkontroluj, kam má Thunderbird ukládat Doručenou, Odeslanou, Koncepty atd.    * Pokud tam vidíš, že „Doručená pošta“ je odkazovaná na složku uvnitř *Konceptů*, změň ji na tu správnou (tu v rootu účtu).  3. **Odebrání nechtěné složky**     * Pokud složka vznikla jen chybně na straně Thunderbirdu, můžeš na ni kliknout **pravým → Odstranit**.    * Pokud to nejde, znamená to, že složka fyzicky existuje na serveru (IMAP). Pak se přihlas do webmailu (nebo použij jiného klienta) a tam ji smaž. Po synchronizaci v Thunderbirdu zmizí.  4. **Obnovení struktury**     * Po úpravách je dobré na účtu kliknout pravým → **Odběr…** a odškrtnout složky, které nechceš.    * Nakonec Thunderbird restartuj, a složky by se měly ukázat správně. --- 👉 Nejčastější řešení:  <ul><li> V *Kopie a složky* nastavit Doručenou přímo na `Inbox` v rootu. </li><li> Nesprávnou složku smazat ve webmailu, nebo ji aspoň odhlásit v odběru. </li></ul> --- </blockquote>",poljos-moz,false,0,0

I have no idea why the folder location was being changed, but I am almost certain that the old directory will remain, hence the request to manually delete it.  There are better ways I am sure.  I would styart byu asking if you have the awful allow windows search in your system integration turned off.  I deleted over 10,000 useless copies of email when I got rid of that monster.  I don't search my emails with windows search.  That s what Thunderbird is supposed to do.  I also disable the Windows indexing service for the Thunderbird profile folder.  Nothing like having multiple shadow copies of old versions of Thunderbird's files saved by windows,  without a huge index of the text in the Thunderbird profile.  Such a waste of space. </p><p>2. My understanding of IMAP in this context is poor.  But I think once an email is downloaded it remains downloaded.  I do not think the local copies are aged at all  so it gets all mail for the last thirty days and then commences to add to it each day.  That is inline with what Michel T was saying about the setting only working going forward.  Not so if no local copies are stored.
