I need to import multiple (bookoo) .EML files into TB 115.10 to later move into ""folders"".  Several weeks ago I somehow found someway to import a single .EML file (downloaded from an old ISP) into TB -- and then got busy with other projects -- and now cannot figure how I did it. I did not use an extension (ImportExportTools NG) -- just the native tools in TB 115.10.   If anyone is familiar with importing EML files -- sure would appreciate suggestions. Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1760676;,druw
