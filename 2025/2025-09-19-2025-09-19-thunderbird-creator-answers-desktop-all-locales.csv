1536681,2025-09-19 02:45:06 -0700,2025-09-19 02:45:06 -0700,Add-on Category Manager for Thunderbird,"<p>Dear Developers, </p><p>In the older versions of Thunderbird (up to 102, if I recall correctly), the add-on Category Manager was seamlessly integrated into the address book. With the introduction of the more recent versions (starting from 115), however, Category Manager has become much more cumbersome to use, has lost several features, and has been reduced to the bare minimum. </p><p>In the past, I had contacted the developer, John Bieling, who told me that Category Manager would soon become an integral part of Thunderbird rather than remaining just an add-on, specifying that the “stripped-down” version released after the move to 115 was only temporary. Unfortunately, no further updates have been provided, and the GitHub discussion has also been inactive for quite some time. </p><p>The functionalities that Category Manager offered—such as assigning labels to contacts (including custom ones), applying multiple labels to the same contact, sending emails to multiple groups with overlap management to avoid duplicates, syncing with the smartphone address book, and even sending SMS messages to contact groups—were unique and extremely valuable. For those who, like me, manage an association with thousands of contacts and complex mailing lists, Category Manager is an irreplaceable tool that makes Thunderbird clearly superior to any other email client. </p><p>My concern is that a future Thunderbird update might make Category Manager unusable. On the contrary, I sincerely hope that the project can be resumed, maintained, and further developed, perhaps even integrated directly into Thunderbird itself. </p><p>Therefore, I would like to ask: is there any chance that Category Manager will be maintained and improved in the future, possibly by integrating it directly into Thunderbird’s core? </p><p>Thank you for your attention and for your work. </p><p>Kind regards, Michele Guarda </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,"",michele.guarda

The first say 15-20 local folders were shown as usual, but a larger number of folders are not shown. Can a limit for the disc space be reached? Where can it be changed? I use Bitdefender as security package. Windows 11 is used on the pc. I have removed Thunderbird from my computer and reinstalled the program. This has not lead to a chande. The missing local folders are not shown. Next I have removed Thunderbird from the computer. I have replaced the profile folder in the roaming folder with a back up folder. Having reinstalled Thunderbird I can see some files from the backup but not the missing local folders. Thunderbird oon my computer can recieve new e-mails. I hope that somebody out there can help me getting my missing local folders back. </p><p>Jens Kirk </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jens.kirk
