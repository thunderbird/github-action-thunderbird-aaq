Is there a way to increase the scrollbar width for a better fit for my fat fingers? I found a solution for Windows 10, but cannot find one for Linux. Thanks in advance. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1765506;,wmichaelb

It filters out spam and sends it dutifully to the Junk folder. However, in the last few weeks TB has stubbornly classified several of my favorite regular messages as junk. This, after having worked for years trouble-free.  The attachments show one example of it failing. It doesn't make any difference if I set the filter to Before or After Junk Classification. Does anyone know how to fix this? </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",firefox1925
