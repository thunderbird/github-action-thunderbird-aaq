But popfile is hasn't been supported for a long time and has stopped working for some of my email accounts. I created  new pop3 accounts instead of using popfile's proxy to categorize the emails before they reach the inbox.  Those pop3 accounts now have their own inboxes separate from the one under local folders and their own sets of message filters.  I can use those message rules to move mail into the local folders, but I want to remove the popfile specific rules and use the same new non-popfile specific message filter for all accounts. instead of having to duplicate the message filters for each account. </p><p>Can all accounts be configured to use the local folders inbox and the same message filter?  How? I have enabled the account column so I can tell which account received each message.  It's been many years since I set up Thunderbird &amp; I don't remember how I did it when Outlook Express went away. Can the junk filter be used to classify emails into more than junk/notjunk categories? </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1726017;,Bill_Stuntz
