But popfile is hasn't been supported for a long time and has stopped working for some of my email accounts. I created  new pop3 accounts instead of using popfile's proxy to categorize the emails before they reach the inbox.  Those pop3 accounts now have their own inboxes separate from the one under local folders and their own sets of message filters.  I can use those message rules to move mail into the local folders, but I want to remove the popfile specific rules and use the same new non-popfile specific message filter for all accounts. instead of having to duplicate the message filters for each account. </p><p>Can all accounts be configured to use the local folders inbox and the same message filter?  How? I have enabled the account column so I can tell which account received each message.  It's been many years since I set up Thunderbird &amp; I don't remember how I did it when Outlook Express went away.

Some research indicated this issue goes back many years and can be intermittent. After much ""repair folder"" the issues seems to have abated. However, as part of my research I explored the user-local filesystem tree for TB for one of the larger email accounts I monitor, as in </p><p>C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\&lt;8_chars_profile_id&gt;.default\ImapMail\&lt;mail_server_name&gt;\email_top_level_folder_names_as_NTFS_directory_names. </p><p>From this I discovered that with a Message Store Type of File-per-folder, TB constructs a filesystem directory tree that replicates the email folder tree, including the naming, presented by the IMAP email server. Not an unreasonable design choice but one with a potential flaw. Given that a Windows user_name can be 20 characters, an FQDN hostname can be 253 characters, and the max IMAP folder name length can be uncertain but apparently good practice is no more than 250 characters,... </p> <ul><li> What happens when TB goes to create a deep-in-tree directory having a pathname that exceeds the Windows maximum of 260 bytes?  </li></ul> <ul><li> Suppose this deep-in-tree directory is not originated from the TB UI but rather from a TB update scan of an IMAP server?  </li></ul> <p>The user could have created IMAP folders via a Web interface with longish names in a 3 or 4 deep hierarchy not understanding the total pathname length limit in how TB echos the IMAP folder tree with a directory tree. The user then points TB at this email account and oops. Does TB fall over? </p><p>The default leading part of the TB AppData pathname above could be 93 characters alone before we get to the email server FQDN. Windows 11 Pro does offer a Group Policy setting to enable long pathnames up to 32k for manifested apps but this policy is not configured OOB. </p><p>Regards. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1726453;,rdbingham1
