What email provider are you using? Is it a gmail account, or Yahoo, or what? You can tell who your provider is by looking at your email address. For example, if it's a gmail account, it will be [your user ID]@gmail.com. Once you know who the provider is, you can access your email by logging into their server directly with your user id and password. Once you're logged in, your email will be available, links should work, and you won't get nagged for donations, and life will improve for you immeasurably. Then you can uninstall Thunderbird and be a happy camper once again! </p><p>If you don't know how to log in to the provider directly, please reply with who the provider is  and someone (maybe me?) can coach you how to do so. Don't respond with your whole email address...just the provider. </p><p>Good luck! </p>",mike_the_wino,false,0,5

For the IMAP account yes, for the POP account NO. Any messages stored locally in your POP account and not on the server are stored locally in that account and nowhere else. If you delete the POP account from Thunderbird and choose to delete both account info and message data without having made a backup first, you'll lose all the messages stored there that are not on the server… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

If you browse the contents of those profiles, you will be able to confirm the right one - and I'm guessing it's the one from dec 2023. Look in the imapmail folder for evidence of IMAP accounts and in the Mail folder for evidence of POP accounts and in Mail\Local Folders for other message folders.

There are three folders un your ""Profiles"" folder&nbsp;: default, default-release and default-beta. In a first time we can neglect the <strong>default</strong> profile, because it has not been used since 2023.

Verify your ""Applications"" folder, but one of the two versions could be installed somewhere else, e.g. the Dektop </p><p>b) open the Thunderbird folder in your User-Library, open the the <strong>profiles.ini </strong>file with Text-Edit and show us a screen shot of its content </p><p>c) open the ""xxxxxxxx.default"" profile folder.

"", give it a name (e.g. John), follow instructions and start Thunderbird which will open the account creation wizard.
