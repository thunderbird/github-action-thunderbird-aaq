What email provider are you using? Is it a gmail account, or Yahoo, or what? You can tell who your provider is by looking at your email address. For example, if it's a gmail account, it will be [your user ID]@gmail.com. Once you know who the provider is, you can access your email by logging into their server directly with your user id and password. Once you're logged in, your email will be available, links should work, and you won't get nagged for donations, and life will improve for you immeasurably. Then you can uninstall Thunderbird and be a happy camper once again! </p><p>If you don't know how to log in to the provider directly, please reply with who the provider is  and someone (maybe me?) can coach you how to do so. Don't respond with your whole email address...just the provider. </p><p>Good luck! </p>",mike_the_wino,false,0,1

Had the profile not been present, thunderbird would had stated 'no profile' and would have immediately terminated. So, that means you have a profile and I see there is one from December 2023 that may be the right one. I also see a profile with beta in name, indicating you may have installed a beta? If you browse the contents of those profiles, you will be able to confirm the right one - and I'm guessing it's the one from dec 2023. Look in the imapmail folder for evidence of IMAP accounts and in the Mail folder for evidence of POP accounts and in Mail\Local Folders for other message folders.

There are three folders un your ""Profiles"" folder&nbsp;: default, default-release and default-beta. In a first time we can neglect the <strong>default</strong> profile, because it has not been used since 2023.  The <strong>default-release</strong> profile seems to be your old working profile and the <strong>default-beta</strong> profile seems to have been created by a TB beta version. </p><p>If TB had found NO profile on startup you would have seen a ""Missing Profile"" message (picture) and TB wouldn't start. If TB for some unknown reason had created a new profile on startup the new profil would been named ""xxxxxxxx.<strong>default-esr""</strong> which actually is the default name of new profiles (see picture new installation) unless you create them manually.  </p><p>My guess is that by mistake you installed a beta version on your Mac, and when you started this beta for the first time TB automatically opened the ""Set Up your Existing Email Address"" and at the same time created the ""yyyyyyyy.default-beta"" profile (separate profile for each Thunderbird version!). </p><p>Now please verify: a) if you have installed two TB versions: a default-release version which could be an ancient version and a beta version. Verify your ""Applications"" folder, but one of the two versions could be installed somewhere else, e.g. the Dektop </p><p>b) open the Thunderbird folder in your User-Library, open the the <strong>profiles.ini </strong>file with Text-Edit and show us a screen shot of its content </p><p>c) open the ""xxxxxxxx.default"" profile folder.

You did some trafficking in the ""special account"" Local Folders but I am unable to go back the chronicle of your manipulations.  </p><p>From your images I can see that you had created GMail POP accounts but never used them. So we must concentrate on the imap folders. You had created several IMAP accounts but you are the only one to know how many and with which addresses.

I cannot tell for the other five <a href=""http://imap.gmail-x.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail-x.com</a> folders since I can't see the sizes and the modification dates of the mailbox files.  </p><p>There also is the question whether you still can access to your GMail and Outlook webmail and whether all your messages are still there.  </p><p>As a first trial you might recreate the GMail account for the email address corresponding to the <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> folder in the profile or perhaps it will be easier to set up the Outlook imap account.
