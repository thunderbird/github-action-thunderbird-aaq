What email provider are you using? Is it a gmail account, or Yahoo, or what? You can tell who your provider is by looking at your email address. For example, if it's a gmail account, it will be [your user ID]@gmail.com. Once you know who the provider is, you can access your email by logging into their server directly with your user id and password. Once you're logged in, your email will be available, links should work, and you won't get nagged for donations, and life will improve for you immeasurably. Then you can uninstall Thunderbird and be a happy camper once again! </p><p>If you don't know how to log in to the provider directly, please reply with who the provider is  and someone (maybe me?) can coach you how to do so. Don't respond with your whole email address...just the provider. </p><p>Good luck! </p>",mike_the_wino,false,0,0
