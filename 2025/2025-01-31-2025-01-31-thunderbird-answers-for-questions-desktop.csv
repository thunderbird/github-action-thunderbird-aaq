What email provider are you using? Is it a gmail account, or Yahoo, or what? You can tell who your provider is by looking at your email address. For example, if it's a gmail account, it will be [your user ID]@gmail.com. Once you know who the provider is, you can access your email by logging into their server directly with your user id and password. Once you're logged in, your email will be available, links should work, and you won't get nagged for donations, and life will improve for you immeasurably. Then you can uninstall Thunderbird and be a happy camper once again! </p><p>If you don't know how to log in to the provider directly, please reply with who the provider is  and someone (maybe me?) can coach you how to do so. Don't respond with your whole email address...just the provider. </p><p>Good luck! </p>",mike_the_wino,false,0,0

In about 99 of every 100 folk complaining about inabiliuty to connect  I find myself asking them what the error message is.  I can not guess,  so oyu have to tell me, or anyone else trying to help you. </p><p>As this has been a long standing issue I would guess it is your antivirus program dropping the ball.  But that is just a guess based on really nothing other than they have been a real problem with email over the years. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
