My list would have about 20 addresses.  This is odd in and of itself but about a week ago I created a list with 7 email addresses.  How can this be fixed?  Thank you.

Since windows live mail stopped working a few weeks ago ive decided to try thunderbird as my new email program on windows 7 pc. Have downloaded but every time i try to add my bigpond email account it says it cant because either configuration, email address or password are incorect.  Ive been talking with bigpond support for days and getting nowhere. The email and password are correct because i can access telstra webmail and weve tried both pop3 and imap config settings but getting nowhere. What is left to try? I tried adding a gmail to thunderbird and it worked but no luck with the bigpond email. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",glenperry1963
