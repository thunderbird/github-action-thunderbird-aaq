I've tried following the directions here, but GPG doesn't seem to do anything different with the --rfc4880 flag, and so importing the key back into Thunderbird still gets the ""unsupported features"" warning. </p><p>Even when creating a key in Sequoia-PGP, it seems to add an extra notation? And that also seems to make Thunderbird say it's an extra unsupported feature. </p><p>Am I doing something wrong? </p>",thunderbird;encryption;,thunderbird,encryption,en-US,1777446;,jack.b24
