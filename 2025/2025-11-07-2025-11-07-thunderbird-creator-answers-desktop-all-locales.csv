I've tried following the directions here, but GPG doesn't seem to do anything different with the --rfc4880 flag, and so importing the key back into Thunderbird still gets the ""unsupported features"" warning. </p><p>Even when creating a key in Sequoia-PGP, it seems to add an extra notation? And that also seems to make Thunderbird say it's an extra unsupported feature. </p><p>Am I doing something wrong? </p>",thunderbird;encryption;,thunderbird,encryption,en-US,1777446;,jack.b24

Kept my data but I had to re install all  my apps. With Thunderbird I follow the same procedure I used with Firefox: After installation  I copied the profile folder from my backup and replaced the new one. That worked out well. With Thunderbird, I followed the same procedure, all my emails where there but not my local folders. I am attaching several snapshots to illustrate my steps. Image 1 ""local folders now"" Image 2 ""Profile Folder"".  (why there are 2 sub-folders)? Image 3 ""Mail in the profile folder"" Image 4 "" List of folders in my Local Folders"" The are there, how do I get them back on Thunderbird in the correct place ""Local Folders""? Thank you for your help again.  Regards Ilio Pieroni </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",Iliopier
