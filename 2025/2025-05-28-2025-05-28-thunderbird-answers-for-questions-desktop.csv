Compacting removes deleted messages from the folder, and it also rebuilds the index. A possible cause of confusion:: When a search is done. the global search uses the index, and users may rely on an older search after a message has been deleted. That is,, a search may indicate a message is present when it is not. There are millions of Thunderbird users; if messages were being deleted, even for 1% of users, there would be a massive outcry.  </p><p>Regardless of our confidence in Thunderbird, as a business, I recommend daily backups because you are more likely to encounter a computer failure or a software crash or a virus infection. Having written that, many backups don't work, as evidenced from what we see here on the forum. The simplest backup that always works is this:  </p> <ol><li> If IMAP, do File&gt;offline&gt;download  (to ensure all messages are on PC) </li><li> ensure thunderbird is not running    &lt;== IMPORTANT </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol> <p>Those are the basic mechanics, but a detailed assessment of potentially lost messages since last backup is encouraged. For your question no how to restore 'lost' messages, I do not feel that is possible, as the messages may likely have previously been deleted. Othes may see possibilities. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I can't be certain that my custom download will figure that out.  I don't trust myself to do a custom download without loosing my Profile data.  I am just not that tech savvy.  I am not even sure my zip backup works.  I say that because when I go to Help\Troubleshooting Information and select ""aboutprofiles""  Thunderbird shows a ""yes"" next to the default Profile showing that my old version is using the defualt-esr profile.

Now I can't be sure.  I originally downloaded Thunderbird on my Dell computer in 2000 and I am certain at that time I did it directly from the Mozilla web site.  My Dell hard drive died in January of this year and I got a thinkpad.  I restored my Dell files and directory to my Thinkpad using a backup external hard drive.  I can't remember if Thunderbird worked right away after restoring my files or if I had to download it again.  I know I was very excited at that time that I didn't loose my Profile info.  I suppose it is possible the Thinkpad recommended I download from the Microsoft store - I don't know.  To be candid - I don't know where the microsoft store is on my computer and I wouldn't go there first to download files.   </p><p>i'm sorry if I gave you bad info earlier. </p><p>Re ""The default-esr profile is the one currently being used.

I will be sure to keep contributing to Mozilla development.  I appreciate having an option outside of Outlook and Google.
