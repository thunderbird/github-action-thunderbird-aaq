Compacting removes deleted messages from the folder, and it also rebuilds the index. A possible cause of confusion:: When a search is done. the global search uses the index, and users may rely on an older search after a message has been deleted. That is,, a search may indicate a message is present when it is not. There are millions of Thunderbird users; if messages were being deleted, even for 1% of users, there would be a massive outcry.  </p><p>Regardless of our confidence in Thunderbird, as a business, I recommend daily backups because you are more likely to encounter a computer failure or a software crash or a virus infection. Having written that, many backups don't work, as evidenced from what we see here on the forum. The simplest backup that always works is this:  </p> <ol><li> If IMAP, do File&gt;offline&gt;download  (to ensure all messages are on PC) </li><li> ensure thunderbird is not running    &lt;== IMPORTANT </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol> <p>Those are the basic mechanics, but a detailed assessment of potentially lost messages since last backup is encouraged. For your question no how to restore 'lost' messages, I do not feel that is possible, as the messages may likely have previously been deleted. Othes may see possibilities. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
