They actually do not exist until they are opened of detached and saved somewhere. </p><p>All attachments exist as MIME encoded text in the body of the email they arrived in,  but they are not a ""file"" or really distinct data.  A discrete part of the message body is marked as being the attachment.  But that data has to be decoded to get to the actual binary file that was sent. </p><p>So perhaps if you explained what it was you think you are trying to achieve we might be able to offer some ideas.

So I went down and tried Profiles and clicked on the about profiles link, which did work.  The Open Directories in this page did work, so I can find out where the links go to. </p><p>Some go to the home/.../.var directory which I have in my new installation but not in ANY of my backup directories.  What goes on?  What do I copy the old .Thunderbird directory to?  Do I fiddle with one of the profile files (as I used to have to do in the past) by updating the profile word to match my old data?  If so, which profile do I diddle? (Default-esr or default?  Root or local?)  Help!  Why is this suddenly so complicated when it was a dead-simple fudge before? </p>",Sam.Spade,false,0,0

If you cannot access the <a href=""http://live.thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">live.thunderbird.net</a> site it’s because there is temporarily a issue with the site itself try to use another browser to enter that site again but in this case it remains. </p><p>Clear up caches and cookies from that browser selection on that pc that is in use . To see if there are some outages recent use that website use that status checker online from or on Google . </p><p>It seems that there is not going to be acces today to that site I think because it is not valid any more there to enter there where severally reports of that site by users from Norton. Try to go to other sites like <a href=""http://addons.thunderbird.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://addons.thunderbird.net/</a> that site is still working online also for Norton users. </p><p>I think it s because the antivirus program is blocking it temporarily or permanently. Do you use that antivirus software from Norton? Try to uninstall that anti virus and or lighten up security scans from that Norton software to find out if that is the blocking culprit. </p><p>That acces to that site can be reported because self signed certificates for that anti virus program are installed there and acces does not or is not going to be accepted by certain security softwares like Norton or other antivirus programs out there on pc s. </p><p>Because security softwares like Norton can flag a site as not recognised or trusted site and can be blocked for thunderbird users. To fix this try to find out if thunderbird or browser or Norton are up to date. Find out if thunderbird is a trusted subject in Norton firewalls configuration. Turn off and on that vpn function there on that pc to find out more. </p><p>And as mentioned above check for these valid certificates that thunderbird is using. And be sure that browser or email providers does not do not block these certificates most of the issues are there with not accepting certificates , blockings are rare or not even present. </p><p>Do you have Norton as security on you’re pc? Can I ask? </p><p><br> </p><p><br> Questions are open. </p><p>Greetings googlethunderbird </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
