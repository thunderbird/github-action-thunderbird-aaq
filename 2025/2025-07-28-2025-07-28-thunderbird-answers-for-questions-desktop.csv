However, in the past, I used the custom setup and had the appropriate settings but the big difference now, I think, is that I use GMAIL (from what I read online) but Cox was my default email program before.

Daarna vanaf de Mozilla Support website de nieuwste versie (140.1.0esr) gedownload en geïnstalleerd. Geen account opgegeven. Daarna de installs.ini en profiles.ini aangepast zodat ze verwijzen naar de juiste profile naam, en het profile bestand overgehaald van de desktop. </p><p>En nu werkt het weer, en ben ik heel erg blij!

Even uit nieuwsgierigheid, waarom kopieer je het profiel van de ene naar de andere? Als je gebruik maakt van IMAP, kun je de mail op beide apparaten ontvangen en verwerken. Dat kan zelfs met POP, maar wordt minder aangeraden. </p>",Mozilla-assistent,false,1,0

Wij gebruiken POP, omdat we in een berggebied wonen waar wel eens uren (of zelfs dagen) geen internet verbinding is. En omdat ik regelmatig met de bus naar een andere stad ga, en de rit 4-6 uur duurt.  Zonder internet kan ik alle oude mails gewoon raadplegen in de POP-mailer. Het is ons mailarchief en alles zit netjes in mappen. De desktop is onze mailserver, en elke zondag slaan we het profiel op, zodat het meeloopt in de weekbackup. Op dat moment maak ik ook een kopie naar mijn laptop, zodat ik een redelijk recente versie heb staan, waarbij de inbox al over de verschillende mappen is verdeeld. Om dezelfde reden doen we ook niets in de cloud. Ik heb een eenvrouwsbedrijf, en als ik niet bij mijn mails en data kan, kun je me van het plafond schrapen! Ik weet dat dit in Nederland ondenkbaar is. Als er een internetstoring is, ligt heel het land op z'n gat en schreeuwt iedereen moord en brand. We hebben een dual router, die de vaste lijn gebruikt en de 4G zendmast op de tegenoverliggende helling zet bij als de datasnelheid over de vaste lijn onvoldoende is, of de vaste lijn het niet doet. Bij onweer valt de mast vaak uit door blikseminslag. Na een half uur begeeft ook de UPS het, net voldoende voor ons om de storing aan te geven. Zelf hebben we natuurlijk ook een UPS. Even voor de gein een speedtest gedaan, nu alles gewoon werkt: download Mbps is 47,08 en upload Mbps is 5,23. Dat zijn voor ons prima waarden.  Misschien snap je nu waarom we op deze manier werken? 😉 </p>",AnnaPelt,false,0,0
