But with a bit of googling I guess you mean this <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/workflow/9317561?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/workflow/9317561?hl=en</a> </p><p>You may have used Thunderbird with Gmail for an extended time,  but you obviously missed the fact Gmail is different.  You have no inbox folder on gmail.  You have no folders at all.  You have an all mail message store and some messages have a label for inbox, some others might have a label for ""important""  and some might have both.  This extends to all the thinks you call folders.  See the Thunderbird user support document for details <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-gmail#w_gmails-particularities"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-gmail#w_gmails-particularities</a> </p><p>When Gmail makes mail available via IMAP.  Google simulate folders on the fly based on the labels assigned to individual emails.  Google offer some fairly extensive controls on what labels are offered as IMAP folders.  See <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels</a> </p><p>There is one constant that has existed for as long as gmail has existed.  All mail is in the all mail folder and some of the all mail contents may have an inbox label.  Others might have a trash/bin/Deleted label </p><p>The fact that they are all appearing as unread new messages in the inbox is almost certainly caused by your recovery activity.  You do not mention what changes or otherwise you have made to Thunderbird,  or what happened to necessitate a full recovery of the last 30 days deletions which probably resets all mail to a new unread state.  How you are interacting with Gmail within Thunderbird is really an unknown as you have not shared your settings for the account But you might want to visit this google page and ensure you have the defaults selected for your IMAP folders. <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop</a> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> . </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Thunderbird has no message preview.  It has a reading pane,  which I assume you are referring to as a preview pane.  It is in no way functionally different to having the email open in a tab or it's own window.  The only reason I split that hair is because there are those out there (They have instructed me in this forum on the security advantages) that think viewing stuff in the ""preview"" is somehow safer and it is not. </p><p>So have you tried using the ""customize"" option on the more menu? <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-14-04-12-27-80a483.png""> </p><p>Or have you perhaps been using the compact header addon <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/compact-headers/?src=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/compact-headers/?src=search</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Strange behavior indeed. </p><p>I started Thunderbird in Troubleshoot mode and selected remove add-ons in the process.

I have no idea what add-ons they are talking about because I haven't added anything but anyway ... </p><p>It immediately connected and downloaded my emails from Gmail. Unfortunately it has implemented a few preferences I don't really want such as deleting emails from my Google account when I delete them from Thunderbird but otherwise it's working fine. </p><p>I am not a software enthusiast and don't enjoy spending time trying to figure out which buttons to push to get a program to do what I want it to do. </p><p>I've been using Thunderbird for a long time now, I can't understand why it's suddenly behaving like this. It's also kind of suspicious that the behavior began on April 11 at the same time as the update. </p><p>Best regards, Andygj </p>",Andygj,false,0,0
