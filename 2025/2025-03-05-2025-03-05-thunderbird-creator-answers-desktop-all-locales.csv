So I installed Kubuntu 22 and upgraded to Kubuntu 24 which restored my Internet access. Consequently I am now trying to restore my emails in Thunderbird from my last backup. It took me while to realize that relevant Thunderbird profiles.ini wasn't the one in the Home &gt; hidden .thunderbird Rather the profiles.ini is in Home &gt; snap &gt;thunderbird &gt; common&gt; .thunderbird That snap fooled me for a while&nbsp;! So documentation doesn't mention snap, anyway I found it eventually. Also some documentation mentions profile.ini whereas it is actually profiles.ini ... plural. Sorry to be niggly. So now my profiles.ini looks like this: [Profile1] </p><p>Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=y72gpdv6.default Default=1 </p><p>[InstallFDC34C9F024745EB] Default=3f6mpdvc.default-release Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=3f6mpdvc.default-release </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>I discovered that putting y72gpdv6.default from my backup in the code block at the top like that enables me to see most of my emails when I run Thunderbird. There are 4 blocks of code. Could you please tell me that the blocks do? There are 3 defaults, in fact 1 default and 2  default-releases. What is the purpose of the 2 default-releases? Should I change them, for example replace them with something from my backup? Naturally I want to be sure that I have recovered everything. My original profiles.ini only has 3 blocks of code. Of course, I considered just replacing the new profiles.ini with the original profiles.ini from my last backup, BUT the new profiles.ini has 4 blocks of code instead of 3, hence I'm trying to understand how profiles.ini works.  I would appreciate any help. Thank you. Ron H </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1716207;,wherepond

The first devastating problem with Thunderbirt happened when I updated a new version of it about 2,5 years ago. 80% of my email addresses disappeared, about 80 % of both sent and received emails disappeared. </p><p>About 2,5 weeks ago I noticed that I was not receiving any emails on my Thunderbird account. I could see them in the webmail but not my Thunderbird account. I could send emails normally, but they would not appear in my SENT file. I can see in my Thunderbird account in a number change (Received emails) if I have received some, but none actually appear, I must go to my webmail to see them. </p><p>But to make this stranger, SOME emails do randomly appear in my received account on Thunderbird, perhaps 1 in 30 received emails. </p><p>Also, once again, about 80-90% of all my sent and received emails have randomly disappeared from those files. </p><p>I've spoken about this with my webmail provider and they tried all they could, but to no avail. We closed my Thunderbird account and opened it again and transferred all the emails (received and sent) from the webmail to the Thunderbird, and it took about 3 hours of transfer time, and it seemed to happen as the numbers were counting at the bottom left. But when all was transferred and I opened the Sent, Received and Notes files, they had disappeared again, nothing of the re-transfer actually stuck. </p><p>I'm telling you this because twice now in 2,5 years I've found that your Thunderbird email service does not function, it has crashed, it's been an absolute catastrophe, I waste my time with it, and now I have to fish old received and sent emails from the webmail. </p><p>You should fix these problems. </p><p>I'm changing my email address in a few days to gmail, so ""thanks"" and good-bye. </p><p>Markku Piri </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,fi,"",markku.piri

Messages get moved into topical boxes. Recently I've noticed that a mailbox has unread messages in it and when I open it, I see the new messages for an instant and then they disappear. And another mailbox now has unread messages. So it seems that the filters run on the inbox when the mail is received and then they are run again (but a different set are applied) when I open the mailbox they got moved to by the first run.   I see no settings in the Filters dialog that has anything to do with this behaviour. Why is this happening and how can I stop it? </p><p>BTW, most of my filters have Stop Execution as the last step. (Most only have a single Move to... action followed by Stop.  And for performance reasons, all newly created filters should have Stop as an automatic 2nd step since most users wouldn't think to do this. ) </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",gmkayaker
