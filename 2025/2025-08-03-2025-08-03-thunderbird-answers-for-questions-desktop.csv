A lot of my email addresses I click to save that now in my address book won't show that it is currently saved in my address book whenever it is, and I'm stating that when I receive the next email of that same exact saved email address that icon scrolled over still shows the ""Save this address..."" option as if it is an email address not saved yet, so when I assume it's a new one for me to click the save it just adds another same exact name &amp; email address in my book and still not show that it is a saved contact when I try it again.  There's just some odd issue that keeps a lot of my saved contacts from being shown saved each time I receive their next emails from them same exact email addresses &amp; names I've had saved, and that's why it's aggravating when I've had the same ones shown saved on my address book list multiple times whenever I open it to check that before I click to ""Save this address..."" again on it.  I've even took time to delete a lot of them that kept showing multiples of in my address book list just to see if that would help it get saved and shown saved &amp; stored whenever I click to ""Save this address..."" again on the next email, but that hasn't changed any of that odd issue either! </p>",wk97,false,0,0

Thunderbird catches that and shows the popup. But after you hit Retry and the login works, something in the alert system doesn't reset cleanly.

Bump-up the mail check interval In Thunderbird-&gt; Settings &gt; Server Settings, try setting ""Check for new messages every X minutes"" to 15 or even 30. Also uncheck ""Check for new messages at startup"" if it’s on. That can help avoid hitting Earthlink’s timeout or rate limits, which may be what's triggering the false failures. </p><p>Hopefully this helps your issue! </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0

I had it set to check for mail every 1 minute and it didn't occur to me that there was a timeout or rate limit.  They must have implemented it some time within the last 10-20 years, because I don't remember it being a problem before then.  I've set it to 15 minutes now and turned off checking for new messages at startup.  I'll keep an eye on it and see if that fixes the problem.

When I checked the folders in the new location (NAS drive), the new folder was not there.  I looked in the previous location listed in account settings and it was not there either.  However, the folder and email can be viewed in Thunderbird.  I verified that the account settings for Local Folders was still pointing to the new location.  Then I noticed that not all folders were copied to the new location when I did a drag and drop.  I am certainly confused and, for now, I have reset the Local Folders location to the original one, </p>",Thespian,false,0,0

There's no explanation out there..either on other forums, blogs, vlogs, or YouTube.  This looks so easy.  I have tried it once but still have some problems: Your instruction as I import to TB:   ""Thunderbird will ask for the file.  Click browse""   There is no browse option here.  Instead, there is ""Choose comma or tab seperated file (.csv, .tsv)   So I select that choice.   Other options listed are LDIF file.  Vcard file.  SQLite database file.  Mork database file.  Again, I chose Common or tab seperated file.  Don't know if that was correct... Then it all goes to hell...but I get to the sport where there is a page of display choices... ""Import Address Book file.  Match field names.""   I usually display first, last, primary email, home phone, home address, home city, home state, home zip code, work phone,  work address.   Then it displays a file from a secondary email account that I have...although I'm sure that the one I chose is my primary email account.  I double checked myself and it's the PRIMARY Gmail account that I sign into as my first step.    Have I gone so far down the rabbit hole that I can't get back out???   Look forward to your helpful reply. Thanks. </p>",LarsS,false,0,0
