I get a message  that either my user name ie cm.edwards1@ntlworld username is  wrong. Or the password is wrong.   As a result whilst I can see on my computer emails that go back to say 2010.

So now we sign in with a common password for VMO2.  With regard  to this new password I tried it to sign in to my email. That did not work either.

I  now realise   that I  generally normally never signed out from <a href=""http://Virginmedia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Virginmedia.com</a> so I had not been aware that my emails were not being updated to my computer  until  being forced to generate this new VMO2 password.
