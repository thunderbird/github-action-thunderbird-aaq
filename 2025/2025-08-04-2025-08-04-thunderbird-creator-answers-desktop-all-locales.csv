I have a couple  of gmail accounts and a couple of Yahoo accounts. Recently both of the Yahoo inboxes have  started populating from the same Yahoo account. I have reinstalled Thunderbird twice (both with and without uninstalling first). I have deleted the accounts and set them up again. I have changed passwords on the accounts. I have ensured there is only one profile. Nothing seems to allow me to get emails from both accounts going to the correct inboxes on Thunderbird. If I set up account A first, then both account A and account B in Thunderbird get emails from Account A. If I set up account B first then both Thunderbird accounts get the emails from account B. Do I have a profile problem? Any suggestions </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",mike.buckrell
