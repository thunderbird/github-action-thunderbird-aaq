That outlook works and Thunderbird does not on the same device actually increases the chance of it being antivirus related as Outlook relies on the Windows certificate store for encryption and it is very easily manipulated programmatically to add dud certifying authorities. Thunderbird has no programmatic manipulation, instead requiring a manual adding of ""new"" trusted certifying authorities.  So if you are using SSL/TLS or StartTLS then my guess is your antivirus is the root problem. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
