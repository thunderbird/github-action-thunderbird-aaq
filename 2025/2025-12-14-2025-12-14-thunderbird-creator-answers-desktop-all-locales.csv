My computer often crashes and freezes, so I deleted my Gmail from an earlier version of Thunderbird and reinstalled the latest version. </p><p>When I try to add the account, Thunderbird just says “Looking up configuration of my Gmail” and never completes the setup. Oddly enough, I was able to add the same Gmail account into Outlook without any issues. </p><p>Is there something wrong with Thunderbird’s automatic server configuration for Gmail? </p><p>On top of that, I’d like to download all my past Gmail emails (sent items and inbox storage) into Thunderbird, but I don’t know the correct manual settings to use. </p><p>Any guidance on fixing the account setup and the proper manual IMAP/POP settings would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thanks in advance, Chris </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",chris.carragher1977
