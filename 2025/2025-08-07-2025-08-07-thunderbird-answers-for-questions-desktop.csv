I first suggest you rightclick on the desktop icons to see where each is installed. You mention 'windows apps' - did you install these from Microsoft or from Thunderbird?  I encourage clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation and then scrolling to 'profile folder' and clicking 'open folder' to verify the location of the profile in case you need to copy elsewhere . If the profile is at other than c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles you probably installed from Microsoft. Once the profile locations are known, the next steps are usually straightforward. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
