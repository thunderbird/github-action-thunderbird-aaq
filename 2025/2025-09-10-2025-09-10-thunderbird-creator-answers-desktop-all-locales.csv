I have three POP/SMTP accounts, which work in all respects, except for the Junk folder in only one of the accounts.  Thunderbird marks a junk mail in that account as Junk, but leaves it in the Inbox.  When I try to transfer it manually into the proper Junk folder I get the message in the first attached snapshot. </p><p>The Junk folder for the subject account shows Properties per the second attached snap.  The location for the Junk file is missing, which is probably why this situation is giving me grief. </p><p>What is the procedure for giving the Junk folder for that account a proper name?  This had been working fine, but just seems to have developed amnesia.  I tried compacting all folders and doing a 'repair' on this Junk folder, as recommended in the message, but that didn't help.  Oh, and that Junk folder in the left pane has a black icon, whereas the working accounts have red ones (third snapshot). </p><p>Many thanks for any tips! </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",Electrojim

I exported my Thunderbird profile on the old machine and imported it to the new one. Everything looked like it worked. I checked for new messages and there were about 20. They downloaded but they didn't appear in my inbox and weren't in any other folders either. I tried sending myself a few messages and they downloaded but also didn't appear. </p><p>I exited out of the program a few times and one of the new messages I sent myself was suddenly visible, but it was not in my usual inbox. I should explain how my setup looks. I only have one account set up. I have a heading with my email address, and under that is inbox and trash but these folders have never been used. I'm not even sure why they exist, honestly. Under that heading I have the Local Folders heading with inbox, sent, drafts, trash, etc. This has always been where my new messages come, where my sent messages are saved, and so on. </p><p>My new mail has always gone to the inbox under local folders. This time the message went to the inbox under my email address. I don't know why. My sent messages still go to the sent folder in Local Folders. </p><p>And other than that one message out of several that I sent to myself, none of the other 20-some new messages have shown up anywhere. I'm not sure what to do. </p><p>I appreciate any help you can give. Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",mash28

First off, a BIG thank you for all the hard work you have put in and now give it to us for free to use. Your generosity is mind-blowing. I am using TB on Linux and Android. My email life depends dramatically on the use of aliases. When I send mail luckily TB let's me ""customize the from address"" and I can use anything my email provider allows me to use. That's fantastic. But there is a bug. When someone replies to my email and I hit reply to answer their reply, TB PUTS THE WRONG EMAIL ADDRESS INTO THE FROM FIELD. It puts the main email address, not the aliased address the email I am replying to was sent to. Once I did not pay attention and hit send - and my cover was blown. My main email is for no one to see, just the aliases. Please, PLEASE fix this bug. When replying to an email, the from should ALWAYS be the address it was sent to. This is really important and if you fix this, as far as email goes, my life will be perfect.  </p><p>On the Android version,, things are much harder. Itis impossible to compose or reply to aliased emails so I can only use it for reading.  </p><p>I believe that if you fix the alias issues, for people whose email provider allows aliases, email usage patterns will truly be revolutionized.
