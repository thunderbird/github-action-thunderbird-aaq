First off, a BIG thank you for all the hard work you have put in and now give it to us for free to use. Your generosity is mind-blowing. I am using TB on Linux and Android. My email life depends dramatically on the use of aliases. When I send mail luckily TB let's me ""customize the from address"" and I can use anything my email provider allows me to use. That's fantastic. But there is a bug. When someone replies to my email and I hit reply to answer their reply, TB PUTS THE WRONG EMAIL ADDRESS INTO THE FROM FIELD. It puts the main email address, not the aliased address the email I am replying to was sent to. Once I did not pay attention and hit send - and my cover was blown. My main email is for no one to see, just the aliases. Please, PLEASE fix this bug. When replying to an email, the from should ALWAYS be the address it was sent to. This is really important and if you fix this, as far as email goes, my life will be perfect.  </p><p>On the Android version,, things are much harder. Itis impossible to compose or reply to aliased emails so I can only use it for reading.  </p><p>I believe that if you fix the alias issues, for people whose email provider allows aliases, email usage patterns will truly be revolutionized.
