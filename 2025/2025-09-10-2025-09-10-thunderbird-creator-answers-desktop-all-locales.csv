I have three POP/SMTP accounts, which work in all respects, except for the Junk folder in only one of the accounts.  Thunderbird marks a junk mail in that account as Junk, but leaves it in the Inbox.  When I try to transfer it manually into the proper Junk folder I get the message in the first attached snapshot. </p><p>The Junk folder for the subject account shows Properties per the second attached snap.  The location for the Junk file is missing, which is probably why this situation is giving me grief. </p><p>What is the procedure for giving the Junk folder for that account a proper name?  This had been working fine, but just seems to have developed amnesia.  I tried compacting all folders and doing a 'repair' on this Junk folder, as recommended in the message, but that didn't help.  Oh, and that Junk folder in the left pane has a black icon, whereas the working accounts have red ones (third snapshot). </p><p>Many thanks for any tips! </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,1763259;1763345;1763388;1763415;,Electrojim

First off, a BIG thank you for all the hard work you have put in and now give it to us for free to use. Your generosity is mind-blowing. I am using TB on Linux and Android. My email life depends dramatically on the use of aliases. When I send mail luckily TB let's me ""customize the from address"" and I can use anything my email provider allows me to use. That's fantastic. But there is a bug. When someone replies to my email and I hit reply to answer their reply, TB PUTS THE WRONG EMAIL ADDRESS INTO THE FROM FIELD. It puts the main email address, not the aliased address the email I am replying to was sent to. Once I did not pay attention and hit send - and my cover was blown. My main email is for no one to see, just the aliases. Please, PLEASE fix this bug. When replying to an email, the from should ALWAYS be the address it was sent to. This is really important and if you fix this, as far as email goes, my life will be perfect.  </p><p>On the Android version,, things are much harder. Itis impossible to compose or reply to aliased emails so I can only use it for reading.  </p><p>I believe that if you fix the alias issues, for people whose email provider allows aliases, email usage patterns will truly be revolutionized.

Both worked fine. I haven't used my PC since May, and now I saw that since then Thunderbird won't download my mails. (But only on that one gmail account - not on the other one)   Now, I've changed my password with google, adapted it and on the mobile it works perfect - but not on my PC. So - I've deleted the one, set it up again, (it's the same as the other gmail settings) but it doesn't work. (screenshot) I also deleted google access to thunderbird (thought maybe there is an old password in or so) and in the mobile it set up a new access without problems (Thunderbird Freeyour Inbox) ... ... but still nothing is happening on the PC set up. anything else I can try?
