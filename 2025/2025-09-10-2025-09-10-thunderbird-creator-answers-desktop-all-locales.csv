I have three POP/SMTP accounts, which work in all respects, except for the Junk folder in only one of the accounts.  Thunderbird marks a junk mail in that account as Junk, but leaves it in the Inbox.  When I try to transfer it manually into the proper Junk folder I get the message in the first attached snapshot. </p><p>The Junk folder for the subject account shows Properties per the second attached snap.  The location for the Junk file is missing, which is probably why this situation is giving me grief. </p><p>What is the procedure for giving the Junk folder for that account a proper name?  This had been working fine, but just seems to have developed amnesia.  I tried compacting all folders and doing a 'repair' on this Junk folder, as recommended in the message, but that didn't help.  Oh, and that Junk folder in the left pane has a black icon, whereas the working accounts have red ones (third snapshot). </p><p>Many thanks for any tips! </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",Electrojim

My Inbox is syncing perfectly, but I have an issue with the Sent folder. </p><p>On Yahoo Webmail, my Sent folder has 6,124 emails, but in Thunderbird, only 2,000 emails are synced. At the bottom status bar, Thunderbird shows this message: </p><p>(4,124) deleted messages </p><p>It seems like Thunderbird thinks those 4,124 messages are deleted, even though they are still visible and intact on Yahoo Webmail. </p><p>Has anyone experienced this issue before? Is there a way to fix this so Thunderbird can sync all 6,124 Sent emails properly? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",mirfanrmdhan999
