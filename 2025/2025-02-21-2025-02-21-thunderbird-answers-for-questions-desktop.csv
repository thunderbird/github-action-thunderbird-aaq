If you changed your email provider, that would explain not being able to receive those messages <i>at the server</i>, because not all mail servers support that feature, but if your messages are there on the server and you can see them with some other mail client, then you should be able to see them in Thunderbird too.

Gmail labels are mapped to folders on the IMAP server, but they're not the same thing, because a message can have multiple labels in Gmail, but be in a single folder in IMAP. In order to apply a Gmail label to a message without removing any other labels it may have, you would have to <i>copy</i> the message to the IMAP folder corresponding to that label. But that copy would be treated as a different message from the original in the mail client, not as a message that's in multiple folders at the same time… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
