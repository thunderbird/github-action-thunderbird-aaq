In the Message List it's good that the dates show on every message.  [mail.ui.display.dateformat.today] has been set to [2] since 2016, noting that within the message list, it didn't really matter too much if the date shows or not, as the messages are set to display in date order anyway, and if no date was shown, irrespective of how they are sorted, it'd be clear that the message was from today, even without the date. </p><p>My issue is in the displayed email that's received and opened the day received, as every message is, no date is displayed. I have a monitor dedicated to open projects, with typically fifteen projects displayed. Staggered on top of the project are messages from different senders not on the same thread/email-chain that are supplying info, or to whom I've disseminated info on via different threads for the project. I really need each email to always show the Date. </p><p><em><strong>If you could cajole one of the designers to let me know where in the code it is to shut-off the module that suppresses the date on ""Today's"" emails, that would be absolutely terrific.</strong></em>  </p><p>Please let me know if you can help.  </p><p>Thank you very much! </p>",chart,false,0,0

Since you've already tried turning off NordVPN (and the issue persists), let's go over some common potential causes and solutions to get Thunderbird working again on your Windows 10 PC.Summary of Steps to Try: </p><pre>   Check Gmail security settings (enable less secure apps or re-enable IMAP).    Verify IMAP/SMTP settings (ensure they match Gmail’s settings).    Create a new Thunderbird profile to check for profile corruption.    Clear Thunderbird’s cache from the Network &amp; Disk Space settings.    Temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus to check for interference.    Update Thunderbird to the latest version.    Test Gmail with a native email app or browser to check if the issue is specific to Thunderbird.    Check Google account security for any alerts or changes that might block access. </pre> <p>I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue with Thunderbird! If the problem persists, please let me know, and we can dive deeper into other possible causes. 😊 </p>",Sakura,false,0,0

Also changed the outgoing server settings similarly and crossed my fingers but unfortunately on my pc using Thunderbird it now won't send or save drafts."" </p><p>Thanks for the update! It sounds like you’ve made some progress, but you’re still encountering issues with sending emails and saving drafts. It seems like the switch from OAuth2 to password-based authentication for both incoming (IMAP) and outgoing (SMTP) mail servers has allowed Thunderbird to read your Gmail, but it’s not resolving the full issue. </p><p>Here’s how we can troubleshoot and work through the problem of sending emails and saving drafts: 1. Double-Check SMTP Settings </p><p>Since you're able to receive emails but not send them, it’s likely an issue with the SMTP (sending) settings. </p><p>Gmail SMTP settings: </p><pre>   SMTP Server: <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a>    Port: 587    Encryption: STARTTLS    Authentication method: Normal password    Username: Your full Gmail address (e.g., yourname@gmail.com) </pre> <p>Steps to verify: </p><pre>   Open Thunderbird.    Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings.    Under Outgoing Server (SMTP), select the Gmail SMTP server and click Edit.    Ensure the authentication method is set to Normal password, and the username is the full email address.    Click OK to save changes. </pre> <p>After this, try sending an email again and check if the issue is resolved. 2. Check for SMTP Connection Errors </p><p>Thunderbird might not be able to connect to Gmail’s SMTP server properly, which could prevent sending emails or saving drafts. </p><p>Solution: </p><pre>   Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.    Scroll down to the Logins section and look for any connection errors related to your SMTP server. If there are any authentication or connection issues, they might appear there. </pre> <p>You could also enable SMTP logging to track the issue in more detail: </p><pre>   Close Thunderbird.    Open Run (Windows + R) and type thunderbird.exe -smtp-log.    Open Thunderbird and try sending a test email. The log file will be saved, and you can review it for any errors related to the SMTP server connection. </pre> <p>3. Test Draft Saving: </p><p>There might be a problem with local drafts not being saved correctly. If drafts are not being saved in Thunderbird, it could be related to the IMAP settings or a conflict between local and server-side storage. </p><p>Solution: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Server Settings.    Under the Drafts folder section, ensure that Keep drafts in is set to ""Drafts"" on the server (to save drafts in Gmail's cloud storage, not locally).    If you want to store drafts locally, choose Local Folders instead. </pre> <p>Also, check if Thunderbird is able to connect to the drafts folder on the Gmail server: </p><pre>   In Thunderbird, click on your Drafts folder and make sure it syncs correctly. If the folder appears empty or unresponsive, there may be an issue with the IMAP connection. </pre> <p>4. Test Sending Email Without VPN: </p><p>Since you mentioned using NordVPN, it could be affecting Thunderbird’s ability to send emails. Some VPNs might block certain ports or protocols used by email services like Gmail. </p><p>Solution: </p><pre>   Disconnect from the VPN and try sending an email again. If the email sends successfully, it suggests that the VPN might be interfering with Thunderbird’s connection to the SMTP server.    If this works, try adding an exception for Thunderbird in your VPN settings or use a different VPN server. </pre> <p>5. Check Gmail’s Security Settings: </p><p>Even though you've switched back to password-based authentication, Gmail’s security settings may still block certain connections. </p><p>Solution: </p><pre>   Ensure that your Gmail account doesn’t have any alerts or security blocks. Log in to Gmail in a web browser and check for any suspicious activity or ""blocked sign-ins"". If you find any, you may need to allow Thunderbird to connect again.    Try logging into Gmail through a web browser and check for any security prompts (e.g., confirming that you are trying to connect via Thunderbird). </pre> <p>6. Clear Thunderbird’s Cache: </p><p>Sometimes, Thunderbird’s internal cache might cause issues with syncing drafts or sending emails. </p><p>Solution: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Network &amp; Disk Space.    Click Clear Now under Cached Web Content to clear Thunderbird’s cache.    Restart Thunderbird and test again. </pre> <p>7. Test with a New Profile: </p><p>If Thunderbird's current profile is corrupted, it could cause inconsistent behavior like not sending emails or saving drafts. </p><p>Solution: </p><pre>   Try creating a new profile by following these steps:        Close Thunderbird.        Press Windows + R, type thunderbird.exe -P, and hit Enter.        Create a new profile and add your Gmail account to it.        Test whether this new profile resolves the issue with sending and saving drafts.If the problem persists, please let me know </pre>",Sakura,false,0,1
