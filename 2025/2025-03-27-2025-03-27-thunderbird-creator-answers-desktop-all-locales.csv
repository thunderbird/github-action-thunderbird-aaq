So I did that and was told to go to 115.18.0 and it was not noted as esr.  So I did and was immediately told to go to 128.8.1 esr.  I was not on the esr channel and do not want/need to be on esr.  about:config has been changed to esr channel from release w/o my ok - the least I'd expect is a warning.  Release 115.x.x has betas and releases more than I had seen previously - aboutr 25-26.  It looks like nothing but betas from 116 to 128 and a lot of what look like releases from x.0 to x.10.2 which is new to me.  What is the rational behind all these versions and why there is not a simple center of how to use this info?  I remember when way back, tbird had issues but they were manageable. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",jeff-g
