I was not on the esr channel and do not want/need to be on esr.  about:config has been changed to esr channel from release w/o my ok - the least I'd expect is a warning.  Release 115.x.x has betas and releases more than I had seen previously - aboutr 25-26.  It looks like nothing but betas from 116 to 128 and a lot of what look like releases from x.0 to x.10.2 which is new to me.  What is the rational behind all these versions and why there is not a simple center of how to use this info?
