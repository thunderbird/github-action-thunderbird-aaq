I took up with the powers that be that the published minimum system requirements for Thunderbird are woefully inadequate for the smooth running of the application.  I wasted my time again.  But the memory and disk space requirement are about double what is published.  There is a major difference between running and basing smoothly functioning. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The local storage does not contain anything but caches and temporary storage.  The version downloaded from the Microsoft store is somewhat different,  but fortunately few folk use it. </p><p>Next, what are you really trying to do. Thunderbird may or may not have files names with the email account in the profile folder.  Mostly I do not have anything but server names in my storage folder names and not atall in the storage files. </p><p>If you want the specific folder an account uses for it's storage,  look in account setting at the bottom of the server settings for the local directory. </p><p>If you actually want backups of the profile,  I suggest you use this add-on to make them. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My wife is almost a luddite when it comes to technology and she is very reluctant to change anything.  But, she has been running up against Comcasts 10gb email archive space and has become so very annoyed that they want her to delete any of her +999 emails.  I recognize that an email reader like Mozilla could solve her problem but ONLY IF she can run Mozilla on more than one computer (home and work) and still access her emails.  Is that possible? </blockquote> <p>Not really.  In saying that I am continuing the concept of a Luddite.  You could use a POP mail account the Thunderbird portable on a Portable drive to make it multi machine.   <a href=""https://portableapps.com/search/node/thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com/search/node/thunderbird</a> But it is something that needs to be done with due care,  not by someone that thinks they are working a CD player or data corruption from pulling the drive early to leave the machine will see data corruption. </p> <blockquote> If so, just point me to a link on the ""how"" and I'll work on my wife to convince her to switch. I just need to really understand the ""how"" because if I get it wrong... well anybody married for a long time understands that dilema.  Thanks in advance. -=JT=- </blockquote> <p>I would suggest she start using another mail provider instead of Comcast.  They appear to be a poor choice for just about everything anyway. At least from where I sit on the other side of the world.  Dodgy support, poor documentation et. al.   </p><p>Perhaps you might even consider a paid subscription service that does not limit online storage,  just charges more as you store more.  Google and Outlook are the big US providers there,  Yahoo has basically no limit on storage,  but their service appear to have other usability issues like problems synchronizing very large mail accounts. I understand the Thunderbird development company is going to start up their own email product in the relatively near future which would at least have none of the advertising issues that the others I mentioned have in their very core. </p><p>At the end of the day storage is not free,  we all pay for it in one way or another,  either through access to us as advertising targets for the provider, or with our hard earned.  Clearly this ""cloud"" storage is the new money maker,  with Microsoft basically ensuring everything on windows 11 is backed up to their cloud with its subscription model for excess storage. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
