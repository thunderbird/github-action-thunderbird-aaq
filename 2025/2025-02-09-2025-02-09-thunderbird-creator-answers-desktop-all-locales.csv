My Thunderbird is running fine, except that I cannot backup my profile (as it does not exist). The folder when my profile is located currently seems to be a cache folder and I scare that it disappears when the cache will be cleared out.

If I send an email from either of those 2 devices 2 copies of the same message appear in the 'Sent Items' folder. Two messages also appear in the 'Sent Items' folder of Outlook on my PC. If I send a message from Outlook on my PC only 1 message appears (as it should do). Is there something that can be done to correct this so that the message only appears once?
