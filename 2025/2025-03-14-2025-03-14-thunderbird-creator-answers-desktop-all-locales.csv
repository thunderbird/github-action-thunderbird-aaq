I can not find any documentation anywhere as to what changed or why an extension would not work with 129+. </p><p>Also the release notes do not mention that 136 changes the Profile format, requiring a redownload of all messages from the server and therefore reindexing. This took several hours, only to find the addons don't work. Downgrading Thunderbird gives a profile error, and requires the `--allow-downgrade`switch to restore functionality. There should be a warning in the release notes regarding the one-way nature of the upgrade. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",electricdesert

I would like to have them listed in time of arrival order. Is this possible? If yes, is there a simple setting that a user can access to switch from topic order to time based order? If no, is there any way this variation in presentation can be achieved? Thanks for reading and considering my request, Peter. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",pegger2
