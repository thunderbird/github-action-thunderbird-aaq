I can not find any documentation anywhere as to what changed or why an extension would not work with 129+. </p><p>Also the release notes do not mention that 136 changes the Profile format, requiring a redownload of all messages from the server and therefore reindexing. This took several hours, only to find the addons don't work. Downgrading Thunderbird gives a profile error, and requires the `--allow-downgrade`switch to restore functionality. There should be a warning in the release notes regarding the one-way nature of the upgrade. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",electricdesert
