Last night, after I received your reply, I sent myself a message (click ""Send,"" it went), and contrived a draft to no-one and saved it (Cmd-s, Cmd-w). Then I quit TB (now 137) and relaunched it, and the Sent folder re-appeared, first containing only that one sent message, and then rapidly filling up with the other sent messages from the past. The drafts folder then also re-appeared. There was at first a strange yellow star on that folder icon, then it would open after re-clicking, with the new draft and the earlier ones (and the star disappeared). Still no Templates folder. Then I quit TB first (so no other software would intercept the closing) and after that shut down the MBP.  </p><p>But rebooting this morning, TB lunched with the Sent, Drafts, and Templates folders missing, so I repeated the drill above, with the same results.  </p><p>As far as I know, I am just using the default profile, never having created any new one.
