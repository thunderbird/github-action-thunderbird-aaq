Thinking back, I don't know where my cursor was in Thunderbird, but what I typed into what I thought was the Firefox address bar was 'maps,' followed by Enter.  Because of Firefox address bar history, or whatever it's called, this would have been a shortcut of sorts to auto-fill and launch: <a href=""http://maps.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">maps.google.com</a>. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

I did discover, however, that those superfluous folders show only in the Unified Folders mode; that is, if I elect to show All Folders instead, with no Unified, the pane is longer, of course, but there is only one appearance of each account.  I did not elect to make any of the Troubleshoot options permanent, figuring that if they show in the TS mode, there's nothing to be gained checking those boxes. </p><p>I'm wondering now if it might be easier to reinstall Thunderbird, but am not at all sure which mail folders might have to be saved so as not to lose any messages, or what other files might contain account and other setup data that otherwise would have to be reset from scratch.  The one other 'bug' I have in my present installation is somewhat strange: when I right-click on my Unified Junk folder, there is an (exact) 5-second delay before the drop-down menu appears to allow clearing the folder.  Right-clicking any individual account Junk folder, on the other hand, brings the menu up immediately. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

Did you have more than one item selected? I'm curious what you see in ""All Folders"" if you select only one item, an account name, and right click on it. Does ""Subscribe"" appear in the drop-down menu? </p><p>Re-installing Thunderbird does not affect your data, but you will want to have a back-up copy of your data on an external drive in any case. Many methods work. One that Thunderbird offers is the ""Tools"" menu, then ""Export..."" Then copy that zip file to an external drive. Note the message that you should use another method to back up a profile that is larger than two gigabytes. </p><p>Then you will feel safer doing whatever you do next. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

This issue isn't a show-stopper at all, Tbird still works just fine, so if I can do any diagnostics to help in understanding this, I'm happy to go along for the ride. </p><p>I'm using this issue: 128.9.1esr (64-bit), and Help's auto-check says it's current.  This is running under Windows 10 22H2, updated regularly, and the AV is just Windows Defender, also up-to-date.  I shy away from add-ons to Mozilla utilities, but for Firefox (only) I have DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, Ghostery Privacy/Blocker, and something called UglyMail, which I don't recall installing (hmm!). </p><p>In those screenshots, the arrows (and highlighted entries they point to) are what were right-clicked, only the one highlighted entry in each case.  Oh, I see what  you mean about two... just tried that second screen-shot test again.  It seems that if you left-click one folder or account name and it lights up, you can right-click another and it will too.  But I did all that over again and, no, 'Subscribe' is never an option in the drop-down menu.  I don't have any newsgroups set up, if that makes a difference. </p><p>I believe that this: ""9ll320g5.default-release"" is my current Tbird profile; it's 2.74GB, so I can put that onto a flash drive easily enough instead of using the resident utility.  The entire ""Profiles"" folder, including the named one, is only 2.77GB. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

Note in the attached screenshot, that the second appearance of one of the email accounts that 'duplicated itself' shows up in blue and note one unread message.  But neither the Unified Inbox or the individual Inbox for that same account show any unread messages.  Even going to that account and Mark[ing] All Folders Read does not clear the bubble with the number one in it. </p><p>And I would like to confirm which folders under: C:\Users\Lab\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ should I save on my Desktop or on a flash drive to preserve all email messages, account settings, etc. should I elect to reinstall Thunderbird afresh.  I think it's the first in the list under Profiles; that is, a folder called: 9ll320g5.default-release, but I'm not sure that's the only one to save to get back to a full re-installation. </p><p>Many thanks to you guys who know what you're doing. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

I would like to back-up whatever is important to restore even the current, broken installation I have; I'd hate to lose all the info in all those emails.  In reading instructions for backing-up, and posts suggesting different/alternate methods of doing so, this seems a somewhat dicey operation.  I'm still reading-up on this, however, and will proceed when I feel that everything essential to operation is copied.  I even have another Win10 computer I could try a 'virtual reinstall' on first, just for confidence. </p><p>Wayne, is that add-on you linked me to really just 3.40KB?  Seems too small to be of any use.  But I've installed it and am ready to give Reset Unified Folders a whirl, but also am due for a system backup.  So I'll do the backup first, thus creating as-is versions of Thunderbird files, probably tomorrow, and will try that rebuild afterward and report back here.  Many thanks. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0
