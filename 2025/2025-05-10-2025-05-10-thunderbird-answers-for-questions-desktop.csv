Before I got your generous reply I phoned them and in an hour's worth of work found that all my server parameters were wrong, both for the secondary account that had stopped syncing but also for the main account which had no problems.  Hover help couldn't tell my how either one was working -- said they shouldn't be -- but directed me to correct the parameters.  Somehow that didn't help, so finally they said remove both accounts and install them again (with correct parameters) and that did work, although it took most of an hour to reload all the emails for both accounts.  By the way, the wrong parameters that had been working for both accounts for many months were the ones defaulted by Thunderbird, for example, <a href=""http://mail.mann.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mann.org</a> instead of <a href=""http://mail.hover.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.hover.com</a> and wrong port numbers for both incoming and outgoing mail.  So, in the end, I'm completely back up but I never found out how I could have been running for so long with all the wrong parameters.  Thank you again for your help.  The problem is solved and I'll see if I can find a button to signal that.  I'll also be glad to try your help with the activity manager and error console, which I knew nothing about.

Norton is my pet hate for this as they get mentioned over and over for decades. Most antivirus software firewall do this at some time or other,  some being much worse for it than others.  They block new versions of Thunderbird until they get that call from home a few days later that there is a new approved version.  just fix the antivirus product or in my case I just uninstalled it.  Several years on Windows 11 now with only Defender. So I am hundreds of dollars up and don't have the incessant nags of the paid antivirus products. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Thunderbird stores all passwords for calendars separately to IMAP.  The exception being oAuth  where the token is stored in the password manager and shared between calendar and mail. </p><p>3. When a calendar is created,  you have to tell Thunderbird that credentials are required.  <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-05-10-18-37-47-29f392.png""> </p><p>What I find these days is users who have never been challenged for a password turn off authentication when it fails and they are asked for a password.

Remove the line with the blank username. </p><p>I don't know how this entry was created but I see entries in other Thunderbird instances that are also blank so they are not uncommon.
