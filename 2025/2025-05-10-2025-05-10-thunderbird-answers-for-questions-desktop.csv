Even if your Mozilla account expires you wouldn't notice anything in Thunderbird. There may be a greater impact for Firefox, e.g. if you sync your bookmarks to your Mozilla account. </p><p>If you don't know what a Mozilla account is all about, then I'm wondering why you did create one in the first place. It certainly didn't get created magically out of the blue. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

Typically email providers limit the no. of recipients in a single message to prevent spam, and you may have reached a threshold with your newsletter.
