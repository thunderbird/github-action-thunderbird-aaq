Before I got your generous reply I phoned them and in an hour's worth of work found that all my server parameters were wrong, both for the secondary account that had stopped syncing but also for the main account which had no problems.  Hover help couldn't tell my how either one was working -- said they shouldn't be -- but directed me to correct the parameters.  Somehow that didn't help, so finally they said remove both accounts and install them again (with correct parameters) and that did work, although it took most of an hour to reload all the emails for both accounts.  By the way, the wrong parameters that had been working for both accounts for many months were the ones defaulted by Thunderbird, for example, <a href=""http://mail.mann.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mann.org</a> instead of <a href=""http://mail.hover.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.hover.com</a> and wrong port numbers for both incoming and outgoing mail.  So, in the end, I'm completely back up but I never found out how I could have been running for so long with all the wrong parameters.  Thank you again for your help.  The problem is solved and I'll see if I can find a button to signal that.  I'll also be glad to try your help with the activity manager and error console, which I knew nothing about.

It probably does not contain any mail at all  But I am prety sure you have imported a load of junk as the files addons.json, addonStartup.json, AlternateServices.bin, etc. are located in the root of your profile ie Users\name\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\********.default-esr that you have managed to get them into Local folders, I have no idea what you have done/ </p><p><br> I linked to the import export tools addon.  Did you install it and import the MBOX files from the location as I suggested or did you do something else?

Second, I copied the directory to another location and gave it a different name. Third, I downloaded the Import/Export Addon. Fourth, I deleted all of the extraneous files that somehow got into the Local Folders location. Fifth, I used the Import/Export Addon to Import folders located in the copied directory. I have now recovered into Local Folders quite a few emails that were within folders in that main directory.   HOWEVER, there are a number of files that were not in folders but were within the main directory that have not been imported.  These files have the extension .msf, such as Inbox.msf and Sent.msf.  I haven't been able to import those successfully.  Any ideas? Thanks. </p>",puravid1,false,0,0
