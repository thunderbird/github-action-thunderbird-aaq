I have just set the junk option in settings (Global) to move junk mail to the Junk folder but the Gmail account does not have a Junk folder, only a Spam Folder. </p><p>Why do people use such unprofessional terms? It is Spam. Even ""Folder"" is childish to someone who started with Dos 5.0 although it is sort of correct. </p><p>I have also adjusted the notifications so I do see a quick notification about receipt of an email. I saw a notification that mentioned an email that was considered junk. I cannot find it. I do not know for sure whether it was junk or not. </p><p>Where could this email have gone? Gone forever? I have nothing set to totally remove emails. I do this manually. Emails caught by my Filters are sent to the Bin/Trash (another mix) so I can check them before deleting permanently. </p><p>Regarding the Bin/Trash mix mentioned, I have 4 accounts showing. An old IP based and a Gmail based account for both myself and my partner. My partner is not interested in using computers. My Gmail account has a Bin folder but the other 3 have Trash folders, all with bin icons. I have no idea about setting icons for these folders, nor do I care about this, meaning I don't think it is something I have done deliberately. I just find it weird and confusing that there is no convention followed. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",Oldneweng
