I currently monitor (some for non-profits, some my own) five email accounts in Thunderbird. They are all IMAP accounts. However, my own main account also has an extensive system of local folders that adds up to about 12GB of data, and probably over 100 folders (don't ask; it was necessary until I retired last year, but I need to keep all of those saved emails, as I still access them frequently).  </p><p>I've searched the forums and have found good information on moving Tbird to a new computer, but that's not what I'm looking for. Chances are what I need is here, and I've missed it, so please forgive if I'm rehashing old questions. </p><p>Currently, my Thunderbird profile and folders are stored on my C: drive, as is the default. I have been manually backing them up several times a week (for years) to OneDrive, because I can't afford to lose everything if my laptop decides to bite the dust. Using that method, I've successfully moved the setup to a new computer several times. I'm not sure why simply redirecting the setup to a different location on the same system has been a bugbear for me.&nbsp;::smile:: </p><p>It would be much less labor-intensive if I can simply point Thunderbird to the OneDrive files so they are always up-to-date and ""there,"" should I need to make a computer change again. </p><p>Note, that I am not looking to access the Tbird installation with multiple computers.  </p><p>I have tried (and failed) to do this in the past.

So instead of Home or Cell you can add a custom tag such as Shop or Home2 in the event one has two home phones. The problem is Thunderbird only has Six options for Phone Type. There is no custom.  If I go on iCloud and I have a phone number set a Custom and named it Shop there is not a issue as both the phone and icloud support Custom tags.  How does a person add that phone number into Thunderbird since Custom Tags are not a option? I even exported my data from Thunderbird to a VCard and went into Systools Split and Merge and it does not support Custom tags either. Systools does however give a few more options than Thunderbird, but none that I am aware of are configurable.  I thought VCard was supposed to be a industry standard and the same across all platforms and clients?
