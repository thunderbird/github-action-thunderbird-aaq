I used WHM to move TB and a lot of other files to the new server about 4 months ago. Before switching the DNS I downloaded the TB profile. Changed the DNS. I also reinstalled TB.

Tried to  do this manually just replacing the files. Also tried setting up 2 email accounts (old and new server) for the same account. I could not get this to load the old emails. If I change the DNS back to the old server and wait; eventually I can access the current emails, so they are still there. </p><p>When the DNS is  pointed to the new server, and I drop in the old server profile file, sometimes there is a flash where current emails show, and then are erased. It sort gives me the impression that the profile file is inserting the emails locally, but the IMAP server is removing the emails because they are not on the server.
