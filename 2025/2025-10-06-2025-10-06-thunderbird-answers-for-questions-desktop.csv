Emails are received into the server that handles your emails. That might be an email address provided by your Internet Service Provider or maybe a free email address such as those provided by gmail or it may be an email address you have because you have purchased a domain etc.  </p><p>Thunderbird simply accesses the server and downloads whatever is in the server Inbox. </p><p>The server is set up to receive whatever is sent to it.  You are paying that company to accept emails sent to your email address.  Usually, servers have their own Spam filters to detect spam and then server usually puts those emails into the server Spam folder. You would only be able to see them if you created an Imap mail account.  In webmail account, you can usually set up what is deemed as safe or unsafe sender, so server auto filters those into the Spam folder. </p><p>In Thunderbird, 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Junk Settings' for each account - you can set up and train the Thunderbird Junk filter to recognise what you deem as Junk or Not Junk. </p><p><br> <strong>Why are you getting spam in the first place:</strong> Your email address is known by nefarious people and they are block sending spam mail to your email address.  The Source View of your email should offer information on the initial source of sender maybe it includes an IP address. The top Received by will your server and the one closest to the From, Subject, To, Date headers will be the first server to receive the email. </p><p>Maybe your email address is displayed on some website so any search bot might discover it.  </p><p>Advice on checking the date issue: You need to determine whether Thunderbird is involved in altering anything. </p><p>Process: I would suggest that you check the webmail account first thing in the morning before you start up Thunderbird. You would need to logon and check the webmail account to see if it displays all the same date/time for new spam mail. Make a note of the date/time or take a screendump image of server data. Then you will know whether the date time is all the same on server <em><strong>before </strong></em>it gets downloaded to Thunderbird. Once you have checked the server, start up Thunderbird, let it do the downloaded and notice if it displays same date/time as server when emails are downloaded. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

You would need to logon to your webmail account via a browser. Then ask some one from the 'church' to send an email and see if it arrives in the webmail account. </p><p>My next question is: how much quota do you have left on the server&nbsp;? If server has used up the allowed quota then emails cannot be received into the account until you delete something to create space. Now if you have deleted the odd email maybe it was just enough space to receive an email, but not enough space to receive more. You may need to delete a load old mail off the server to acquire more available quota. Please note, if you use an Imap account in Thunderbird, then anything you delete off server will also get deleted from the Imap account.  So, if you have some old emails you want to keep you need to get copies before you delete anything off server. In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Right click on those emails and select 'Copy to' and choose a suitable folder in 'Local Folders' account. </li><li> Make sure you can open those copied emails after all, you do want a full downloaded copy and not just a copy of headers&nbsp;! </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Only items ticked are Folder Pane Header, and (greyed out) All Folders. 3. I can't think that I did. I was busy all day uploading Windows 11 and didn't do anything with TB excepy download new messages and maybe send. Local directory is C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Local Folders, and Account Name is Local Folders. Looking at folders again now, The Sent folder also disappeared. I have just sent a test message and the folder has reappeared but only holding that one message. Search shows I still have another 72 sent messages in the system, but not in the folder. As I say, the Local folders are all gone, except for Deleted and Outbox (both showing empty). </p>",bob246,false,0,0

I went ahead an proceeded forward with the pop-up and it asked for a verification that is was me.  Then asked if I give Thunderbird permission to hook up with Yahoo &amp; I did. Now looks like the pop-ups are not happening any more. Christ1, thanks for directing me how the setup should be and gave me confidence that it was Yahoo trying to reach out.

So, unless the account requires unique passwords per PC (e.g., gmail) then you'll be okay. I do strongly recommend checking account online and making a copy of your password. Thunderbird is often asked to restore lost passwords, and it cannot do that. You can see the password being used at settings&gt;privacy&amp;security. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
