Emails are received into the server that handles your emails. That might be an email address provided by your Internet Service Provider or maybe a free email address such as those provided by gmail or it may be an email address you have because you have purchased a domain etc.  </p><p>Thunderbird simply accesses the server and downloads whatever is in the server Inbox. </p><p>The server is set up to receive whatever is sent to it.  You are paying that company to accept emails sent to your email address.  Usually, servers have their own Spam filters to detect spam and then server usually puts those emails into the server Spam folder. You would only be able to see them if you created an Imap mail account.  In webmail account, you can usually set up what is deemed as safe or unsafe sender, so server auto filters those into the Spam folder. </p><p>In Thunderbird, 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Junk Settings' for each account - you can set up and train the Thunderbird Junk filter to recognise what you deem as Junk or Not Junk. </p><p><br> <strong>Why are you getting spam in the first place:</strong> Your email address is known by nefarious people and they are block sending spam mail to your email address.  The Source View of your email should offer information on the initial source of sender maybe it includes an IP address. The top Received by will your server and the one closest to the From, Subject, To, Date headers will be the first server to receive the email. </p><p>Maybe your email address is displayed on some website so any search bot might discover it.  </p><p>Advice on checking the date issue: You need to determine whether Thunderbird is involved in altering anything. </p><p>Process: I would suggest that you check the webmail account first thing in the morning before you start up Thunderbird. You would need to logon and check the webmail account to see if it displays all the same date/time for new spam mail. Make a note of the date/time or take a screendump image of server data. Then you will know whether the date time is all the same on server <em><strong>before </strong></em>it gets downloaded to Thunderbird. Once you have checked the server, start up Thunderbird, let it do the downloaded and notice if it displays same date/time as server when emails are downloaded. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

No idea,  but I would expect not. </p><p>2. Why bother?  Seriously mail at rest is a text file. It can not infect your system, cause issues or really do anything that any other simple text file could do.   Just ignore it, if you try and open an infected attachment on an email  let the antivirus notify you and block the creation of the attachment.  Mail at rest does not have attachments, only mime encoded text representations that need to be decoded and turned back into a file to be opened, so any malware in an attachment does not exist in a harmful state until the attachment is saved or opened, because that is when the file is created.  Likewise Thunderbird does not run script in messages,  so there is no drive by malware from opening an infected email.  When using Thunderbird essentially you have to chose to open a website that infects your system, open an attachment  that your antivirus fails to detect as infected in memory or when the temp file is written to disk preparatory to opening.  If your antivirus fails to detect it at that point, it will not have been able to detect it in the incoming email either. (Same definitions used) </p><p>3.  MailDir has had basically no updates for a decade.  The underlying code was written by a programmer working for Mozilla Messaging who left the organization for greener pastures at Google before Mozilla Messaging was disbanded as a company by Mozilla in 2012.  I understand there may be some work being undertaken on the pluggable store which was a fundamental requirement for the maildir like implementation. I think long before it gets released as a ""thing"" it will be replaced.  The support article which I assume you have read contains a link to open bugs for that specific feature,  it is up to you to make your own decisions as to if you wish to risk your data using it.  I use it for a single IMAP mail account so I can test and track bugs, but I do not trust it with my pop mail, only IMAP as that is mostly going to be backed up with a server copy unless a bug deletes the server copy as well. </p><p>Just to be clear, Microsoft defender does not scan email at all,  yet it rates about as effective in detecting malware as all of the paid products out there that do.  Mail scanning is mostly smoke and mirrors to sell the commodity (Fear) that is the stock in trade of antivirus companies and cover for the security weaknesses inherent in products like Outlook that start running scripts as soon as you open an email.  If you press these vendors for a reason for scanning email they will offer ""another line of defense"".  They have memory, hard disk and file system locked down and they want to mess with text files because they have the potential if opened in the wrong application to cause trouble.  </p><p>You have now received a reply from a peer as this is a peer forum.
