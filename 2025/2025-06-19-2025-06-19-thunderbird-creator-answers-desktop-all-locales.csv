I use multiple computers and have the same issue on all. I am running Thunderbird 128.11.1esr (64 bit) on my desktop, which is Linux Mint. </p><p>If there are any suggestions on how to move the folders back to their original location, would be good, unless I have to now live with it. </p><p>Thanks, V1King </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",V1King
