I use multiple computers and have the same issue on all. I am running Thunderbird 128.11.1esr (64 bit) on my desktop, which is Linux Mint. </p><p>If there are any suggestions on how to move the folders back to their original location, would be good, unless I have to now live with it. </p><p>Thanks, V1King </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",V1King

For the last few weeks, maybe longer, it still spell checks, but the words it stops at are no longer highlighted. So I don’t know where in the body of the email the issue occurs. Without seeing the context around the potential misspelled word, I can’t tell if I should accept the suggested correction, or push Ignore. </p><p>I’ve attached a screen shot of Thunderbird stopping at “interlibrary” but there is no indication at that word in the body of the email. </p><p>When I tried a simpler example - one sentence with a misspelling - the misspelling was given a red underline. And occasionally, a questioned word would be highlighted. But it use to work reliably ALL the time. </p><p>What can I do to bring back highlighting the questionable word? I didn’t realize how much more useful it made the spell checking. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",designer5
