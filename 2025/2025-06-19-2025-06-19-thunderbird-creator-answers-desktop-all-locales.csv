(bug1971121),"<p>In the past, as Thunderbird was spell checking (triggered by pushing Send), it would highlight the words it questioned. For the last few weeks, maybe longer, it still spell checks, but the words it stops at are no longer highlighted. So I don’t know where in the body of the email the issue occurs. Without seeing the context around the potential misspelled word, I can’t tell if I should accept the suggested correction, or push Ignore. </p><p>I’ve attached a screen shot of Thunderbird stopping at “interlibrary” but there is no indication at that word in the body of the email. </p><p>When I tried a simpler example - one sentence with a misspelling - the misspelling was given a red underline.
