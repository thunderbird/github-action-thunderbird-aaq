I recently had to purchase a new computer and had to install updated software for everything including Thunderbird.  The calendar is giving me fits...  When the computer is turned off, I lose all records of previous meetings as well as all scheduled meetings in the future (as well as any scheduled recurring meetings) along with the links to the online meetings.  I assume that I have a problem in my settings but I don't know where to begin...  I have looked for other similar problems on line and most seem to be associated with sync-ing with other calendar applications - but I don' use other calendar applications and don't sync with any other applications. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",dmt.equip2010
