A reply with signature should be contiguous; previous messages (the ""quote"" (I consider ""quote"" to be somewhat of a misnomer)) are there for reference below the reply and separated from it.

Do you see more than one profile shown?  - if yes, browse each one to see the size and date of the file named abook.sqlite - that is the addressbook.

Needless to say, make sure to keep a backup copy of the original prefs.js file. Also make sure to adjust profiles.ini accordingly. For some reason extensions can be disabled and grayed out after this. To fix this you can try to remove a simple extension which doesn't have it's own config.

Everyone moves machines every few years (I tend to hold out longer than most just because of this sort of thing but I finally maxed out with 9 years on my old machine!).
