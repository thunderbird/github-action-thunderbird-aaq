My suggestion is to dig into profiles to see if an older profile is present. Try these steps:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down left side to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - you are now in the profile. click the 'back' arrow to go back one more folder - you should now be in the ....thunderbird\profiles folder. Do you see more than one profile shown?  - if yes, browse each one to see the size and date of the file named abook.sqlite - that is the addressbook. If you find one that was updated recently, that may be it. Look also in the Imapmail folder if you had an iMAP account and in the Mail folder if you had a POP account.  - if you see the missing data, report back and we can try next steps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To fix what you have, my guess is that your latest updated prefs-x.js has the content you want. So, delete all prefs files except the highest numbered one, and rename that one to prefs.js.  Based on feedback from others with the same problem, you may need to copy the highest-numbered prefs to a separate directory, rename it there to prefs.js, and then copy/paste into the profile. be sure thunderbird is NOT running during all of this. Do let me know results, as that helps when advising other users. Thank you </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thunderbird uses the index file to show list of mail, but when you select an email, it then locates the stored email in the mbox file. Repairing does not delete emails from mbox file. It just recreates the index - it checks the real store of emails to see what exists and creates an index of emails in that store. If you repaired index and now emails are missing then they were already gone. </p><p>If you click on 'Get Messages' then do you get an error message&nbsp;?
