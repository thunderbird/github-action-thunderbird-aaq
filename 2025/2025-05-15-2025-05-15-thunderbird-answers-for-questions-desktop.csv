My suggestion is to dig into profiles to see if an older profile is present. Try these steps:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down left side to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - you are now in the profile. click the 'back' arrow to go back one more folder - you should now be in the ....thunderbird\profiles folder. Do you see more than one profile shown?  - if yes, browse each one to see the size and date of the file named abook.sqlite - that is the addressbook. If you find one that was updated recently, that may be it. Look also in the Imapmail folder if you had an iMAP account and in the Mail folder if you had a POP account.  - if you see the missing data, report back and we can try next steps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What you are describing is a situation where thunderbird is being prevented from shutting down successfully. That is when the prefs.js file in the profile is updated with all updates from current execution. It might also be a situation where the prefs.js is read-only. If you browse the profile and see multiple instances of the prefs.js, that is also an indication of interference during shutdown. Please post results. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

There are 40 prefs files in my profile folder, all dated more than a year ago but the problem only appeared this week after I added the new email account. I have had McAfee installed and operating for several years with no problem but I don't know how to check if it is interfering.  I don't have a vpn turned on.  Any suggestions? </p>",bgaden3,false,0,0

To fix what you have, my guess is that your latest updated prefs-x.js has the content you want. So, delete all prefs files except the highest numbered one, and rename that one to prefs.js.  Based on feedback from others with the same problem, you may need to copy the highest-numbered prefs to a separate directory, rename it there to prefs.js, and then copy/paste into the profile. be sure thunderbird is NOT running during all of this. Do let me know results, as that helps when advising other users. Thank you </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Then I opened Thunderbird and added the new account again, it loaded as expected and all went well. I closed Thunderbird and after waiting briefly opened it again...but the new account did not appear. My other two were there and working as usual. </p>",bgaden3,false,0,0
