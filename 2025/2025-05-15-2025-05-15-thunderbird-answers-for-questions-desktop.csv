Do you see more than one profile shown?  - if yes, browse each one to see the size and date of the file named abook.sqlite - that is the addressbook.

To fix what you have, my guess is that your latest updated prefs-x.js has the content you want. So, delete all prefs files except the highest numbered one, and rename that one to prefs.js.  Based on feedback from others with the same problem, you may need to copy the highest-numbered prefs to a separate directory, rename it there to prefs.js, and then copy/paste into the profile. be sure thunderbird is NOT running during all of this.

Needless to say, make sure to keep a backup copy of the original prefs.js file. Also make sure to adjust profiles.ini accordingly. For some reason extensions can be disabled and grayed out after this. To fix this you can try to remove a simple extension which doesn't have it's own config. Restart Thunderbird and re-install the extension.

I do agree with a comment on one of the various threads on the subject that there really needs to be a simple ""Move to new machine"" script or a more hand-holding procedure that automates all this. Everyone moves machines every few years (I tend to hold out longer than most just because of this sort of thing but I finally maxed out with 9 years on my old machine!). And not everyone will be grep- and text-editor savvy these days. Just too many pieces of information scattered in many different places that all have to be coordinated manually for what should be a routine operation. </p><p>But good to have the reinforcement that someone else tried the same and ended up with the same conclusion.

For those who may come across this post in the future, I will point out that in prefs.js at least, each ""\"" in the pathname seems to appear as four (""\\\\"") -- multiple layers of escapes I guess.

You are on about Thunderbird specific features that were not in your webpage, like as if you are in the process of setting this up for the first time and trying to learn what you are doing.  But that is not the impression you gave with your initial post.  So I am still guessing about the level of support you need and even what you actually understand about Thunderbird, or have read for yourself.    See this article on the global inbox <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unify-your-pop-email-accounts-global-inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unify-your-pop-email-accounts-global-inbox</a>   </p><p>The <a href=""https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/tldr-TLDR"" rel=""nofollow"">tl;dr </a>is Account settings &gt; server settings &gt; advanced. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-05-16-17-47-48-955ba4.png""> </p><p>Note that changing this at this late stage will make the entire account and it's folders along with their contents disappear from the folder pane as the account is now in the global inbox.  So do not go setting it for account that have mails you want to keep in them.  Move the mail to local folders first. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
