My suggestion is to dig into profiles to see if an older profile is present. Try these steps:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down left side to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - you are now in the profile. click the 'back' arrow to go back one more folder - you should now be in the ....thunderbird\profiles folder. Do you see more than one profile shown?  - if yes, browse each one to see the size and date of the file named abook.sqlite - that is the addressbook. If you find one that was updated recently, that may be it. Look also in the Imapmail folder if you had an iMAP account and in the Mail folder if you had a POP account.  - if you see the missing data, report back and we can try next steps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To fix what you have, my guess is that your latest updated prefs-x.js has the content you want. So, delete all prefs files except the highest numbered one, and rename that one to prefs.js.  Based on feedback from others with the same problem, you may need to copy the highest-numbered prefs to a separate directory, rename it there to prefs.js, and then copy/paste into the profile. be sure thunderbird is NOT running during all of this. Do let me know results, as that helps when advising other users. Thank you </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You can indeed use a text editor and do a search and replace of the existing path G:\tanguero88\Mail\Thunderbird\\Profiles\p271pzrc.default with the new one. Needless to say, make sure to keep a backup copy of the original prefs.js file. Also make sure to adjust profiles.ini accordingly. For some reason extensions can be disabled and grayed out after this. To fix this you can try to remove a simple extension which doesn't have it's own config. Restart Thunderbird and re-install the extension. You may need to restart Thunderbird twice after this, to get all installed extensions operational again. </p><p>I did this successfully multiple times on a Linux machine, and I wouldn't expect this being any different on Windows. </p>",christ1,false,1,0

I do agree with a comment on one of the various threads on the subject that there really needs to be a simple ""Move to new machine"" script or a more hand-holding procedure that automates all this. Everyone moves machines every few years (I tend to hold out longer than most just because of this sort of thing but I finally maxed out with 9 years on my old machine!). And not everyone will be grep- and text-editor savvy these days. Just too many pieces of information scattered in many different places that all have to be coordinated manually for what should be a routine operation. </p><p>But good to have the reinforcement that someone else tried the same and ended up with the same conclusion. And thanks too for the tips on getting the extensions to work (I use extensions more on Firefox than on Thunderbird so not a deal-breaker for me anyway). </p><p>I will mark this ""solved"" since I think between the info in my post and your reply (and the basic information from the link included), it pretty much sums it up. For those who may come across this post in the future, I will point out that in prefs.js at least, each ""\"" in the pathname seems to appear as four (""\\\\"") -- multiple layers of escapes I guess.
