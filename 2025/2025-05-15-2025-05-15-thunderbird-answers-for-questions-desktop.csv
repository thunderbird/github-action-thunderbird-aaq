What you are describing is a situation where thunderbird is being prevented from shutting down successfully. That is when the prefs.js file in the profile is updated with all updates from current execution. It might also be a situation where the prefs.js is read-only. If you browse the profile and see multiple instances of the prefs.js, that is also an indication of interference during shutdown. Please post results. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

There are 40 prefs files in my profile folder, all dated more than a year ago but the problem only appeared this week after I added the new email account. I have had McAfee installed and operating for several years with no problem but I don't know how to check if it is interfering.  I don't have a vpn turned on.  Any suggestions? </p>",bgaden3,false,0,0
