This is common because Verizon email is now handled through AOL/Yahoo, and they require either OAuth2 or an app password. </p><p>Let's try this: </p> <ul><li>     Open Thunderbird </li><li>     Go to Menu &gt; Account Settings </li><li>     Under your Verizon account, go to Server Settings </li><li>     Set Authentication Method to OAuth2 </li><li>     Scroll down to Outgoing Server (SMTP), select the Verizon SMTP server, click Edit </li><li>     Set Authentication Method there to OAuth2 as well </li><li>     Restart Thunderbird </li><li>     You should get a Yahoo/AOL login window </li><li>     Sign in with your full Verizon email address and approve Thunderbird access </li></ul> <p>If that works, you're done. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0

This [trouble writing to the folder] can happen if: </p><p>1.     You're running Thunderbird from a USB drive or restricted location </p><p>2.    The profile folder is read-only or permission-locked </p><p>3.    Security software is interfering with Thunderbird's ability to save files </p><p>Are any of these occurring in your environment? </p>,Thundamike,false,0,0

There are a number of troubleshooting steps we can take to find out why. If there is an error message that occurs, please provide that error message in your response. </p><p>Are you using IMAP or POP3? This will determine if you can retrieve the old emails off of the mail server or not. </p><p>If the issue occurs in Thunderbird on a new computer and you still have access to the old computer, the old profile folder can be added with <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_restoring-a-profile-backup"" rel=""nofollow"">these instructions</a>. More info on backing up and restoring profiles is also available in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">Move Thunderbird data to a new computer</a> and <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">Profiles</a> support articles. </p><p>To prevent this from happening again and when using IMAP, you can check ""Synchronization &amp; Storage"" in the account settings for the affected account and click the ""Advanced"" button to see if all of the folders are selected to be synchronized and kept on the local computer. More info on this can be found in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization"" rel=""nofollow"">IMAP Synchronization</a> article. </p><p>If the issue is about not receiving any email, please see the <a href=""/en-US/kb/cannot-receive-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">Cannot receive messages</a> article for more help. </p><p>I hope this helps. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0
