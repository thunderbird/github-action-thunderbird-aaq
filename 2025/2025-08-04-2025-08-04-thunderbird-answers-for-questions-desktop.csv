At that point I felt that Thunderbird was probably being applied in a load environment that it wasn't well tested for, and that's where I departed to other solution. </p><p>Thanks again for your suggestions for this project! </p><p>Dave </p>",wb0gaz,false,0,0

But regardless, if had realized you're primary goal was copying or moving message rather than delete, I would have suggested using filters, which would be a much smoother process than drag and drop. </p>",wsmwk,false,0,0

It was that encounter (after first encountering a 10K limit that turns out would be solved by using a different IMAP server address than the one auto provisioned by Thunderbird), combined with problems in Yahoo's webmail environment itself (could not filter/select subsets of the giant inbox to cleave it into smaller folders) means my definition-of-problem was changing in real time. I didn't use drag/drop at any point, and I didn't use filters in Thunderbird (learning curve fail on my part), but I did use highlight swaths of emails and right click context menu to initiate move-to (which didn't behave as expected.) </p><p>Anyway, the email client I'm now using (EmClient) handled the &gt;100K inbox count (so greatly simplified maniulation of the giant folder) and hasn't (at least so far) exhibited stability issues I encountered with Thunderbird in handling very large email counts. As I suspect my use case is not typical (giant email folders resulted from growing accustomed to searching for emails rather than pre-organizing in folders) and my timeframe also is atypical (under the gun due to Yahoo), I really can't fault Thunderbird nor the very helpful people that offered support here! </p><p>So, thanks again for your time and efforts on behalf of my self-imposed task! </p><p>Dave </p>",wb0gaz,false,0,0
