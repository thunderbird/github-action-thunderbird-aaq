I added an account for an email address on an external email server to the Outlook app on my laptop. Then in Outlook I created folders for that email. It isn't an Outlook email address as such. But as Outlook has limited forwarding and filtering without paying a subscription, I decided to try Thunderbird. (I hope this is making sense and that I've got the terminology correct.) I downloaded and installed Thunderbird and created an account for the same email address on the external email server. I now realise that as Thunderbird is reading the email from the server not from Outlook, of course the folders haven't copied over. I tried your suggestion using subscribe but this naturally only picks up the folders on the server, which are the standard built-in folders.  Given the situation, I suspect that there's no way to get the folders from Outlook. Or is there? </p>",ayyaesika,false,0,0

However, none of the folders I created in Outlook have been copied over. Only the standard built-in folders e.g inbox, junk, sent etc were setup in Thunderbolt with all the mail from the other folders in the inbox. This is not very helpful.   How do I set up the Thunderbolt account so that the folders (and contents) are matched with the folders (and contents) in Outlook? Thanks </blockquote> <p>Hey, sounds like your account might be set up as POP instead of IMAP in Thunderbird. POP doesn’t sync folders just pulls everything into the inbox. Try removing the account and re-adding it as IMAP. That should mirror your Outlook folders properly. </p>",helpemailtales1,false,0,0

Thanks to your help, I managed to export a clean Thunderbird address book and massaged my Outlook exported .csv file to match.

None of the group addresses from Outlook were preserved; however I recreated them in Thunderbird using Thunderbird's tools. My problem is I don't know how to copy (export/import) them to my second computer. All of my addresses are in the Thunderbird personal address book and I made group addresses in the personal address book. These groups are now listed with an indent under the personal address book. When I select (click on) a group I see the members of the group. When I click on the personal address book I see the group names mingled (alphabetically) with the individuals in the address book. The group names include a symbol indicating multiple people (2 people). I have tested this personal address book and found that sending email to the group addresses works. The problem is trying to replicate this personal address book on my second computer. None of the group names or subdirectories show up when I export the functioning personal address book from the first computer and import it to the second computer. When I export the subdirectories (groups) and import them to the personal address book of the second computer they don't show up as subdirectories or group names in the second computer. What does happen is every name in every group shows up multiple times in the second computer's personal address book and none of the group names show up (either as entries in the personal address book or as subdirectories under personal address book).

I'm stil not happy with what is happening in my personal address book. I did not follow David's adivce to replace the second computer's Thunderbird appdata using a copy from the first computer. Instead I uninstalled Thunderbird from the second computer and re-installed it using the installer downloaded from Mozzilla's website - just to make sure I had the right stuff. I had to enter all three email accounts to start using it. Then I exported the personal address book from the first computer into an ldif file and using a thumbdrive imported the personal addresses to the second computer. Everthing seemed good including a handfull of group address lists. Then I tried to correct (edit) a person's bad email address. After opening the contact for editing I noticed that the person's first name was improperly a plumbing company - also a contact. I had seen a disconnect before and tried to export this messed-up address book to a csv file to investigate using Excel. I wanted these Thunderbird files to be in a folder on my thumbdrive. When I selected the folder it got erased - along with all other files in the folder. I eventually exported the csv file and discovered the first names were correct for about 20 lines then there was a disconnect where the first names were offset one line above the last names. I must have overlooked an issue with the origonal outlook address book when it was massaged into a Thunderbird shape. These improper first names do not appear to affect email - I don't think they are used. Both computers had the offset first names. It seems as if the ldif file export /import includes the group lists where the csv file only includes individuals. Should I use the ldif export/import to keep both computers address books synchronized? </p><p>Thanks, Steve </p>",stevet2486,false,0,0

That guarantees 100% compatibility. exporting to other formats always introduces the possibility of errors. Do that for the abook.sqlite and the history.sqlite. Moving addressbooks is really a simple matter and only gets complex when exporting. My original suggestion of copying is what I do, as that uses windows file explorer and I know I'll get a perfect copy. For future reference, reinstalling thunderbird never makes issues simpler. Copying the profile would have had all the accounts ready for you.  </p><p>To share what I do: as a volunteer here, I run four copies of thunderbird. when I update one, I go to profile, copy the abook.sqlite and then paste it into the profiles of the other three.
