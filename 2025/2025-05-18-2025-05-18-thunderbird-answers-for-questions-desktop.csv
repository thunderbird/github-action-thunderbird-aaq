I added an account for an email address on an external email server to the Outlook app on my laptop. Then in Outlook I created folders for that email. It isn't an Outlook email address as such. But as Outlook has limited forwarding and filtering without paying a subscription, I decided to try Thunderbird. (I hope this is making sense and that I've got the terminology correct.) I downloaded and installed Thunderbird and created an account for the same email address on the external email server. I now realise that as Thunderbird is reading the email from the server not from Outlook, of course the folders haven't copied over. I tried your suggestion using subscribe but this naturally only picks up the folders on the server, which are the standard built-in folders.  Given the situation, I suspect that there's no way to get the folders from Outlook. Or is there? </p>",ayyaesika,false,0,0
