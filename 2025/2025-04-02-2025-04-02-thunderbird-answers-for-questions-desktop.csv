For her, I located a new copy Version 13 (but several years old) on ebay and she's very happy. I just checked and prices go from $30 on up. I suggest buying an unopened one, and I think they come with microphones, but possibly not needed with newer PCs that have them built in.

You would need to: Exit Thunderbird. Uninstall Thunderbird. Access Thunderbird profile name folder and delete the 'compatibility.ini' file. Reinstall the desired version eg: Use the link above but choose the Channel 'Thunderbird Extended Support Release'  which I think is still using version 128.9.1esr Then start Thunderbird and it should pick up everything. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
