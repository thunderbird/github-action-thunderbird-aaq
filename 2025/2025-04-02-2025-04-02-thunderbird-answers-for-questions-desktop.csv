A disabled woman in early 80s needed voice to text and I installed for her and she just starts Dragon software, starts thunderbird, clicks the 'new message' button and starts talking. For her, I located a new copy Version 13 (but several years old) on ebay and she's very happy. I just checked and prices go from $30 on up. I suggest buying an unopened one, and I think they come with microphones, but possibly not needed with newer PCs that have them built in. As a tip, her only problem was to click the voice-to-text feature OFF when not dictating, as Dragon keeps on typing...&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have been on the phone with Nuance support a number of times but only yesterday did they finally own up the Dragon does not support Thunderbird, and thus there is no fix.  There is also no other voice-to-text software that I have been able to find to work with Thunderbird, so a great deal of frustration for someone who spends a large part of every day dictating into documents and emails!

Please check that Avast is not adding it's own info to your outgoing mail. This would be a setting in Avast. To fully check you do not have any AV product interfering - start up computer in 'Safe Mode with Networking' - you will need to connect your computer to router using an ethernet cable to do this. Then start start up Thunderbird and try to send.  </p><p>You could be on a server block due to too many emails being sent - server spam filter may have your IP listed as sending spam.
