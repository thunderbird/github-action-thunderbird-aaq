You might need to go into webmail using a web browser and actually delete some stuff and empty the trash to free up some space, or if your provider offers the option you might be able to buy or rent more space so you do not have to delete anything. </p><p>Regardless this is an issue with your mail provider refusing to allow you to get mail until you have free space on their mail server to hold it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

A disabled woman in early 80s needed voice to text and I installed for her and she just starts Dragon software, starts thunderbird, clicks the 'new message' button and starts talking. For her, I located a new copy Version 13 (but several years old) on ebay and she's very happy. I just checked and prices go from $30 on up. I suggest buying an unopened one, and I think they come with microphones, but possibly not needed with newer PCs that have them built in. As a tip, her only problem was to click the voice-to-text feature OFF when not dictating, as Dragon keeps on typing...&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
