A disabled woman in early 80s needed voice to text and I installed for her and she just starts Dragon software, starts thunderbird, clicks the 'new message' button and starts talking. For her, I located a new copy Version 13 (but several years old) on ebay and she's very happy. I just checked and prices go from $30 on up. I suggest buying an unopened one, and I think they come with microphones, but possibly not needed with newer PCs that have them built in. As a tip, her only problem was to click the voice-to-text feature OFF when not dictating, as Dragon keeps on typing...&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
