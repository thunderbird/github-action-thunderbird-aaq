I do not see an actual explicit statement as to the error message, just several general statements that things are not working. </p><p>In your initial posting you stated you had the same issue as that poster,  if that is the case fill in the form and click allow.  That was his problem,  he did not want to do that.  I assume you have a similar issue,  but I really do not see you describe anywhere what it is or how you got the this point.  Is this your first use of Thunderbird for instance? or are you trying to fix something that broke? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

But, clicking Allow does not result in any activity from Gmail to Thunderbird. After a couple minutes, I get a message the POP server has timed out. Clicking Account Permission only produces an empty window. I don't get any Sign In display as I've seen in other discussion threads discussing this Oauth problem. </p><p>I followed the suggestions mentioned in the 'Automatic Conversion...'as I noted in my initial post above. It states there should be an oauth entry in the Saved Login screens. It is never populated. I presume there's supposed to a transmission back from Gmail Workspace that puts an entry there. </p><p>Note the comment in my initial post: 'An idiosyncrasy is I'm the domain administrator for a ""Free Legacy Edition of G Suite for personal use"".' Google Workspace administrators shut me out of an older version of Microsoft Outlook a couple weeks ago. I've downloaded Thunderbird with its Oauth2 capability to recover my Email functionality. </p>",larrygad,false,0,0

If a scam email has an attachment, never open it - do not be curious. If email contains any links do not click on them. You can always check a link by hovering over it and the real link is shown in the bottom Status Bar. Thunderbird by default does not allow any 'remote content', so it will not link to anything unless you disable the block on remote content. Emails are safe providing you do not allow remote content and do not open attachments and links. </p><p><strong>How to attach an email as either .eml or text file to your own email.</strong> </p><p>You can 'attach' the email as a .eml to your own email that you are sending.  Open a new Write message and enter info etc. Then left click on spam email and hold down to grab and drag over to the 'Write' compose window and it will get added as an attachment when you release the mouse. </p><p>Alternatively - if they do not like .eml attachments, right click on spam email and select 'Save as' and then for 'Save as  type' choose 'Text files (-.txt, *.text)' Select to save to easy location such as desktop.
