But regardless of attemts to get to the bottom of exactly what screens you see, the issue is most likely your antivirus product or it's software firewall or even your VPN.  All of those things cause issues for Gmail users.  Especially the VPN part these days.  VPN's are rarely set up with email and anti hacking safe guards such as Google use in mind.   </p><p>The authentication flow for oauth is susceptible to locally installed web servers and development environments and antivirus products that think the localhost is theirs to block.  Once about 20 or 30 years ago malware used localhost to send mail as an SMTP server.  SOme products are still carrying on as if spam was still an issue from malware.  It is not. Ransomware, hacking and stollen identities is the items of risk today,  not some 30 years old malware sending penis enlergement emails that get blocked at point of receipt because the sender fails reverse DNS lookups, DMARK, DKM,SPF etc. </p><p>You are asking folks that have no issues to help you figure out what is unique about your setup, without actually saying what your setup is. </p> <em><p>larrygad <a href=""#answer-1730104"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>Checked Config preferences: 'network.http.windows-sso.enabled' set to false.

According to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/windows-sso"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/windows-sso</a> something irrelevant to Thunderbird. </p> <em><p>larrygad <a href=""#answer-1730079"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>Last night I sent a note to Google Workspace Support about this problem. No reply back received this morning.  Started Thunderbird, clicked Allow, and POP server timed out as described above. </blockquote> <p>The completion of the oAuth authentication flow and the pop server timing out are only vaguely related.  If you have no oAuth token it will time out after about 5 minutes  because Thunderbird can not respond to the request for the token.  But timeout can occur for many other reasons, including having the port blocked by a firewall. </p> <blockquote> Restarted Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode as suggested in another Oauth discussion thread to check Config Settings as noted there.

POP server timed out evidently because Gmail was not talking back. </blockquote> <p>And we are back to interference for an addon,  or more likely some code injected by your antivirus program.  Because there should be no request for further authentication when you return from troubleshooting mode.  Do you have an exception in your antivirus program for Thunderbird profile folder.  It sounds to me like something is blocking the saving of the password file when the program exists.  Something I have come to expect from these antivirus products that think every file write has to have their permission. </p> <blockquote> Turned Troubleshoot Mode back on and restarted. I didn't see any Credentials screen, so I clicked the Get Massages 'cloud'. A message popped up at the bottom of the Thunderbird screen saying 'No New Messages'.  Thanks again for feedback. </blockquote> <p>Yep, so it works in troubleshooting mode.  I have no idea what your expectations are,  but having completed the authentication flow you will have an oAuth token in the password manager and unless you have a VPN or something else that triggers Google you may not be asked for any sort of credential of a very long time.  It is over 12 months since I authorized anything. Google related in Thunderbird. </p><p>I would suggest you start by reviewing the addons installed in the Thunderbird addon manager.  Try disabling them all next time you start Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode and restarting and see if it still works.  If it does the path to determine what is the issue is simply to eliminate which is causing the issue by enabling them one at a time until it stops working again. </p><p>That does not exclude injected code from the antivirus.  They make grand claims sometimes about scam and spam management.  This is often done by injecting an addon into the running Thunderbird instance.  Just as malware does really, ignoring Thunderbirds interfaces and permissions.  Troubleshooting mode disables the addon interface  so the antivirus is the next thing to turn off if it is not an addon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Thanks. </blockquote> <p>The server receives emails because that's it's job, it would be a problem if it did not. Thunderbird access server and if you use a Pop account it will download whatever is in server Inbox to Pop account.  If you use an Imap account, all imap folders can only display whatever is on server. </p><p>You could try setting up something in Webmail account which filters all @gmail.com email addresses to Trash automatically. See info: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/spam-filters-and-email-blocking-new-experience"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/spam-filters-and-email-blocking-new-experience</a> </li></ul> <p>If you use a Pop account then you would not see them in Thunderbird, but if using Imap then obviously when Trash synchronises with server you will see them. However, Comcast uses Xfinity server which I believe auto removes emails from the Trash after 14 days. So a Pop account would never see those emails and you can sure they will get auto removed off the server after 14 days. </p><p>Alternative in Thunderbird: If all the incoming emails are incoming to the Inbox then you can create a Message Filter to put emails with a Gmail address in Trash. (I understand you have already tried that option) But, obviously if a contact you know then chooses to use a Gmail address you may need to rethink that strategy. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That means one single mbox text file document might contain hundreds of emails, each one appended to the file as they were written to it. Anti-Virus has no concept of this. They see it as one file and if anything in the file is a problem, it can try to fix or quarrantine or even completely empty all the contents. But the end result is the file gets corrupted or killed and you lose some or all emails in that file. </p><p>Any email you think is dodgy - if you delete it and then compact the folder, all traces of that email are gone so there is no need to scan anything.  </p><p>Scanning an mbox file is pointless as you have no idea whether the AV is picking up on a previously deleted email and traces still exist due to a lack of compacting OR if a dodgy email then you still do not which email. </p><p>If you do allow scanning - you must also set up to get AV to tell you there is a problem, but not auto fix - it must ask you  what to do. In which case, you make a note of the file and you say do not do anything. </p><p>Sometimes the AV is picking up an email already deleted, but traces still exist because the folder has not been compacted. So, first action is to compact the folders especially the Inbox and the Junk/Spam folder. </p><p>If you really need to check further, then this is a procedure I use which identifies a specific email. However, I must admit in all the decades I've used Thunderbird - compacting Inbox and Junk has always proved to be the best method of cleaning up rubbish.  But the following can help to identify a problem. </p> <ul><li> Create a folder on desktop called 'TB-Check' </li><li> In Thunderbird - select folder eg: Inbox </li><li> click on first email and then use 'Ctrl+A' to highlight all emails in folder </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails and choose 'Save as' </li><li> In pop up window - select 'Desktop' to see list of folders it contains and then select 'TB-Check' so name appears in the bottom 'Folder: text area' </li><li> click on 'Select folder' button </li><li> All highlighted emails in the folder will get exported as single .eml files into the 'TB-Check' folder. </li><li> Scan that 'TB-check' folder and see if he AV picks up on any file. </li></ul> <p>The difference is this - the *.eml files are individual emails, so now you have perfect control. Any particular email deemed as a no-go... Now you can go back into Thunderbird, locate that specific email in Inbox, delete it and then compact the Inbox to ensure all traces are gone. Finally go back to the 'TB-check' folder and delete the contents then empty the computer recycle bin to ensure all traces are gone or delete the bad eml file and then you have the choice to move all other .eml fles to a backup folder if required. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

When you use IMAP your messages are stored on the server of your email provider which has nothing to do with Thunderbird or Mozilla. With the IMAP protocol Thunderbird (or any other email client) reflects the situation on the sever like in a mirror, that means Thunderbird synchronises with the server. </p><p>With the POP protocol messages are stored locally on Thunderbird. When you download messages from the server Inbox they will be stored in your Thunderbird profile. According to your server settings in Thunderbird downloaded messages grosso modo may stay on the server or may be deleted from the sever immediately or after some time. </p><p>The fact that your Inbox shows only 7 messages may be caused by an erroneous choice of message view.  That's why I asked you whether you have activated the Quick Filter and now want to explain its use by an exemple: in my image I show an account Inbox which contains 122 messages. Now I activate the Quick Filter button ""<strong>Show only unread messages</strong>"" and the thread pane displays only 3 messages, because these are the unread messages of a total of 122 messages in Inbox. </p><p>I would like that you show a similar screen shot, so we can see whether you are a victim of this frequent ""view"" choice error. </p>",Mapenzi,false,1,0
