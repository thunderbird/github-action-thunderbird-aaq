But regardless of attemts to get to the bottom of exactly what screens you see, the issue is most likely your antivirus product or it's software firewall or even your VPN.  All of those things cause issues for Gmail users.  Especially the VPN part these days.  VPN's are rarely set up with email and anti hacking safe guards such as Google use in mind.   </p><p>The authentication flow for oauth is susceptible to locally installed web servers and development environments and antivirus products that think the localhost is theirs to block.  Once about 20 or 30 years ago malware used localhost to send mail as an SMTP server.  SOme products are still carrying on as if spam was still an issue from malware.  It is not. Ransomware, hacking and stollen identities is the items of risk today,  not some 30 years old malware sending penis enlergement emails that get blocked at point of receipt because the sender fails reverse DNS lookups, DMARK, DKM,SPF etc. </p><p>You are asking folks that have no issues to help you figure out what is unique about your setup, without actually saying what your setup is. </p> <em><p>larrygad <a href=""#answer-1730104"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>Checked Config preferences: 'network.http.windows-sso.enabled' set to false.

According to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/windows-sso"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/windows-sso</a> something irrelevant to Thunderbird. </p> <em><p>larrygad <a href=""#answer-1730079"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>Last night I sent a note to Google Workspace Support about this problem. No reply back received this morning.  Started Thunderbird, clicked Allow, and POP server timed out as described above. </blockquote> <p>The completion of the oAuth authentication flow and the pop server timing out are only vaguely related.  If you have no oAuth token it will time out after about 5 minutes  because Thunderbird can not respond to the request for the token.  But timeout can occur for many other reasons, including having the port blocked by a firewall. </p> <blockquote> Restarted Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode as suggested in another Oauth discussion thread to check Config Settings as noted there.

POP server timed out evidently because Gmail was not talking back. </blockquote> <p>And we are back to interference for an addon,  or more likely some code injected by your antivirus program.  Because there should be no request for further authentication when you return from troubleshooting mode.  Do you have an exception in your antivirus program for Thunderbird profile folder.  It sounds to me like something is blocking the saving of the password file when the program exists.  Something I have come to expect from these antivirus products that think every file write has to have their permission. </p> <blockquote> Turned Troubleshoot Mode back on and restarted. I didn't see any Credentials screen, so I clicked the Get Massages 'cloud'. A message popped up at the bottom of the Thunderbird screen saying 'No New Messages'.  Thanks again for feedback. </blockquote> <p>Yep, so it works in troubleshooting mode.  I have no idea what your expectations are,  but having completed the authentication flow you will have an oAuth token in the password manager and unless you have a VPN or something else that triggers Google you may not be asked for any sort of credential of a very long time.  It is over 12 months since I authorized anything. Google related in Thunderbird. </p><p>I would suggest you start by reviewing the addons installed in the Thunderbird addon manager.  Try disabling them all next time you start Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode and restarting and see if it still works.  If it does the path to determine what is the issue is simply to eliminate which is causing the issue by enabling them one at a time until it stops working again. </p><p>That does not exclude injected code from the antivirus.  They make grand claims sometimes about scam and spam management.  This is often done by injecting an addon into the running Thunderbird instance.  Just as malware does really, ignoring Thunderbirds interfaces and permissions.  Troubleshooting mode disables the addon interface  so the antivirus is the next thing to turn off if it is not an addon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If something goes wrong then you stand a good chance of losing emails. </p><p>Many people have an Anti-Virus and that AV will scan incoming files /emails and it will also scan any file that gets opened.  When  the AV is doing this Thunderbird temporarilly has no access to a file.  I would advise that you do not want any AV scanning your profile folders or their contents. Access AV and set up an exception to not scan your Thunderbird profile folder. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
