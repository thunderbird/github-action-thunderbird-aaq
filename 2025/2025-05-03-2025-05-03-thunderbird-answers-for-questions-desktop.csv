But regardless of attemts to get to the bottom of exactly what screens you see, the issue is most likely your antivirus product or it's software firewall or even your VPN.  All of those things cause issues for Gmail users.  Especially the VPN part these days.  VPN's are rarely set up with email and anti hacking safe guards such as Google use in mind.   </p><p>The authentication flow for oauth is susceptible to locally installed web servers and development environments and antivirus products that think the localhost is theirs to block.  Once about 20 or 30 years ago malware used localhost to send mail as an SMTP server.  SOme products are still carrying on as if spam was still an issue from malware.  It is not. Ransomware, hacking and stollen identities is the items of risk today,  not some 30 years old malware sending penis enlergement emails that get blocked at point of receipt because the sender fails reverse DNS lookups, DMARK, DKM,SPF etc. </p><p>You are asking folks that have no issues to help you figure out what is unique about your setup, without actually saying what your setup is. </p> <em><p>larrygad <a href=""#answer-1730104"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>Checked Config preferences: 'network.http.windows-sso.enabled' set to false.

According to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/windows-sso"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/windows-sso</a> something irrelevant to Thunderbird. </p> <em><p>larrygad <a href=""#answer-1730079"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>Last night I sent a note to Google Workspace Support about this problem. No reply back received this morning.  Started Thunderbird, clicked Allow, and POP server timed out as described above. </blockquote> <p>The completion of the oAuth authentication flow and the pop server timing out are only vaguely related.  If you have no oAuth token it will time out after about 5 minutes  because Thunderbird can not respond to the request for the token.  But timeout can occur for many other reasons, including having the port blocked by a firewall. </p> <blockquote> Restarted Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode as suggested in another Oauth discussion thread to check Config Settings as noted there.

Because there should be no request for further authentication when you return from troubleshooting mode.  Do you have an exception in your antivirus program for Thunderbird profile folder.  It sounds to me like something is blocking the saving of the password file when the program exists.  Something I have come to expect from these antivirus products that think every file write has to have their permission. </p> <blockquote> Turned Troubleshoot Mode back on and restarted. I didn't see any Credentials screen, so I clicked the Get Massages 'cloud'. A message popped up at the bottom of the Thunderbird screen saying 'No New Messages'.  Thanks again for feedback. </blockquote> <p>Yep, so it works in troubleshooting mode.  I have no idea what your expectations are,  but having completed the authentication flow you will have an oAuth token in the password manager and unless you have a VPN or something else that triggers Google you may not be asked for any sort of credential of a very long time.  It is over 12 months since I authorized anything. Google related in Thunderbird. </p><p>I would suggest you start by reviewing the addons installed in the Thunderbird addon manager.  Try disabling them all next time you start Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode and restarting and see if it still works.  If it does the path to determine what is the issue is simply to eliminate which is causing the issue by enabling them one at a time until it stops working again. </p><p>That does not exclude injected code from the antivirus.  They make grand claims sometimes about scam and spam management.  This is often done by injecting an addon into the running Thunderbird instance.  Just as malware does really, ignoring Thunderbirds interfaces and permissions.  Troubleshooting mode disables the addon interface  so the antivirus is the next thing to turn off if it is not an addon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You must use OAuth to let these apps and devices access your account. </em> </p><p>In Thunderbird, Pop accounts can also be set up to use Authentication Method: Oauth2. It's a very simple modification and Thunderbird set this up some time ago. </p><p>You may need to disable any program using localhost eg: Apache Xampp until all is set up. 1. Edit incoming and outgoing smtp 'Authentication Method' to use 'Oauth2' 2. In Thunderbird set up to allow cookies (Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security) 3.

Now I'm required to mirror both - which is not helpful to me.</em> </p><p>My previous comment was posted because it sounds like you really would prefer to use POP. I forget to say - do make sure you have enabled the POP option in the webmail account &gt; SEttings &gt; see all settings &gt; Forwarding Pop/IMAP </p><p>Do you still have the Pop gmail account in your Account SEttings&nbsp;? If you removed it, do you know that Thunderbird does not auto delete it from the Profile&nbsp;? That means if you did remove it from Account SEttings, then you can create a new pop account using correct settings and then simply alter the 'Account SEttings' &gt; 'Server Settings' &gt; 'Local directory:' to point to the original pop folders and all your emails. </p><p>IMAP is designed to only display whatever is on the server as seen when you logon to webmail account. So, each folder synchronises with the server everytime you access the folder and move an email. If you choose to 'move' an email out of an imap folder then it also means you are 'moving' emails off the server. If something goes wrong then you stand a good chance of losing emails. </p><p>Many people have an Anti-Virus and that AV will scan incoming files /emails and it will also scan any file that gets opened.  When  the AV is doing this Thunderbird temporarilly has no access to a file.  I would advise that you do not want any AV scanning your profile folders or their contents. Access AV and set up an exception to not scan your Thunderbird profile folder. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

When you use IMAP your messages are stored on the server of your email provider which has nothing to do with Thunderbird or Mozilla. With the IMAP protocol Thunderbird (or any other email client) reflects the situation on the sever like in a mirror, that means Thunderbird synchronises with the server. </p><p>With the POP protocol messages are stored locally on Thunderbird. When you download messages from the server Inbox they will be stored in your Thunderbird profile. According to your server settings in Thunderbird downloaded messages grosso modo may stay on the server or may be deleted from the sever immediately or after some time. </p><p>The fact that your Inbox shows only 7 messages may be caused by an erroneous choice of message view.  That's why I asked you whether you have activated the Quick Filter and now want to explain its use by an exemple: in my image I show an account Inbox which contains 122 messages. Now I activate the Quick Filter button ""<strong>Show only unread messages</strong>"" and the thread pane displays only 3 messages, because these are the unread messages of a total of 122 messages in Inbox. </p><p>I would like that you show a similar screen shot, so we can see whether you are a victim of this frequent ""view"" choice error. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
