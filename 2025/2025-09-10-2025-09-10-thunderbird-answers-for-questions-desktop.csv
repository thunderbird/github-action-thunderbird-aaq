If you want an account to have multiple identities, then you need to create additional entities for the account. Once done, Thunderbird will honor the identities.

For you account, if you go to settings&gt;privacy&amp;security and click saved passwords and then show passwords, you will be able to highlight the rows for the account and delete them. Then, when you next check for new mail, Thunderbird will prompt for the password. However, if you do not remember the password, you need to contact your email provider. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

From what you wrote, my inference is that you are attempting to create an account on a second PC, using the same password as on first PC. There are several email providers who do not allow the same password from multiple PCs (such as Gmaill). So, there is either a discrepancy in your setup or your account is with a provider who demands a unique id per PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
