The subject account is a Microsoft one, a work-related Outlook site that was functioning correctly in this regard up until a few days ago.  One of the other accounts I have is also a Microsoft one, but more of a 'consumer' (Hotmail) one, which may be different in that regard; it continues to work properly.  Anyhow, I'll open the Webmail access to the subject account and see how things are organized there.  Thanks much for the tip, and I'll report back here when I find out anything definitive. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

I'm using POP, not IMAP, so there's no 2-way communication when the program automatically downloads new mail; that is, I don't see how a change in the Microsoft (their server) account can change anything in Thunderbird. </p><p>What I have done, however, is to open the Thunderbird profiles to take a look at the two Microsoft accounts, thinking that there really should be no difference in how they are set up.  But there are differences.  The attached screenshots show the two accounts, and how there is no Junk folder under the second one.  Moreover, there is no Archive folder either, but then I've never archived anything in that account, so maybe Thunderbird didn't create one... yet.  Not sure how that works.  Anyhow, there must have been a Junk folder there at some point, because a few days ago it was working.  I wonder if I can create (just manually add) a Junk folder in that tree?  I am loathe to do that for fear of really screwing something up. </p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:  Physician, heal thyself. Well, for some strange reason, the Junk folder magically reappeared, although the icon for the one account was the wrong color.  I clicked on Default for the color, under Properties, which turned the little color sample box gold, but made the icon in the left pane red, just like the other two accounts.  There was a bogus junk message in the re-created Junk folder; bogus, in that it opened a totally blank message pane, and I could not delete the message, that made Thunderbird crash.  But a quick Repair, under Properties, took care of that issue so now it's all working just as it should again.  Must have been some Artificial Intelligence 'bot' that took temporary residence in Thunderbird.  I dunno. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

If you have those email addresses being collected into a main account, then setting each 'alias' email address as an 'identity' in the account will faciliate sending using the email address. </p><p>The alternative is to set up those different alias email addresses as mail accounts in Thunderbird where they appear as a separate mail account in Folder Pane with their own set of folders Then any emails sent to that email address will end up in their own mail account, so a reply would auto use that email address as the From. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Aliases, unlike identities, are zero setup. Whenever you send email you just add a hyphen and a made up alias to the first part of your email address. That way you can have completely separate email addresses for whoever you send them to. If you first have to create and identity, then what is the point of having aliases?  </p><p>And again, the developers understand that which is why in the new message window the dropdown menu under ""from"" shows ""customize from address.."" This is where the alias gets typed. Zero setup. It is perfect, except replying defaults to the main (unaliased) email address, which is the whole topic of this post. </p><p>And honestly, I do not see how it ever can be useful to not reply from the same email address (alias) that and email was sent to. If I give someone an email address (or aliased email address) to email me at, I ALWAYS want to reply to them with the same email address. This is why I call it a bug.  This app is close to perfection, if it only would always put the correct from address, the address the mail I am replying to was sent to, in the from field.
