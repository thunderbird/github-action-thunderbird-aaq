I have been happily using an older version of TB because it supports my add-ons and themes. Now because of your uninvited intrusion they no longer work. Furthermore it seems that I can no longer download an older version that supports my requirements. NOT HAPPY! </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",adastron

This is very annoying, especially when trying to write a new message (or even while commenting here in the Ideas panel).  My main account is on a Microsoft Exchange service, so I need to use the OWL add-in but the delays also seem to occur when accessing gmail.  The other ""feature"" which seems to have changed is inbox defaulting to top then running through to end when sorted with most recent at bottom.  I have now reversed to have most recent on top, which seems to have resolved, but this was also annoying.  Attempted to resolve by clearing 1 GB from cache and archiving about 15K conversations - but interruptions not significantly improved.  Until a few days ago Thunderbird seemed to run without any problems.  Any suggestions? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",richard29
