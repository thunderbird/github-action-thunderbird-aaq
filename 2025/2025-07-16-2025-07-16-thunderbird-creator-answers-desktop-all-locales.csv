This is very annoying, especially when trying to write a new message (or even while commenting here in the Ideas panel).  My main account is on a Microsoft Exchange service, so I need to use the OWL add-in but the delays also seem to occur when accessing gmail.  The other ""feature"" which seems to have changed is inbox defaulting to top then running through to end when sorted with most recent at bottom.  I have now reversed to have most recent on top, which seems to have resolved, but this was also annoying.  Attempted to resolve by clearing 1 GB from cache and archiving about 15K conversations - but interruptions not significantly improved.  Until a few days ago Thunderbird seemed to run without any problems.  Any suggestions? </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,1749698;1749709;1749778;,richard29

However, when we enable “Synchronize the most recent 1 month” in Account Settings → Synchronization &amp; Storage, Thunderbird begins syncing from the oldest messages in the account (starting in 2008), rather than downloading the most recent month (e.g., June 15 – July 15, 2025). </p><p>My questions: Is there any way to configure Thunderbird to download and store only the latest (by date) 30 days of IMAP messages? </p><p>Alternatively, is there a way to use the WebExtension API to access the full content of recent IMAP messages without syncing the entire history? </p><p>I'm currently using Thunderbird 128.11.0esr on Linux (MATE desktop). </p><p>Any advice or workarounds would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,"",sblazie
