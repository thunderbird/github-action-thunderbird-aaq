The emails to my <a href=""http://mailfence.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mailfence.com</a> email address came into my *iphone* just fine; just not into Thunderbird, which is on my PC.  They used to come in fine into my PC's Thunderbird app for the last few years. </p><p>Turns out, I THINK, the culprit was that I had *thought* I was clicking the old ""Get Messages"" button, but that button WASN'T EVEN AT THAT SPOT anymore!  Instead, I was mistakenly clicking the ""Mail"" icon, thinking it was the ""Get Messages"" icon, or at least that it was serving the same purpose as the old Get Messages icon used to give me. </p><p>Somehow I just now saw a bunch of emails to my <a href=""http://mailfence.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mailfence.com</a> email address come into Thunderbird, from my recent various experiments.  Not sure how I did that; maybe clicking the ""Mail"" icon does in fact serve as a ""Get Messages"" icon? </p><p>Get a load of the attached screengrab, and you'll see my confusion: (1) There is no longer a ""Get Messages"" button at the upper left. (2) AND, there's no File Edit View bar of tabs at the very top like there used to be!  The File Home View you see in this screengrab is from the PAINT app, I believe. I realized this problem by looking up in Thunderbird Support how to get ""Get Messages"" back and saw a screengrab that had File Edit View, that I then realized I was missing. </p><p>Thanks for any help getting me back my File Edit View and my Get Messages button. If you see other problems in this figure please I'd appreciate your letting me know how to fix that, too! </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",alysenet1
