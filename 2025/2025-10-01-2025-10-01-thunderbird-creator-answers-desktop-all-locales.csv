The emails to my <a href=""http://mailfence.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mailfence.com</a> email address came into my *iphone* just fine; just not into Thunderbird, which is on my PC.  They used to come in fine into my PC's Thunderbird app for the last few years. </p><p>Turns out, I THINK, the culprit was that I had *thought* I was clicking the old ""Get Messages"" button, but that button WASN'T EVEN AT THAT SPOT anymore!  Instead, I was mistakenly clicking the ""Mail"" icon, thinking it was the ""Get Messages"" icon, or at least that it was serving the same purpose as the old Get Messages icon used to give me. </p><p>Somehow I just now saw a bunch of emails to my <a href=""http://mailfence.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mailfence.com</a> email address come into Thunderbird, from my recent various experiments.  Not sure how I did that; maybe clicking the ""Mail"" icon does in fact serve as a ""Get Messages"" icon? </p><p>Get a load of the attached screengrab, and you'll see my confusion: (1) There is no longer a ""Get Messages"" button at the upper left. (2) AND, there's no File Edit View bar of tabs at the very top like there used to be!  The File Home View you see in this screengrab is from the PAINT app, I believe. I realized this problem by looking up in Thunderbird Support how to get ""Get Messages"" back and saw a screengrab that had File Edit View, that I then realized I was missing. </p><p>Thanks for any help getting me back my File Edit View and my Get Messages button. If you see other problems in this figure please I'd appreciate your letting me know how to fix that, too! </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1768816;,alysenet1

I have a problem sending to one person on my contact list (who has an AOL email address). </p><p>As a workaround I can go into my Thunderbird Account Setting and change the Outgoing SMTP servers, send to the AOL addressee, then reset the Outgoing SMTP servers to their original setting.  I wondered if there was any option withing the New Message creation to temporarily select an alternative SMTP server to use for that email only? </p><p>The background is:- - Many years ago some ISPs (mainly <a href=""http://BT.com"" rel=""nofollow"">BT.com</a>) rejected emails sent via the servers of my email hosting company. - In order to get around this I started using Gmail outgoing servers, with my Gmail settings masking the Gmail ID so that any recipients saw emails as from MYNAME@MYDOMAIN.COM. This has worked perfectly for many years (probably 10+ years). - Very recently I have a new contact with an <a href=""http://AOL.COM"" rel=""nofollow"">AOL.COM</a> email address, and AOL is blocking my emails to him and sending me a rejection notice with references to DKIM &amp; SPF failures (to be honest that means nothing to me and is beyond my technical know-how). - Ironically I found by trial and error that if I change my Thunderbird Outgoing Server to my own ISP Servers then AOL accepts my emails. I would like this to be a little bit simpler as I cannot get AOL to give me any useful suggestions. </p><p>Many thanks for any ideas. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1768804;,redhouse
