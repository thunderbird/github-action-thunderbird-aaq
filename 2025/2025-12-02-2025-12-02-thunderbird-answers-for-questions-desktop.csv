You may have more success with the Account Hub after all. Sorry if I steered you wrong. </p><p>If you have to set up the account manually, you should be able to get all the needed information from Godaddy.

Have you tried that approach? </p><p>We also have a preference in that version which allows more granular Oauth configurations to be specified, but I don't think that is necessary. </p><p>Please feel free to email me directly for any help with specific settings or continue the conversation here so other can learn from our ""exchange"". </p><p>Cheers </p>",tobypilling,false,1,0
