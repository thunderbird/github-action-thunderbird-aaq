The error/warning I get is as follows: Thunderbird, The IMAP server Kingston does not seem to support encrypted passwords. If you just set up this account, please try changing to&nbsp;:Normal password"" as the Authentication method in the account setting... It stops there. When I send, it does not want to save to my sent file, and I get this warning all the time. I went to settings and SMTP server has ""Normal password"" in the settings. I have restarted several times but no luck. Ideas? Solution?
