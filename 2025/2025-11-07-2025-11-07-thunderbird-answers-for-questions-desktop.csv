So it was easy to think this was the case, but after further investigation and info supplied by you, it became clear the reason for not seeing Local Folders was because your Account Settings were messed up and not pointing to the correct location. The reason you had a problem with no Local Folders displaying was simply because the 'Local Folders' in Computer User account 'iliop' was pointing to a Local Folders in a completely different User Account called 'ilio pieroni'. </p><p>It was not due to a bug.  Or if the bug exists, it was not manifesting in your case because your settings were wrong, so impossible to tell. </p><p>It would be helpful if you selected my previous comment which stated how to change where the Local Folders was pointing to as the 'Chosen Solution'. As this solved the original question regarding the empty Local Folders. </p><p><strong>re: The other folder 9dtmj... is %.48 GB, what is in it, all my emails?.</strong> </p><p>I think that's a typo&nbsp;:) You meant 5.48GB </p><p>The image you posted showing profiles '9dtm....' and 'vn35....' are in an entirely different computer User Name account called 'ilio pieroni' - not 'iliop'. </p><p>5.48GB is the entire profile, not just emails, it includes addons, preferences, mail accounts, emails, address books, calendar etc etc etc. There are many reasons for a profile appearing larger than another. It may include non compacted files, so basically it may include previously deleted but hidden emails which make files appear larger. If you are using an IMAP account and it's been used all the time no matter what profile name then whatever is on the server would be displayed exactly the same. No change at all.  What is also not known is whether there are a load of junk/spam or Trash emails in one account but not in another. What is not known are the differences in Synchronisation &amp; Storage settings. It's possible you have a full copy download of everything for offline/backup use in one profile and something different in another profile. It's possible you have a load of mozmsg in one account - that's just stuff used by a windows search and not Thunderbird, but it can increase overall size.  Maybe a compact failed in one profile,s o you end up with additional nsmtp files.  If you use a gmail email address or a server hat uses the same labels format, then seeing 'All Mail' in one profile, but not in the other will make it virtually double in size.  </p><p>I could go on listing all the various things that can increase size in one profile but not in another. </p><p>If you have an Imap account for your email address, then it will not make any difference because you can only see whatever is on server. </p><p>As you can see there are many reasons. We would need to see the list of files in a mail account name folder. So in profile 9dtmj.....then select 'ImapMail' - select mail account name folder They must be displayed as a list - not icons - it usually called 'View = Details' and displays in columns. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That's because you started Thunderbird in a different User Account and it created new profiles. The Imap account would be the same because it only shows what is on the server.  But there's nothing in the Local Folders because you never put anything in it. Local Folders is very specific. It does not synchronise to any server. It is specific to a profile name folder. </p><p>If you logged on to the 'Ilio Pieroni' User Account and moved emails off the imap server and put them into 'Local Folders', then the next time you log on to a different user account 'iliop' those moved emails will disappear from your Imap account because you moved them off server, but they would not appear in Local Folders, because you did not put them in that folder in that profile in that User Account. In effect you would have lost emails from that profile. </p><p>I would strongly advise that you use only one computer 'User Account' to see emails using Thunderbird and that User Account  is 'iliop'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

There is no such thing as a Thunderbird account. But there is a Thunderbird email client program. In Thunderbird, you create a 'mail account' for a specific email address which you have already acquired on another server eg: gmail. All data, preferences, mail accounts, emails, address books, calendar etc are stored in a profile. A Profile can contain many mail accounts. </p><p>As I understand it, you deleted a gmail Mail Account from your Thunderbird email client. But you seem to still be getting a request to allow an Oauth login in order to reconnect to gmail server. </p><p>This sounds like you still have a stored password for that 'deleted' gmail account. In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Scroll down to 'Passwords' section </li><li> click on 'Saved Passwords' </li></ul> <p>You should see an 'Oauth://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> line for the gmail email address account which you deleted. You may also see an smtp://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> line for same gmail email address. </p> <ul><li> Select each line in turn and click on 'Remove'. </li></ul> <p>Check you no longer have any lines in that saved password section which mention the Username = the deleted gmail email address. </p> <ul><li> click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p>Exit Thunderbird wait a few moments whilst Thunderbird updates files, then restart.

Thunderbird as any other email client can only download whatever is on server.  POP accounts only get access to server 'Inbox' to download whatever is in server 'Inbox' and put it in pop account 'Inbox'. So anything the server puts in server 'Spam' folder will never get downloaded to a Pop account.  IMAP accounts can subscribe to see server folders and as they synchronise with server folders, the imap folders will display whatever is on server and that includes the Spam folder. </p><p>Thunderbird can filter unwanted mail and do whatever you tell it to do eg: put in Spam or directly into the Trash/Deleted folder.  </p><p>Thunderbird has no control over the server.  The server accepts any email sent to you because that is it's purpose. However, you may be able to logon to your webmail account and set up to block a sender. </p><p>I have done this in my Gmail webmail account, but even the server will put all blocked senders into the server Spam folder. </p><p>There are some programs that can act like a 'middle-man'. There are people who use such programs to act like a filter between server and your email client - aka Thunderbird. As an example: <a href=""https://mailwasher.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mailwasher.net/</a> I'm not able to advocate the 'Mailwasher' program as I do use it. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
