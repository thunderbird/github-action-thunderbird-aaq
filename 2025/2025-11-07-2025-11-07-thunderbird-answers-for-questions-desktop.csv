If you do not close those tabs then the session remembers what was left open as according to your instructions and it attempts to keep them open. </p><p>This is not something to complain about. It's your actions that determine whether something opens in a tab or not. It's also your actions that determine whether to close a tab or not.  However, it seems you are not understanding why it's occurring in the first place. Wanting to complain to the developers is a bit like you wanting to complain to the London Mayor because you bought too many packets of frozen peas in Tescos.  So this is the forum where you ask about issues you do not understand or need help to sort things out. In that respect, you are in the correct place. So let's try to get you sorted. </p><p><strong>What can cause emails to open in tabs:</strong> If you have the 'Message Pane' enabled, then a single left click will open the selected email and display it below the Message List in the 'Message Pane'. If you double click on an email then that is the instruction to open the email in a 'Tab' by default. </p><p>In the Message List: </p> <ul><li> If you use 'threading' of emails and a thread is in a 'collapsed' state, you will see a chevron &gt; just to the left of the Subject. </li><li> If you do a single left click on a collapsed thread then it will display X number of Conversations in the 'Message Pane'. </li><li> If you do a double click on a collapsed thread then that is the instruction to open all emails that are a part of that thread and open each of them in a new tab. </li><li> If you clickon the chevron &gt; then it will expand the thread revealing all emails contained therein. This means you can then clickon a single email to see it's contents in the 'Message Pane' or do a double click to open that specific email in a new tab. </li><li> In all cases you can right click on an email and select 'Open' and it will offer various choices. </li></ul> <p><br> <strong>To close tabs:</strong> To close just one tab you can click on that tab's 'x' icon General option: Right click on the tab and select the desired option. If you want to just keep the Mail tab open - it's always the one on the far left and it might have same name as a folder you selected eg: Inbox - But close all others: Right click on the 'Inbox Mailbox tab' and selct 'Close other tabs' </p><p><br> As you have an issue with Thunderbird not starting and you think it's due to you leaving a load of tabs open then try the following: </p><p>Do not attempt to open Thunderbird. You need to access the Profile. I'm assuming you got the Thunderbird email client program from the official website: <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> </p><p>I'm also assuming you are using a Windows OS computer. So if you have a different OS or got Thunderbird from a different location then please tell us. That means the profile by default should be in this location: </p> <ul><li> In windows search type: <strong>%Appdata%</strong>  - see image below as a guide </li><li> Select %Appdata% file folder </li><li> Select: 'Roaming' folder </li><li> Select: 'Thunderbird' folder </li><li> Select: 'Profiles' folder </li><li> Select: the profile name folder eg: 123abcd.default-release </li></ul> <p>Look for the following files and delete them: </p> <ul><li> session.json </li><li> xulstore.json </li></ul> <p>Let's see if resetting the session data etc sorts out what is remembered. </p><p>Now start Thundrebird. Report back on results. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

There is no such thing as a Thunderbird account. But there is a Thunderbird email client program. In Thunderbird, you create a 'mail account' for a specific email address which you have already acquired on another server eg: gmail. All data, preferences, mail accounts, emails, address books, calendar etc are stored in a profile. A Profile can contain many mail accounts. </p><p>As I understand it, you deleted a gmail Mail Account from your Thunderbird email client. But you seem to still be getting a request to allow an Oauth login in order to reconnect to gmail server. </p><p>This sounds like you still have a stored password for that 'deleted' gmail account. In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Scroll down to 'Passwords' section </li><li> click on 'Saved Passwords' </li></ul> <p>You should see an 'Oauth://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> line for the gmail email address account which you deleted. You may also see an smtp://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> line for same gmail email address. </p> <ul><li> Select each line in turn and click on 'Remove'. </li></ul> <p>Check you no longer have any lines in that saved password section which mention the Username = the deleted gmail email address. </p> <ul><li> click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p>Exit Thunderbird wait a few moments whilst Thunderbird updates files, then restart.
