There is no such thing as a Thunderbird account. But there is a Thunderbird email client program. In Thunderbird, you create a 'mail account' for a specific email address which you have already acquired on another server eg: gmail. All data, preferences, mail accounts, emails, address books, calendar etc are stored in a profile. A Profile can contain many mail accounts. </p><p>As I understand it, you deleted a gmail Mail Account from your Thunderbird email client. But you seem to still be getting a request to allow an Oauth login in order to reconnect to gmail server. </p><p>This sounds like you still have a stored password for that 'deleted' gmail account. In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Scroll down to 'Passwords' section </li><li> click on 'Saved Passwords' </li></ul> <p>You should see an 'Oauth://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> line for the gmail email address account which you deleted. You may also see an smtp://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> line for same gmail email address. </p> <ul><li> Select each line in turn and click on 'Remove'. </li></ul> <p>Check you no longer have any lines in that saved password section which mention the Username = the deleted gmail email address. </p> <ul><li> click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p>Exit Thunderbird wait a few moments whilst Thunderbird updates files, then restart.

Thunderbird as any other email client can only download whatever is on server.  POP accounts only get access to server 'Inbox' to download whatever is in server 'Inbox' and put it in pop account 'Inbox'. So anything the server puts in server 'Spam' folder will never get downloaded to a Pop account.  IMAP accounts can subscribe to see server folders and as they synchronise with server folders, the imap folders will display whatever is on server and that includes the Spam folder. </p><p>Thunderbird can filter unwanted mail and do whatever you tell it to do eg: put in Spam or directly into the Trash/Deleted folder.  </p><p>Thunderbird has no control over the server.  The server accepts any email sent to you because that is it's purpose. However, you may be able to logon to your webmail account and set up to block a sender. </p><p>I have done this in my Gmail webmail account, but even the server will put all blocked senders into the server Spam folder. </p><p>There are some programs that can act like a 'middle-man'. There are people who use such programs to act like a filter between server and your email client - aka Thunderbird. As an example: <a href=""https://mailwasher.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mailwasher.net/</a> I'm not able to advocate the 'Mailwasher' program as I do use it. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
