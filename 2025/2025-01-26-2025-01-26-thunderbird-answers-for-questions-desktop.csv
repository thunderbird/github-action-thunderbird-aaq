Tried sending a test message,which worked, but generated an error message because Tbird couldn't save a copy in the Sent folder.  I have a lot of folders that I would hate to lose, the product of years of Tbird use.  (They're still OK on the old computer.)  I have used One Drive as the transfer medium without incident.
