Because that's <i>not</i> what I'm saying. Those two email addresses would of course be the same no matter what you put there, because it's just the same data being looked at from different places.  What I'm saying is that the email address that appears in the username there (in both screenshots) may need to be the same as the ""From"" address of the message you're trying to send in order for the SMTP server to accept the message… </blockquote> <p>I will have another look David.

The <i>[Gmail]</i> folder, which if visible should appear at the same level as <i>Inbox</i>, in your case appears as a subfolder of it, and the <i>All Mail</i> folder, which (if subscribed) should appear either as a subfolder of <i>[Gmail]</i> (if visible) or as a separate <i>All Mail</i> folder (if not), in your case appears as a mix of those two cases, i.e. a separate <i>[Gmail]All Mail</i> folder with the ""[Gmail]"" prefix in the name… </p><p>So although it seems you'll have to manually subscribe to those folders in order for them to appear in Thunderbird, there is clearly something amiss there, but I don't know what's causing it nor how to fix it other than maybe deleting the account (both info and data) and setting it up again… </p><p>And you said you cannot choose  <i>All Folders</i> under View &gt; Folders in the menu bar?

The stock reply I kept getting was it was ""a known Mozilla Thunderbird error."" After doing what you described above, and five days of arguing with tech support for escalation to a supervisor/competent tech, I got to a person who listened to me and understood my testing results.  Spectrum changed to a ""one password to rule them all"" policy scheme.  The tech pulled in a server engineer  and even got them to check the server logs. It was determined that the issue was two fold.... took fifteen minutes total to fix.... </p><p>First, their password scheme assumed the TWC server password would accept the same special characters as the website password. However, the TWC server only accepts&nbsp;!@#$%-_ special characters, fewer than the website.  </p><p>Second, they scheme is supposed to update the server password when you update your website password. It turns out it does not update the TWC server password at all.  </p><p>So let it be known at this time the TWC servers' passwords have to be updated/reset by hand and it is a specific group separate from the regular path of support that does it. It is now written in my account notes that this group needs to address a password reset on the TWC server. The tech wrote up a report but can not guarantee that the changes needed will be made to the scheme. </p><p>AA </p>",teknikal,false,3,0
