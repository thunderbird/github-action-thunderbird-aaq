If you want to use Thunderbird to access your Gmail account you'll have to ""Allow"" this. Simple as that. Before OAuth2 authentication has been introduced Thunderbird had unlimited access to your Gmail account regardless, without even asking for permission. Did you complain about that? </p> <blockquote> I DO NOT WANT to grant access for the list of dangerous purposes provided in the pop-up. </blockquote> <p>There is nothing dangerous about allowing access for Thunderbird. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
