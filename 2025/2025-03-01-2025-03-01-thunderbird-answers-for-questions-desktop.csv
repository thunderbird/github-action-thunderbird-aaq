Are you needing to have your personal mail in your pocket, without using your phone to manage portability?  The wh9le basis of the issue really does not make a lot of sense to me. </p><p>Just to be clear,  portable apps use a wrapper application around Thunderbird to fool it into thinking it is installed and the profile it is loading is located on the local machine.  I have no idea how it is done and I do not care are portable apps is not supported from here. </p><p>Thunderbird will run multiple instances using multiple profiles,  but I doubt the portable apps wrapper will let it happen. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have two copies running on my PC all the time,  although one is the daily developer build,  but having the release version with multiple profiles is equally something that should work.  So I will try again.  Why use the portable version at all? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
