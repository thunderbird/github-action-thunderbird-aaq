Are you needing to have your personal mail in your pocket, without using your phone to manage portability?  The wh9le basis of the issue really does not make a lot of sense to me. </p><p>Just to be clear,  portable apps use a wrapper application around Thunderbird to fool it into thinking it is installed and the profile it is loading is located on the local machine.  I have no idea how it is done and I do not care are portable apps is not supported from here. </p><p>Thunderbird will run multiple instances using multiple profiles,  but I doubt the portable apps wrapper will let it happen. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have two copies running on my PC all the time,  although one is the daily developer build,  but having the release version with multiple profiles is equally something that should work.  So I will try again.  Why use the portable version at all? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I'm also assuming you are using an up to date version of Thunderbird. I'm assuming you do not allow anyone else to use your computer OR if they do - they do not use your own User Account on computer. </p><p>When you logon to computer it asks you for a password to access your computer User Account and see desktop. This means there is a level of protection for all documents etc in that User Account. No one else should have your personal User Account password, so they do not  get any access to your desktop environment. </p><p>When you run Thunderbird and want to access saved passwords, when you click on 'Saved Passwords' it should only display the username account data - not the actual passwords. But when you click on 'Show Passwords', it should ask for the Windows User Account password in order to display the passwords. This a another level of protection just in case someone is looking over your shoulder at this moment in time and you do not want them to see the actual passwords. So you can cancel if required. </p><p>You also have the option to completely remove that Windows password request. You will need to enter the computer User Account password in order to access and disable it. This may be ok and suit you, if you are the only person using computer and no one else has your User Account password and you do not leave computer switched on and logged on to your User Account whilst you are not present.  </p><p>There is also an option to set up a 'Primary Password' which would operate instead of the Windows OS request for computer user account password. It does the same thing. The 'Primary Password' is not a mail account password, it's something you set up as a separate access level of security. This should be set up if others have access to your computer and access to your computer User Account password - unusual but possible. </p><p>The Primary Password is asked when you start up Thunderbird as it will use password to access and download emails, but it is not a login to Thunderbird. It's usually asked once per session when you first start up Thunderbird or if you specifically want to see saved passwords.  You do not have to enter it. Thunderbird will still proceed to download mail.  </p><p>Info on Primary Password: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password</a> </li></ul> <p>Please note: The Primary Password does not prevent access to Thunderbird, so you should still be able to see emails etc. </p><p>If you are the only person using your computer then a Primary Password is not really necessary as it's only stopping you from seeing your own mail account passwords. But I would advise you ensure you have a computer User Account password as it offers protection to all your documents on your computer. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That is the first level of security and it's important.  No one can access your User Account to see your desktop or personal documents unless they also have access to your computer User Account and that also includes Thunderbird. So you already have a first level of protection for Thunderbird. </p><p>If you start Thunderbird and want to see saved passwords then you will get asked to input that User Account password. It means should anyone be present and looking over your shoulder at that moment in time you can cancel and prevent anyone seeing stored passwords. </p><p>Some people also choose to set a  'Primary Password' which only protects access to viewing saved passwords in Thunderbird. That 'Primary Password' is useful if you share your computer AND your computer User Account password with other people.  </p><p>If you do not share computer with other people and do not share your User Account password with other people AND you never leave your computer running and logged on to User Account when you are not present then the Primary Password is somewhat surplus to requirements. It's only blocking your own viewing. </p><p>Other programs on computer do not generally ask for a password in order to run the program itself eg: Microsoft Office suite or OpenOffice or Paint etc. Passwords are only asked when logging on to something like a User Account on computer or a program that is directly accessing a server.  Thunderbird does not need a password to run the program. It does need passwords to access saved passwords and it does need mail account passwords to access servers. Many servers do use OAuth2 or require 2FA, but that is specific to that server. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
