Do you want to sort them into other folders so it's easier to organise etc. </p><p>It's somewhat risky to have a lot of emails in one folder. At this point, it's not known if there is any type of corruption in that Inbox especially if you have tons of emails and the file size may be even larger if you have deleted or moved any emails and not been compacting. So when proceeding let's assume there maybe corruption which could impact on results later on. I would not like to only have good emails in an Inbox which I will need to compact and do not know if that file has an unknown problem, hence adise to move good first. </p><p>At this point do not compact anything this is vitally important. I'm going to advise you to do this in a way that will not lose emails if there is any unknown issue with that Inbox. It may seem odd but it's all because you have an old Inbox brimming with emails and the file state is unknown. I'm assuming you have more unwanted emails than good wanted emails. So it's alot quicker to move what you want than what you do not want. </p><p>Are you using a Pop or IMAP account&nbsp;? If IMAP then anything you delete - it will get deleted off the server.  I would also advise if this is an imap account then use 'Copy to' to another folder because if something goes wrong with a 'Move to' you may lose email. </p><p><strong>First:</strong> Create a new folder with a suitable name  or create better still several new folders and then you can move emails into suitable folder eg: Family, Friends, Online Orders, Hobby, etc </p><p><strong>Second: </strong> I would advise you move all the good wanted emails out of the Inbox and put them in the new folder(s) you created.  </p><p><strong>How to move a batch of emails:</strong> If they are listed one after the other - click on first email, hold down shift key and click on last. All emails in between become highlighted/selected. Right click on highlighted emails and select 'Move to' and choose the relevant new folder you created. </p><p>If they are in various locations throughout: you could sort by 'From' and then move batches of same email address into same folder. OR Hold down 'Ctrl' key whilst clicking on various emails to select. Right click on highlighted emails and select 'Move to' and choose the relevant new folder you created. All the highlighted emails move as one batch to designated folder. </p><p>When all the good emails have been moved out of the Inbox, this will leave all the emails you want to delete in the Inbox. </p><p><strong>Third:</strong> Now to kill/delete all the unwanted emails left in Inbox. </p> <ul><li> Select top email in Inbox </li><li> Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press 'A' key </li></ul> <p>This will highlight all the unwanted emails in the Inbox </p> <ul><li> The Message Pane will say X conversations and offer two buttons 'Archive' and 'Delete'. </li><li> Click on 'Delete' </li></ul> <p><strong>Last:</strong> When Inbox is empty, you need to clean up all old traces of moved and deleted emails. This is important. </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Inbox' and select 'Compact' </li></ul> <p>This will leave you with a clean new empty Inbox ready for use. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

My first suggestion is this - click to her email account pane - on bottom line is 'Outgoing Server; - click the button 'edit outgoing server' - does this pane show her email address or yours? If it shows yours, then her setting is not being used. DO NOT change this, as her account may be pointing to yours, and changing might reverse the problem. instead,  </p><p>- click to account settings pane - at bottom of left side bar is link to outgoing servers pane. click it - there, you should see an SMTP server setting for her account. Edit the DESCRIPTION field to have her name - then, return to her account pane and on the bottom line, click the drop-down menu and select the SMTP server that you just renamed. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
