My first suggestion is this - click to her email account pane - on bottom line is 'Outgoing Server; - click the button 'edit outgoing server' - does this pane show her email address or yours? If it shows yours, then her setting is not being used. DO NOT change this, as her account may be pointing to yours, and changing might reverse the problem. instead,  </p><p>- click to account settings pane - at bottom of left side bar is link to outgoing servers pane. click it - there, you should see an SMTP server setting for her account. Edit the DESCRIPTION field to have her name - then, return to her account pane and on the bottom line, click the drop-down menu and select the SMTP server that you just renamed. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
