(From/To/Subject/Date/CC etc)   When a new user first replies to an email, they will only get the basic Unix legacy ""On [date] [name] said:""  This took me back when I first used TB, back at something like v7, but I soon found the Reply With Header add-on.  However, the existence of this add-on or even its name vs. function is not obvious, and a new user may simply find that the cut-down header does not meet their requirements and simply looks elsewhere for a client.  If the ReplyWithHeader add-on functionality ever disappeared, I would also be quitting TB (though finding an equally good program would be hard, but not impossible.) </p><p>Now, the code to do the full reply header is already in TB, as it is placed into a Forward message.  So, as I see it, TB could very usefully (a) default to the full header for replies as well as forwards, and (b) include a simple long/short reply header option under Preferences - many mobile Apps already have this (Bluemail for example).  This would remove one possible negative experience for a new user. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1723486;1723490;,cjg.aptl
