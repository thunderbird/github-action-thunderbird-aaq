If you have difficulty, you can manually locate the files in c:\program files and delete them.  - download from <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a>   you have a choice of the ESR or the monthly. With ESR, there are fewer updates per year for stability, but the monthly will have latest features.  - after installing, start thunderbird and then exit.  - now, copy the backed up thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming - to OVERWRITE the existing thunderbird folder - restart thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
