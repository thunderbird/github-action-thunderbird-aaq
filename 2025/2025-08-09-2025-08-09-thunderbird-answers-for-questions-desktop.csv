If you have difficulty, you can manually locate the files in c:\program files and delete them.  - download from <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a>   you have a choice of the ESR or the monthly. With ESR, there are fewer updates per year for stability, but the monthly will have latest features.  - after installing, start thunderbird and then exit.  - now, copy the backed up thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming - to OVERWRITE the existing thunderbird folder - restart thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Click the open button for the profile folder </p><p>You should now have a windows file explorer window open showing a path at the top of the screen and a load of files.  Perhaps many gigabytes of them.  Check that one of those files is prefs.js just to be sure you are in the right place and then close Thunderbird. That is your profile folder and everything needs to be copied to a USB drive, so make sure you have one with enough space free. In the windows file manager press Ctrl+A and everything in the file list should be selected, now drag that to your USB drive to make a copy. </p><p>Now on your new device open Thunderbird and repeat the steps to open the profile folder from troubleshooting information. Close Thunderbird. Copy the entire contents of the old profile folder into the new profile folder.  You will be prompted to replace files and you should.  If you are not prompted to replace files than  you are almost certainly copying the files in the wrong place. </p><p>Once the copy of the files and folders is complete start Thunderbird and it should just run with your old data.  Note that this replaces anything in the new installations active profile folder without an undo option. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The are so slow in what they do that things like saving file on exist simply fail because they are still boiling the kettle to make a cup of coffee when Thunderbird exists and give up on it's request to save the file. </p><p>Generally placing an exception in the antivirus product for Thunderbird or it's profile folders will get you off that merry-go-round. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So I am guessing you do not have a bug,  but you do have features (like email account address books and calendars) and/or addons that are just not working because you have not granted them permission to actually work.. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
