My computer immediately lost the ability to access half of the websites I tried to visit and Thunderbird wouldn't send or receive email. I rebooted and that fixed every issue, but since then, Thunderbird no longer checks for new messages for any of my accounts. If I manually instruct it to check, it downloads the messages with no problem.  I don't use any add-ons, and I'm using the latest version on a Windows 11 PC.  I have already tried deleting global-messages-db.sqlite, repairing each mail folder from within Thunderbird, clearing the cache, and running an install of the latest version.  I have also tried changing the setting for each mail folder to alter the interval for message checks by a minute just to see if that would jog it, but no luck. I've looked at various other help threads for this and am out of ideas.  Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1781285;1781307;,contact1220

I had them sorted in alphabetical order but a week ago it started moving my folders.  For example, I have a folder named ""FunWithTubes"" but it keeps moving to the bottom of the list after ""Y"" and if I move it back then a day or so later it will be back somewhere else near the bottom.  This is not the only folder it does this too but does not do it to all of them.  How do I get it to put my folders back where I had them and leave them alone?  This has got to be a bug. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",southern-boy

Although I have all my folders set to show emails in date order, with the newest at the top I am now sometimes finding new emails halfway down the list. This has happened several times in the last few weeks. I have ""repaired"" the folders every time I notice this but it has not solved the problem.  Is there a glitch in the later versions of Thunderbird which is causing this?  It was apparent today with my 'deleted' folder. I can't send you an image because I have now sorted the issue, until it happens again. I only discovered this by mikssing a couple of important emails and finding them in webmail but not in  Thunrderbird. I use IMAP and my settings to the server are correct. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",sthoselitz
