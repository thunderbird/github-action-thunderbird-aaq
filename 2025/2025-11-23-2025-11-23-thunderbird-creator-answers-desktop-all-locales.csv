My computer immediately lost the ability to access half of the websites I tried to visit and Thunderbird wouldn't send or receive email. I rebooted and that fixed every issue, but since then, Thunderbird no longer checks for new messages for any of my accounts. If I manually instruct it to check, it downloads the messages with no problem.  I don't use any add-ons, and I'm using the latest version on a Windows 11 PC.  I have already tried deleting global-messages-db.sqlite, repairing each mail folder from within Thunderbird, clearing the cache, and running an install of the latest version.  I have also tried changing the setting for each mail folder to alter the interval for message checks by a minute just to see if that would jog it, but no luck. I've looked at various other help threads for this and am out of ideas.  Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1781285;,contact1220
