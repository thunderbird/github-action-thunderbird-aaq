There were no problems until my system was shut down for 20 days while I was in the hospital. After returning home Thunderbird had lost major parts of its functionality: Problem 1-Thunderbird was unable to download the approximate 2700 email messages that had accumulated while I was in the hospital. By experimenting with troubleshooting mode and various other things I eventually got these emails into my inbox. Problem 2-When I try to send or forward a message, after a long pause Thunderbird reports that the task failed because the connection to the outgoing mail server timed out. This happens even with a short simple message to myself. If I try to save the message to the Drafts folder that also fails with a timeout. Should I update to the 140.5.0esr release? Any other suggestions? </p>",bob.bench9;mozilla98;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:145.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/145.0,1,0,0,,,
