In the UK the clocks go forward 1 hour at 1am on the last Sunday in March </p><p>So at 1am it suddenly becomes 2am. That means the calendar has entered the 10am event one hour early, so when clock goes forward one hour that should reset the event to 10am.  Hopefully&nbsp;:) </p><p>But having explained where I think the logic is coming from, it's not exactly very helpful to see what appears to be an incorrect setting for future events on or after the 30th March.  </p><p>I'll see if there has been some mention of this in a bug report etc. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

For all your various email address on various servers, you can create a mail account in Thunderbird to access and download emails from server and also create new emails. This means you can see all your emails and mail accounts in one view.  Thunderbird also has it's own calendar and also can sync with other calendars including gmail.  Thunderbird also has Address Books and can sync with others. </p><p>for example - If you have a gmail email account then you can add it as a mail account in Thunderbird. You can set up POP and/or IMAP accounts. </p><p>Thunderbird works on Windows, MAC and Linux based OS. </p><p>Thunderbid can be downloaded from the official website: <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> </p><p>It's free to download and all support is free if you use this Thunderbird Support Forum.
