For all your various email address on various servers, you can create a mail account in Thunderbird to access and download emails from server and also create new emails. This means you can see all your emails and mail accounts in one view.  Thunderbird also has it's own calendar and also can sync with other calendars including gmail.  Thunderbird also has Address Books and can sync with others. </p><p>for example - If you have a gmail email account then you can add it as a mail account in Thunderbird. You can set up POP and/or IMAP accounts. </p><p>Thunderbird works on Windows, MAC and Linux based OS. </p><p>Thunderbid can be downloaded from the official website: <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> </p><p>It's free to download and all support is free if you use this Thunderbird Support Forum.
