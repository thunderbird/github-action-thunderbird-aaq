Very heavy on network bandwidth, especially when you are talking about 4 to 10Gb archives with a whole years email in them trotting back and forth every few minutes. </p><p>Next is the issue that Thunderbird has a very long history of struggling with server shares, and a NAS is essentially a server share.  That was one of the reasons why Thunderbird defaulted to storing profiles in the remote %appdata% folder as the profile was supposed to be downloaded and uploaded to the server at lacal account login and logout.  There have been bugs associated with just about every release in the last decade around server file systems TCP file sharing etc. </p><p>So you now apparently have your email on the server.  Have you checked those folders actually have mail in them?  it would not surprise me at all to find the actual transfers never completed because your antivirus held the process up while it scanned the copy retrieved to append the new messages to.  Go to the NAS, delete all MSF files in all folders and then while there ensure there are files named for the years. </p><p>Next what nomenclature did you use to create these year names files?  for instance 1/1/2025 is three folders in windows parlance. 1\1\2025 is three in Unix/Linux which your NAS almost certainly uses. </p><p>I say three because the first is 1 it has a sub folder named 1 and it has a subfolder named 2025.  Thunderbird has code to try and prevent these text basted structures from being interpreted as folder strings but nothing is perfect. and what works on Windows may not work in Linux and the two may be mutually incompatible. so check exactly what is on the NAS at the native file system level. There is a meta bug about folder names here <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124287"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124287</a> </p><p>In the end however, it may just be it is taking so long for your archive file to arrive from the NAS that Thunderbird is just giving up on the render.  I would assume in that case there would be some clues in the error console (Ctrl+Shift+J) mentioning timeouts or missing files or data </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My original problem was that Thunderbird fails to download mail from the mail server and gives no error message or request for the password. Upon investigation, only the SMTP server is visible in Security &gt; Show passwords - the mailbox server is absent. I can access the webmail where I can do the usual things with the incoming mail except download it.  This proves it is not a password problem. </p><p>I use the latest version of Thunderbird and the account I use is POP3 which I have used since the year dot because my provider has only recently added IMAP. I backed up TB and uninstalled it,  then reinstalled it.  It found all my old mail and reset settings as they were, thus I achieved nothing doing that. </p><p>My latest effort was to take out the checks for TB to Check for mail on start up and also Check for mail every 10 minutes. I added a New Account and selected IMAP rather than POP3.  I used the settings and ports in the instructions on the providers web site. Everything proceeded normally except - I could not download mail. I did NOT delete the POP3 account because it has been putout of action and I do not wish to lose important mail stored on my hard drive. </p><p>Upon checking the Settings &gt; Security &gt; Show passwords, showed both the Mailbox server and the SMTP servers. </p><p>Subsequently I have laid the problem aside before I lose my marbles and hair.  I Now I have three email clients, one of which is 'broke', Outlook for Windows which to me is NOT intuative and will not import TB Addree Book clearly unless you know how to edit the csv file and in some cases does not copy and paste.  The other client I am trying, which is at this stage very trying, is BlueMail the basic version.  It has automatically found about a quarter of my address book from where I don't know and it too does not allow copy and past when adding new contacts. Both programmes send and receive emails however and use the same password I use for TB and webmail. Go figure! </p><p>Does anyone have a solution for a fan for many years, of Thunderbird?? </p>",grotto70,false,0,0

It might be years before it breaks,  but break it will and it will be up to you to figure out what you did to undo it and then what to do to get the result you think you want. </p><p>To be asking that question, did  you did not read the link I provided as it tells you why it is unsupported.  I will however quote it here as well. </p> <blockquote> ""These changes mean that customizations based on userChrome.css, userChrome.js, userContent.css and userContent.js can break Thunderbird at any time and are very difficult to troubleshoot. "" </blockquote> <p>As Thunderbird does not employ support staff you will be largely on your own with that troubleshooting.  I know I struggle with doing my own to the point I largely just gave up on using it years ago.  I still use it to move the menu bar to place the menu above the tab bar,  but that does not make it right, or supported by the development team. </p><p>BTW did you notice that the sizes in Thunderbird are in pixels,  so if you used 14px  that is around 20% smaller that 14pt which you specified in the CSS file.
