The old messages would be in the old profile at the Mail\&lt;POPaccount&gt; folder, or possibly in the Mail\Local Folders folder, with names such as inbox, inbox.msf. and sent and sent.msf.

If a small amount, just rightclick and COPY to the online sent folder. If there are a lot of messages, I suggest creating a manual filter for the process. I suggest this as uploading is not a strength of IMAP and the filter will slow the process a bit - which is desired.

Very heavy on network bandwidth, especially when you are talking about 4 to 10Gb archives with a whole years email in them trotting back and forth every few minutes. </p><p>Next is the issue that Thunderbird has a very long history of struggling with server shares, and a NAS is essentially a server share.  That was one of the reasons why Thunderbird defaulted to storing profiles in the remote %appdata% folder as the profile was supposed to be downloaded and uploaded to the server at lacal account login and logout.  There have been bugs associated with just about every release in the last decade around server file systems TCP file sharing etc. </p><p>So you now apparently have your email on the server.  Have you checked those folders actually have mail in them?  it would not surprise me at all to find the actual transfers never completed because your antivirus held the process up while it scanned the copy retrieved to append the new messages to.  Go to the NAS, delete all MSF files in all folders and then while there ensure there are files named for the years. </p><p>Next what nomenclature did you use to create these year names files?  for instance 1/1/2025 is three folders in windows parlance. 1\1\2025 is three in Unix/Linux which your NAS almost certainly uses. </p><p>I say three because the first is 1 it has a sub folder named 1 and it has a subfolder named 2025.  Thunderbird has code to try and prevent these text basted structures from being interpreted as folder strings but nothing is perfect. and what works on Windows may not work in Linux and the two may be mutually incompatible. so check exactly what is on the NAS at the native file system level. There is a meta bug about folder names here <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124287"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124287</a> </p><p>In the end however, it may just be it is taking so long for your archive file to arrive from the NAS that Thunderbird is just giving up on the render.  I would assume in that case there would be some clues in the error console (Ctrl+Shift+J) mentioning timeouts or missing files or data </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
