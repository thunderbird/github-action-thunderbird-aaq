IF you have multiple calendars (e.g. one for each email account) the organizer will default to the identity associated with that calendar. </p>",ReptarBar,false,0,0

It sounds like you MSF file is not pointing to the MBOX file. Perhaps if you were to explicitly describe the steps you took to get into this situation someone counld work out where you went wrong.   </p><p>Personally I would think it is with the assumption to can share local mail  it does not work in the long term,  but that does not describe your current issue only where you are headed. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Now, at the end of the year, I create a new folder and move messages from the entire year. I have a computer where I did everything the same way, but the local folder is on the PC, not on the NAS, and everything works fine. </p>",michal.bieganski,false,0,0
