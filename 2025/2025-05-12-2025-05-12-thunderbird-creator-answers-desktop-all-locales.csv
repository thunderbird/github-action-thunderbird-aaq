It says it is downloading messages but then a couple are missing.,"<p>I click on the 'get messages' and it says it is downloading 4 messages (for instance) but then only 2 of them are there.   Not in the inbox, or spam or trash, just not there.   I can often see the subject of a message but there is no message like that.   This has only been happening for about a week or two now. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",pdsimdars

This question appeared some years ago. Now I'm still confronted with the same question. When I reply to messages or I'm up to forward a message, my signature is not inserted. I used TB for a very long time and I used this feature in the past extensively. I think, this must be an issue to TB . </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",dhwelzow

And like yearly I make a mass copy of emails from an online folder to a local folder. I used the function ""copy to"" in the context menu, alternatively moving the mouse together with ctrl for the copy option. In my current version (nearly new...) the copy process is completely in the background (no info on progress etc.). And also no info on failing.  And it does fail, after copying a small portion of the selected emails. </p><p>I would be totally fine with a modal dialog process, that is thunderbird blocked until the process has finished. Is there an option?  Or any other way to have a bit more control on the process status and success? Thank you </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1731917;,co-base
