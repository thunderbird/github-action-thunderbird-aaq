Example, I open an email after logging in for the whatever many times it has been during the day, and I need to answer the email but need to get some information first. I go get the information and the email program requies me to log in again, even if it has been just a few minutes.  This has not happened in the past. I have been using Thunderbird for a very long time, many many years and never had this happen before. I loaded the program on my laptop that I use when I travel or am not at home. Same thing happens with it. </p><p>This is highly frustrating and time wasting to have to do that. There is nothing I have found that shows me how to address this. My phone has a different email program and that does not happen when using the phone. And like I said, I have been using this email program for a very long time and have not experienced this in the past.  </p><p>Is there access to a user's manual or some quick guide to help me with this? I am not a tech newby, but I'm not an IT professional either, which was why I choose using Thunderbird many years ago.  It seemed user friendly at that time. </p><p>Thank you kindly for your help.

I've uninstalled and installed other versions, such as 137 and 128, and everything is the same. I've disabled the firewall and even Windows Defender, and nothing has worked.
