I have a MacBook Air running Sonoma 14.7.2, my ISP is Gandi, and Thunderbird 115.4.1 is my email.  I had clicked on a link in an email from a known source and when I returned to email, all the inbox messages were gone.  All other folders (Sent, Drafts, etc) are there and current.  My husband and I each have email accounts; his Inbox is all there too.  The Inbox emails were not in the Trash, Deleted or Junk folders.  I closed Thunderbird and reopened; messages still gone.  I closed all apps, shut down the computer and restarted; opened Thunderbird, messages still gone.  When I look at the Profile files, I can't tell which one would be my Inbox, but none of the likely candidates seems big enough to hold the, um, 7000+ messages that were there.  I have spent the day internet-searching and reading various posts on disappearing messages - most of which are very old and/or for Windows - but I am unable to figure out what to do.  Are the messages somewhere in the Profile?  Are they on my ISP's server?  How can I get them back into the Inbox?  Thanks for any help. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1705055;,carla33

Hopefully someone can help!! I've added images of my settings and also of the error message I get when trying to send mail.  BTW We had about 5 sessions with the India help desk at which we kept getting cut off.  When finally getting to chat with someone....they had no answers, they said they would esculate the problem and someone would call in 24 hrs.  That never happened...The case ID # 203683399     NO ONE EVER RESPONDED and so the problem persists. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1705023;,mercedes2000_12

Ho quindi modificato le impostazioni di destinazione creando una cartella Posta su un server NAS. Risultato: ora ho scaricato tutte le 20mila mail, che sembra siano tutte presenti, sia ricevute sia spedite (anche se avevo capito che le spedite non le avrebbe scaricate), ma quelle degli anni 2007/2014 le trovo solo se faccio ricerca, mentre scorrendo la lista Posta in arrivo è come se non ci fossero. Come faccio a farle riapparire nell'elenco, in fondo, dato che ho ordinato per data decrescente di arrivo? Inoltre, c'è modo di separare nuovamente le spedite dalle ricevute? Ultima domanda: rischio qualcosa a cancellare ""Tutte le email"" dal sito gmail? ormai dovrei aver tutto al sicuro sul mio server. grazie </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,it,"",stefano.vass
