I have a MacBook Air running Sonoma 14.7.2, my ISP is Gandi, and Thunderbird 115.4.1 is my email.  I had clicked on a link in an email from a known source and when I returned to email, all the inbox messages were gone.  All other folders (Sent, Drafts, etc) are there and current.  My husband and I each have email accounts; his Inbox is all there too.  The Inbox emails were not in the Trash, Deleted or Junk folders.  I closed Thunderbird and reopened; messages still gone.  I closed all apps, shut down the computer and restarted; opened Thunderbird, messages still gone.  When I look at the Profile files, I can't tell which one would be my Inbox, but none of the likely candidates seems big enough to hold the, um, 7000+ messages that were there.  I have spent the day internet-searching and reading various posts on disappearing messages - most of which are very old and/or for Windows - but I am unable to figure out what to do.  Are the messages somewhere in the Profile?  Are they on my ISP's server?  How can I get them back into the Inbox?  Thanks for any help. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",carla33
