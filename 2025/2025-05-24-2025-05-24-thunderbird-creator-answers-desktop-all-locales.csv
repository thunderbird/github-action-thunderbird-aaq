The only 'fix' is to manually re-copy the affected message from my server, then delete the corrupt copies. - The filters are set to run with new email - Each filter copies the message to the Local Folder, then moves the message to the server's Trash. This two-step action is because Proton Mail Bridge does not allow third-party clients to move messages out of the server--if you do this, it orphans the email in their All Mail folder and become a mess to clean up. - After extensive research, I thought my folders were corrupt so I completely rebuilt the Local Folder structure. All messages were moved into new folders and the original folders were deleted. - Each folder is a few hundred MB, total Local Folder size is less than 7GB </p>",stu0000000;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:138.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/138.0,0,0,0,,,stu0000000
