If you want to have text either side of image but with it's own right alignment then create eg: 3 cells width. You can set alignment of table itself as center using the 'Advanced Edit' button Attribute: align and Value: Center </p><p>Put an image in each row cell or middle cell if using 3 cell width. Set content alignment of a cell as center. Double click in the cell to get the pop up to set up cell properties. and set that cell to use alignment as center via 'Advanced Edit' button. </p><p>Now all text is normal and all images are central. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Please note - it's all too easy to think you are just copying an image, but you may also be inadvertantly copying all the remote content associated with that image. That means if the recipient has remote content disabled as is the default for security reasons, all those images will get blocked so cannot be seen. So please be careful about what you copy and paste when using other peoples images on websites. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It has been one that has bothered me for years only because of the time it  takes to recompose that particular E-mail of witch I receive occasionally from people who won't or do not know how to compose before sending. Normally, I collect the pics and try to put them down the middle of the screen one after another with space in between each, some with text on top others on the bottom of that particular pic. Some E-mails have very large amounts of pics to put in order. In view of your efforts and others I am beginning to feel their is no easy solution to this challenge. </p>",cboydg21,false,0,0
