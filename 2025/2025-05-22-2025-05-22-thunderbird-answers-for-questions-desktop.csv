Please note - it's all too easy to think you are just copying an image, but you may also be inadvertantly copying all the remote content associated with that image. That means if the recipient has remote content disabled as is the default for security reasons, all those images will get blocked so cannot be seen. So please be careful about what you copy and paste when using other peoples images on websites. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
