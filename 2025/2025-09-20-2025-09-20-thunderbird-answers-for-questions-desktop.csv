Closing this.  Please refrain from raising duplicate posts that waste folks time managing them.  You posted on the 18 and received a reply.  Personally I would not have offered you the link to report a bug.  But that is never mind nothing will change with this topic and certainly not in the time frame of the two days between your posts. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
