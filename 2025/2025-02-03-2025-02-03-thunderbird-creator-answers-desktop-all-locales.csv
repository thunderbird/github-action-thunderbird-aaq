How do I import all my data (emails, addresses calendar) from Outlook to Thunderbird. </p><p>I have tried Import tool within Thunderbird - import from Outlook. I tried MailStore and was totally confused - the terminology was strange. I managed to make an archive - it took ages to find where it was and I still do not know the file extension.  </p><p>No videos...nothing. </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",orangewatchcompany

I synchronize every minute. Sometimes, when opening Thunderbird, a message ""Item changed on server"" appears with the options ""Submit my changes anyway"" or ""Discard my changes and reload"". </p><p>By default, Thunderbird adopts the server entry. I notice this when I simply close the dialog with ""x"". For me, the calendar items on the server always have priority. Therefore, my question is, can I set this through the Config Editor so that this pop-up is not displayed? This way, the server entries are always automatically loaded in the background. I can't find a suitable solution, which has somewhat surprised me. </p><p>Attached is a screenshot from my documentation, hence the red rectangles. </p><p>Thank you very much! </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",serjoscha
