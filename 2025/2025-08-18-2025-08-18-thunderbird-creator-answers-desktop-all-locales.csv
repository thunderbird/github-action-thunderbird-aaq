The IMAP acct now fetches email from the same GoDaddy server account  as the POP3 account used.    I want to continue using the same Local Folders location as before, in order to maintain and update the large amount of selectively retained email permanently stored there. </p><p>Previously with POP3, I had redirected Local Folders from the default location on the C: drive to a different location (K:\...\Thunderbird\Local Folders) on a data drive.  Under Account Settings &gt; Local Folders, Thunderbird still points to the desired data drive directory  (K:\...\Thunderbird\Local Folders).  Does this mean that the new IMAP account will also use the redirected Local Folders location or will it use the Default location on the C: drive listed after creating the IMAP account?  I ask because under Account Settings &gt; Server Settings for the IMAP Mail Server, the ""Local Directory"" entry points to  C:\Users\MCM\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\...... </p><p>Perhaps the ""Local Directory"" is not related to the ""Local Folders"" location? </p><p>Thank you for helping with this somewhat confusing situation. </p><p>Michael M. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1757712;,RadFirefox
