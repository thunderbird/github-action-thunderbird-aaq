Prior to moving I updated the updated Thunderbird on the old computer to version 137.0.1 and installed the same on the new computer. Since I cannot transfer files via USB I copied all of them to OneDrive and then shared that folder to the new computer. The OneDrive folder can be seen on both computers;  the same profile m5wv3t89.default, and its contents can as well (e.g. Mail -&gt; <a href=""http://pop.rcn-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.rcn-1.com</a> -&gt; Inbox and Inbox.msf). I point the new computer's Thunderbird to the same Local Directory. It appears to create a new index file: It creates another one with a different suffix: Inbox-MacBookPro-2.msf -- the same size as the Inbox.msf.  So far so good... </p><p>In the new computer Thunderbird I can see the Inbox and all the Local folders. However, when I attempt to look at an email, I select an email, and the pane below the email is solid white. I see no text. (see screenshot below) I generally run in Dark Mode. And on the settings page ""Enable dark message mode"" is checked, and ""Show dark message mode toggle"" is also checked (but I have no idea where to find the toggle!). </p><p>How do I get Thunderbird to display a selected message? (if it is only black text on white background that's fine ... or if it can be white text on a black background -- dark mode -- that would be better). But right now I can't see the message text, period! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jduhl
