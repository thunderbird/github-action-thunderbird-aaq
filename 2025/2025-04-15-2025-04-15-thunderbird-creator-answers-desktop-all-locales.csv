Prior to moving I updated the updated Thunderbird on the old computer to version 137.0.1 and installed the same on the new computer. Since I cannot transfer files via USB I copied all of them to OneDrive and then shared that folder to the new computer. The OneDrive folder can be seen on both computers;  the same profile m5wv3t89.default, and its contents can as well (e.g. Mail -&gt; <a href=""http://pop.rcn-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.rcn-1.com</a> -&gt; Inbox and Inbox.msf). I point the new computer's Thunderbird to the same Local Directory. It appears to create a new index file: It creates another one with a different suffix: Inbox-MacBookPro-2.msf -- the same size as the Inbox.msf.  So far so good... </p><p>In the new computer Thunderbird I can see the Inbox and all the Local folders. However, when I attempt to look at an email, I select an email, and the pane below the email is solid white. I see no text. (see screenshot below) I generally run in Dark Mode. And on the settings page ""Enable dark message mode"" is checked, and ""Show dark message mode toggle"" is also checked (but I have no idea where to find the toggle!). </p><p>How do I get Thunderbird to display a selected message? (if it is only black text on white background that's fine ... or if it can be white text on a black background -- dark mode -- that would be better).

I have been using Thunderbird forever and want to continue to do so! </p><p>On my Android Phone (Pixel 7a) with Android 15  I am experiencing a breakdown of the sync of my inbox of my gmail. This is one of two email adresses I am using (hotmail is the other) and the Gmail-Inbox and the gmail-spam box are the only two synced folders. </p><p>This can work for days or even weeks, but then suddenly is stops syncing. I do not notice this until looking at my inbox from another device. I then have to sync manually to get the sync going again. Changing between WiFi ang 4G/5G does not make the sync startup again. </p><p>I have set the batterysaving-settings off for T-bird and not changing any other settings which might affect this behaviour. </p><p>Can you help please?

I can't find any settings to reset or apply a theme or fix the colors of the text within the address book.
