Replies observe the client's color configuration and include signatures, albeit in odd places, while forwards contain no signature anywhere and contain a large number of elements, chiefly boxes, colored inconsistently with both dark and light modes.  No means exists in Settings to configure either colors (specifically, generally, or to conform with the client's color mode configuration) or signatures for forwards. </p>",eb40,false,0,0

In both, it appears in quasi-light light mode with various elements appearing in red rectangles, instead of dark mode as in the email received.  This is a gross rendering failure. </p><p>•  Furthermore, and quite oddly, forwards and replies inconsistently configure message text.  The first failure is that replies are in dark mode and forwards are in light mode.  The second failure is that message text in forwards is white, consistent with the dark mode scheme but not with white background, which is inconsistent with the dark mode scheme.  The third failure is that the client resists configuration of message text to to any other color.  So, perhaps a signature exists in the forwards but becase of this cascade of color configuration failures, is invisible. </p>",eb40,false,0,0
