But here goes nothing. </p><p>Certainly the account showing in the second entry appears to be a pop account (it even says it in the top of the screen),  but the first entry with all of those archives is more likely to be an imap configured account using the same email address.  What has me more than a little lost is why you do not have Thunderbird retrieving your Optus mail directly.  It seems odd to have gmail retrieve it and then download it to Thunderbird from that account.  You will still need to use Optus to send mail from your Optus address is a large part of why I am confused. </p><p>If you are using POP  are those 400 odd unread emails in the second account showing as read in the first? </p><p>go to account settings. (right click the first account in the list and select settings.)  First change the name to add I think IMAP to the end.  so the email address plus IMAP Now to confirm what I have just assumed click on the server settings entry and confirm the account is actually configured as IMAP. So if I am correct, the first account is configured as IMAP and the second is POP. </p><p>Your IMAP account is not to be considered an archive,  everything in it is fully synchronized to the gmail server.  You will also find that gmail maintains an all mail folder which contains all your archives. All of your mail in the account actually.  Folders in gmail are really populated on the fly from the all mail store.  Gmail does not actually have folders.  It just pretends. </p><p>POP mail has ever been able to download sent folders, that is a limitation of the <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC </a>that defines POP mail. Clients like Live and Thunderbird make a copy of outgoing mail and place it in a sent folder,  but said copies are not related to the sent you see online and any mail send using a browser is not reflected locally at all. </p><p>IMAP is defined in this <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC</a> I am only including the links as you said you are always curious.  I do not claim any real expertise in those documents,  but they are an excellent source of ""how it is supposed to be"" rather than how it is.  One of the first things you learn is the standard is rarely fully implemented and Microsoft will always apply it in a slightly different way to everyone else.  Talk about contract law,  just try Microsoft interpretations of things they feel limit their right to innovate.  Interoperability is not their goal. </p><p>Can we just go back to the beginning here?  What exactly are you trying to achieve? I can I think see where you are,  but where exactly to you want this to go.  That is what is not clear. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
