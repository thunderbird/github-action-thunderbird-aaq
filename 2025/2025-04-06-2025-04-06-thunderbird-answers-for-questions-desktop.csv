But here goes nothing. </p><p>Certainly the account showing in the second entry appears to be a pop account (it even says it in the top of the screen),  but the first entry with all of those archives is more likely to be an imap configured account using the same email address.  What has me more than a little lost is why you do not have Thunderbird retrieving your Optus mail directly.  It seems odd to have gmail retrieve it and then download it to Thunderbird from that account.  You will still need to use Optus to send mail from your Optus address is a large part of why I am confused. </p><p>If you are using POP  are those 400 odd unread emails in the second account showing as read in the first? </p><p>go to account settings. (right click the first account in the list and select settings.)  First change the name to add I think IMAP to the end.  so the email address plus IMAP Now to confirm what I have just assumed click on the server settings entry and confirm the account is actually configured as IMAP. So if I am correct, the first account is configured as IMAP and the second is POP. </p><p>Your IMAP account is not to be considered an archive,  everything in it is fully synchronized to the gmail server.  You will also find that gmail maintains an all mail folder which contains all your archives. All of your mail in the account actually.  Folders in gmail are really populated on the fly from the all mail store.  Gmail does not actually have folders.  It just pretends. </p><p>POP mail has ever been able to download sent folders, that is a limitation of the <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC </a>that defines POP mail. Clients like Live and Thunderbird make a copy of outgoing mail and place it in a sent folder,  but said copies are not related to the sent you see online and any mail send using a browser is not reflected locally at all. </p><p>IMAP is defined in this <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC</a> I am only including the links as you said you are always curious.  I do not claim any real expertise in those documents,  but they are an excellent source of ""how it is supposed to be"" rather than how it is.  One of the first things you learn is the standard is rarely fully implemented and Microsoft will always apply it in a slightly different way to everyone else.  Talk about contract law,  just try Microsoft interpretations of things they feel limit their right to innovate.  Interoperability is not their goal. </p><p>Can we just go back to the beginning here?  What exactly are you trying to achieve? I can I think see where you are,  but where exactly to you want this to go.  That is what is not clear. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Is that it? </p><p>It is easily done,  but while I see folk trying to do it all the time I am reluctant to tell them outright how because usually the are trying to fix something that such an action is either unlikely to fix,  or is not what they really want at all. So what exactly is the desired outcome? </p><p>You can always use the profile manager to create a new profile (which is the same as starting over and is non destructive)  once you have things sorted you can also use it to remove the now unused profile. </p><p>See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is as clear as mud. </p><p>I will try without promising anything.  The first issue ios not all junk/spam processing is done by Thunderbird.  If you use a large provider like Yahoo or Gmail or even Outlook you will be subject to provider spam filtering.  Because IMAP mail is syncronised  some of the stuff in your junk folder will probably have been put there by your provider. </p><p>In the case of Gmail, I have observed they do not flag such mail as SPAM with the SPAM flag, so mails in the SPAM folder show with a grey SPAM flag if GMail put it there.  </p><p>If that is not complicated enough some antivirus products play in that space as well.  Usually with SPAM and SCAM setting in the antivirus program and code they inject into the running Thunderbird like the malware they say they are trying to prevent.  Like most commercial software what they do and how they do it is something of a black hole. </p><p>Then you finally get to Thunderbird junk tools.  Thunderbird's filtering uses your address book as a white list. (Which address books are used can be fine tuned in account settings)   If a persons address is in your whitelist mail from them is never considered junk.    </p><p>One of the reasons I do not routinely use a yahoo mail account is they also use the address book as a white list,  but mine is empty on the Yahoo web site, so their spam filter just insists on placing things in SPAM that do not belong there and I have no intention of having an extra address book online just to fix their spam filtering. </p><p>Ok, that is the short version.  Did it help at all? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

I have used advik pst to mbox converter, but nowhere I'm told what the mbox file look like. I mean there is a Migrated folder, with a subfolder, with a subfolder, with 3 subfolders and in one af theese subfolders there are msg files (my mails from Outlook). It is my perception that Thunderbird use msf files, so I'm really not sure which file or folder to pick. </p><p>I have tried a couple of weeks to changes from MS to Linux (used a lot of hours I don't have), but my mail is causing only troubles and the conveniences following several different suggestions has so fare been that LInux totally crashed my PC and I had to reinstall everything from scratch. I have also been forced to reinstall Thunderbird twice so by now I'm not sure that Linux is for regular PC users. I'm normally the person our neighbors and family turn to when issues with PC's, but this.... </p><p>Think I need it explained like to a 7 years... I have a 6Gb pst file - how do I get that into my Thunderbird? </p><p>Best Max </p>",max174,false,0,0
