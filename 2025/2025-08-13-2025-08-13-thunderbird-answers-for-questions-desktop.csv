The long and short of it is that it was a password hiccup with google's smtp server rejecting what it got for a password. </p><p>After following several different paths trying to fix it, these steps worked (but I have no clue why): 1)  I deleted the existing google smtp entry from Thunderbird leaving only smtp from other providers. 2)  I then went through Google's machinations and generated a new password. 3)  I checked that my google smtp was set up correctly BUT changed the authentiation from Normal password to Oauth2 (then checked that all my IMAP and POP accounts use OAuth2) 4)  I sent a test email to and from myself and was prompted for a password then supplied the google generated one. </p><p>The test email went through so I sent all the saved drafts I had and they all went through. </p><p>What I gleaned from this is that Google may (or may not) have changed and no longer allows normal password as an option.
