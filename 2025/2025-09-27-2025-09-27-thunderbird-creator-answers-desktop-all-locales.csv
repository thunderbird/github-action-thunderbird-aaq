Eventually, usually, it comes back and continues to work for a time. But I never know when it will happen again, how long it will last each time, etc. It is only barely useable like this. </p><p>I'm running it in Troubleshoot mode and not seeing any real difference.

Opening Thunderbird I get a popup saying its from Yahoo and it has my Yahoo mail address on it. If I delete that popup by clicking the upper right ""X"" another popup takes its place. And so, and so on. One popup after another all for various Yahoo products. Meanwhile Thunderbird can not be used - can't write, can't send and can't receive anything on Thunderbird. </p><p>What do I do??? If I reinstall Thunderbird I will loose all my saved emails, and anyway will that work??? </p><p>I have run my antivirus, checking my whole disks, and nothing. </p><p>How do I get rid of the Yahoo popups????

It typically happens when downloads and copying are occurring in the background. TB seems to be giving too much priority to the background making everything in the foreground slow and frequently stop completely. When composing a message a typed line does not appear for 20 seconds or more making it difficult to prevent typing errors. I have not had this problem with older versions of TB. My local message store is well over 20 GB. I expect some operations to take awhile but none should slow or stop response to immediate entry. When TB logs into servers and there are network problems input at the keyboard is often ignored completely. To regain control I have to call the task manager and do end process and restart TB. At first I thought this was a problem with one computer. I have several with a mix of several versions of Windows (7,8,10 and 11) with several email addresses and have the same problem in varying degrees with all of them. If this is a setting problem I have no clue how to fix. I have been using TB more than a decade and feel confident about how to do most operations. I'm using version 140.3.0esr (64bit). </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,1767824;,IKBadger
