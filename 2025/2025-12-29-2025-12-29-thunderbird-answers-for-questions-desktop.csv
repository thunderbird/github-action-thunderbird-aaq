You should see an mbox file for each gmail label. </p><p>The easiest way to get mbox files into Thunderbird is by copying them in the file system. You want to put them in the ""Local folders"" directory of your profile. Close Thunderbird, copy the files, re-start Thunderbird. To find where your profile is on disk, Help (menu) &gt; Troubleshooting information &gt; ""Profile folder"" in the first table &gt; ""Show in [...]"" </p><p>I have seen this procedure fail because Thunderbird did not recognize the imported files. Make sure that the files do not have an extension. If Thunderbird does not recognize them, you can use the add-on ImportExportToolsNG to import the mbox files. </p><p>Please ask when you have more questions. </p><p>I do not use gmail and I have not used take out, but I believe that all the information that I have shared is accurate. </p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Oh, I read more carefully and see that you may already have all the files that you need.
