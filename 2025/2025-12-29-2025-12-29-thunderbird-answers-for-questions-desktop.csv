I would suggest you unzip everything you got from google and then import.  Note it looks to me like your instructions have essentially exported the all mail folder.  None of he individual labels will be included in that file is my guess.  So each email address will import a a folder with the email address in the name and everything in the account under that one folder. Google by default do not create a separate zip for each label,  so you might find your takeout to be in rather indigestible chunks. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
