The two very small .css files need to go into the /chrome folder in Thunderbird's root menu in Users/[your name]/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird. (If you don't have a folder called ""chrome"", make one) Follow the instructions on the github page. Some additional tips: <strong>First </strong>rename your old userChrome.css and userContent.css to .._old.css or similar (I didn't have the latter in my root folder). On the github page, <strong>do not simply right-click the two files and Save link as..</strong> (this would save the entire github page).
