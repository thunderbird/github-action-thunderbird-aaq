Some additional tips: <strong>First </strong>rename your old userChrome.css and userContent.css to .._old.css or similar (I didn't have the latter in my root folder). On the github page, <strong>do not simply right-click the two files and Save link as..</strong> (this would save the entire github page).

However, all this does is export address book to a file in OneDrive. ... </blockquote> <p>When you click on 'Export', a new window opens and you might find it auto opens on perhaps somewhere you last used to save something, but that is irrelevant - you can choose where you want to save the file. eg: Onedrive or Desktop or any folder on your desktop. You do not have to use the location that is initially presented - this is the window where you choose: Where you want to save the file Choose the filename - you can change the filename choose the 'save as type' eg: Comma Separated .csv  (useful as this can be uploaded onto any email client etc) or LDIF if it's only going to be used by someone using Thunderbird. </p><p>OneDrive is only really useful if you want to store backups on the Microsoft Server otherwise don't use it. That's also handy if you have more than one computer, so can access ondrive to see stuff.  I always advise, do remember if you lose access to Microsoft account you lose access to everything stored on it. So always worth having a separate backup to an external drive of anything really important.  </p><p>Finally, create an email and attach the file.  To attach - left click and hold down on file and drag over email and release to drop to attach. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
