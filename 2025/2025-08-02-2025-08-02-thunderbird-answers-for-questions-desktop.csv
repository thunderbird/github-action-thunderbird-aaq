Instructions and two .css files are on this page: <a href=""https://github.com/cybrkyd/thunderbird-supernova-grey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cybrkyd/thunderbird-supernova-grey</a> This uses the colour #e7e7e7 but this can easily be changed to a colour of your preference. The two very small .css files need to go into the /chrome folder in Thunderbird's root menu in Users/[your name]/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird. (If you don't have a folder called ""chrome"", make one) Follow the instructions on the github page. Some additional tips: <strong>First </strong>rename your old userChrome.css and userContent.css to .._old.css or similar (I didn't have the latter in my root folder). On the github page, <strong>do not simply right-click the two files and Save link as..</strong> (this would save the entire github page).  Copy the actual lines to a text editor and save them using the appropriate names in the /chrome folder </p><p>This works really well. </p>",Helvetica,true,0,0
