However I'd really appreciate input from this community regarding our specific scenario before I make a move. I have a programming background but I fumble blindly trying to be his email admin. </p><p>The problem we are trying to solve is his current email setup chokes on send/receive almost daily, after which he has to use Task Manager to kill a hanging Outlook.exe process. After years of tinkering I'm about to give up on Outlook completely. I think the main issue is how Outlook interacts with his Archive. His Archive.pst file is 4GB and Outlook saves it as one big file even though it has many subfolders which are essentially his filing system. Outlook is configured to save everything directly to a local laptop which is backed up regularly and we want to retain this local feature. Thunderbird is attractive because: 1. it supports the local drive storage  2. it appears to have options for transferring his Outlook archive and other folders over in such a way that he can continue to search and access them as needed.  He would also like to be able to: 1. move new emails received in Thunderbird into the same (transferred) archive subfolders he has now 2. send and receive new emails without the program choking 3. view and send new emails from his Android phone (without accessing the archive) 4. transfer his email contacts from Outlook and manage them in Thunderbird Can anyone see red flags with this in Thunderbird?
