Overall, I hope to improve the overall support for Chinese usage, thanks to the development team for their excellent work. </p><p>　　期待Thunderbird成为国际性的软件，目前Thunderbird电脑端在中文使用上面临以下问题： 　　1、软件界面未完全汉化 　　2、邮件编辑器对中文支持没有段落首行缩进支持，手工空行两格但对方收到的邮件显示并不是想达到的首行缩进两空格的效果。 　　3、现在的邮件编辑器太古老，有无计划升级的更现代化和直观化，对表格的支持也相当弱和笨拙。 　　总体来说希望提升对中文使用的整体性支持，感谢开发团队的优秀作品。 </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",gc35766
