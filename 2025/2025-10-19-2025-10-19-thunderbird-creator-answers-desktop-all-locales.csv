I don't know what happened. They were there the last time I checked my email about 5-10 minutes earlier. I've looked in other folders but they aren't there either. Aso tried repairing the folder with no success. Is there a way to recover these emails?  I've been trouble shooting / googling this all afternoon and kept seeing reference to a recovery tool. Is this something already on Thunderbird or  software I need to purchase? I really want to know if there is a way to recover the lost emails and how to do it.

Is there a safer snap version to use.  </pre> <p>I was about to add a new account to thunderbird and checked for cves first and saw this  CVE-2025-11715. MY version if affected but there is no way to update my installed  version to a fixed release in the software centre. </p><p>I see 140.4.oesr-1 is available in the drop down menu on the mozilla thunderbird snap page in software centre but its onlt latest/candidate and I dont understand if that means is stable/ok to use?  </p><p>Clicking on this version  doesnt update my current one and instead requires a new install. Is the best idea to go ahead and install this version? and do this would i need to remove the current account in thunderbird and unistall the app before I he one i install a new one?  </p><p>i have autism and worry about installing the wrong thing, so thought the ubuntu snapstore as the version was verified by canonical would be stable and secure.  I am nervous of downloading from browser in case i download a fake or mess it up in some way fake and dont know how to use termial that well.  </p><p>Please can I get help on the best way to proceed to use a version of thunderbird that is definitly safe to use and add accounts to?  Also should i stop using the version 140.3.1esr if the security risk is high, if i dont uninstall it should i stop using until and update is made? do i need to unistall that version it before installing any newer version or could i keep that with its account and install the 140.4 version to add the new account to?  </p><p>How can I check regularly that what I am running is safe to use if ubuntu doesnt update for months even  when there are security risks?
