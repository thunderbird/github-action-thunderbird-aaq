I see 140.4.oesr-1 is available in the drop down menu on the mozilla thunderbird snap page in software centre but its only latest/candidate which i think means not yet stable? Is this a safe choice?  </p><p>Clicking on the 140.4. version from snap doesnt update but requires a new install. Is the best idea to go ahead and install this 140.4 candidate version rather than continuing with 140.3.1? Should i just hold off using thunderbird until my installation recieves an update? I do really need to use it so this is a last resort.  </p><p>i have autism and stuggle with processing information and worry about installing the wrong thing. i thought the ubuntu snapstore as  verified by canonical would be stable and secure.   I am nervous of downloading from browser in case i download a fake site or mess it up installing and I dont know how I would be sure I had an authentic version. Im not great at using the terminal and knowing if ive input correctly either. It seems that apt would just fetch snap version anyway.  if downloading from site was the best way to procees, do i need to uninstall snap first and how can I check its not a corrupted file?  </p><p>Please can I get help on the best way to proceed to use a version of thunderbird that is definitly safe to use and add accounts to?  </p><pre>Also could my passwords and emails already be compromised by using 140.3.1esr and should i stop using it immediately? would an update be enough to remove the threats?   </pre> <p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;security;,thunderbird,security,en-US,"",brew
