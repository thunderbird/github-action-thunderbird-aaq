But even then, LibreOffice lists only an outdated certificate (which is not visible anymore in the Thunderbird builtin certificate management). </p><p>Therefore I've checked with certutil the nssdb entries in the Thunderbird profile folder. Surprisingly, there is an outdated SMIME to my mail address contained (no further, even not the current one). Even after removal of those outdated certificates via the builtin certificate management.
