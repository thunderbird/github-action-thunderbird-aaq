After some investigation by myself, it could be a problem within Thunderbird certificate management itself. </p><p>Situation: I've a current and some outdated SMIME certificates for my mail address. But all for one mail address. </p><p>Because the current SMIME certificate is not accessible for LibreOffice, I removed temporary all of my outdated SMIME certificates from Thunderbird by the builtin certificate management, i.e. the list of my personal certificates was set to one entry (=the current certificate) in Thunderbird. But even then, LibreOffice lists only an outdated certificate (which is not visible anymore in the Thunderbird builtin certificate management). </p><p>Therefore I've checked with certutil the nssdb entries in the Thunderbird profile folder. Surprisingly, there is an outdated SMIME to my mail address contained (no further, even not the current one). Even after removal of those outdated certificates via the builtin certificate management. The current certificate is never listed; always only an outdated one. </p><p>This looks like a difference between builtin certificate management and nssdb within the profile folder (or may for another storage location of the certificates)? </p><p>certutil -L -d ~/.thunderbird/myprofilefolder --email mymailaddress </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p><p>Environment OS: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS Thunderbird: 128.12.0esr (64-Bit) </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Snowbiker

The email account is set up correctly and emails can be sent and received. </p><p>The computer also runs Cashflow Manager which can email invoices and statements. When we attempt to send an email from Cashflow Manger, a new Thunderbird email window opens up but it appears to be in a non-formattable state. You can't write in it or do anything with it. You have go to the file options and do ""Open As New Message"" to then be able to do anything with it.  </p><p>Why are new emails opened in this manner different to opening them from within Thunderbird itself? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1747487;,info5587

It only happens with some folders - =not all of them. I can drag and drop the folder to the location I want but for some folders one of the following things happen. </p><p>1. The folder immediately return to its original location, that is, I can't move it at all or 2. I cannot drop it where I want but I can drop it in a nearby location and then shuffle the folders around it so it ends up where I want it. For example, if I want to put folder Y between folder X and Z, I can't drop it in that location but I can drop it before folder X (or after folder Z, or in any other nearby location) and then move other folders around so I end up with the correct X,Y,Z order. </p><p>In ALL cases, when I exit Thunderbird and then restart it, the folders re-appear in their previous locations - that is, as if I hadn't moved them at all. </p><p>This only happens with some folders - and not necessarily the same folders each time - sometimes folders which were in their correct location re-appear somewhere else, but this is a rare event and I've only observed it a couple of times. I have disabled 3rd party backup software in case this was reverse synchronising the files - it was putting the old versions back (a long shot!) but the problem persists. </p><p>I have done a clean re-install and are using the default locations provided during the installation. </p><p>I could try to create new folders, move the emails to those folders, delete the existing offending folders and then rename the new folders to the desired names and then try move them to the desired locations but this is just a hack and maybe it won't work. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",richarda01
