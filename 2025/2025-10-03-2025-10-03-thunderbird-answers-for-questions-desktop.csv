For the IMAP account, they live on the server with a copy on PC. Deleting from IMAP does not affect the POP account, because the message has already been downloaded to PC. You do not need both. If you want all messages accessible from PC or phone or other PCs, keep the IMAP account. The POP account could possibly have desired messages that have been downloaded from server. My recommendation is to go with the IMAP account for its flexibility. But, if you only use the PC as your primary repository for saved messages, then POP may be your choice. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The idea of the design was probably to remove anything surplus to requirements and simplify the view making it less cluttered. Sometimes ideas are tried out but then removed upon feedback from users. Even if you had focus in another area eg: Message Pane - that selected folder becomes a grey background and the thin blue line also turned grey.  </p><p><strong>How to know which folder is currently selected whether you have focus on folder or not.</strong> </p> <ol><li> A selected folder will have a blue background highlight if window has focus or grey background if not the focus. </li><li> The selected folder name will appear in the far left tab above the Folder Pane as the current mail tab. </li><li> The selected folder name will also appear in the 'Message List Header' toolbar - positioned on left side with the number of messages.  </li></ol> <p><br> I've found the code which created it in 128* - rather extensive - I'll test it out - If anyone does it first post info. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,1,0
