I was looking to cleanup the install (version 140.5 esr) and noticed an older version of the app still exist on the computer (version 68.4). will deleting this version have any implications.  This computer was originally Windows 10 but has been upgraded to Windows 11 when the problems seemed to start appearing. </p>,thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",gsawkins
