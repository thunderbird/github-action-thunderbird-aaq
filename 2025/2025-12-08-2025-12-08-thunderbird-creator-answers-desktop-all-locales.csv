The underlying email account is a gmail account and I have used Manage Identities to set it up so that by default emails show as coming from the club's domain-related account, e.g. manager@sportsclub.uk.  All seems OK; however, the email one receives from the account shows the correct signature, but still as coming from the gmail account Curiously though, if one hovers over the email address it shows the name of the 'manager identity' even though the display shows the name of the underlying gmail account.   Everything is set up exactly as I have in my personal Thunderbird account which has several identities and all work as expected.  The only difference is that my email account is a Plusnet one.
