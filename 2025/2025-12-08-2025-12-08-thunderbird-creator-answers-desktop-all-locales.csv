This computer was originally Windows 10 but has been upgraded to Windows 11 when the problems seemed to start appearing. </p>,thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1784587;,gsawkins

The underlying email account is a gmail account and I have used Manage Identities to set it up so that by default emails show as coming from the club's domain-related account, e.g. manager@sportsclub.uk.  All seems OK; however, the email one receives from the account shows the correct signature, but still as coming from the gmail account Curiously though, if one hovers over the email address it shows the name of the 'manager identity' even though the display shows the name of the underlying gmail account.   Everything is set up exactly as I have in my personal Thunderbird account which has several identities and all work as expected.  The only difference is that my email account is a Plusnet one.  So I assume that it must be a feature of gmail.  Does anyone know if that is the case and what one can do about it? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",Nocton

When I reset my O/S (win11) I had to reinstall Outlook from Office, all paid up and legal.  Nothing but problems trying to get my backed up PST file from previous Outlook.  System kept trying to get me to subscribe to Windows 365 crap.  I had standalone 2024 version of office.   When I installed Thunderbird (I have it on laptops and other computers), I entered my email and voila, in about 1 minute I was sending and receiving emails.  I had spent 6 hours on Outlook, even using AI (Copilot) to help me. I was SO IMPRESSED, that for once I donated to Thunderbird, $30 CAD. </p><p>Now, I used Mailstore to get my pst file, something I could NOT GET OUTLOOK to do, and have it available to export to Thunderbird, or for TBird to IMPORT from the pst.  Neither one worked, telling me that TBird didn't have a profile for the transfer, or some such notation. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated.  Like many of you, my whole communication life is in those emails (I have about 40 folders where I saved stuff). </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",bobfound
