As mentioned in the original query, the source of these problem messages is a major UK supermarket (probably the biggest), and I have been receiving these messages from them for years, without any problems until recently.  Some are 'Special Offers', but most of them are information about forthcoming deliveries. </p> <blockquote>But what you are seeing is what is talled a web bug.

If I understand this correctly, Tesco are monitoring what and when I read these messages; I don't really have a problem with that, but the implication is that Thunderbird is not handling these scripts correctly, especially since I don't have the same problem if I use a different mail client. </p><p>I have tried clicking on messages sent to me some time ago and the problem occurs with them too.  However, I have only noticed this problem recently (within the last week or two), so I would say that something must have changed in Thunderbird since then. </p>",bugzilla5,false,0,0

I see nothing in the release notes for V146 that would constitute anything like the changes you refer to.

My Thunderbird looks much like it did when V3 was released in 2009, apart from having a serious lack of color for the toolbars.  I still have the three pane view of my mail I had when using version2  with essentially the same lists. Everything has been replaced and someone thought a multi line mail list would be good.  I hated it when it came out and I still see it as a space waster that offers me nothing but aggravation,  but it took about two clicks to get back to my old list view so I am not really bothered, except I had to make those clicks. </p><p>Here is a link to the Thunderbird releases archive.
