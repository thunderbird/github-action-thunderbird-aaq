Please add an option so I can  use the ""X"" as a QUIT for TB - the current 3 button quit is very awkward as well as unnatural.

If the original email was given the darkened text as new emails get, I would see it.  As it is, some folks have sent me new messages because I did not respond to their reply.  It's a little embarrassing.  I would simply like all incoming email to be shown as individual incoming emails so that I can easily see them.
