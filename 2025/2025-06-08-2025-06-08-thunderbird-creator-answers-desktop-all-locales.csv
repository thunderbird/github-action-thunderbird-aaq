But back in February 2025 my previous Dell desktop died, so had to purchase a new Dell desktop running Windows 11.   Then I downloaded Thunderbird and installed it on the new desktop then copied over the profiles that fortunately had been backed up just a week prior.  It has been working fine.  (When I installed the Thunderbird on the new computer I did not realize there was a difference between ESR (Extended Support Release) channel and Release channel; I just downloaded and installed what I came upon.) </p><p>However, around 5/28/25 got a pop-up message that stated something to the effect it is recommended I upgrade to Thunderbird Release. </p><p>Should I download and install a new Thunderbird from the Release channel?  Will the existing profiles work with the Release channel Thunderbird?   Thank you for your help. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1740161;,jpwvols

They never showed up, but the new folder heading shows there are 19 messages in the folder.  If they are there they are not visible.  And they are gone from the Inbox. </p><p>I can't find a way to search the entire Inbox to see if they are in a different sub-folder, but I've checked the nearby sub-folders and they aren't there.  Nor in the Trash or Junk folders.  I've also tried the index repair for the new sub-folder and also the Inbox.  That didn't help.  I also closed out Thunderbird and restarted it, That didn't help either. </p><p>Any suggestions? </p><pre>John </pre>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jbclem
