But back in February 2025 my previous Dell desktop died, so had to purchase a new Dell desktop running Windows 11.   Then I downloaded Thunderbird and installed it on the new desktop then copied over the profiles that fortunately had been backed up just a week prior.  It has been working fine.  (When I installed the Thunderbird on the new computer I did not realize there was a difference between ESR (Extended Support Release) channel and Release channel; I just downloaded and installed what I came upon.) </p><p>However, around 5/28/25 got a pop-up message that stated something to the effect it is recommended I upgrade to Thunderbird Release. </p><p>Should I download and install a new Thunderbird from the Release channel?  Will the existing profiles work with the Release channel Thunderbird?   Thank you for your help. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",jpwvols
