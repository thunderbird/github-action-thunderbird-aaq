You should always keep it simple. The menu should always be at the top because that is what people use to decide to do.  </p><p>The younger generation think a search bar is the starting point for finding things. You do not remember the desktop environment I grew up and still live in successfully today. </p><p>The main advantage if living on a desktop today is that is free of charge and I do not need to revise my hardware every 10 years let alone every couple of years because it still works and it is secure. </p><p>I have arranged my life so I do not have to move to dramatically reduce my carbon foot print. If you accept that environment desktops rule OK. </p><p>Also only having emails or events or tasks planning or finance on the screen gives you way more room to read things. I use two monitors because I have a lot to read. I choose what I want from a menu. </p><p>I use a search bar once I am on the right window </p><p>There should at least be an option to have the menu at the top. </p><p>It is the sort of decision that could loose you customers because it makes your product harder to use for those of us who grew up in a desktop environment not on a Web Page. And people who have to work in the US Federal Government. </p><p>In my web browser I always have the menu visible and at the top. Then the tabs then the URI editor The search bar is the third line down not at the top. Followed by the bookmarks toolbar then the web page. </p><p>Having the same format in every product would makes your products consistent and easier to transition between. </p><p>In the latest version of Thunderbird things have moved  around for what to me seems zero benefit. </p><p>I would repeat an old maxim that has made me one of the more efficient programmers. If it ain't broke don't fix it. </p><p>I am efficient because I spend most of my working out what not to change because it works. So actual hardly do anything. </p><p>One reason banks liked OS/2, was because it never needed rebooting. One bank had an OS/2 server running continuously for 10 years. When it eventually did break they had trouble finding it because no one had touched it  for 10 years.  </p><p>Enough ranting, thank you for what is otherwise a great product. Just be open to the fact that some of your customers would be happier if you just applied security updates and left the UI exactly the same as it was for the rest of time. </p><p>Having written utilities for Citrix Systems Inc. that ran exactly the same business logic running on 8 OS. It would be nice to have the same level of consistency in Thunderbird.  </p><p>The issue with that goal is you structured your menus differently on Linux than Windows, so making things  completely consistent would cause some unavoidable movement of items in the menu. </p>",aanngcle-firefox2;mozilla98;,true,false,false,;solver_id:3886290;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:135.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/135.0,3,0,1,,,
