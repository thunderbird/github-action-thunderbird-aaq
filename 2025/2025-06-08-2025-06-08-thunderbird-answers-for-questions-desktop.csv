So hopefully those workers who do so much for us can fix it.   I just went back and looked at old emails and there is no url html address as the first line just the name of the company that sent it, The html address was in the 2nd line.  It could be that Thunderbird is looking at the wrong line and does not know it is an html page. Wirst possibility is that emails from another server is doing something that is wrong. de Barry </p>",vk2aab,false,0,0

Specifying to keep on server applies to POP, yet accessing from multiple devices requires IMAP. Have you logged in online to Yahoo to see if messages are there? If not, then they're only on your PC. Tell us more details. On your question, an IMAP account does keep PC and server in sync, not in Local Folders, but in the account's folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My idea was to install T-bird in order to be able to backup my yahoo mail in local folders (as well as using T-bird for ad-free using of my email). Initially, I understood from the descriptions, that I would need to use POP to do so. When I did, I only saw my Yahoo inbox, not my other folders of my yahoo account. sfhowes from this forum was kind enough to tell me that I need IMAP in order to see all my other folders. So I deleted the POP account and created a new, IMAP account. I then just selected all my yahoo folders and pulled them into my Local Folders in T-bird. I thought I would be copying them, but instead it appears that the respective folders on the yahoo server (which are still there) do not contain any data any more. The only data on the yahoo server which is still available is the messages in the inbox. All the other data seems to exist exclusively on my PC. I verified online at yahoo from my PC and as well with another mail-app on my mobile. Is there a solution for this? Can I simply ""copy"" (move?) them back to my yahoo account? I'm a bit scared now to just try it... Is there a recommended way to do what I intended? That is keeping a backup of my yahoo mail folders on my PC now. Are Local Folders not the place to do so? Sorry if I'm ambiguous in my descriptions and thanks for your patience! Thanks and kind regards, Pat </p>",pwarborg,false,0,0

So you moved emails off the server. </p><p>Imap account folders synchronise with server folders and can only show whatever is on server. </p><p>If you want to get copies of important emails into the 'Local Folders' mail account: In an imap folder, right click on a batch of highlighted emails and use 'COPY TO' and select the relevant folder in 'Local Folders' account. Then check you have good copies. If it fails then at least you can recopy them. </p><p>If you want to put copies of emails back on server then do the above in reverse. Select batches of highlighted emails in the 'Local Folders' account and use the 'COPY TO' and select an imap account folder. Please note uploading back onto a server may take a while as servers do tend to have limits on how much can be uploaded via imap. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Now I still have 2 folders with about 4000 messages each left on the yahoo server. For whatever reasons, not everything was copied and as a result, the complete folder does still exist on the yahoo server, while from one of them, about 3500 messages were COPIED and about 1500 from the other. When I try now what you suggested, I cannot copy a single additional message from the missing ones to the Local Folder. When I try (right clicking a message in e.g. ""Sent"" on the yahoo server and clicking Copy To and select the ""Sent"" folder  in my Local Folders) I get the error: ""A folder with that name already exists. Please enter a different name."" To be clear: I do not try to move the folder, but only a single message from the yahoo server to the Local Folder (where the folders have identical names, because I did pull the complete folder from the server to local, as described above). Any idea what's the problem here? Any suggestion, how I can complete the 2 folders in my Local Folders which were not copied/moved completely? Thanks and kind regards, Pat </p>",pwarborg,false,0,0
