So hopefully those workers who do so much for us can fix it.   I just went back and looked at old emails and there is no url html address as the first line just the name of the company that sent it, The html address was in the 2nd line.  It could be that Thunderbird is looking at the wrong line and does not know it is an html page. Wirst possibility is that emails from another server is doing something that is wrong. de Barry </p>",vk2aab,false,0,0

Specifying to keep on server applies to POP, yet accessing from multiple devices requires IMAP. Have you logged in online to Yahoo to see if messages are there? If not, then they're only on your PC. Tell us more details. On your question, an IMAP account does keep PC and server in sync, not in Local Folders, but in the account's folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
