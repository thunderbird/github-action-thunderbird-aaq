So hopefully those workers who do so much for us can fix it.   I just went back and looked at old emails and there is no url html address as the first line just the name of the company that sent it, The html address was in the 2nd line.  It could be that Thunderbird is looking at the wrong line and does not know it is an html page. Wirst possibility is that emails from another server is doing something that is wrong. de Barry </p>",vk2aab,false,0,0

Alas, pressing F11 does not get my TB to full screen: all it does is add a calender/events to the right of my messages of my old/existing email account (on the still reduced-size Thunderbird screen). </p><p>When I click on the square in the top-right corner of TB, it goes to full screen on my (less than two-year old) Dell laptop. When trying to add a (gmail) email account to my laptop TB that I've been using on my desktop for many years, I get stuck in the final step, a full screen labeled Google account.  </p><p>It shows the new email address I'm trying to install, and then the words  This will allow Mozilla Thunderbird Email to: - Read, compose send ...  (etc.) - See, edit, download ... (etc.) - See, edit, permanently delete ... (etc.) followed by a line saying: By clicking Allow, you allow this app and Google to use this information.   </p><p>That's all I can see on that screen: I don't see an 'Allow' button that I can click, I can't move the image or change its resolution in order to get an  Allow button to appear. I'm stuck ... basically unable to use that (for me precious email account) on my laptop. </p><p>Any other suggestions would be appreciated. </p>",fdw2,false,0,0

And whether the window pops up in thunderbird or the browser is something I can't say for sure: it could be either one.  To get out of that full-screen pop-up, I press ESC and that gets me back to thunderbird. </p>",fdw2,false,0,0

Specifying to keep on server applies to POP, yet accessing from multiple devices requires IMAP. Have you logged in online to Yahoo to see if messages are there? If not, then they're only on your PC. Tell us more details. On your question, an IMAP account does keep PC and server in sync, not in Local Folders, but in the account's folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
