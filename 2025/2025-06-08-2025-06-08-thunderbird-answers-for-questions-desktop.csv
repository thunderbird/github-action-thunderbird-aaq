I just went back and looked at old emails and there is no url html address as the first line just the name of the company that sent it, The html address was in the 2nd line.  It could be that Thunderbird is looking at the wrong line and does not know it is an html page.

The link does not have to be in  the first line, it can be anywhere but the first one found is sent to the browser.

My idea was to install T-bird in order to be able to backup my yahoo mail in local folders (as well as using T-bird for ad-free using of my email). Initially, I understood from the descriptions, that I would need to use POP to do so. When I did, I only saw my Yahoo inbox, not my other folders of my yahoo account. sfhowes from this forum was kind enough to tell me that I need IMAP in order to see all my other folders. So I deleted the POP account and created a new, IMAP account. I then just selected all my yahoo folders and pulled them into my Local Folders in T-bird. I thought I would be copying them, but instead it appears that the respective folders on the yahoo server (which are still there) do not contain any data any more. The only data on the yahoo server which is still available is the messages in the inbox. All the other data seems to exist exclusively on my PC. I verified online at yahoo from my PC and as well with another mail-app on my mobile. Is there a solution for this? Can I simply ""copy"" (move?) them back to my yahoo account? I'm a bit scared now to just try it... Is there a recommended way to do what I intended? That is keeping a backup of my yahoo mail folders on my PC now. Are Local Folders not the place to do so? Sorry if I'm ambiguous in my descriptions and thanks for your patience! Thanks and kind regards, Pat </p>",pwarborg,false,0,0

Okay, I understood that what I see in the imap-folder are the folders as they exist on the yahoo-server. That's why I was referring to them as I did. I did not attempt to copy any folders directly out of a browser. Let me illustrate the initial issue. The first image shows the top part of the imap-folder in T-bird. It shows that, even after my action of dragging it into the Local Folders, it is still in the imap folder (thus on the yahoo server), while only a PART of it appears copied to a new folder named ""Sent"" in Local Folders (second image). The same is true for a second folder, which also still exists in the imap-folder (image 3) and is created in addition in Local Folders (image 4) and there also just contains a PART of the messages of the respective folder in the imap-folder. Having this clarified, I did exactly what you show in your screen dump. That results in the error mentioned before.
