None of the emails coming in to the inbox are staying there. They are instead going into a subfolder of my inbox set up to filter online orders coming in to my business. When I try to move them back to the inbox they disappear nowhere to be found. </p><p>I don't know what to do. Who is supposed to help in situations like this? My business is being affected by losing emails into cyberspace and all my message filters going wacky. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1754813;1754816;,chochian

In some cases, the scrollbar even overlaps the subject line of that last email. This often makes it difficult or even impossible to click on the email, as the scrollbar covers a large portion of its title. This issue occurs when the ""Quick Filter"" feature is enabled. If I disable ""Quick Filter,"" a proper space appears between the last email's title and the scrollbar, and the issue no longer occurs. </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,"",shokun252606
