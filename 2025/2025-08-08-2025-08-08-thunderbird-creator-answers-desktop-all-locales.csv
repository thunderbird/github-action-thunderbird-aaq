In some cases, the scrollbar even overlaps the subject line of that last email. This often makes it difficult or even impossible to click on the email, as the scrollbar covers a large portion of its title. This issue occurs when the ""Quick Filter"" feature is enabled. If I disable ""Quick Filter,"" a proper space appears between the last email's title and the scrollbar, and the issue no longer occurs. </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,"",shokun252606

It typically happens with emails with either images or ones that fetch some sort of dynamic content. </p><p>I've repaired folders, rebuilt summary files, removed parent.lock, restored a backup of both program and message files from two days prior to the problem starting, reinstalled my current version of Thunderbird, rebooted the computer by holding the power button down for a minute, tried Thunderbird Troubleshoot mode, tried Windows 10 Safe Mode, disabled all add-ons, cleared my cache (under disk space), cleared my startup cache, created a new profile, compacted folders, and (temporarily) gave it a free pass through my Firewall.  Nothing had any effect. </p><p>The Thunderbird Error console doesn't show anything in particular different between emails that load fully and those that do not. </p><p>To say I am at my wit's end is an understatement.

I fill this in, click on test, and Thunderbird comes back with an available POP3 configuration it found, which is not the one I have been using for several years.  I try it out, Thunderbird tests the password and finds something in the password or configuration that doesn't work.  I try a manual configuration the the correct pop3 and smtp addresses and get the same result.  I am at a complete loss at this time.  This is all I get when I try to open Thunderbird--none of the usual email boxes, calendar, contact screens at all.  I cancel the setup and get an option to continue and potentially not have access to some features, or exit.  I click on exit and a new screen opens with file tabs for email, calendar, address book, and tasks.  Looks nice, but there is no data brought forward on any of these tabs, and email looks like it has not been set up (no surprise--no inbox or preview box). </p><p>Any ideas on how to complete his setup and bring the data in, or on how to go back to the previous release and uninstall the new version? </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,"",WoodardLT
