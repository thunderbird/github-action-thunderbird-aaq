I prepare my bulletin in Word then copy (Ctrl-C) and paste (Ctrl-V) into Tbird. This may be the problem  If I copy and paste from Notepad the results aren't pretty but the rh margin problem goes away. </blockquote> <p>Please note that Microsoft add a load of code which is often not required and cannot be used by anything other than microsoft software.  So many parts of the code are not able to be understood by anything other than Microsoft products. It also bloats emails as well. </p><p>Therefore, if you use eg: MS Word, it's advisable to use the 'Paste without formatting' option. In a new Write mesasge: Via top Menu Bar Edit &gt; Paste without formatting  OR via keyboard shortcut command (Ctrl+Shift+V) </p><p>Notepad will work because it's a simple text editor. But the question is why are you composing emails in Word or Notepad in the first place. </p><p>In Thunderbird, you can create HTML emails and use the Table formatting option to help position content. You can save the email as a draft if you have not completed it and come back to it later on. OR better still, if this is something you do on a regular basis then save as a template. Then you can re use on a regular basis and just edit the required sections and it will save you a load of time. But it's worth remembering not everyone uses the same fonts or same font size to view emails or uses the same email client and some will use webmail. Others may view using HTML but others will auto prefer to view Plain Text. </p><p>Please use the type of font likely to be available on most systems eg: Arial Do not attempt to force a specific font size on people. Also remember Word uses pt (point) and Thunderbird uses px(pixel) for font size. Example 12pt = 16px When sending please make sure your sending format is 'Both HTML and Plain Text' Located in Settings &gt; Composition - 'Sending format' section. </p><p>As a heads up - In Thunderbird, you can force received emails to use a specific font and you can force a minimum sized font, eg: anything that uses 12px or less will display as 14px. I force tables to be centralised and can choose to display using a dark theme, so background is dark and text is light. You can also force a Plain Text or Simple HTML view. I'm just saying, keep it organised and simple as it is just an email. </p><p>Otherwise, you can attach the document and I would say using pdf is a reasonable solution as it's possible to download Adobe Reader to read emails. Not everyone has MS Office installed, I use OpenOffice Writer, it can open MS docs but you cannot completely guarrantee it looks exactly the same as when composed in MS Word. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
