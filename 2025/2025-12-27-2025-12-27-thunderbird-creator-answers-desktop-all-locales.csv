The process I followed is install thunderbird, go to help menu, trouble shooting , open file (profile), close thunderbird, go up 3 levels to roaming, then paste the copied file in the thunderbird file and close. then open thunderbird. It still wants me to set my account up and there is no data. Is there something I'm missing. Thanks for any help in advance.

This problem seems to occur when clicking on emails from a particular UK supermarket (<a href=""http://tesco.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tesco.com</a>) and the web page opened has a long and complicated URL, but the page contains only a single pixel which shows up as a white dot on a black background. </p><p>Obviously, it is likely that there is something strange about that source, but the problem doesn't occur if I click on the same email in a different email client (in this case Evolution). </p><p>I have tried various Settings as advised by web searches and also the solutions suggested in Thunderbird Help (Troubleshooting Mode and Troubleshooting Information). </p><p>I am running Thunderbird 140.5.0esr (64-bit) on Kubuntu Linux 24.04. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bugzilla5

I repaired the folders and eventually, the index completed to full success.  It is about 2.5 GB. </p><p>It still doesn't seem like some searches are working correctly, but maybe there is an explanation.  Most of my email other than IMAP sent emails is stored in my Local Archives. </p><p>Using the term ""klinghardt"" for example, global search shows only results from 2025, a total of 992 items, and does shows some from both IMAP and Local Archives.  From Local Archives, it shows 255 items in the ""From Visitors 2016"" folder.  It does not go back prior to 2025.   </p><p>However, there are many earlier emails in that folder before 2025 with the same term.   </p><p>Using the term ""klinghardt education"" does show messages back to 2017 and a total of 524 of them in the ""From Visitors 2016"" folder.  Why would using just ""klinghardt"" show less than ""klinghardt education""? </p><p>The ""From Visitors 2016"" folder has almost 140K messages from about 10 years. </p><p>If I go ""From Visitors 2016"" folder and do Search Messages with the same ""klinghardt"" term on subject alone, I get 982 returned messages that go back to 2015.  I believe this is not using GLODA but am not certain. </p><p>If I go to Quick Filter on Sender, Recipients, Subject, I get 1251 items going back to 2015. </p><p>If I see messages over many years with Search Messages and Quick Filter, why do I only see messages from 2025 when I use the global search? </p><p>To make things a bit more complex, there is also a ""From Visitors"" folder in Local Archives that has hundreds more with terms from 2011-2015 that don't seem to show up in the global search results at all with either of the above.  If I use ""klinghardt academy"" though, some results do come back from the ""From Visitors"" folder.  Total of 32K messages in the From Visitors folder. </p><p>I have already tried many options from the documentation and suggested by ChatGPT but am hesitant to do anything that could not be reversible.  </p><p>At this point, I am unclear on what here is a problem vs. an explainable behavior. </p><p>I would be grateful or any thoughts or next steps you might suggest. </p><p>Thank you and happy holidays,&nbsp;:) Scott </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,"",sforsgren
