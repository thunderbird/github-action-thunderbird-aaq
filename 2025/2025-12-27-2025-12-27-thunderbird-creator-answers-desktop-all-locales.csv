The process I followed is install thunderbird, go to help menu, trouble shooting , open file (profile), close thunderbird, go up 3 levels to roaming, then paste the copied file in the thunderbird file and close. then open thunderbird. It still wants me to set my account up and there is no data. Is there something I'm missing. Thanks for any help in advance.
