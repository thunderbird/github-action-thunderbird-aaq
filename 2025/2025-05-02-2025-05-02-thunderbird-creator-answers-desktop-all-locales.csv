Ik heb toen met hulp van dit forum van alles geprobeerd om hem terug te krijgen, maar tevergeefs. Toen ben ik maar helemaal opnieuw begonnen. Erg vervelend, want ik was dus ook mijn adressenboek kwijt, en er waren allerlei mails waarop ik nog moest reageren en dat kon ik dus niet meer. Enfin, uiteindelijk draait alles weer. </p><p>Gisterochtend zette ik mijn computer aan, en tot mijn verbazing werd gevraagd om mijn wachtwoord te geven. Dat heb ik gedaan, en daarop kwamen de nieuwe mails binnen. Maar tot mijn grote verbazing bleek dat mijn hele inbox was vervangen door die zoekgeraakte inbox van drie jaar geleden! Ook mijn adressenboek was vervangen door het oude zoekgeraakte exemplaar, waarin dus alle nieuwe contacten ontbreken, en waarin ik allerlei inmiddels overleden contactpersonen terugvind, alsmede mailadressen die inmiddels niet meer werken. </p><p>Ik moet natuurlijk mijn mailbestanden van eergisteren weer terug hebben. Ik heb nu geen idee hoe ik dat moet proberen te doen. Ik weet dat die zouden moeten staan in de map met 8 willekeurige tekens en dan .default, en die map is van vandaag. Er is ook nog een vergelijkbaar mapje van 1 september vorig jaar. Er is ook een map 'Crash Reports', met als meest recente bestand 'InstallTime20250404084548'. </p><p>Wie helpt me uit de misère?
