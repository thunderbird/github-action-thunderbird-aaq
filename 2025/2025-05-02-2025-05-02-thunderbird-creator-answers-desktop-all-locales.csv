Dat heb ik gedaan, en daarop kwamen de nieuwe mails binnen. Maar tot mijn grote verbazing bleek dat mijn hele inbox was vervangen door die zoekgeraakte inbox van drie jaar geleden! Ook mijn adressenboek was vervangen door het oude zoekgeraakte exemplaar, waarin dus alle nieuwe contacten ontbreken, en waarin ik allerlei inmiddels overleden contactpersonen terugvind, alsmede mailadressen die inmiddels niet meer werken. </p><p>Ik moet natuurlijk mijn mailbestanden van eergisteren weer terug hebben.
