However, I went to the profile folder and searched ""archive"", and found both a archives.msf and a archives (no extension) file with dates of yesterday associated to a generically named account--and not ones for all similar accounts.  So I deleted both files and opened Thunderbird and the folder is gone.  So this did solve the problem...and hopefully didn't create a new one! </p><p>Thank you Matt. </p>",thunderbirder,false,0,0

Try to see if antivirus software is running on that same pc machine and firewall configuration is available there to for to change settings so the direct connection cannot be disturbed or by maybe to implicated or to much settings in one time that could block these sending to your receivers. I had mine sendings to and receiver's did accept that mail yes that worked great on my device.I do use Antivirus to. What version do you use? What version of macbook do you use? Try to configure firewalls or Antivirus  software to Thunderbird that it is allowed to use that port that is configured. As it is said in that pop up it could be a typo in your email name or login name. </p><p><br> Greetings Googlethunderbird </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

The easy way is to use windows file explorer. exit thunderbird, locate the message file in the profile, COPY it and then paste it into the Mail\Local Folders folder of the other PC. OR, you could use the addon, importexporttools NG, to export the mbox from one computer and then import it on to another. Just highllight the message folder and right click and select the importexport option to export mbox on first pc and highlight local folder on other PC and rightclick and select import. AND, if t he other computer isn't using thunderbird, use the online tool to read mbox  files at <a href=""https://www.mbox-viewer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mbox-viewer.com/</a> </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
