So, to clarify my question, Can I change my existing Thunderbird POP account name and email (from username@q.com to username@myctl.net) and retain all existing folders and emails in the changed account? Some server settings would also be changed. Or, do I need to set up a new TB account? </p><p>Rick, I would definitely make backups before any account changes are made.
