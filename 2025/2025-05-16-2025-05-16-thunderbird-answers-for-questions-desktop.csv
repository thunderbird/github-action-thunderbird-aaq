But the isssue is does Thunderbird know of these profiles or are they ""lost""  the method of deletion varies. </p><p>.Default was replaced with default-release as an extension of the default (created on install) profile in V68 I think it was.  It was implemented with the profile per install </p><p>So before you remove them,  go to the about profiles section in Troubleshooting information on the help menu  and see if those profiles are listed.  If they are, you can delete them from there.  If not you can delete them from the file manager,  which is I assume how you have identified they exist. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
