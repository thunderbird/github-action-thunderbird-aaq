But the ATT support folks fall back onto some sort of service obligation in their terms of service telling you that if web mail works then they have met their obligation to supply email.  This other process is also theirs entirely,  but they rarely if ever advise their own customers that they require you to use this procedure.  They recommend using oauth in their web pages,  but that will only work if you use Yahoo server names not ATT ones. </p><p><a href=""https://www.att.com/support/article/email-support/KM1240308/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.att.com/support/article/email-support/KM1240308/</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I know Google does not work well with a VPN and I would assume Micrsift's offering would be equally troublesome with regard to a VPN.  My personal experience when helping friends I have found only fully uninstalling Norton actually disables it, despite the product saying it has disabled itself.  I have variously had issues with it's mail scanner dropping pop mail connections when a malformed email is encountered in the mail to be downloaded.  I have also seen it block everything because it's mail scanner needs to have you manually trust it's self signed encryption certificate. I have seen it's firewall component block Thunderbird because of software updates that changed the version number after the second decimal point, so this forum get a flow of I can not get mail topics after every update because Norton's blocks the ""unknown"" version of Thunderbird in it's firewall component.  That usually resolves itself after few days when it get a message from home that the new version is Ok.

The nice thing about IMAP is that you can access the account from any computer or your phone (there is now a Thunderbird app for Android - and probably IOS).  I have not noticed any downside to IMAP and am planning to transition my old account over to IMAP.

You need the real version, available at <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a>   There is a choice there: the Extended Support Release version, or the Monthly release version. The ESR version is for less frequent updates and stability, while the  monthly always has the lastest new features. The look and feel is the same. Once installed, you are prompted to setup your account. For gmail, on the account setup, you just need to enter your name and email address and click to proceed. If you encounter problems, just post the screenshot where you're stuck, and someone here will help. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
