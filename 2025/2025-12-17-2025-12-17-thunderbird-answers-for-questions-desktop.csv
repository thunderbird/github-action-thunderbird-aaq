I have no true solution, but I suggest rightclicking on each folder and checking properties to verify that thunderbird thinks they're both assigned to the account. Also, check to see which one thunderbird is using for sent messages. Once you can verify the unneeded one, you may be able to rightclick and delete. But this may also be a case where this bug may be fixed in an upcoming release - but I don't know that.
