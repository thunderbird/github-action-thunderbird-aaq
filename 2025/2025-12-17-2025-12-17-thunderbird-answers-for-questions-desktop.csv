At first I thought something maybe was wrong with my computer, but obviously this is a bug.  As you say, it can have dire consequences, if you don't notice it and go to the garbage folder and retreive the lost emails from there. Pleaser fix this! </p>",torden2,false,1,0

There already is one that does the same thing: it's the check box at the top of the email list.  The question is: How do you get Thunderbird to stop AUTOMATICALLY selecting the next email after it deletes one? Is there a way to do that? </p>,woody8297,false,0,0
