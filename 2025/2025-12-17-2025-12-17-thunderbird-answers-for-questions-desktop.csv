If the addressbook needs updating, that can be done as well. Provide real details on the components involved, which normally are message folders and addressbooks. Let us know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The second profile is imap, thinking that opening the pop profile would download the messages on the server. If that's true, could it be that easy?  </p><p>But then there will be sent messages to move over, since they won't be on the server.  </p><p>The address book does not need updating. </p>",atscomms,false,0,0

The sent messages on the POP account can be copied to the new POP profile if done prior to sending messages. If you have the old POP input folder, those can be merged into the new POP input folder. Clarify what you want and I'll try to give the details for that. My inference is that your goal is to restore the POP account and remove the IMAP account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
