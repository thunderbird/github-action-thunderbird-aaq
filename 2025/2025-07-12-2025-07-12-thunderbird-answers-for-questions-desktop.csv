In hindsight, that may have been the issue, dunno now since I picked out and installed 6 SASL plugins first.  Would you think that Normal Password vs Encrypted choice would have caused the ATT SASL error? The error went away after reboot... </p>",jeff-g,false,0,0

David gave me detailed instructions, and I followed them exactly, but the folders were not transferred. Is there a way to export (or import) folders one at a time? I have had Thunderbird on my old PC for many years. Could the problem be that this version is too old? I am clutching at straws here. Obviously, it is very important that I get these folders over as, for example, I have software keys in emails from years ago that I need when I install the apps on my new PC. </p><p>It will be an incredible pain if I have to send hundreds (thousands?) of email messages to myself. </p><p>Any ideas? </p><p>With hope, </p><p>Robin McLeod </p>",robinm16,false,0,0

If some components were not copied, that indicates that thunderbird was still active. You can verify that the copy worked by looking at the copied folder in Windows File Explorer. In the thunderbird\profiles\&lt;profilename&gt; folder will be the imapmail folder with IMAP content, the Mail folder for POP content, and the Mail\Local Folders folder for local folders. Can you do a screenshot of the copied folder?   </p><p>Yes, there are manual ways. You can use Windows File explorer to copy each individually when thunderbird is not running and paste into the Local Folders folder on the other PC. The addon, importexporttools NG, does the same thing from within Thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In the Profiles there were two, so I looked at them both. I went to the Mail folder in each and - none of my many folders were there. So that seems to explain why none were getting moved over! They must be somewhere else. But where? I'll hunt around to see if I can find them.
