In hindsight, that may have been the issue, dunno now since I picked out and installed 6 SASL plugins first.  Would you think that Normal Password vs Encrypted choice would have caused the ATT SASL error? The error went away after reboot... </p>",jeff-g,false,0,0

Thanks for the input, learn something every day. </p>",jeff-g,false,0,0
