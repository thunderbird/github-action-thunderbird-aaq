Snap applications are designed to be confined, meaning they have limited access to the host system's resources. This isolation helps to improve system security by preventing applications from interfering with each other or with the underlying operating system. I have no experience with Snap, but my guess is that (Snap) Thunderbird does not have proper access to the new profile location. How to rectify this, I don't know. </p><p>This probably wouldn't have happened with the vanilla Thunderbird version from <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/</a> The default profile location for this version is ~/.thunderbird. So if you want to try that version, you'd have to manually adjust profiles.ini to make the new profile location known to Thunderbird. Or use profile manager for that by creating a new profile, and use the new location as profile directory. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

That would be true only if the account was IMAP. That's problem 2.  </p><p>On problem 1, you have messages on the PC, but not on the server. The account is POP. To copy the messages back online, you need to create an IMAP account alongside the POP account. Then, you can COPY (not move) the messages from PC to the online inbox. At the same time, since the sent folder, for whatever reason, is on the server, you can copy them from the online sent folder to the PC's sent folder. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Is there a possability to merge the two accounts or move the send folder from one accout to the other, so that I only use for example only the imap account? </p><p>Now after reading the articel I think I prefer imap more than Pop.

As I wrote the settings in my Telekom/t-online account are Pop AND Imap (see above secureimap und securepop). Both seems to be activated.
