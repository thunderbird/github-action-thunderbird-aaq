1492899,2025-02-12 17:47:58 -0800,2025-02-12 18:09:27 -0800,Spam control,"<p>I am not sure whether this question should be classified under ""Email and messaging"" or ""Settings"" but here goes. I am getting a lot of emails from people and organizations that I would rather not open and look at or am bothered to do so. And setting up filters for each and every email sender would clutter up the workings of Thunderbird creating a significant lag during startup and mail download (am using IMAP). Is it possible to have a sender or organization set up in the message filter which then during the next go-around returns the email to sender with a subject line saying ""Returned to sender, no such address""? Thanks for any consideration of this request. James </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1711715;,smnckl

My addresses are not like they use to be just come up names and addresses have disappeared which is frustrating. If I am unable to find out what is wrong I will go to Gmail only, which is a shame I have used TB for years.

It still showed up on the tool bar when I hover over the Tbird icon, but it will not click up onto the screen. I can no longer reply to emails or write a new email. I tried a system restore, which restored the old Thunderbird display (which I like better than the new one anyway) but it did not fix the problem, I still can't reply or write. I tried starting Tbird in safe mode but that didn't work either. I can't reply to messages or write a new message. All I can do is see incoming messages. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",edbdchi
