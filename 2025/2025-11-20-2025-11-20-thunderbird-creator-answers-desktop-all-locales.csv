I'm not talking about displaying a threaded view. What I'm getting is that when I select an email to view, Thunderbird opens up a small group of emails from the same sender.

It means that in order to view an email, I have to poke it once, and then again... assuming that the one I want to read is at the top of the displayed list.

Last night when I brought it up, a new screen said ""Unable to Connect"" followed by good information like check the network connection, firewall, etc., make sure Thunderbird is permitted to access the web. Plus, the PC bubble communicated ""Authentication failure when trying to connect to server <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a>"". </p><p>I have checked everything (looked around) and all seems fine.  However, I am a ""senior"" and maybe I missed some communication along the way. I am getting emails on my iPhone and on the Xfinity website, but Thunderbird is not connecting to the server now.  Do I need to change any settings? </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,1780814;1781016;1781017;1781056;1781353;,jsgarden800

Now, I cannot send anything to anyone - including my email provider. The message is: ""Outgoing server (SMTP) error. The server responded: (C18) RBL restriction: Blacklisted by Internal Reputation Service"" I verified all the settings (though I changed nothing prior to the problem) and all is correct.  I've checked with tech' support and they verified that my address does not have a Blacklist.  I've restarted the program and restarted the computer.  I've also donated several times to Thunderbird.   Before I change clients, I thought I'd see if anyone had a fix for this.
