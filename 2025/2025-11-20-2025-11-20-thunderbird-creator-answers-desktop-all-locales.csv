I'm not talking about displaying a threaded view. What I'm getting is that when I select an email to view, Thunderbird opens up a small group of emails from the same sender. It doesn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to it either... emails displayed might be from the same day or different days. It's extremely irritating! It means that in order to view an email, I have to poke it once, and then again... assuming that the one I want to read is at the top of the displayed list. Why has TB  started doing this, and how do I stop it? Thanks in advance, Ian </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",IanStar
