It took about 3 days before I submitted this question, because I couldn't find a pattern.  Some e-mails would crash within 20 words; sometimes it seemed like the spelling correction was doing it; other times it coincided with TB auto-saving a draft; other times, I would load a saved draft and TB would hang almost immediately when I began to type more words in it.  But then I had an e-mail that crashed every time I tried to type the word ""shouldn't"" and I thought I'd found the trigger. </p><p>I had done both changes at the same time, so in order answer your question, I just a minute ago reset accessibility.force_disabled to 0 and started a new e-mail, and TB hung about 30 seconds letter, no ' in the text.

Years ago one of the leading brands blocked all images if they came from the same link (which was common with marketing mail that used the same link with your personal identifyer in it and some keywords to actually fill in the correct image.  So full tracking was covered by linking the image to a script rather than an image.  Just as facebook does with their logo on webpages. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0
