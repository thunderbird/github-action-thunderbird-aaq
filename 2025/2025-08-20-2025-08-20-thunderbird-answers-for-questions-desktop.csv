The newly installed is V146, while the original Thunderbird is 128.  So, I guess it never updated itself, which may explain why I started with problems about a week ago when my filters stopped working.  And within the past couple of days it started sending ""Authentication Failure"" messages.  This was before I tried to backup [edited email from public] @gmail.com.

So, I downloaded it again and found that the version was later than the Thunderbird I still had open.  The original is V128; the one from today is V146.  Apparently V128 wasn't updating even though it was set for auto updates. When I checked C:\Users\***\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Thunderbird all I had was a Crash Reports file. When I checked C:\Users\***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles I have two, both with todays date.  One has 48 items, the other only 1. I will include screenshots of all of this. Several days ago I started to experience problems with my filters not working.  And since yesterday I'm getting a pop-up with ""authentication failure"".  This has all occurred with V128.  This was before I tried a backup/restore of one email account today. I suspect that V128 is corrupted in some way.  If so, I have the feeling that I'm going to start over with V146.  I'd like not to as I'll be loosing all of my local folders and mail. Maybe there's something else I'm not doing? Thanks. </p>",k75ride,false,0,0
