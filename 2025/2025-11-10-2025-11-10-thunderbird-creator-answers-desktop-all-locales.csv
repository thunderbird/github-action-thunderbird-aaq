When I am using my laptop rather than my desktop computer, all of the folders are there and the messages, when deleted go to the ""Trash"" folder and are removed from the Inbox. I have been looking for a way to get all of those folders that are normally a part of the other accounts that I have on Thunderbird without success. Is there anyone here that knows how to restore those additional folders to the Gmail account that does not currently display them? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tstory

I then started having trouble receiving emails that I knew were sent and I thought that maybe my old emails were kept on the server too long and were taking up too much space on the server so I went into Thunderbird to change the settings to delete emails that had been on the server for 2 weeks. Thunderbird is now locked onto the Account Settings page and I can't get out of it. As soon as I click on the page I get the ""Thunderbird not responding"" message so I close the program. I've tried starting Thunderbird in safe mode with no result.  I downloaded the latest version and reinstalled Thunderbird but as soon as I start the program it takes me straight into the ""frozen"" Account Settings page that I can't get out of. I have gone into The Profiles folder and I've included a screenshot of what's there. The latest profile was created when I tried to change the Account Settings. Can I delete that profile and go back to the one created on 9/6/2025? </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,"",geoffreysmith
