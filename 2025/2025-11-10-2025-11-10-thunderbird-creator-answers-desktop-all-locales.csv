I then started having trouble receiving emails that I knew were sent and I thought that maybe my old emails were kept on the server too long and were taking up too much space on the server so I went into Thunderbird to change the settings to delete emails that had been on the server for 2 weeks. Thunderbird is now locked onto the Account Settings page and I can't get out of it. As soon as I click on the page I get the ""Thunderbird not responding"" message so I close the program. I've tried starting Thunderbird in safe mode with no result.  I downloaded the latest version and reinstalled Thunderbird but as soon as I start the program it takes me straight into the ""frozen"" Account Settings page that I can't get out of. I have gone into The Profiles folder and I've included a screenshot of what's there. The latest profile was created when I tried to change the Account Settings.

Again, all has been working fine. </p><p>Very recently I created a new account (Account B) and directed this to use Account A's Thunderbird inbox (via Account B's Server Settings, Advanced...) and selected the ""Include this server when getting new mail"" option. All looked fine at that stage (I did not think to go back and check Account A's Server Settings, Advanced...). Under Account B's Copies and Folders I also directed Account B to use Account A's folders. </p><p>As I expected, Account B did not have any of its own folders created. </p><p>On selecting Account A in the folder pane and checking for emails (via the Get messages icon at the top of the folder pane), only Account B was checked (as evidenced by the status bar messages scrolling through at the bottom of the window). This was most perplexing - had I somehow lost a whole bunch of messages that I knew should be sitting in the inbox at the mail server? </p><p>However, I soon found the culprit. Account A's Server Settings, Advanced.... were completely greyed out (and so effectively disabled) - see image attached. </p><p>So setting up a 2nd email account to download to 1st email account's inbox disables downloading of 1st email account's inbox messages.

To repair them, I have disconnected from our e-mail provider (<a href=""http://Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">Proton.me</a>), &amp; reconnected to it.

I have tried to compact the folder &amp; to repair the folder, but these actions have no effect.  How do I get her inbox clear of this problem, so I can focus on her bigger problem? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",doncodling

In office365 business accounts, it is possible to setup general mailboxes like sales@ etc. and grant access of said mailbox to user account of choice.  OAuth2 login for these accounts does not exist, instead, login occurs via user accounts and then the shared accounts appear for such user, it is not possible to login with or setup shared mailboxes with a password as it is normal (licensed) user accounts. According to Chat-GPT5 it is difficult or impossible, it says login name would be something like licensedusername@company.com\sharedmailbox@company.com, so for example, eric.smith@contoso.com\sales@contoso.com But that doesn't seem to work, like a silly suggestion, <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> server then asks for credentials of said eric.smith@contoso.com\sales@contoso.com as if it were a single username! so if you have any info if that is possible, any work-around, pls let me now!

I was looking at spark, but their interface is not as helpful. Thoughts!
