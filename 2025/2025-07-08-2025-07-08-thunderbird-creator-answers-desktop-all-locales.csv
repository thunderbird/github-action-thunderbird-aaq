I thought doing this first would be my best bet before migrating to a personalised email address. </p><p><strong>Brief History</strong>: I installed TB, with the Default Profile using a g-mail address. The g-mail Server is set to never delete Emails. The Default Profile is set to synchronise so that all data is, supposedly, downloaded onto my computer. </p><p>Email Attachments have not, fully, downloaded even though individual Email Sizes appear to include Attachments. I have to open an Email and then open an Attachment before the Attachment will even <em>begin</em> to download. </p><p><strong>Current Situation</strong>: I do not want to have to open 8K+ emails, even after culling junk etcetera, on a case by case basis. I do not want to have to go all Anakin Skywalker on the sandpeople @ g-mail. </p><p>I know how to get info from Settings and Account Settings. Please tell me what you require me to go fetch. </p><p>Thank  you! Brian. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",stexcela51
