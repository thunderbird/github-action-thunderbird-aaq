I thought doing this first would be my best bet before migrating to a personalised email address. </p><p><strong>Brief History</strong>: I installed TB, with the Default Profile using a g-mail address. The g-mail Server is set to never delete Emails. The Default Profile is set to synchronise so that all data is, supposedly, downloaded onto my computer. </p><p>Email Attachments have not, fully, downloaded even though individual Email Sizes appear to include Attachments. I have to open an Email and then open an Attachment before the Attachment will even <em>begin</em> to download. </p><p><strong>Current Situation</strong>: I do not want to have to open 8K+ emails, even after culling junk etcetera, on a case by case basis. I do not want to have to go all Anakin Skywalker on the sandpeople @ g-mail. </p><p>I know how to get info from Settings and Account Settings. Please tell me what you require me to go fetch. </p><p>Thank  you! Brian. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",stexcela51

PST files are only supported by Microsoft Outlook—so if you're switching to another email client (like Thunderbird or Apple Mail), moving to a cloud-based platform (like Gmail or Office 365), or simply want a portable, readable backup (like PDF), converting the PST file becomes essential. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",WilliamsWelsh

I need to add a second POP account.  When I go through the motions of New Account &gt; Email, the 'Account Hub' box appears were I can enter the name of the account and the email address.  When I click Continue, I get  two green ticks and it says Looking Up Configuration then it changes to a spinning blue circle.  This stays like this indefinitely.  I click the escape key to close the window.   </p><p>Then if I go back to the New Account &gt; Email procedure, it takes me back to the same box with the spinning blue circle and I can't start the process again.  I have to restart Thunderbird to try again, but it still won't work.  I have tried starting in Troubleshooting mode and disabling add ons but like the blue circle I am going in circles.   </p><p>I have two computers and on the other one I have the original Release version.  This adds the second POP account with no problem.   </p><p>I am on Windows 11.  Can anyone suggest something to try? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ambience.fires
