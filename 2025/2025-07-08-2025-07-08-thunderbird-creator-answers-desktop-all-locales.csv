The first problem I had was importing my address book (contacts list) from Outlook. I needed help because Thunderbird would not import the CSV file created by exporting my Outlook address book. It was necessary to re-organize the columns to match Thunderbird's layout - what a pain. Next, I created nine group addresses using Thunderbird's tools. I successfully tested at least one of the groups by sending a test message to the group. A few weeks later (now) I needed to add new members to a group, but found the group had no members. All of my nine groups exist, but have no members. Is there anything I might have done to empty all of the group addresses?
