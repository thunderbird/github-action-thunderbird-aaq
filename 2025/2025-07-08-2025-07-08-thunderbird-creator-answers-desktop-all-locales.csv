I thought doing this first would be my best bet before migrating to a personalised email address. </p><p><strong>Brief History</strong>: I installed TB, with the Default Profile using a g-mail address. The g-mail Server is set to never delete Emails. The Default Profile is set to synchronise so that all data is, supposedly, downloaded onto my computer. </p><p>Email Attachments have not, fully, downloaded even though individual Email Sizes appear to include Attachments. I have to open an Email and then open an Attachment before the Attachment will even <em>begin</em> to download. </p><p><strong>Current Situation</strong>: I do not want to have to open 8K+ emails, even after culling junk etcetera, on a case by case basis. I do not want to have to go all Anakin Skywalker on the sandpeople @ g-mail. </p><p>I know how to get info from Settings and Account Settings. Please tell me what you require me to go fetch. </p><p>Thank  you! Brian. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",stexcela51

The first problem I had was importing my address book (contacts list) from Outlook. I needed help because Thunderbird would not import the CSV file created by exporting my Outlook address book. It was necessary to re-organize the columns to match Thunderbird's layout - what a pain. Next, I created nine group addresses using Thunderbird's tools. I successfully tested at least one of the groups by sending a test message to the group. A few weeks later (now) I needed to add new members to a group, but found the group had no members. All of my nine groups exist, but have no members. Is there anything I might have done to empty all of the group addresses? I'm more than frustrated trying to learn how to use Thunderbird. </p><p>Thank you, Stephen Thompson </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",stevet2486
