Please fix asap. </blockquote> <p>Answered at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1548557#answer-1781550"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1548557#answer-1781550</a> </p>",wsmwk,false,1,0

The email does not exist in the Thunderbird IMAP account because it does not exist on server. How may this have occurred&nbsp;? </p><p>Your mail account in Thunderbird must have been set up as an IMAP mail account which means it can only display whatever is on the server. All folders in an Imap account synchronise with all folders of same name on server. That's the same view as if you had logged onto your webmail account via a browser. </p><p>You phone has a mail account accessing the same email address on same server. However, if you have set up a mail account on phone that uses the POP protocol, then the default setting would be to access only server 'Inbox' and download mail and delete copy off server. You need to check the account settings on phone to see if you can select an option to 'Leave copy on server' OR the only alternative is to remove the Pop account on phone and recreate it as IMAP.  </p><p>But remember, when using an IMAP protocol, if you delete any email from the phone then it will synchronise with server and delete off server which means when you log on to Thunderbird account, that same email will get removed because it does not exist on server. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The date is only relevant in the branch the message is in, and I think that is honored as far as it goes as the image below shows,  messages a shown in date order if there are multiple replies to the same email. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-11-22-21-51-23-4c228d.png""> </p><p>Message threading is a very old concept and it was what brought me to Thunderbird about 20 years ago from Outlook Express and Text only outlook before that after messing with Netscape Navigator and Eudora for a time. I had started writing my own email program when Thunderbird came along.  Thunderbird was slow and homely (it is still both IMO), but it offered the message threading which was driving my efforts so I adopted a new mail client and stopped my development efforts.  </p><p>But I digress as tends to happen when you get into ancient history. Each mail has a references header (well replies and forwards do when sent from a mail client that is even attempting to be standards compliant and most get one from the SMTP server when the mail is submitted if there is none.  Hence email from Outlook finally fell into line as little as about 5 years ago.  Microsoft had their own propriety threatening along with their TNEF encoded messages. Some very  basic text editors from the last century simply did not support the header but it is now fairly ubiquitous.  Thunderbird I think inherited the support from being a NNTP USENET client. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet</a>. </p><p>The references header is the driving force behind the threaded view.  See <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2076#section-3.6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2076#section-3.6</a> although there are other setting in the prefs that can be used to modify the defaults.  They are not actively supported any longer as far as I know,  but they still exist. This discussion <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Message_Threading"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Message_Threading</a> and this wiki page dating from around 2008 and really still relevant. <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Message_Threading"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Message_Threading</a> </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236849"" rel=""nofollow"">This bug</a> also has links to open and closed bugs relating to threading.  In is a wealth of information if you have the time.  I do not. </p><p>The references header <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-4.6.3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-4.6.3</a> as it related to email and <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1036#section-2.2.5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1036#section-2.2.5</a> as it related to USENET. The USENET is really the complete description, even though we are talking email. </p><p>Now how to represent this data in a logical and sensible way. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-11-22-21-48-47-9d1ee9.png""> This is the time honored way,  and the way the table view uses. Although historically there were lines connecting each of the leaves and they can be sen in the Betterbird images. It shows not only the relevant messages,  but how they relate to one another, and date is not really a consideration because the relationship is to other mail not a date.  It is more about which email is a reply to another than anything else.  The part that is missing are the messages that are stored in other folders that only become visible if you right click a message and choose view in conversation from the menu.  Only then do you really get the entire thread. </p><p>The problem as I see it is this representation of a mail a a multi line card. Everything folks expect of a thumb driven phone interface with lots of room to press your finger.  As a mouse driven desktop interface it is a space wasting screen real-estate grabber. The Linux/ Touch screen crowd love it. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-11-22-22-26-08-623e08.png""> In my opinion this is a meaningless and confusing representation of the relevant data.  It provides almost no clues as to what messages are of where they fit in so folks assume that it is a mess and Thunderbird just can not sort by date.  Thunderbird can sort by date just fine.  What Thunderbird can not do it provide a coherent and understandable view of its data in this newer card view. Aat least not one I can understand, and I already have the preconceptions of the hierarchical links. Betterbird can do it,  but Thunderbird is still getting there. <a href=""https://www.betterbird.eu/media/img/multiline-view.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.betterbird.eu/media/img/multiline-view.png</a> </p><p>And of course no discussion involving the card view is complete without a link to the user experience discussion from several years ago which demonstrates yet another poor implementation of a threading view  on the topicbox website. Comparing what was suggested there to what was delivered is in itself enlightening but their attempt at threading makes Thunderbird look positively wonderful. <a href=""https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/ux/Tdb49a4666565e68e/cards-view-ui-plans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/ux/Tdb49a4666565e68e/cards-view-ui-plans</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Uninstall my current (possibly simplified version) of TB and download the new, complete one, with all functions included – or...?</strong> </p><p>As I previously described, my version of TB, as far as I can see, only has the email function installed (<em>Spaces Toolbar</em> is completely empty, no Calendar, no Address Book, no Tasks, etc. – and of course no email accounts either because I haven't added any yet – but all the other functions should, somehow, still be there – or?). </p><p>When checking in the Terminal, I find that the version of TB I am using is: “<em>Mozilla Thunderbird 140.5.0esr</em>” (which fully corresponds to the information in TB: “<em>140.5.0esr(64-bit)</em>”. If I check in more detail (Terminal: “<em>snap info thunderbird</em>”), I get, among much other information, the answer: </p><pre>  latest/stable: 140.5.0esr-2 2025-11-19 (877) 237MB -   latest/candidate: 140.5.0esr-2 2025-11-21 (895) 237MB </pre> <p><br> Same result regardless of the method: I have the latest version. Still, I miss the above-mentioned features. Do I have another, specially adapted – simplified – version of TB for Ubuntu, or have I missed something here? </p><p><em>If</em> it is the case that I have a simplified version of TB - is it then the best option for me to use the version of Thunderbird that is available for download from Mozilla's website? And in that case, should I first completely uninstall the version of TB that is included in Ubuntu (i.e. the one I have right now and that I described above)? Ideally, I would like to install TB directly from the Terminal in Ubuntu, snap or Flatpak (I gues APT is out of the question), - as long as it is possible to get the same version, i.e. the full version that is downloaded from <em><a href=""http://mozilla.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.net</a>.</em> </p><p><em>If</em> instead it is the case that I have the full version of TB, what is the reason why I am missing the above-mentioned features - or perhaps rather, why these are not displayed in the Spaces Toolbar? </p><p><strong>Some further thoughts – with a follow-up question regarding “Tasks”</strong> </p><p>When it comes to synchronizing with the cloud, I currently have no such needs, but if that were to change, it would be good to know the possibilities you describe.  Thanks!&nbsp;:) </p><p>On the other hand, I plan to use TB for my mobile phones as well. However, this is a little further along as I will also make changes regarding the OS for these (to something alternative, for example ""LineageOS"" – to the extent that such an OS is compatible with TB, a question that I will certainly return to when the time comes). </p><p>When it comes to content (data) from Outlook, only the address book (contacts) will be transferred (if I remember correctly, there is a guide for this on Mozilla). Apart from the aforementioned address book (and emails from my email accounts, which are just a regular IMAP operation), my Thunderbird will start from scratch in everything else. </p><p>Mozilla provides a lot of information about TB and on the page: “<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/getting-started-thunderbird-main-window-supernova"" rel=""nofollow"">Getting Started with the Thunderbird main window (Supernova and newer)</a> it is clear that all the functions I am looking for above are included in the latest version of TB (which is the reason for my troubles mentioned above). </p><p>On the <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/topics/calendar/thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">Calendar page</a> there is also some useful information for new users about the calendar. </p><p>Most of this feels familiar and closely related to Outlook. </p><p>What I am missing (as far as I have gotten in my research so far) is a more in-depth review of Tasks. Tasks are indeed mentioned under the aforementioned “Calendar” but mostly in passing. </p><p>I will of course notice how Tasks works, in one way or another, after I get a working full version of TB, but it would be interesting to have some advance information about this. So, to the extent that there is such information, it would be great with a link to one or two pages that describe Tasks a little more in depth. </p><p>The fact that I return to Tasks so much is because my use of Tasks is far more frequent than the equivalent for Calendar. I would probably describe Task as a completely central function in my use of a PIM. This in turn may have to do with the fact that I use Tasks as if it were an app for more far-reaching tasks continuously over a longer period of time (months at times) up to projects (at least smaller projects). </p><p>Maybe there is a smoother way to solve this, now that I am switching to a new system. That is, some kind of program/app that is more adapted for projects - but that can still be synchronized with TB Calendar. In that case, it would be of great interest to receive tips and suggestions for one or more such possible solutions. </p>",ICIT,false,0,0

It sometimes accumulates many, but they're just baggage.  The inaccessible message happens if the desired profile and associated profiles.ini are not loaded together. The purpose of using the thunderbird folder and not the profile folder is that the thunderbird folder includes both. Here is what happens: thunderbird opens the profiles.ini but the profile it is identifying isn't there. That can be an easy fix, often by overtying in the profiles.ini the actual location. this is avoided when the thunderbird folder overwrites the default thunderbird folder. what often happens is the user pastes the transferred thunderbird folder to the appdata\roaming]\thunderbird folder which creates appdata\roaming\thunderbird\thunderbird - and that is why I state that a prompt to overwrite should happen. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It is used for those that want tasks in their google calendars and if I understand correctly requires a new version for this latest update to Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>Thanks for the reply, Matt, </p><p>No, I wasn't using any Google Calendar extensions.  I did use ""Provider for Google Calendar"" before Thunderbird added Google Calendar support, but I removed it years ago. Thunderbird's built-in support, while it was working, was good enough for my needs. </p><p>I have recently reinstalled the Provider extension, which installs successfully in TB 140 (its reviews suggest it's broken in Thunderbird 144, which isn't offered on the ESR channel yet), but I haven't yet set it up, since it requires a separate connection to my Google account, and doesn't recognize the calendars that Thunderbird is already attempting (and failing) to integrate with.  If that does work, it unfortunately doesn't answer the question about what's broken in either Thunderbird 140 or in my profile...and if it's just going to break again when Thunderbird ESR updates beyond 140, I'd rather have the built-in functionality working. </p><p>I'm not quite sure how I got switched to the ESR channel (I've been using Thunderbird since long before there was any such thing), but given how many extensions seem to break in new versions, I've decided to stick with it, to give authors a chance to fix incompatibilities before they impact me. </p>",erik36,false,0,0
