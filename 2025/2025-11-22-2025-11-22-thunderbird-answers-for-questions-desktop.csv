Per ottenere questo risultato la comunicazione tra un mittente MITT ed un destinatario DEST è mediata dal una società abilitata alla gestione della PEC rispondente a precisi requisiti tecnici (GEST). Nelle intestazioni della PEC avremo quindi riferimenti a MITT, DEST e GEST.  Supponiamo che DEST, ricevuta una PEC da MITT, voglia aggiungere il mittente alla propria rubrica di Thunderbird. A volte capita che al nome di MITT non vanga associato il relativo indirizzo email ma quello dell'intermediario GEST. Il risultato è che da quel momento in poi tutte le PEC ricevute da utenti di GEST appariranno con mittente MIT, talvolta con la dicitura ""per conto di"".

Do you have Thunderbird set to download only headers? Then, when you must select the messages to see the bodies? </p><p>And what do you mean by ""still only 1""? You said that the counter was incremented. Do you mean to say that after you select the messages to download the bodies, the counter <strong>reverts</strong> to ""1""? </p><p>If I understand correctly, then almost all that makes sense. When you select the messages to download the bodies, they are no longer new. They may remain unread for some time, depending on how long you have set Thunderbird to wait before considering a message read. </p><p>I understand that the taskbar and tray icon can show the count of <strong>either</strong> new messages <strong>or</strong> unread messages. See my screen image. I can imagine that you have them set to show new messages and that the counter is behaving as it should. The only mystery would be why ""1"" still appears in the badge. Is there still a new message somewhere? </p><p>But I may not be understanding your situation perfectly. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
