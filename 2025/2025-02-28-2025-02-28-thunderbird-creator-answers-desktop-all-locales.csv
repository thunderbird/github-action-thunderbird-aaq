Thats pretty annoying so I decided to go use Thunderbird. but I have been experiencing significant synchronization issues with my Hotmail (<a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>) accounts in Thunderbird. Specifically, when I add more than one Hotmail account, the folders for those accounts do not appear at all. Additionally, when I attempt to send a test email, it shows as “sending” but then the process hangs, nothing happens. </p><p>To resolve the issue, I have tried: </p> <ul><li> Removing and Re-adding Accounts: </li></ul> <p>I removed all my Hotmail accounts from Thunderbird and re-added them. During the re-adding process, I cleared the saved passwords (so that the login prompts would reappear) and manually configured the account settings (IMAP server, SMTP server, etc.) &amp; cleared caches on %AppData% Thunderbird&gt;Profile&gt;Imap folder </p> <ul><li> Connection Settings: </li></ul> <p>I verified that the incoming and outgoing server settings are correct (IMAP: port 993 with SSL/TLS; SMTP: port 587 with STARTTLS) and that the authentication method is set to OAuth2. </p> <ul><li> Rebuilding Profile Indexes: </li></ul> <p>I backed up and deleted the local index files (.msf files) in my Thunderbird profile for the affected folders so that Thunderbird would rebuild them. </p> <ul><li> Security Software Check: </li></ul> <p>I temporarily disabled my antivirus/firewall software to rule out any interference with the connections. </p><p>Despite these efforts, after re-adding the accounts, the folders still do not synchronize, and during a test email send, the message remains stuck in the “sending” or ""Hanging"" what ever you call it. </p><p>So I need help&nbsp;:D </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",mustafaihsanalbayrak

In error my first post said ‘Firefox’ NOT ‘Thunderbird’. </p><p>Hi all. I recently had a terminal problem on my Win 10 computer so have bought a new Win 11 machine. I ran Thunderbird mail on the old Win 10, had 5 email accounts, had about 12 local folders and had my Profile stored in a folder on the desktop. The folder was moved there some years ago but don 't remember how I did it. I moved it there because this folder gets backed up every night.  </p><p>So, I have managed to remove the HDD from my old machine and have located the 'old' profile folder. I now need to re-install Thunderbird on the new machine and match it up to my old profile folder (I think...)  </p><p>Any advice on how to do that? </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",steviebobs
