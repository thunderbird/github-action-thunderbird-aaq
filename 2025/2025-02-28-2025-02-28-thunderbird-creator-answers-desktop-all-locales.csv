Every time I empty the trash, either manually or by exiting Thunderbird, the ""Trash"" folder is being silently deleted, and from that moment on I cannot any longer delete messages, receiving a ""not enough space"" error. If exit the program, and trash is set to be emptied on exit, the next time I reopen Thunderbird there is no ""Trash"" (Cestino in my language, I have Thunderbird in italian) folder. In my ThunderbirdProfile\Mail\Local Folders the file ""Trash"" of 0 byte, keep being silently deleted. To restore correct functionality, I just have to create a new ""Trash"" folder under ""Local Folders"" in Thunderbird, then a new ""Cestino"" folder appears, and everything is fine.  But the next time I empty the Trash, the problem reappears. I suspect something linked to Windows 11, computer was recently upgraded from Win 10 to Win 11. I tried with latest version 128.7, both 32 and 64 bit. As you can see from the screenshot, after emptying Trash, the 0 byte file ""Trash"" is missing.

Whenever I try to send an email I get the error message ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://mail.lcn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.lcn.com</a> timed out. Try again."" I have to use webmail or my mobile phone to do so. 2. After I switched, Thunderbird created  a new folder for incoming emails with the title of my email address. I already had a default folder using my account name, so I copied all the new emails to that and deleted the new one. I then went to Server Settings and changed the User Name to my Account name, which it was previously. However, my incoming emails now do not appear at all, I can only see them on my phone or webmail. I have checked my settings over &amp; over but I cannot see anything wrong. I would include some screenshots but the print screen button on this temporary keyboard doesn't seem to work properly.
