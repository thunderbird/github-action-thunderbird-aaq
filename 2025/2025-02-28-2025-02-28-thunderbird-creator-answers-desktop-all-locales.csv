Thats pretty annoying so I decided to go use Thunderbird. but I have been experiencing significant synchronization issues with my Hotmail (<a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>) accounts in Thunderbird. Specifically, when I add more than one Hotmail account, the folders for those accounts do not appear at all. Additionally, when I attempt to send a test email, it shows as “sending” but then the process hangs, nothing happens. </p><p>To resolve the issue, I have tried: </p> <ul><li> Removing and Re-adding Accounts: </li></ul> <p>I removed all my Hotmail accounts from Thunderbird and re-added them. During the re-adding process, I cleared the saved passwords (so that the login prompts would reappear) and manually configured the account settings (IMAP server, SMTP server, etc.) &amp; cleared caches on %AppData% Thunderbird&gt;Profile&gt;Imap folder </p> <ul><li> Connection Settings: </li></ul> <p>I verified that the incoming and outgoing server settings are correct (IMAP: port 993 with SSL/TLS; SMTP: port 587 with STARTTLS) and that the authentication method is set to OAuth2. </p> <ul><li> Rebuilding Profile Indexes: </li></ul> <p>I backed up and deleted the local index files (.msf files) in my Thunderbird profile for the affected folders so that Thunderbird would rebuild them. </p> <ul><li> Security Software Check: </li></ul> <p>I temporarily disabled my antivirus/firewall software to rule out any interference with the connections. </p><p>Despite these efforts, after re-adding the accounts, the folders still do not synchronize, and during a test email send, the message remains stuck in the “sending” or ""Hanging"" what ever you call it. </p><p>So I need help&nbsp;:D </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",mustafaihsanalbayrak
