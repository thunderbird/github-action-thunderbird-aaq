I believe that AT&amp;T is going to delete my sbcglobal email account as I have canceled my AT&amp;T internet service. I see sbcglobal messages in thunderbird that go back to 2008 that I would like to read again. Will these messages disapper when AT&amp;T disables the SBCglobal email account. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",hmb2stxrrn
