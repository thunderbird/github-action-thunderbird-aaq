In reviewing the profile after update I note that Mozilla location service key, google location service key and safe browsing keys are missing (not sure what they were pre update). The key4.db file pre update was 1/3/22 but after update it is 10/10/25. The logins.json pre and post update is 7/9/25.

I restored my recent backup but still the part of the folder is missing. I used a copy of my profiles made on my laptop with no results. I completely uninstalled Thunderbird then copied my backup with no luck. Finally, I had to make a full image restore to get Thunderbird back to where it was before 143.1.0 I updated to 144.0 with no change. Each time I open TBird, it asked me to install the 143.1.0 update and if I do then the same happens, a big part of one of my local folders subfolders disappears. Strangely, on my laptop that is basicly a duplicate of my PC thunderbird everything is ok with the last 143.1.0 update. What is in the 143.1.0 update to cause these problems, is there a command to reject long file names. &nbsp;? Has anyone experienced this problem otherwise I will be stuck with update # 143.1.0 for years Thank you Douglas Noades </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,1771827;,douglasnoades

The two things seem to be connected as Thunderbird seems to refuse to send emails that do not have an address in my address book and as the address book has gone - no send!  I can't even reply to incoming emails, the ""send"" button just stays grey (see attached example).  Even if I type the email address - same result.   If I try to add a contact to Address Book nothing happens when I hit ""New Contact"".  The address book just comes up with the following strange messages: </p><p>""Contacts from remote address books are not show until you search""  note nothing happens when I search </p><p>and </p><p>""This addess book show contacts only after a search""  again nothing.  (Screenshot attached) </p><p>I have tried copying address book from a back up of my profile that is a only a week or so old but nothing changes.  I can see lots of abook-x.sqlite etc files in the back up profile but even deleting all of these in the  working profile and copying the back up files in does nothing. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated as I can't just keep using my mobile version to conduct business. </p>",thunderbird;contacts;,thunderbird,contacts,en-US,1771869;1771890;,craig109
