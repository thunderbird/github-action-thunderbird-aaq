In reviewing the profile after update I note that Mozilla location service key, google location service key and safe browsing keys are missing (not sure what they were pre update). The key4.db file pre update was 1/3/22 but after update it is 10/10/25. The logins.json pre and post update is 7/9/25. I can see the default release profile and local only - use only the default release. My question is - has the 64 bit installation cleared all my keys/how can I check all my keys and how do I fix and ensure connections are secure? </p><p>Thankyou for any advice. </p>",thunderbird;encryption;,thunderbird,encryption,en-US,"",hmrowe

Now I bought a new notebook and needed to transfer all the mails to my new notebook. My old laptop is still active and can still copy anything I would need. I copied the profiles and also the whole TB file under Roaming and tried to restore on the new computer. I couldn't do it in several different versions. Now it give the message ""You have launched an older version of TB"". I was using the version of 143.0.1 x32 bit on the previous laptop. But now I can not download the 32bit version of 143.0.1.  I found 38.0.1 in my hard disk and loaded it and the restoring was succesfull. But this time I had no update option so I need to use the old version. I will be very glad if anyone would show me a way to solve the problem. </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,es,"",turgayozdemir1

I have several calendars and mail accounts, that works fine for about a year. Now I added a new calendar on NextCloud, it works with my calendar app on Android, but not with Thunderbird, whatever I try, it does not show the new calendar and it's content. In the Agenda tab under the calendar, all my current agenda's are shown. At the bottom right there is a sync button, that is supposed to reload the calendars and sync changes, but that does not work for this new calendar. All old tips for syncing are supposed to be integrated with Thunderbird. </p><p>Any idea? </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Kees </p>",thunderbird;calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,nl,"",kees.serier
