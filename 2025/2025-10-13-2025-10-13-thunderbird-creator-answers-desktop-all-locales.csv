In reviewing the profile after update I note that Mozilla location service key, google location service key and safe browsing keys are missing (not sure what they were pre update). The key4.db file pre update was 1/3/22 but after update it is 10/10/25. The logins.json pre and post update is 7/9/25. I can see the default release profile and local only - use only the default release. My question is - has the 64 bit installation cleared all my keys/how can I check all my keys and how do I fix and ensure connections are secure? </p><p>Thankyou for any advice. </p>",thunderbird;encryption;,thunderbird,encryption,en-US,"",hmrowe
