Eventually it stopped, but all emails in that folder back to 2021 disappeared. Tried the repairing folder option, that had no apparent effect. Now it loads new messages just fine, but all those for the last four years are absent.  I have it set to leave messages on the server, and indeed they all are. So I should be able to get Thunderbird to re-load them, right?  But I have searched in vain for any instructions on how to do this, and cannot figure it out. Is it possible? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tbray1

When I add the email/password, it detects the settings and then says it cannot confirm the password. </p><p>To workaround this, I only add the email, and then when it detects settings, it asks me to input the password. And when I do that, it adds the account and attempts to read my incoming STMP server. I get an error that it times out. And when I try to send emails, it says it cannot access the outgoing STMP. </p><p>I use cpanel and when I access my email via roundcube, it shows me my messages. I have cloudflare set up via namecheap with the correct DNS records. My other email clients (gmail/outlook) work fine. I have reinstalled thunderbird so Im not sure what else I can do </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1715651;,petermissick

I see that you can add little category color bars to each event.  I tried to add a new category, but it disappeared from the dropdown menu as soon as I added it and a color bar never appeared in the event on the calendar display. How can I add and subtract categories? Can I change the colors assigned to categories? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",tharrso

This does not work.  I do not want to try sending via to: as I do not want everyone to get all the email addresses.  It has always worked for me.  I have a list of 172, no go.  If I send to 10 as a test it does but I am hesitant to do the same email 17 or so times to get them all out????  Its not the attachments, it does not work as an email without anything attached.  All smtp settings correct, nothing has changed and it worked a couple of weeks ago </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",wattzat28
