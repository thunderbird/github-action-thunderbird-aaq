Eventually it stopped, but all emails in that folder back to 2021 disappeared. Tried the repairing folder option, that had no apparent effect. Now it loads new messages just fine, but all those for the last four years are absent.  I have it set to leave messages on the server, and indeed they all are. So I should be able to get Thunderbird to re-load them, right?  But I have searched in vain for any instructions on how to do this, and cannot figure it out. Is it possible? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tbray1

The installation was done from scratch, without having Thunderbird installed previously. I am currently using Thunderbird 128.7.1esr (64-bit). However, I am encountering an issue where all messages—whether old or new—are appearing in the same month, despite the actual date they were sent. </p><p>When sorting by date, the inbox sorts correctly, but all messages display with the same month (April), regardless of when they were received. This issue occurs across all folders (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Archives, and any local folders). While the day and year are accurate, the month always shows as April. </p><p>I have verified the date and time settings on macOS, which are set to automatic, and the region matches the settings in Thunderbird. I have also run the ""Repair Folder"" option on the Inbox folder properties, but the issue persists across all folders. </p><p>Do you have any suggestions for resolving this? </p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance! </p><p>Best regards, </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",leonardo17

I am not a software developer, but retired hardware engineer, so I know a little about hyperlinks. My Email provider is AOL, and URL links come in properly as URL address, but they are '<em><strong>not hyperlinks'</strong></em>  that I can just click on to redirect me to that website, and view what is sent to me with a new tab. If I change (View Message body) AS, TEXT, then the URL address in the email turns into a hyperlink and is then clickable. Really TEXT??? Its not text, I think this is a bug.  Why would I have to change from View Message AS ""Original HTML"", my default view each time I want to view the link. Note the email body has a URL address the for redirect with HTML code, see below.  </p><p>Example:   <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/share/p/_8Z8M_PJR"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/share/p/_8Z8M_PJR</a> </p><p>I have been a member of this group for well over 10 years and I donate each year, but I plan to postpone any further donations until I receive support for something that should be a simple fix. <a href=""http://AOL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">AOL.com</a> email in the inbox over the web, the URL is shown as a hyperlink, (blue), thunderbird is not showing it as hyperlink?  </p><p>Community support is welcome,  Eric S. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1715703;,cfogri1
