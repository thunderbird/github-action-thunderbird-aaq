I would like to combine them and have access to all at once.  </p><p>I have moved all my personal emails on my work PC into one folder labeled “Personal.” </p><p>I would be ok moving the personal emails to the local TB drive on Mac if recommended. </p><p>All I can seem to find when I search the knowledge base is how to move Thunderbird from old to new. And in those instructions they overwrite the profile on new. I am already actively using Thunderbird on my Mac so what I must do is merge pc TB to Mac TB but I have not been able to find instructions. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a Mac so I’m re-teaching myself. I’m much more fluent on the PC right now. </p><p>For me there is nothing that compares to Thunderbird. I’ve been using TB for 25 years and have not found anything that compares. </p><p>Thank you for you assistance! </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lisabauer
