It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a Mac so I’m re-teaching myself. I’m much more fluent on the PC right now. </p><p>For me there is nothing that compares to Thunderbird.

Can hexadecimal values be entered? </p><p>The reason I'm asking is that I am receiving many emails where the ""From:"" address ends with "".za.-com"".

If it's not possible, then this can be regarded as a feature request. I have a few (4) definite 'Favourites' in my list, which I regularly have to move messages to. Since I have several email accounts, some of which have largish folder trees, I often scroll down to a different account, find I need to move a message to a 'Favourite' and then have to scroll all the way back up to locate the folder. In fact, I often go to the folder directly, rather than go all the way back to 'Favourites'. Making the idea of 'Favourites' a little redundant. Outlook has a simple 'Pin Favourites' feature that keeps the pane visible, even if the other folders are scrolled down. I find this incredibly useful, and would really like this ability in Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bigthicko
