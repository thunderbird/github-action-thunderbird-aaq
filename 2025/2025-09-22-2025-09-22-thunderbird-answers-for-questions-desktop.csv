I took your approach and used the search window.  Same result. I used Revo Uninstaller to remove TBird from the W11 box and then reinstalled it. Used a different flash drive to copy TBird on the W10 box. Went back to the W11 box - same result. Local Folders show in the Profile - Mail folder but not when I open TBird. I built the W11 box about 4 months ago - haven't had any problems with it but maybe there is something???? Other ideas??? </p>,misterg.mbg,false,0,0
