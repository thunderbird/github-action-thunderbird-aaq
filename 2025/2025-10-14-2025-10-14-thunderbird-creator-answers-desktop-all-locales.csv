All of my emails, folders, settings, etc. are gone.  Went through the Help - Trouble shooting process to find the old profile.  There are three profiles listed in 'About Profiles' and if I launch with any of them, all I get is a new setup.  Freaking out here as I have 10 of thousands of emails, in multiple email accounts, in a relatively complex folder structure which includes online and local folder storage.  I have a feeling that Thunderbird updated last night and is the cause of this problem.    </p><p>Running Windows 10 Pro v 22H2, build 19045.6332 .

But now, I am back to having to enter the password in the pop-up box when sending mail. </p><p>Any reason why this problem occurs after the system has operated fine for months/years.
