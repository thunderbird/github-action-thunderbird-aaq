This situation happens to several people on different computers. To resolve this, I've installed older versions of Thunderbird, for example, 102.15.1. However, this solution doesn't seem satisfactory to me because, even though I select the application not to update, the message to update keeps popping up. Furthermore, it's not recommended to keep applications updated. They can also be opened with Microsoft Outlook Standard. Could someone help me with this issue, please?

I can uncheck the folders from Server (Dialog in TB) and they're gone. </p><p>Today I also tested: 1. Live version Mint 22 TB 128 - same problem 2. Mint 21 TB version 115 - same problem 3.
