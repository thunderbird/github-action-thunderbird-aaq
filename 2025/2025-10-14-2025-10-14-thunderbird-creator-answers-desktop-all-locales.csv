We usually save emails we receive or send on our computer, but with the latest versions of Thunderbird, we can't open them; they appear blank. This situation happens to several people on different computers. To resolve this, I've installed older versions of Thunderbird, for example, 102.15.1. However, this solution doesn't seem satisfactory to me because, even though I select the application not to update, the message to update keeps popping up. Furthermore, it's not recommended to keep applications updated. They can also be opened with Microsoft Outlook Standard. Could someone help me with this issue, please?

I emptied the trash bin, which freed about 2-3G. I compacted the directories, which did nothing. </p><p>In Thunderbird's directory, I see most of the space is taken by a directory named after my gmail account. In the settings for my gmail account I disabled the setting to keep all of the account's messages on the local computer, under synchronization, and I changed the disk usage setting from synchronizing everything to synchronizing only for the last 30 days. Neither of these did nothing. </p><p>There's also a directory for my old university email account, which has been out of use for over ten years. It's not configured in Thunderbird. Gmail is the only email account there. </p><p>Besides gmail, I have a few feeds. For some reason items named ""feeds.json-1.corrupt"", and increasing numbers, have been appearing in the feeds section. The biggest number is currently 1017, and it seems there's 1017 of these entries. Some of the feeds show very large numbers of unread messages since I haven't been reading them for a long time. </p><p>So, any idea how do I free some of the disk space Thunderbird uses? Any idea what's in there? I've been thinking of just deleting the directory but I assume that would lose my account settings and such, so I'd have to add them back. Or worse. I've also found some options for deleting messages, including in gmail account settings, but at least some of them say they delete the messages completely, while I'd only like to delete them from my hard drive and not from gmail or other remote sources. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,fi,"",grimripper

Is it possible to turn it off, and if so, how? </p><p>If it is not possible, then it would be good if this apparent bug were fixed.  </p><p>I included a screenshot showing just one example of an email from an address I had created a custom filter for in the junk mail folder. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,1772139;,mhnorwood
