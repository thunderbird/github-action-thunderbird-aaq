All of my emails, folders, settings, etc. are gone.  Went through the Help - Trouble shooting process to find the old profile.  There are three profiles listed in 'About Profiles' and if I launch with any of them, all I get is a new setup.  Freaking out here as I have 10 of thousands of emails, in multiple email accounts, in a relatively complex folder structure which includes online and local folder storage.  I have a feeling that Thunderbird updated last night and is the cause of this problem.    </p><p>Running Windows 10 Pro v 22H2, build 19045.6332 .

I have changed password on all three <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a> email accounts, and for a few days email sends worked fine.  But now, I am back to having to enter the password in the pop-up box when sending mail. </p><p>Any reason why this problem occurs after the system has operated fine for months/years.

We usually save emails we receive or send on our computer, but with the latest versions of Thunderbird, we can't open them; they appear blank. This situation happens to several people on different computers. To resolve this, I've installed older versions of Thunderbird, for example, 102.15.1. However, this solution doesn't seem satisfactory to me because, even though I select the application not to update, the message to update keeps popping up. Furthermore, it's not recommended to keep applications updated. They can also be opened with Microsoft Outlook Standard. Could someone help me with this issue, please? Thank you </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,es,1772172;1772240;,Freganzo

My email provider is <a href=""http://Strato.de"" rel=""nofollow"">Strato.de</a> with IMAP. The problem is that TB doesn't allow unsubscribes from folders on either installation.  So, if you select a server folder, the folder is displayed and the emails are included. I can unsubscribe from the subscription, and the folders are not gone. All folders and Mails are on TB. </p><p>With TB, all folders are loaded and all emails synchronized during installation and the first contact with the server. I can deselect folders in the ""Subscribe"" menu, but they are immediately available again. I can see in the TB status display that the unsubscriptions are being sent. Strato reports that their server is OK.  It also works with Outlook 2013 in Windows 11 and two other email programs in Linux. It works well with other clients (Evolution, Balsa) under Linux. I can uncheck the folders from Server (Dialog in TB) and they're gone. </p><p>Today I also tested: 1. Live version Mint 22 TB 128 - same problem 2. Mint 21 TB version 115 - same problem 3. New mailbox/address created on Strato's server - same problem Can anyone explain this? Thanks.
