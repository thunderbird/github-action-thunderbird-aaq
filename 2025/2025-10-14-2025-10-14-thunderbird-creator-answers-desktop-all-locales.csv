All of my emails, folders, settings, etc. are gone.  Went through the Help - Trouble shooting process to find the old profile.  There are three profiles listed in 'About Profiles' and if I launch with any of them, all I get is a new setup.  Freaking out here as I have 10 of thousands of emails, in multiple email accounts, in a relatively complex folder structure which includes online and local folder storage.  I have a feeling that Thunderbird updated last night and is the cause of this problem.    </p><p>Running Windows 10 Pro v 22H2, build 19045.6332 .

I currently have 7 active email accounts, but have had up to 12 on my Windows platform running with no problems.  Installed: Thunderbird vs 140.3.1esr Windows 10 </p><p>I have recently had problems with the password entry for three of the accounts which use <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a>, managed by AOL. </p><p>When sending a message on that email system, I often have to enter the outgoing server password manually.  I have changed password on all three <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a> email accounts, and for a few days email sends worked fine.  But now, I am back to having to enter the password in the pop-up box when sending mail. </p><p>Any reason why this problem occurs after the system has operated fine for months/years.  I don't see this problem with my other accounts using different mail servers. </p>",thunderbird;save-passwords;,thunderbird,save-passwords,en-US,"",ht77
