Fortunately, someone from Mozilla provided link to a new version of TB that solved my problem. (It appeared that the problematic TB update was version 115.15.2.0... the download link I received was for version 128.5.2.0. The problematic version was installed in my WIN 10 ""Program Files (x86)"" folder... I installed the new TB version in my WIN 10 ""Program Files"" folder and associated the new TB version with a copy of the TB Profile I'd been using with my previous version of TB.) That resolved my mid-2024 TB issue. </p><p>However, in late-2024, I started getting a ""Thunderbird is not responding"" warning and TB became unusable. Online, I read that my Kaspersky internet security software might the problem so I paused the Kaspersky protection... but that did not resolve my ""Thunderbird is not responding"" problem. The solution I've come up with is to use the MS365 Outlook email program directly (instead of via TB) and trying to customize Outlook email to act like TB.  Customizing Outlook is a slow, time-consuming process but it's better than wasting time fruitlessly trying to overcome the ""Thunderbird is not responding"" issue. </p><p>I'm really sorry to say goodbye to Thunderbird! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1700588;,jimtodd1104
