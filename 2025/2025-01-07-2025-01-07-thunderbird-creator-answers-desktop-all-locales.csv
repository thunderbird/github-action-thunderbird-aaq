Fortunately, someone from Mozilla provided link to a new version of TB that solved my problem. (It appeared that the problematic TB update was version 115.15.2.0... the download link I received was for version 128.5.2.0. The problematic version was installed in my WIN 10 ""Program Files (x86)"" folder... I installed the new TB version in my WIN 10 ""Program Files"" folder and associated the new TB version with a copy of the TB Profile I'd been using with my previous version of TB.) That resolved my mid-2024 TB issue. </p><p>However, in late-2024, I started getting a ""Thunderbird is not responding"" warning and TB became unusable. Online, I read that my Kaspersky internet security software might the problem so I paused the Kaspersky protection... but that did not resolve my ""Thunderbird is not responding"" problem. The solution I've come up with is to use the MS365 Outlook email program directly (instead of via TB) and trying to customize Outlook email to act like TB.  Customizing Outlook is a slow, time-consuming process but it's better than wasting time fruitlessly trying to overcome the ""Thunderbird is not responding"" issue. </p><p>I'm really sorry to say goodbye to Thunderbird! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1700588;,jimtodd1104

Last year they forced everyone to stop using non-Gmail apps on mobile devices for security and as a side effect of that, they turned off IMAP access which was never mentioned in the change. I assume they did this for our entire domain in Google. I asked for this to be re-enabled and provided some arguments for how using a mail client like Thunderbird was superior and much more efficient than webmail (ugh). As with any large organization, they refused </p><p>While opening and updating Thunderbird this week to see if there is something new I was able to do a web-login to my work account and that worked. This sets up the security to a 3rd party app in the Google account but not sure how this is used. I can still not connect via IMAP and only IMAP/POP are options in Thunderbird still. The question I had is there another option for Thunderbird to somehow use a web-based connection perhaps as a proxy via webmail to allow access from Thunderbird? Also what is the 3rd party security connection in the Google account with Thunderbird used for since it is still only showing IMAP/POP connection methods? </p><p>Thanks, Greg </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1700719;,gparrishgparrish
