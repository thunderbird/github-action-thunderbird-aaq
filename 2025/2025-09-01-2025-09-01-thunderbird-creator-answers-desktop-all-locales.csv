Ne tantomeno ci sono notifiche di arrivo di nuovi messaggi. Chiedo se per voi questo e' un problema noto oppure non vi e' mai capitato qualcosa del genere. Tengo costantemente aggiornato alla versione piu recente, non ricordo bene ma non vorrei che questo succeda forse proprio a seguito di un aggiornamento e aggiungo che i parametri sono sempre settati come da default e non sono mai stati cambiati, il problema si e' presentato all'improvviso. Aggiungo che allo stato attuale non ho ancora provato con altri programmi di posta (es. outlook) per vedere se succede lo stesso problema, vorrei evitare di abbandonare thunderbird solo per questo problema perche al momento lo utilizzo anche per altri account di posta e quindi poi sarei costretto ad utilizzarne due diversi per gestire le caselle o comunque a fare una migrazione totale per trasferire tutti gli account al nuovo client, anche perche poi a parte questo incoveniente mi trovo bene con questo applicativo. Aggiungo che ho anche contattato Infocert per avere qualche delucidazione e sapere se tante volte avessero cambiato qualche parametro di configurazione ma la risposta e' stata negativa.
