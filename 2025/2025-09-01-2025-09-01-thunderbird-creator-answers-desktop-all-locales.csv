If I quit the ""thunderbird"" process with Activity Monitor the CPU issues go away for as long as the Thunderbird app is open. </p><p>I found this exact issue as a reported bug: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1977514&amp;_gl=1*1coyjyr*_ga*ODYxNzE0NjQyLjE2OTY0NDU3MDg.*_ga_2VC139B3XV*czE3NTY2OTAwOTckbzMkZzEkdDE3NTY2OTAyMzYkajI0JGwwJGgw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1977514&amp;_gl=1*1coyjyr*_ga*ODYxNzE0NjQyLjE2OTY0NDU3MDg.*_ga_2VC139B3XV*czE3NTY2OTAwOTckbzMkZzEkdDE3NTY2OTAyMzYkajI0JGwwJGgw</a> It says that it was fixed, though, and it has not been for me.
