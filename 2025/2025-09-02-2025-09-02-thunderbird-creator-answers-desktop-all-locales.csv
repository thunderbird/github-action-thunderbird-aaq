On my webmail both email addresses work well with passwords.  And I have two windows computers and one the thunderbird  works well no problem in getting and sending emails.  On the other I receive the emails okay and it's set up just as the other in incoming and outgoing settings and passwords but doesn't send emails as the server times out it says in error message. </p>,thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",golfwidow1
