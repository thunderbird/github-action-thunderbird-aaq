When I tried to set up the same account in Thunderbird on the ""as installed"" Win 11, it fails to pass authentication. I have no idea why since I have checked the password in the ""old"" system and used it in the new. I have tried using the menu option ""New Account"" and the submenu option for ""+ New Account"" within the ""Account Settings"" menu item.
