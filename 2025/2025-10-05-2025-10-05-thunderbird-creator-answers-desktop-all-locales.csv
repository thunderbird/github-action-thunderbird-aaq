It came with Win 11 installed and I added a new ssd with an old Win 10 system, which had Thunderbird configured. The win 10 system worked fine with outlook and I saw and verified the password. I upgraded the Win 10 to Win 11 and it all continued to work fine. I again checked the password stored in Thunderbird. When I tried to set up the same account in Thunderbird on the ""as installed"" Win 11, it fails to pass authentication. I have no idea why since I have checked the password in the ""old"" system and used it in the new. I have tried using the menu option ""New Account"" and the submenu option for ""+ New Account"" within the ""Account Settings"" menu item. Both seem to take me to the same automatic process - which is what is failing. I can't see what, if anything, I'm doing wrong. Any help much appreciated.
