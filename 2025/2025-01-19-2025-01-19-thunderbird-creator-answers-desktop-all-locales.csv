New messages go straight into deleted folder and are highlighted. </p><p>Second Problem - Stopping auto Compaction by Following instructions on Mozilla Help page Action #1: I goto &gt;How Can I Configure Compact? Action #2: Select Preferences (formerly Options)&gt;Network &amp; Disk Space&gt;Disk Space Action #3a: Cannot find Preferences  Action #3b: or Options </p><p>Following instructions for Step #2 I open Application Menu as detailed and GUESS WHAT?.... 'Select Preferences (formerly Options)&gt;Network &amp; Disk Space&gt;Disk Space' is nowhere to be seen. </p><p>I am wondering if anyone in the Thunderbird Tech Dev section has ever bothered a) Read and b) follow the instructions given to see if they actually display as described and then work. </p><p>Anyhow, can someone give me a straightforward reply and resolve to this matter as I am considering leaving MT and finding another agent that works as it is supposed to? </p><p>Thanking you in advance for any assistance. </p><p>Phil </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1704842;,prdp141
