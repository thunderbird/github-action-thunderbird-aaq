Usually post an update it will be the antivirus software firewall or VPN that stops Thunderbird working.  But like you have most folk assume the issue is in Thunderbird and start messing with settings and deleting things.  The result is usually not good as a perfectly working profile is sliced and diced and the underlying problem is not addressed so the subsequent reinstall and adding of mail accounts and contacts fails for the same reason mail retrieval failed in the first place.  Personally I use Defender because it does not meddle in email at all.  I gave up on Norton and McAfee more than a decade ago alarmist products that hamper more than help usually. With the demise of Kaspersky in the US and some other jurisdictions. I have found Defender does it's stated job quietly in the background without fuss. </p><p>Some antivirus products also just can not accept you don't want to use their VPN, so mail fails when they automatically re enable it and the provider refuses to connect you to their mail server because you are not connecting from a known address.  In the case of some ISP's the IP address used to connect must be one they issued on connection to the internet. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Yes, you can change profile location easily if you're comfortable with windows file explorer - exit thunderbird first - VERY important - copy the exact profile to wherever and rename it as desired if unsure of profile specifically, just type help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open folder', exit thunderbird, and you're there. back up one folder so you will be copying the entire profile  - after COPYing it to new location, open the profiles.ini (text file) in the ...appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder and overtype the location pointer to point to the new profile. save and restart thunderbird. when comfortable, then delete the ..appdata\roamng\thunderbird\profiles folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Upgrading TB to 137.0.2 64bit was straight forward and I now have access to 25.5k emails.  I was expecting/hoping that my 12 accounts would transfer, but I was only left with my original address from decades ago.  Still not difficult to add the rest - I had plenty of practice trying out alternative apps when TB failed on me. I am not sure that a unified inbox will be easy, TB ver 137.0.2 seems to have a few peculiarities and finding my way around the menus will take a bit of time. I have my grandaughter's laptop to save as well, it also had crashed and also had the house bitdefender installed.  On the otherhand my daughter's was still working.  I suppose she had not bothered with bitdefender on her own pc. Cheers David </p>",davidobox1,false,0,0

I followed up on the error code, saw the server might have been blocked due to ""suspicious activity"" (maybe because I changed the outgoing SMTP port a dozen times?), changed my Spectrum password and selected port 587.  It worked! However, if past experience holds, leaving town again this week may bugger things up. I'll be back in that case.
