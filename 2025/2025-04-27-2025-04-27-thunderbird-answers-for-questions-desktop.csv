As an initial install has to create a firstr profile that this error message is going to be very important. </p><p>Did you download from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> or the windows store? </p><p><br> There is lots that can go wrong. Usually post an update it will be the antivirus software firewall or VPN that stops Thunderbird working.  But like you have most folk assume the issue is in Thunderbird and start messing with settings and deleting things.  The result is usually not good as a perfectly working profile is sliced and diced and the underlying problem is not addressed so the subsequent reinstall and adding of mail accounts and contacts fails for the same reason mail retrieval failed in the first place.  Personally I use Defender because it does not meddle in email at all.  I gave up on Norton and McAfee more than a decade ago alarmist products that hamper more than help usually. With the demise of Kaspersky in the US and some other jurisdictions. I have found Defender does it's stated job quietly in the background without fuss. </p><p>Some antivirus products also just can not accept you don't want to use their VPN, so mail fails when they automatically re enable it and the provider refuses to connect you to their mail server because you are not connecting from a known address.  In the case of some ISP's the IP address used to connect must be one they issued on connection to the internet. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If so then most likely you did not have offline copies of your messages, so every time you try to access messages from that account you get that error. What you should have done was to download all your messages from the server to your Local Folders account. But it's too late now for that. Do you have a backup of your message archive? If so, you may want to restore that to your Local Folders account, and delete the now dysfunctional account for the discontinued email service. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
