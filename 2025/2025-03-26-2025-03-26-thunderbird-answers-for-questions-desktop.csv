Two kinds of things can be done to recover your messages: </p> <ol><li> Was a copy of your account on the server made? If so, it can be restored. Apparently, though, no copy was made. If it had been made, the IT person would be restoring it. But it would be strange if there were no copy.

Why aren't they using it to restore your account? </li></ol> <ol><li> Was a copy of the files on your computer (client) made? In that .file file? In any other way (did you ever back up the files on your computer?)? If so, your e-mail files can be restored, though you must be careful how you do that. To know whether or not this can be done, you have to know whether or not the back-up that you have is a copy from your computer or from the server. If it is from your computer, then you have to know how to work with the back-up file. That usually entails knowing which software made the back-up. You have to know how to open the back-up file and get at the contents. Or you have to find some other copy of your computer's files. The .file extension seems to be a generic extension that does not tell us which application created it. </li></ol> <p>Thunderbird is not yet relevant in either scenario, but will become relevant if you have a back-up copy that you can work with. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

In the meantime I reviewed all your screenshots and realised that my first diagnosis - a corrupt prefs.js file - was erroneous. What really has happened is that Thunderbird for an unknown reason had created a new virgin profile! Your old profile is named 7hcals8w.default whereas the new profile is named f5p22zq3.default-release. Actually you are working in the new profile, your accounts and messages are in the old profile. Please confirm by a screenshot with the contents of the ""Profiles"" folder in Thunderbird. In the Thunderbird folder you'll also see a profiles.ini file, please open it with a text editor and make a screen shot of its contents  </p><p>So your reply's are not showing up here, so that's why I'm copying from your emails...here are the screen shots, one from the old data dir, one from the new that TB is using and the profiles.ini file... </p>",quiltjunkie2002,false,0,0

They confirm that you have two profiles: the old profile ""default"" with its profile folder 7hcals8w.default which is actually inactive, and an active virgin profile default-release with its profile folder f5p22zq3.default-release </p><p>Since it's the first time in my ""helper career"" that I notice Thunderbird creating a new profile ""ex nihilo"" I am not sure whether the old profile is still viable or at least can be resuscitated by the manoeuvre I am going to propose you. </p><p>First of all, to be on the secure side: create a backup copy of your ""Thunderbird"" folder, the one which contains your profiles and all TB data. </p><p>Next: the Thunderbird application closed, open the profiles.ini file with Notepad, and in the last paragraph  </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>replace the 1 with a 0 (zero) and save the modification. </p><p>Now each time you start Thunderbird it will first open the <strong>profile manager</strong> (image) which invites you to choose between your two profiles to start with: default (old) or default-release (new).  </p><p>Select your old ""default"" profile and hit ""Start Thunderbird"". Now comes the crucial moment: either your old profile is in good shape and TB displays all your accounts, messages, address books, ....  or.... we must search for another solution. If you get an error message on TB start up please make a screenshot! </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

I have been using this program for about 15 years and I have a home based acctg business so this was critical to get my addresses and emails back. </p>",quiltjunkie2002,false,0,0
