Two kinds of things can be done to recover your messages: </p> <ol><li> Was a copy of your account on the server made? If so, it can be restored. Apparently, though, no copy was made. If it had been made, the IT person would be restoring it. But it would be strange if there were no copy.

In any other way (did you ever back up the files on your computer?)? If so, your e-mail files can be restored, though you must be careful how you do that. To know whether or not this can be done, you have to know whether or not the back-up that you have is a copy from your computer or from the server. If it is from your computer, then you have to know how to work with the back-up file. That usually entails knowing which software made the back-up.
