Is there any way to retrieve them? I saw a few answers that I didn't understand. This is really devastating, so I hope I can get them back! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",caroGlou9815

While all of the emails in my old inbox have reappeared in my new inbox, those that I had moved to local folders are no longer accessible because my previous Local Folders are no longer visible. The only 2 local folders that I now have are Trash and Outbox. I am using MacOS 15.3 Sequoia on a desktop. </p><p>I have been to Thunderbird Profiles and can find three entries for each of my previous folders (one with a .msf suffix) and one with .sbd). In ultimate subfolders there are 2 files named after each of my previous local folders (one has the suffix .msf), but they are not folders and do not seem to have any readable content. Please see example in attached screenshot. </p><p>Can you tell me please how to reestablish my previous local folder so that I can access the emails they contained. </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Roger Frost </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",frostrs

Thus I accidentally mark innocent messages as spam, and they disappear to the Spam folder of shame. Yes, if I can catch myself right away, I can press the ""Command-Z"" (""Control-Z"") key combination and retrieve them, and then manually mark them as not-spam.  But I would prefer not to have the messages marked as spam in the first place. </p><p>Also, I don't often have to mark messages as spam. When I do, I am happy to use a toolbar button or a menu item to do the marking. </p><p>So, is there a way I can disable the ""J"" key so that it does nothing, instead of marking messages as spam? </p><p>I am willing to write an add-on if that is what it takes. Just point me to the right API documentation. </p><p>I am using Thunderbird 128esr on macOS Sonoma 14.7.3. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",JDLH

One account works fine, I'm able to subscribe to all folders. But when I try to subscribe for the other account, the ""Select the folders to subscribe to:"" list is blank. I've clicked Refresh but the Folder List but is still blank. What could be causing this? I'm considering deleting the account and adding it back, but I would lose some messages if I did that. It is set up with the <a href=""http://imap.cpmcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.cpmcast.net</a> server and the settings are just like the other account that works. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",davehuong
