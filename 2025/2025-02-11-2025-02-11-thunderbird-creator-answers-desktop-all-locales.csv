Thus I accidentally mark innocent messages as spam, and they disappear to the Spam folder of shame. Yes, if I can catch myself right away, I can press the ""Command-Z"" (""Control-Z"") key combination and retrieve them, and then manually mark them as not-spam.  But I would prefer not to have the messages marked as spam in the first place. </p><p>Also, I don't often have to mark messages as spam. When I do, I am happy to use a toolbar button or a menu item to do the marking. </p><p>So, is there a way I can disable the ""J"" key so that it does nothing, instead of marking messages as spam? </p><p>I am willing to write an add-on if that is what it takes.
