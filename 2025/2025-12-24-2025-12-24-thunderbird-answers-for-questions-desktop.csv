But do you have write access to the address book you are trying to add the contact to? </p><p>Press Ctrl+ Shift + J and have a look in the error console immediately after you attempt to save the new contact. once the console is open,  clear it using the icon on its toolbar so other spurious error reports do not confuse the issue. Getting mail generally triggers quite a few of them for instance and we are interested here only in the result of the save attempts. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Strangely, I just cleared the error console log as you said, and tried adding the contact and then it worked fine.  I don't really understand that, but it's working again. Thanks for your input.
