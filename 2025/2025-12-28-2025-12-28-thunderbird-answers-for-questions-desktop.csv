Or you could use the buttons at the bottom of that list to do the same thing.  But it does work in V140 (do do not say where you issue comes in  but I did try in in the daly developer build and it works. </p><p>SO how do you do this thta I may be able to actually see what you are experiencing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I prefer to do this rather than right clicking and then selecting the BCC option. </p><p>A further quirk that I discovered today is that for a short while, no matter which name I clicked on in the sidebar, the only name/address that Thunderbird would copy was the very first one that I had copied, so I finished up after clicking on five names with five copies of whomever's name I had first clicked on. I then found that only if I first left clicked on the name and then right clicked and selected BCC - only then would the focus change to the new selection. So just right clicking did not change the focus. </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird for about 20 years now. I have run it under various versions of both Linux and Windows. </p>",jeremy40,false,0,0
