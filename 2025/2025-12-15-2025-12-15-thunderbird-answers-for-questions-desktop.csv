(But then there's my own mistake......ugg)  </p><p>But here's what's weird:  two evenings ago I closed the laptop and went to bed...and when I got up in the morning, my Inbox was full, with over 10,000 messages going back to 2021!   The ""Sent"" folder was missing on TB, along with many of my subfolders...so I just recreated the Sent folder and held my breath. Nothing.  </p><p>But then today, when I checked Gmail, the Sent folder had over 14,000 emails! Also on Gmail, my All Mail has over 10,000 emails, so it obviously contains some of those missing emails...yet on TB, there aren't even 100 emails in All Mail. Gmail Trash has almost 6800 emails, so it may contain some of those missing emails too. In Gmail's ""Labels,""  the <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com/INBOX/archives"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com/INBOX/archives</a> is completely empty, along with several other labels and sub-labels. However, the label for the listserv that I administer has almost 5700 emails (and the one on TB has zero.) I've tried everything I can think of to get Gmail to sync those emails with TB, but nothing happens.  </p><p>Any hints as to how to get the emails to migrate from Gmail to TB? </p><p>And to answer your question about old profiles...I couldn't find anything on my laptop in the old profile folder from August of this year except a 2KB .json file.  </p><p>But  I <strong>JUST NOW</strong> realized that since my laptop is new, iDrive might have the backups from my old laptop...and there they were!! In fact, there are 3 Profiles folders!!!!!  One folder has very little, the 2nd one has nothing but a .json file...but the 3rd one has EVERYTHING. All my old folders, subfolders, etc. Now, the ""Date Modified"" is from 2022 and 2023...but I just got this new laptop in October of this year, so depending upon whether or not there are more recent email in those folders, I may have only lost 2 months worth of emails, </p><p>But now my question is, what do I do with the profile and all the folders? Do I just restore them all to my new laptop (and perhaps create a mess of conflicting folders &amp; emails that will take me days to reorganize)? But if that's the worst that could happen, I'll live with it and do what I have to do. </p><p>Again, I can't thank you enough...your question about the backup profile was what got me thinking about the previous iDrive backup!

So I don't think I'm in the position to give any specific advise what to do. For the time being I'd suggest you focus on the device you currently work with, and what's on the Gmail server. Everything on the server should also be visible in Thunderbird.

You would need to logon to the webmaila ccount via a browser and make sure the amazon email address are set up as safe sender, so they do not end up in Spam. Move them to Inbox and then in Thunderbird clickon 'Get Messages' </p><p>Do you have another device eg: phone or computer, connecting to server to see emails? If yes, is it using Imap or Pop&nbsp;? If it uses Pop, then it might be downloading and deleting off the server, so the accounts, Pop or Imap account in Thunderbird cannot download something that has been removed off server. If a pop then make sure it has settings to 'Leave message on server'. </p><p>Maybe you have a filter set up which is altering the view. First check the 'Quick Filter' Select folder - Enable 'Quick Filter'  Are any of the icons showing a blue thin line? If yes, it means it's enabled - click on the icon to switch off the filter. </p><p>Do you have any Message Filters you created&nbsp;? Maybe to move certain emails to other folders or delete etc. If yes, check the 'Filter Log' to see if it moved, deleted etc any emails from Amazon. If filter log is empty then maybe it would be a good idea to select the checkbox 'Enable the filter log' It's possble one of your filters has the type of criteria that may be also catching your Amazon emails. </p><p>Via 'Menu Bar' toolbar - the one with 'File, Edit, View, Go etc Select folder and then check this: View &gt; Threads &gt; 'All' should be selected. </p><p>Check to see if you have inadvertantly set up the Amazon emails as 'ignored' View &gt; Threads &gt; 'All' should be selected, but for a test also select 'Ignored Threads' to see if more emails display. You can uncheck it after if it's not showing anything. Ignored threads will display a red circle type of icon in the thread column.  </p><p>Some people feel they are missing emails and discovered they had 'Threading' enabled.
