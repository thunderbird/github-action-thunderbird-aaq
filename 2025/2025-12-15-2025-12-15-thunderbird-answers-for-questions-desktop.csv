Presumably the change affecting 'All Mail' will be reverted in the next version of Thunderbird. If you're patient you may just wait for the fix. </p><p>For the time being you can check whether you set 'All Mail' as the Archive folder for your Gmail account. At the top right of the Thunderbird window, click the menu button ≡ &gt; Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders &gt; Message Archives Uncheck the box 'Keep message archives in' for the Gmail account. Does the problem go away? </p><p>Alternatively you may simply unsubscribe from 'All Mail'. It is redundant, and just adds to the size of the profile. Select the Gmail account in the folder pane.
