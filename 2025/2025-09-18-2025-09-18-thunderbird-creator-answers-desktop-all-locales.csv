My specific questions are:  1. When I ""permanently delete"" messages (by deleting them from Trash or directly using Shift plus Delete keys), are they really removed entirely, or are they still recorded in the user profile folders?  2. From my observation, it seems that even if the content is removed, the space it occupied is still there in the profile/s because the size of the folders only seems to increase, even if I have had a big clear out. Is this correct? The reasons for my questions include: The need to be able to truly permanently delete some emails e.g. for security reasons like scam emails etc, or to be able to manage the storage space I need to back up the profiles on external devices -- Many times there are duplicate emails, or attachments that are no longer needed because they have been saved elsewhere or originated from my system, etc. Though I do wish to keep and store some emails in Thunderbird's local folder system, there are also many that I do not need or want at all, either immediately or after some time has elapsed. </p>",uitrusthome;davidsk;,false,false,false,;solver_id:6216336;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0,6,0,1,,,

I have been using Thunderbird since 2021. I had setup my account and archives by year containing messages in Folders (Inbox, Sent &amp; Deleted). During a recent laptop migration, I accidentally deleted my profile on my old laptop. I immdeiately recreated it. However now all email stored in my inbox has disappeared. Second, I cannot seem to locate the archives.  So I have 2 requests for urgent support: 1. How do I locate the messages in my inbox prior to deleting my profile? 2. How can I recreate the archive with folders?  I can see that the profile folder is a massive 22 GB. So the data is there somewhere. Please help me recreate my email profile so I doi not face a business crisis.
