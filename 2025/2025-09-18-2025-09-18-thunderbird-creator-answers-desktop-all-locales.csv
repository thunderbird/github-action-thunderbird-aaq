My specific questions are:  1. When I ""permanently delete"" messages (by deleting them from Trash or directly using Shift plus Delete keys), are they really removed entirely, or are they still recorded in the user profile folders?  2. From my observation, it seems that even if the content is removed, the space it occupied is still there in the profile/s because the size of the folders only seems to increase, even if I have had a big clear out. Is this correct? The reasons for my questions include: The need to be able to truly permanently delete some emails e.g. for security reasons like scam emails etc, or to be able to manage the storage space I need to back up the profiles on external devices -- Many times there are duplicate emails, or attachments that are no longer needed because they have been saved elsewhere or originated from my system, etc. Though I do wish to keep and store some emails in Thunderbird's local folder system, there are also many that I do not need or want at all, either immediately or after some time has elapsed. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",uitrusthome
