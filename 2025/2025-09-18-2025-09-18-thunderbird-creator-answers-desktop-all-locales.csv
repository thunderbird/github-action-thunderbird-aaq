My specific questions are:  1. When I ""permanently delete"" messages (by deleting them from Trash or directly using Shift plus Delete keys), are they really removed entirely, or are they still recorded in the user profile folders?  2. From my observation, it seems that even if the content is removed, the space it occupied is still there in the profile/s because the size of the folders only seems to increase, even if I have had a big clear out. Is this correct? The reasons for my questions include: The need to be able to truly permanently delete some emails e.g. for security reasons like scam emails etc, or to be able to manage the storage space I need to back up the profiles on external devices -- Many times there are duplicate emails, or attachments that are no longer needed because they have been saved elsewhere or originated from my system, etc. Though I do wish to keep and store some emails in Thunderbird's local folder system, there are also many that I do not need or want at all, either immediately or after some time has elapsed. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1765295;,uitrusthome

I have been using Thunderbird since 2021. I had setup my account and archives by year containing messages in Folders (Inbox, Sent &amp; Deleted). During a recent laptop migration, I accidentally deleted my profile on my old laptop. I immdeiately recreated it. However now all email stored in my inbox has disappeared. Second, I cannot seem to locate the archives.  So I have 2 requests for urgent support: 1. How do I locate the messages in my inbox prior to deleting my profile? 2. How can I recreate the archive with folders?  I can see that the profile folder is a massive 22 GB. So the data is there somewhere. Please help me recreate my email profile so I doi not face a business crisis. Thank You Warm regards Milind </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1765302;,milindyedkar

I use Thunderbird 140.x, which is regularly updated, and the mailbox has been configured for at least 5 years. Only in the last week has the problem emerged, rendering it unusable. Timeout errors and opening a new message after 2-3 minutes. I've cleared the cache, the database, and re-indexed, but nothing has changed. I've deleted and reconfigured my Gmail account, but nothing has changed. My Gmail mailbox is about 45 GB (I've seen much larger ones without losing performance). I tried installing Thunderbird on a new, clean PC, but the same thing. Extremely slow. Google support hasn't found any issues. Do you have any other suggestions for getting Thunderbird back up and running? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,it,1765296;,stefano.adriani

Since then, most of my folders have disappeared, including my inbox, sent items, trash, etc. In fact, almost everything except for a handful of seemingly random folders that still exist. When I play around with the folder view (View =&gt; Folders), it doesn't really change anything. Possibly interesting: I cannot select ‘All Folders’ in the folder view. </p><p>I use POP and have combined several accounts into shared folders. These are from GMX and Ionos/1und1. </p><p>Of course, I immediately tried to reinstall the latest version 142, but this did not work because version 143 had already manipulated my profile. I received an error message saying that the profile was already being used by a newer version (or something similar). </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird for about 20-25 years, so the folder structure is naturally quite old and complex. I use it for work. My Thunderbird profile is 3.5 GB. </p><p>Can anyone help me? The best solution would be for my profile to be fully functional in 143. Alternatively, it would also help me if I knew how to make my profile, which has already been manipulated by 143, fit for 142 again. Thanks in advance. </p><p>PS: I use Windows 11 Home. And of course I have a backup of my profile. However, I am abroad and the backup is at home, and by the time I get back there, it will be 3 weeks old. </p><p><br> Translated with <a href=""http://DeepL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">DeepL.com</a> (free version) </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,"",olaf.goebel
