My specific questions are:  1. When I ""permanently delete"" messages (by deleting them from Trash or directly using Shift plus Delete keys), are they really removed entirely, or are they still recorded in the user profile folders?  2. From my observation, it seems that even if the content is removed, the space it occupied is still there in the profile/s because the size of the folders only seems to increase, even if I have had a big clear out. Is this correct? The reasons for my questions include: The need to be able to truly permanently delete some emails e.g. for security reasons like scam emails etc, or to be able to manage the storage space I need to back up the profiles on external devices -- Many times there are duplicate emails, or attachments that are no longer needed because they have been saved elsewhere or originated from my system, etc. Though I do wish to keep and store some emails in Thunderbird's local folder system, there are also many that I do not need or want at all, either immediately or after some time has elapsed. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1765295;1765790;1765825;1766612;1766641;1766892;,uitrusthome

With the introduction of the more recent versions (starting from 115), however, Category Manager has become much more cumbersome to use, has lost several features, and has been reduced to the bare minimum. </p><p>In the past, I had contacted the developer, John Bieling, who told me that Category Manager would soon become an integral part of Thunderbird rather than remaining just an add-on, specifying that the “stripped-down” version released after the move to 115 was only temporary. Unfortunately, no further updates have been provided, and the GitHub discussion has also been inactive for quite some time. </p><p>The functionalities that Category Manager offered—such as assigning labels to contacts (including custom ones), applying multiple labels to the same contact, sending emails to multiple groups with overlap management to avoid duplicates, syncing with the smartphone address book, and even sending SMS messages to contact groups—were unique and extremely valuable. For those who, like me, manage an association with thousands of contacts and complex mailing lists, Category Manager is an irreplaceable tool that makes Thunderbird clearly superior to any other email client. </p><p>My concern is that a future Thunderbird update might make Category Manager unusable. On the contrary, I sincerely hope that the project can be resumed, maintained, and further developed, perhaps even integrated directly into Thunderbird itself. </p><p>Therefore, I would like to ask: is there any chance that Category Manager will be maintained and improved in the future, possibly by integrating it directly into Thunderbird’s core? </p><p>Thank you for your attention and for your work. </p><p>Kind regards, Michele Guarda </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,it,1765561;,michele.guarda
