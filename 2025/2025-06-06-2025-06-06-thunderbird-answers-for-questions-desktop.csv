It isn't even a setting I'm familiar with, or is it a hold over from days gone by? </p><p>I may not have made this clear, but I have 5 email profiles that are IMAP as the server I'm on does not support POP anymore.  </p><p>Until just two weeks ago all five were identical, worked perfectly and no changes had been made to preferences. None had ever begun examining email folders or begun deleting emails. One email profile began this strange behaviour and it, of all 5 is the oldest profile I have.  </p><p>It developed one new issue with the message pane once re-created, but still had this weird behaviour continuing to sift through folders and dump emails in the 'Trash' bin. Four days ago I watched as it went through every folder, before I removed the account and files. None of the other profiles have this issue, and all have the same IMAP protocol and retention settings. Four of them can only be accessed via TB and this problem one can both be accessed by TB and iPhone.  </p><p><strong>(And this raises the question as to what impact the iPhone may have on this client profile??) </strong> Interestingly, there was an iOS update a day or so before this client profile began misbehaving. Coincidence? </p><p>Fortunately, as you mentioned, the client can only store and display what the server has, and this may explain why, after deleting emails it subsequently downloads them yet again.

Your reply didn't solve the issue, but it did confirm what I discovered yesterday as a potential problem between two dissimilar clients (iPhone vs TB client) that might actually be the root cause of my issue. I discovered that I had the iPhone mail app running in background on my phone and had, about 5 months ago added the server's mail app. This worked well until, as I mentioned, recently when suddenly the TB client was locked in this struggle to keep the client synched to the server. </p><p>At no time was the iPhone mail app, server mail app or TB laptop client capable of deleting mail off the server (guess that's why I have over 11,000 msgs presently). I don't know what Apple in their infinity wisdom used as a protocol for mail as these details are not readily available.  </p><p>To recap, I removed the iPhone mail app and suddenly the laptop client settled down and stopped constantly downloading emails. To verify that I had isolated the issue, I removed the server mail app as well which had no impact at all. I left the phone this way over night and re-installed the server email app this morning. Everything appears to be fine now.  What's interesting to note as that the way I had (accidentally??) configured my phone originally had not changed in over 5 months and created no issues. Obviously something in the 'environment' changed that spawned this new issue. In any event, the TB client email is stable and functional again. There's a lesson here that sometimes technology and convenience can create new problems where none previously existed. </p><p><strong>And on a completely different note,</strong> I take issue with the developers who created this forum / feedback Mozilla help page. I was a QA manager for a large Fortune 500 company (a lifetime ago now). One of the <strong>wild cards or cockpit errors</strong> I liked to test was an unexpected input that a mainframe developer hadn't considered when designing MF data programs, especially when the data passed through edits on the data input device, through the concentrator platform without issue and on to the mainframe. These wild cards could present a condition that would otherwise be missed during MF processing.  </p><p>One developer stopped me and asked why the MF should catch the data error. My explanation was that the folks doing the data entry remotely were not designers or technical people, they were business people and it was always possible that someone 'might' inadvertently enter something that wouldn't be caught at data entry because of the finite edits we could do, but would need to be caught during MF processing. </p><p>Well, I told you that story so I could tell you this one.  </p><p>I was typing my reply to the latest on this problem when I noticed that the 'solved the problem' link was active. I thought, I'll click on it and then leave my explanation as to the completeness of the 'solution'. I expected that the link would run in background and update the record, but no, it cycled the screen, lost my input and updated the record and then sat there stupidly blank faced waiting for me to re-enter my reply. Not nice, and certainly not well planned either. </p>",bpilkey,false,0,0

After posting this it occurred to me to check my compuserve/aol account directly on their website and not use the TB client.  Going thru Firefox to the AOL site works fine; the message is there.

Which account is it? </p><p>There are a few odd things in your folders. </p> <ul><li> You have two sent folders for Gmail. Do you know why? Do all your sent messages go into one folder? Is the other one ever used? Its icon indicates that it is a server folder, so you should not be able to delete it. </li><li> One of the Gmail sent folders has unread messages in it. Why are unread messages in a sent message folder? Did you mark them unread or did they get saved that way originally? </li><li> You have a sent message folder for your <a href=""http://hispaniolarepairs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hispaniolarepairs.com</a> account in local folders. You must have created that. Why? How do you use it? </li></ul> <p>Is <a href=""http://hispaniolarepairs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hispaniolarepairs.com</a> the corporate account that uses Microsoft 365? Is it the one producing duplicate sent messages? It may be because the server places a copy in the sent folder automatically. When you tell Thunderbird to save a copy, it really is a copy, a duplicate of the sent message that was already saved. You should disable saving a copy, send a message to yourself from that account, and see how many copies of the sent message are saved. </p><p>I don't know any reason why using the Gmail SMTP server for both accounts should cause a problem. But there is much that I do not know. &nbsp;:( </p>",mozilla98,true,0,0
