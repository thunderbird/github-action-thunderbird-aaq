One email profile began this strange behaviour and it, of all 5 is the oldest profile I have.  </p><p>It developed one new issue with the message pane once re-created, but still had this weird behaviour continuing to sift through folders and dump emails in the 'Trash' bin. Four days ago I watched as it went through every folder, before I removed the account and files.

Four of them can only be accessed via TB and this problem one can both be accessed by TB and iPhone.  </p><p><strong>(And this raises the question as to what impact the iPhone may have on this client profile??) </strong> Interestingly, there was an iOS update a day or so before this client profile began misbehaving. Coincidence? </p><p>Fortunately, as you mentioned, the client can only store and display what the server has, and this may explain why, after deleting emails it subsequently downloads them yet again.
