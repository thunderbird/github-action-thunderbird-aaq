Since several weeks ago, for an unknown reason, the ""SENT"" folder on the smartphone shows all the messages which were sent, but not with the correct name of the person/organization to who the email was sent. All my messages in the ""SENT"" folder are recorded as having been sent to ""Lucie Payant"" with a picture of her avatar, instead of showing the name of the real correspondent. </p><p>However, the ""SENT"" folder on my PC is fine and shows the correct correspondent to whom the email was sent to. </p><p>I verified all my settings, and, as far as I know, everything seems correct on my cell.
