For example, with I open a message with subthreads, all the trailing messages are displayed on the tab.  The only way to get them off the tab is by clicking the x in every message.  A real pain. I don't want this. How do I stop it? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",artjohnston

Since several weeks ago, for an unknown reason, the ""SENT"" folder on the smartphone shows all the messages which were sent, but not with the correct name of the person/organization to who the email was sent. All my messages in the ""SENT"" folder are recorded as having been sent to ""Lucie Payant"" with a picture of her avatar, instead of showing the name of the real correspondent. </p><p>However, the ""SENT"" folder on my PC is fine and shows the correct correspondent to whom the email was sent to. </p><p>I verified all my settings, and, as far as I know, everything seems correct on my cell. This situation is very annoying and confusing. </p><p>Can you help me please. Raymond </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",raymondrancourt
