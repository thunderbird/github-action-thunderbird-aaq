La mia casella è ospitata su Aruba, ma utilizzo Thunderbird per la gestione quotidiana della posta. Ho già contattato l’assistenza Aruba, che dopo le loro verifiche mi ha confermato che lato server non risultano anomalie e mi ha quindi suggerito di rivolgermi a voi per ulteriori accertamenti. Il problema che riscontro è il seguente: da questa estate, in modo irregolare e non prevedibile, alcune email che invio da Thunderbird sembrano partire correttamente in quel momento, ma poi non arrivano ai destinatari. Inoltre non compaiono nemmeno nella mia cartella “Posta inviata”, né risultano in altre cartelle (posta in uscita, posta eliminata, ecc.). È come se alcune email, sporadicamente, si “perdessero” dopo l’invio. La maggior parte dei messaggi viene inviata senza problemi, ma in alcuni giorni può capitare che più email consecutive non vengano recapitare e non risultino più tracciabili: ad esempio, questa estate ho avuto un episodio in cui 5–6 email inviate nello stesso giorno non sono mai arrivate e non sono presenti nella posta inviata. Per cercare di monitorare la situazione avevo creato una cartella dedicata e inserito il mio indirizzo in copia nascosta, così da verificare la corretta consegna, ma non posso controllare ogni messaggio manualmente. Inoltre, anche con questo metodo, recentemente è ricapitato che una mia email non risultasse essere stata inviata né ricevuta. A questo punto avrei bisogno del vostro supporto per capire: se si tratta di un problema noto o già segnalato da altri utenti; se ci sono impostazioni o configurazioni in Thunderbird che potrei modificare per evitare che le email “scompaiano”; se esiste un metodo di diagnostica o log che potrei attivare per aiutarvi a identificare la causa. Il problema è purtroppo sporadico, ma impatta la mia operatività, poiché non posso ogni volta controllare manualmente se ogni email è stata effettivamente inviata. Vi ringrazio in anticipo per l’attenzione e per qualsiasi indicazione possiate darmi. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,it,1783798;,giulia5
