Last month(?) the time format for calendar entries changed from 12hr to 24hr. Then I saw that it also changed the time format in mailbox entries. I wanted to go back to 12 hr. </p><p>After a lot of searching, I FOUND A FIX posted in this Linux forum: </p><pre> <a href=""https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=358828"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=358828</a> </pre> <p>The time format is specified in a TB preference, intl.date_time.pattern_override.time_short using the Config Editor. </p><p>Go to Tools - Settings - General. </p><p>Press the Config Editor button - it is at the bottom of the General section, on the right. </p><p>In the screen that comes up, enter the preference name: </p><pre> intl.date_time.pattern_override.time_short </pre> <p>It shows the current value.  On my system it was HH:mm. </p><p>On the right side, press the pencil icon to change the value per below. </p><p>When done, press the Check box. </p><p>THE NEW VALUE WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL YOU EXIT AND RESTART TB. </p><p>The time format is a single stream in 4 parts: </p><pre>  hour - separator - minute - meridian </pre> <p>Note: No dashes or spaces between the parts. </p><p>Part 1 - H is 24hr  HH is 24hr with leading 0 </p><pre>             h is 12hr   hh is 12hr with leading 0 </pre> <p>Part 2 - separator character. Typically &nbsp;: Part 3 - mm is 2 digit minute Part 4 - bb displays AM/PM/noon.  If blank, nothing displayed. </p><p>I use h:mmbb for 12 hr format with no leading 0, and meridian. </p><pre>8:05AM, 12:00noon, 10:14PM </pre> <p>I believe this will work for all versions on all platforms. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",npdan
