There was a solution offered by user Yu5tiqX9og.  That post has apparently been archived, so I'm unable to see whether Yu5tiqX9og's solution/reply was ever posted. I managed to keep a copy of his solution, which he must have sent to me privately. </p><pre>  I <em>italic text</em> do remember that it did fix the problem I was having.   Here is the reply.  </pre> <p><em>italic text</em>The following steps might be helpful: ""Settings"" &gt; ""Composition"" &gt; ""Attachments"" section &gt; tick ""Offer to share for files larger than __ MB. (Please see the attached image.)"" </p><p>I don't have the exact image from the original post, but I've recreated what I believe it probably was. Please see attachment. I hope this helps, SweetTasha </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",pwrichcreek

When trying to click on image attachments for PNG and JPG/JPEG pictures, the behaviour is different: PNG images are displayed just fine in the Windows photo viewer, JPEG images are not. If I open the same images via double-click from the local disk, both open just fine in the same viewer. I have checked the file type settings already and even changed them to always ask me for JPEG images. I get asked just fine and see that TB wants to open the Windows photo viewer for both files types, but while it works for PNG, it does not for JPEG. There is no error message, just nothing happens, at least nothing visible to me. </p><p>When trying the same from a new user profile, it works as expected. I tried TB safe mode, deactivating all add-ons, but it still does not work in my main user profile. </p><p>I would be glad to receive hints for how to solve or at least debug this. Thanks in advance. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",kriegaex
