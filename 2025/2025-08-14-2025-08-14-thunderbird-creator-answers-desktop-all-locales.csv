Everything has always been fine. But recently, I've been having trouble sending email from one of my accounts. When I try to send a message, a message appears: enter the password for the user... Entering the password doesn't help, and another message appears asking me to contact the network administrator. I contacted them, but they didn't find the cause of the problem, but they suggested changing the password, which I did, and reinstalling Thunderbird, which I didn't do for fear of losing all my email. Changing the password helped for maybe two weeks, and then the problem started all over again. The problem only affects one email address and only on one computer. Sending messages from that address on Android works without any problems. Problem 2. I installed Thunderbird on my Android phone and encountered a problem when adding two accounts: the first installed without a problem, but I can't install the second one because every time I try, I get a message that the incoming mail server check failed - unknown error 42. Problem 3. I'm trying to install the program on my second phone - it downloads 99% from the Google Play Store and that's it.

Here are the details: Since two weeks the old laptop will no longer start up windows, no rescue methods work, only CMD is functioning. So I copied all relevant data, including Thunderbird profiles, to an external hard drive, from which I later copied said data to a brand new laptop. It took some renaming of the profiles to make her mails appear but her address book remains empty. As far as I can tell at least some of the necessary files are where they're supposed to be: there is an abook.mab.bak file in her profile but no abook.mab. There are also a bunch of abook.sqlite files. The date stamp on the sqlite file seems correct (1 August) but the one on the mab.bak is from 2020. I've been searching through the old laptop HD with CMD but I don't really know where or how to look (I use linux on my own gear so windows is exotic territory for me).

Il primo consiste nell'avere la cartella locale, che contiene i file dei messaggi, sotto Dropbox, in questo modo ho un aggiornamento costante e quasi istantaneo nel cloud. Il secondo è una copia settimanale di tutte le cartelle importanti (tra cui la cartella locale con i messaggi) su hd esterno. A quanto pare, questo sistema non garantisce contro i difetti di Thunderbird. Oggi ho scoperto che nella cartella Archivio del 2025, un messaggio email non veniva visualizzato. Per farla breve, ho riparato il file indice ed ho scoperto che i messaggi da febbraio a giugno sono scomparsi. Non è servito cancellare il file 2025.msf e far ripartire Thunderbird, non è servito il roll-back di Dropbox a date via via più distanti e non è servito il restore dall'hd esterno. Il problema è probabilmente nato a febbraio, Thunderbird non lo segnala, ad ogni archiviazione di un nuovo messaggio il file contenitore si corrompeva sempre di più. Il file corrotto è finito in Dropbox ed anche sul backup esterno. Quindi, se questa procedura di backup evidentemente non serve, che cosa si deve fare per evitare la perdita dei dati? Devo manualmente cancellare tutti i *.msf ad ogni chiusura? Mi sembra assurdo. Come posso tutelarmi dalla corruzione del file se Thunderbird non segnala alcun errore? Ritengo che sia molto importante introdurre un sistema di auto sorveglianza di Thunderbird, che so... qualcosa come un doppio indice, seguendo come esempio il sistema delle tabelle di allocazione file nei dischi.

Due to hardware complications (e.g., new motherboard) I had this done at a shop.  I took the computer in about noon on Wednesday, July 30.

During that period I received 83 emails to my Gmail account, which of course were not downloaded to Thunderbird, and also sent 13 -- all directly to/from the web Gmail site.  Since the activation of W-11 I have received 19 emails and sent 6 -- still all directly from the web Gmail site. Due to additional hardware issues, my computer did not come home until this (Thursday, August 14) afternoon.  After I got it hooked up, and running, I brought up Thunderbird. It has downloaded the 83 received + 13 sent, from 7/30 through 8/11, but not done anything with the 19 received + 6 sent emails since then.  When I turned Thunderbird off and back on -- or the entire computer off and back on, it has repeated this behavior.
