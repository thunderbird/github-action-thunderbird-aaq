Everything has always been fine. But recently, I've been having trouble sending email from one of my accounts. When I try to send a message, a message appears: enter the password for the user... Entering the password doesn't help, and another message appears asking me to contact the network administrator. I contacted them, but they didn't find the cause of the problem, but they suggested changing the password, which I did, and reinstalling Thunderbird, which I didn't do for fear of losing all my email. Changing the password helped for maybe two weeks, and then the problem started all over again. The problem only affects one email address and only on one computer. Sending messages from that address on Android works without any problems. Problem 2. I installed Thunderbird on my Android phone and encountered a problem when adding two accounts: the first installed without a problem, but I can't install the second one because every time I try, I get a message that the incoming mail server check failed - unknown error 42. Problem 3. I'm trying to install the program on my second phone - it downloads 99% from the Google Play Store and that's it. Is there any way to solve these problems, or should I change my email program? Best regards, Andrzej Witkowski </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",44andwi

Here are the details: Since two weeks the old laptop will no longer start up windows, no rescue methods work, only CMD is functioning. So I copied all relevant data, including Thunderbird profiles, to an external hard drive, from which I later copied said data to a brand new laptop. It took some renaming of the profiles to make her mails appear but her address book remains empty. As far as I can tell at least some of the necessary files are where they're supposed to be: there is an abook.mab.bak file in her profile but no abook.mab. There are also a bunch of abook.sqlite files. The date stamp on the sqlite file seems correct (1 August) but the one on the mab.bak is from 2020. I've been searching through the old laptop HD with CMD but I don't really know where or how to look (I use linux on my own gear so windows is exotic territory for me). Any help is more than welcome. </p>",thunderbird;contacts;,thunderbird,contacts,en-US,"",guy13dm
