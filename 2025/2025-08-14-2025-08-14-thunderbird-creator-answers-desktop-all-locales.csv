Everything has always been fine. But recently, I've been having trouble sending email from one of my accounts. When I try to send a message, a message appears: enter the password for the user... Entering the password doesn't help, and another message appears asking me to contact the network administrator. I contacted them, but they didn't find the cause of the problem, but they suggested changing the password, which I did, and reinstalling Thunderbird, which I didn't do for fear of losing all my email. Changing the password helped for maybe two weeks, and then the problem started all over again. The problem only affects one email address and only on one computer. Sending messages from that address on Android works without any problems. Problem 2. I installed Thunderbird on my Android phone and encountered a problem when adding two accounts: the first installed without a problem, but I can't install the second one because every time I try, I get a message that the incoming mail server check failed - unknown error 42. Problem 3. I'm trying to install the program on my second phone - it downloads 99% from the Google Play Store and that's it.
