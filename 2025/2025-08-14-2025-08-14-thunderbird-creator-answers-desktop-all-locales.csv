I'm used to my Inbox folders being compacted, either automatically, or sometimes I do it manually before a backup.  But just for the heck of it, I tried compacting other mail folders: Draft, Sent, Archives, Trash, and nothing happens!  A right-click on any of these folders has Compact as a viable (not grayed-out) option, but it just does nothing.  No message at the bottom of the screen or little blue progress bar.
