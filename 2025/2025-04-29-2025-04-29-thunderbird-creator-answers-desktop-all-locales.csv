Long time (25 years) user here, first time poster.  Just want to report weird issue/bug, thought to start here on the forum: I'm a fast typer and often sending emails quite quickly.  When I click 'reply' to a message, for example, I start typing pretty shortly thereafter.  What I'm seeing in the past month or two (sorry, don't have accurate info on when this started) is that the focus briefly jumps to the 'to' field of my message before jumping to the body (where I think it should be from the beginning).  The result is that I start typing my message (e.g. ""Hello Gloria, Thanks for your email ....""), and get an auto-matched address from my address book (e.g. ""He"" matches to ""Henry Yu"") plugged in to the to: field.  Then the rest of the text continues in the body field. </p><p>Sometimes I notice, sometimes I don't (if there are multiple recipients in particular it's harder to notice the extra address). </p><p>It's obviously undesirable to be sending messages to basically randomly selected addresses from my address book.  Why is Thunderbird sending the focus to the to: field for a moment, and then jumping to the body?  I suggest just putting the focus squarely on the body.  Or, lock my keyboard or something until the message is ready to receive input. </p><p>Or would anybody know a workaround to this?  Other than slowing down, which is of course what I'm doing at the moment. </p><p>I'm on Windows, T-bird 128.9.2esr (64-bit). </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>George </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728975;1728989;,gshowman

The answers vary over the years and Thunderbird version numbers, not to mention that I can't even find documentation from Mozilla on this topic (official method of changing font size for average user; official list of css keywords, their format, and examples of use; etc.). </p><p>I am trying to increase the size of the Thunderbird fonts—not the ones used to display an email, but the ones used to show my list of accounts, mailboxes, and folders and the list of emails I have received (Table View, not Card View). For what its worth, I've already changed the font magnification to 1.5x. </p><p>I set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true, and created a chrome folder in my profile directory. In it I put this userChrome.css: </p><p>/* Set font size in folder pane */ treechildren::-moz-tree-cell-text { 	font-size: 18pt&nbsp;!important; } </p><p>/* Set font size in message list page */ treechildren::-moz-tree-cell-text { 	font-size: 22pt&nbsp;!important; } </p><p>However, restarting Thunderbird (multiple times with various font sizes) shows no changes. What do I do to change my font sizes? (The average user shouldn't even need to know about profiles or style sheets!) </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",greg41
