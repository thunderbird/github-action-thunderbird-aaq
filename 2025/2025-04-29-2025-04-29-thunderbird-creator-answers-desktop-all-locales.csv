Long time (25 years) user here, first time poster.  Just want to report weird issue/bug, thought to start here on the forum: I'm a fast typer and often sending emails quite quickly.  When I click 'reply' to a message, for example, I start typing pretty shortly thereafter.  What I'm seeing in the past month or two (sorry, don't have accurate info on when this started) is that the focus briefly jumps to the 'to' field of my message before jumping to the body (where I think it should be from the beginning).  The result is that I start typing my message (e.g. ""Hello Gloria, Thanks for your email ....""), and get an auto-matched address from my address book (e.g. ""He"" matches to ""Henry Yu"") plugged in to the to: field.  Then the rest of the text continues in the body field. </p><p>Sometimes I notice, sometimes I don't (if there are multiple recipients in particular it's harder to notice the extra address). </p><p>It's obviously undesirable to be sending messages to basically randomly selected addresses from my address book.  Why is Thunderbird sending the focus to the to: field for a moment, and then jumping to the body?  I suggest just putting the focus squarely on the body.  Or, lock my keyboard or something until the message is ready to receive input. </p><p>Or would anybody know a workaround to this?  Other than slowing down, which is of course what I'm doing at the moment. </p><p>I'm on Windows, T-bird 128.9.2esr (64-bit). </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>George </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728975;1728989;1729009;,gshowman
