I am happy to use userChrome.css or userContent.css. Currently the selected background is too dark against my chosen dark background color. I simply need to lighten it a bit. I've been through the about:config pages looking at ""color"" and there isn't a setting I can find. So it appears I will need to use CSS in userChrome.css to accomplish this. I need to know what the magic incantation is to do this. I get it will involve the&nbsp;::selection pseudo-element, but which tag to apply it to, any special namespace? All? </p><p>An example of the selection color I am talking about is shown in this image (attached) </p><p>Preferably, this solution should continue to work when openSUSE updates to 136/7, etc.. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1728876;,mozcrash1
