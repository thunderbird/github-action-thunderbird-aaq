Recently, I uninstalled it to try other mail clients.  I decided to get TB working again but I'm incredibly frustrated that I'm unable to get an <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account and my <a href=""http://nexamortgage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">nexamortgage.com</a> account working.  The NEXA account is google based and is usually quite easy.  I also have a Keller Williams account that is also Google based and that worked fine on TB just before I tried to setup my NEXA account.  I have tried to enter both manually and have tried multiple different IMAP, SMTP Port settings and Server settings, but nothing is working. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1787659;1787668;1787669;,chunnel

They subsequently disappeared on my mobile phone also. The delete action was also uploaded to <a href=""http://GMAIL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">GMAIL.com</a> and I could not recover them there as it  said I am using a different program. I then went on my desktop in offline mode and all my emails are there in Thunderbird (minus approx 5 days worth while the desktop remained offline (no big deal).  </p><p>I have tried EVERYTHING to back up/export the profile from my desktop (while offline) and upload the mails onto my laptop to recover them and hopefully feed them to GMAIL. Nothing happens, they do not appear. I see all my emails within the thunderbird profile folder in a ""<a href=""http://IMAP.GMAIL.COM"" rel=""nofollow"">IMAP.GMAIL.COM</a>"" folder but not in a ""Mail"" folder (is that relevant)? Is the laptop loading the emails then immediately deleting them, because it is syncing with GMAIL? I am so so lost. Please help. Thank you </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1787705;,petgroom

The webmail for the account still worked and no change on the account. I use Thunderbird because I can see and read multiple email accounts on one page in the one program. I decided to put into Thunderbird the same email account with the correct password. I removed connections for the old account but still left all the past emails in the inbox. The new account receives emails but I can not reply or send out. To reply I have to change email accounts which is confusing for the receiver and also replies are in the wrong sent box. It used to be easy to adjust the settings including passwords words (which one my need to do frequently). Can someone tell be how I can fix the settings for outgoing emails.  I have at present 3 email accounts with the service provider Telstra and 3 gmail accounts (the latter are OK at present) </p>,thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1787719;,pbenken
