Recently, I uninstalled it to try other mail clients.  I decided to get TB working again but I'm incredibly frustrated that I'm unable to get an <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account and my <a href=""http://nexamortgage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">nexamortgage.com</a> account working.  The NEXA account is google based and is usually quite easy.  I also have a Keller Williams account that is also Google based and that worked fine on TB just before I tried to setup my NEXA account.  I have tried to enter both manually and have tried multiple different IMAP, SMTP Port settings and Server settings, but nothing is working. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1787659;,chunnel
