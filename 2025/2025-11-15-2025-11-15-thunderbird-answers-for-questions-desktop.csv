I did reset up Thunderbird on the M6700: I say reset up because I installed it in 2015 when I acquired the M6700, but have never used it.  Help/About indicates that it is Tb Version 38.3.0, and is up to date.  I was able to import Outlook files into Thunderbird without trouble, except that the import utility found Outlook Express files, not Outlook files, and there was no way to browse for different files.  What the program imported were files as they existed in 2015, not current Outlook 2007 files.  The Outlook Express files were on the computer that went bad that was replaced by the M6700, and which I was able to retrieve off of the hard drive that I removed from the dead computer. </p><p>Anyway, all of this has led me tho think that the way forward is to get a copy of PCmover, or other file transfer program to move Outlook 2007 from the M6700 to the 7720.  If it will run under  Windows 11, then hopefully Thunderbird 144.0.1 on the 7720 will be able to import something like 1.7 Gb of date from Outlook, which is the size of the outlook.pst file.  If not, then I will be back at square one. </p><p>Again, thanks for your help.  Regards, Dave </p>",dw01,false,0,0

All your data such as messages, passwords and user preferences, and changes made while you use Thunderbird, are stored in a special folder called a profile. Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there. It also means that you can uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall without losing your settings and data. </p><p>Having said that, typically Thunderbird is installed once with Administrator privileges. So it's available for all users on a computer. Do you want to use Thunderbird as another user, and use an existing profile for that other user? Then you don't need to re-install Thunderbird on that computer. All you need to do is to start Thunderbird once as the new user, and close it right after. That will create a new empty profile for that user. Then copy over the <strong>contents</strong> (i.e. all files and folder) of the existing profile to the newly created profile folder for the other user. </p><p>Also see <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p>",christ1,false,0,0

But I never want to erase any of these messages from the Network Solutions server or my laptop. I recently paid for 25 gigabytes of their bandwith and it's now more than I'll need for a lifetime.  </p><p>A problem arose because I originally had only 2 GB storage at Network Solutions, and I thus erased a year's worth of ""sent"" messages, in order to keep enough storage on their server. It was a ridiculously stingy setup that I was ignorant of. The problem was that on my Laptop TBird client, all those ""sent"" messages that I erased from Network Solutions were also erased from my TBird laptop folders and are now irretrievable. I think the reason was because I had a ""POP"" or ""IMAP"" configuration, and I wasn't aware that those messages would be erased on my laptop.  </p><p>So I'd like to (1) save all my TBird user files (there are a few of them), and I'd like to reload TBird as a new user with the configuration that will prevent losing any email messages (""inbox,"" ""Sent,"" ""Drafts,"" ""archives,"" etc.) on either my laptop or my NetworkSolutions server. Should I use POP or IMAP? Can you please guide me step by step? I would occasionally want to reload one of my previous TBird user accounts to find old email messages, then of course, switch back to my new user account. Is that very difficult to do? </p><p>I hope this is clear enough and it shouldn't be too difficult. Please let me know if you need to know more. Again, many thanks. When you say, ""Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program,"" does that mean that this folder is already backed up and there's no way it can be erased unless I erase it? Can the POP or IMAP configuration erase it? Are you saying that I can simply re-install the latest version of TBird and all those previous user folders will automatically be backed up and not be erased? Do I first have to uninstall the existing TBird version?  </p><p>When you say, ""Then copy over the contents (i.e. all files and folder) of the existing profile to the newly created profile folder for the other user,"" can you please tell me the file location of this existing profile?

I suppose you now know why backups are important.

As per your description you should have an IMAP account. But you should stop guessing, and check it yourself. At the top right of the Thunderbird window, click the menu button ≡ &gt; Account Settings &gt; Server Settings </p> <blockquote> I'd like to (1) save all my TBird user files </blockquote> <p>What exactly are ""TBird user files""?

Of course you can do that, but what for? </p> <blockquote> Should I use POP or IMAP? </blockquote> <p>Regardless of which protocol you want to use, your only insurance for data loss are backups created on a regular basis. If you want to set up a new POP account, all you get from the server is Inbox. You'd have to copy all your other stuff from the server manually to a new POP account. However, you already have an IMAP account with all your (remaining) data readily available. So all you'd need to do is to turn on IMAP synchronization for the IMAP account if not done yet, and create backups on a regular basis. Job done. </p> <blockquote> When you say, ""Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program,"" does that mean that this folder is already backed up and there's no way it can be erased unless I erase it? </blockquote> <p>Backups of the Thunderbird profile are not created automatically. It is your responsibility to do this. As stated before, backups will ensure you can recover your data in case of data loss, for whatever reason. And trust me, there are many possible reasons why data loss can occur. </p> <blockquote> Are you saying that I can simply re-install the latest version of TBird and all those previous user folders will automatically be backed up and not be erased? </blockquote> <p>Nothing is backed up automatically. But re-installing the application will not erase the profile, unless you explicitly tell it to do so. </p> <blockquote> Do I first have to uninstall the existing TBird version? </blockquote> <p>I have no idea why you want to re-install TB in the first place.
