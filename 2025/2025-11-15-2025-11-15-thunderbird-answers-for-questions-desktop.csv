As a matter of fact, I did not accept the request for upgrating T.Bird for long, until I did click on the wrong point... The old version had&nbsp;: on left my accounts, on right, a line with the selected mail / mail box content, and below, a window opening the selected mail. Now, I have 3 windows&nbsp;: - Left&nbsp;: the mail boxes - ""middle""&nbsp;: the list of stocked mails - ""right"" (when you find the way to see them...)&nbsp;: the selected mail, so formated that it's almost impossible to read it&nbsp;! If I'd been clear, the change is real&nbsp;! But I did may be refused the upgrating quite for a long time, and this version might be some monthes old. Any how, on my 14' screen, it's unusable&nbsp;! Plus, I did a mistake in changing the organisation of the central windows, witch is blocked with the alphabetic order when I want them to be organised through there date / age ... Impossible to get back from alphabetic to age order&nbsp;! So I would like to re-install the old version that was perfectly adapted to my screen and ... myself&nbsp;! I add a sceen copy for you to see. For your french, don't worry, unfortunatly I see every day french desapearing in my own country&nbsp;! People are using less and less words, but, that's an other problem... Thanks again for your help. </p>",K.Pete.A,false,0,0

All your data such as messages, passwords and user preferences, and changes made while you use Thunderbird, are stored in a special folder called a profile. Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there. It also means that you can uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall without losing your settings and data. </p><p>Having said that, typically Thunderbird is installed once with Administrator privileges. So it's available for all users on a computer. Do you want to use Thunderbird as another user, and use an existing profile for that other user? Then you don't need to re-install Thunderbird on that computer. All you need to do is to start Thunderbird once as the new user, and close it right after. That will create a new empty profile for that user. Then copy over the <strong>contents</strong> (i.e. all files and folder) of the existing profile to the newly created profile folder for the other user. </p><p>Also see <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p>",christ1,false,0,0

But I never want to erase any of these messages from the Network Solutions server or my laptop. I recently paid for 25 gigabytes of their bandwith and it's now more than I'll need for a lifetime.  </p><p>A problem arose because I originally had only 2 GB storage at Network Solutions, and I thus erased a year's worth of ""sent"" messages, in order to keep enough storage on their server. It was a ridiculously stingy setup that I was ignorant of. The problem was that on my Laptop TBird client, all those ""sent"" messages that I erased from Network Solutions were also erased from my TBird laptop folders and are now irretrievable. I think the reason was because I had a ""POP"" or ""IMAP"" configuration, and I wasn't aware that those messages would be erased on my laptop.  </p><p>So I'd like to (1) save all my TBird user files (there are a few of them), and I'd like to reload TBird as a new user with the configuration that will prevent losing any email messages (""inbox,"" ""Sent,"" ""Drafts,"" ""archives,"" etc.) on either my laptop or my NetworkSolutions server. Should I use POP or IMAP? Can you please guide me step by step? I would occasionally want to reload one of my previous TBird user accounts to find old email messages, then of course, switch back to my new user account. Is that very difficult to do? </p><p>I hope this is clear enough and it shouldn't be too difficult. Please let me know if you need to know more. Again, many thanks. When you say, ""Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program,"" does that mean that this folder is already backed up and there's no way it can be erased unless I erase it? Can the POP or IMAP configuration erase it? Are you saying that I can simply re-install the latest version of TBird and all those previous user folders will automatically be backed up and not be erased? Do I first have to uninstall the existing TBird version?  </p><p>When you say, ""Then copy over the contents (i.e. all files and folder) of the existing profile to the newly created profile folder for the other user,"" can you please tell me the file location of this existing profile? I apologize for my ignorance on these matters and thanks again. I'll study the link you provided. </p>",ttonon1,false,0,0

IMAP accounts sync the messages on PC with the messages on server. Deleting from the PC causes the message on server to be deleted. IMAP achieves what you want, so long as you don't delete the messages. You then have all on both.  Either can work. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
