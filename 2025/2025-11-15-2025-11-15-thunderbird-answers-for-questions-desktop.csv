All your data such as messages, passwords and user preferences, and changes made while you use Thunderbird, are stored in a special folder called a profile. Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there. It also means that you can uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall without losing your settings and data. </p><p>Having said that, typically Thunderbird is installed once with Administrator privileges. So it's available for all users on a computer. Do you want to use Thunderbird as another user, and use an existing profile for that other user? Then you don't need to re-install Thunderbird on that computer. All you need to do is to start Thunderbird once as the new user, and close it right after. That will create a new empty profile for that user. Then copy over the <strong>contents</strong> (i.e. all files and folder) of the existing profile to the newly created profile folder for the other user. </p><p>Also see <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p>",christ1,false,0,0
