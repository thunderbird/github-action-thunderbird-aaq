Here are some steps that may work for you. - import the new addresses - now, highlight the merged addressbook and export to csv format - load into a spreadsheet and use the spreadsheet facilities to sort (all rows except first row) and remove duplicates - save as csv - start thunderbird and remove all addresses  - import the csv   </p><p>The downside is that some miscellaneous data may be lost that was in one of the duplicates. My suggestion is to just do the merge and, over time, work through the duplicates.

One will be the default used by the server and it should have all your sent emails stored in it. However, if no emails display in the server Sent folder, then Thunderbird cannot display what does not exist. I have come across someone who had more than one and was unknowingly subscribing to see the wrong sent folder. If you discover more than one: </p> <ul><li> In Thunderbird  - Unsubscribe from seeing the sent folder </li><li> In Webmail  - delete the additional Sent folder (not the default) </li></ul> <p>Then do the following to resubscribe In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Right click on imap account and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> click on 'Refresh' </li><li> Then select the 'Sent' folder - it must have the checkbox selected and it must be highlighted </li><li> Click on 'Subscribe' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Now you know you are subscribed to see the correct Sent folder. </p><p>As it's an IMAP account, I would advise you use: </p> <ul><li> Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders </li><li> 'When sending messages, automatically' </li><li> Select 'place a copy in' </li><li> Select 'other' and select sent on email address. </li></ul> <p>However, if this is a gmail imap account, do not select 'Place a copy in' because gmail auto put a copy into the Sent label on server, so when your imap Sent folder synchronises with server it should display whatever is on server.

In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li> Right click on Sent imap folder and select 'Properties' </li><li> General Information tab </li><li> Select checkbox 'When getting new messages for this account, always check this folder.' </li></ul> <p>Finally, Exit Thunderbird and wait a few moments for background processes to complete.
