I have set a filter Header: Contains:  <a href=""http://klaviyomail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">klaviyomail.com</a> and delete, but that never happens. Comcast told me to use the From: field, but this can be spoofed and there are millions of fake ones. When I had over 300 filter rules, the system stopped working for me and the tech support genius fixed the problem by deleting all my filters. I started sending the emails as an attachment to missed-spam@comcast.net, but nothing ever happened. Comcast's security team told me to use abuse@comcast.net, but not to forward the emails, but to copy &amp; paste them (with full headers) into another email with Phishing Email as the subject. This was supposedly because forwarding the email doesn't have the complete header. Well, the only difference is that forwarded emails have FWD: ahead of the original subject and --------------Forwarded Message------------- before the original header. So I delete both and the system sends me a Thank You email, most of the time. Other times I get a Message Blocked email because the email <em><strong>contained spam!</strong></em> I wrote a letter to Comcast's president and I got an email from some tech manager who actually knows which end of a computer to use.  The only way this gets fixed is if enough Comcast customers start complaining and writing letters (I couldn't find his email) to the president of Comcast. A few hundred letters might cause him to order some changes. I did find out the Comcast uses a 3rd party spam filter company, that is not Yahoo. </p>",jsmoley,false,1,0

Does Thunderbird allow this? </blockquote> <p>It can be done,  but you are making hard work out of something that should be simple. </p><p>Lets start at the beginning.  Are you dedicated to using this web interface to access your account,  or can you do everything you need with your emails from within Thunderbird? </p><p>If yes,  just use Thunderbird and move whatever emails you want to local folders (the account named as such in Thunderbird) on a daily/weekly basis and they will be stored as emails on your local PC,  no searching for files on your hard disk stored using arcane file names only you understand and can sometimes remember,  just another folder of emails in your Thunderbird program.  No different to your imap account email in Thunderbird,  but no longer on your providers mail server. </p><p>As long as your mail provider is not using googles gmail as a backend, you can also use the archive feature in Thunderbird to point any archived mail to the archive folder on local folders where they can be stored in yearly groups in their original folder names (they are created as needed automatically)  </p><p>So I would recommend a combination of archiving with manual mail moving to get almost everything off the mail server and store is locally in Thunderbird. </p><p>Alternatively you could create a POP account in Thunderbird which will download everything in the inbox on the server, and optionally immediately or later delete it from the server (there are retention on server settings in account settings).  The result is a local only copy of mails which are stored only locally and your server account will be emptied on each download.  No muss no fuss. </p><p>The subset is the problem in this ointment,  as until the mail is downloaded Thunderbird has no idea what subsets you might even have to try and define.  It is a but like saying words beginning with Q is a subset of the contents of a dictionary.  You have no idea what the quantum of that is until you actually open the dictionary and read it.  Hence mail clients mostly work on get it all or get nothing principals. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
