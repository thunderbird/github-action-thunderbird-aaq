Opened it and re-entered all my accounts. The first one brought up exception sayin google did not have valid certificate!!!!! I granted an exception. Closed thunderbird and reopened it. Downloaded messages and exception request did not come up. So I have achieved a work arround but why does Thunderbird not accept Google certificate? Apple does on my iphone. </p>,auskartdyno,false,0,0
