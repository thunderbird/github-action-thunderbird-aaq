This involves intercepting encrypted email traffic, decrypting it using its own certificate, scanning the content for threats, and then re-encrypting it before sending it on to your email provider's server. </p><p>The certificate is generated on the fly, but Thunderbird rightly complaints about it because the issuer of that cert (Norton) is unknown and hence not trusted. To avoid errors or warnings in Thunderbird, you may need to import Norton 360's root certificate into Thunderbird's trusted certificate store. </p><p>Some users may have privacy concerns about a third-party like Norton 360 having access to the content of their emails sent via an encrypted connection, as well as having access to their email password. </p><p>Alternatively you can disable Email Protection within Norton 360 in order to get things working again. </p><p>Personally, I'd get rid of Norton 360 altogether and stick with Windows Defender. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

Alternative answers are those as seen in the other numerous threads (disable email protection or delete Norton).  Why Norton hides this solution on their website behind the roboai, no idea.  <a href=""https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/norton-security/current/solutions/v20240108183457190"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/norton-security/current/solutions/v20240108183457190</a> was the URL it gave me.   From that page: </p><p>The certificate file is C:/ProgramData/Norton/AntiVirus/wscert.der   The instructions say to copy this to the desktop.  No idea why; I assume it's simply convenience since that's where the TB import selection box will default to. </p><p>1.    In Mozilla Thunderbird, click the menu icon (three lines) &gt; Settings. 2.    On the left pane, select Privacy &amp; Security. 3.    Scroll down to the Certificates section, and then click Manage Certificates. 4.    On the Authorities tab, click Import. 5.    Locate the wscert.der file, select the file, then click Open. 6.    In the alert that appears, check Trust this CA to identify websites, and then click OK. 7.    When the Certificate Manager screen appears again, click the Servers tab.  Ensure that there is no entry for Norton Email Protection. 8.    If any entry exists, delete it and click OK to save the changes.  The Email Protection certificate from Norton is now imported to Mozilla Thunderbird. </p><p>For me, the issue only started a few weeks ago on one PC and a few days ago on the other.  Imported the certificate and all is fine now. </p>",User1415950,false,2,0

I installed the ImportExportTools extension.  To be honest, I am confused about what is what - the native Import vs the I-E-T-Extension.  I think I have tried both with always the same result - I can see the imported folder structure (1 folder per month ...) in the Local Folders section, but no messages. Then I created a mbox zip file - 1.94 GB (just under the limit) and the same thing happened ... Then I used the I-E-T-Extension Folder Context menu to import ""All EML Messages from a Directory + Subdirectories"" - this replicates the Apple Mail subfolder structure in the .../V10 folder - not very useful, but at least the messages are there, ""All EML Messages from a Directory"" or ""Individual Messages"" just report 0 files imported instantly. Repeating the same process on 2 additional years' worth of messages lead to the same result that I described in the original question - importing happens (Finder reports 2 lots of 10,000+ items being added to the Profiles folderstructure, but the disk space used only creeps up minimally) - the folder structure in the mbox files gets imported but the messages don't. So, I have now imported 3 years worth of Apple Mail .mbox export folders into the Local Folders of Thunderbird.  2 of these years' messages I can see and on the other 2 ( = the same year repeated twice into a different local folder) there are just the Apple Mail folders visible, but no messages. &nbsp;????  I am thoroughly confused&nbsp;!!! Eventually the process hangs with 174 of 12246 EML files imported, none nof them visible. Is there a way that I can make all messages in a folder tree ""Unread"", which would make them easier to spot in the sidebar? </p>",kjahn1,false,0,0

You can rename an Apple *.emlx <strong>message</strong> to *. eml by deleting the ""x"" and drag it directly in any folder in opened Thunderbird (and not in the TB profile folder). <strong>But you cannot copy/paste a </strong>folder<strong> like 2022-Archive.mbox neither directly in Local Folders in the Thunderbird profile folder nor in the Local Folders in the Folder Pane.</strong> Thunderbird has a very different folder/subfolders hierarchy versus Apple Mail structures and <strong>in its profile doesn't recognize neither folders with the *.mbox extension nor files with an *.eml extension </strong> </p> <em><p>kjahn1 <a href=""#answer-1703417"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> I also tried your suggested alternative method with a drag and drop of messages to a new folder.

One more description &amp; a screenshot to illustrate the action&nbsp;:  In Apple Mail Inbox I select all messages and drag them in the folder ""Essai"" which I created on my desktop. Now 263 messages are stored in folder Essai as 263 .eml files.

I tried to delete the password for the problem account to force Thunderbird to ask for it and thus indicate it was checking the account for mail.  However when I went to Settings&gt;Privacy&amp;Security&gt;Passwords&gt;Saved Passwords&gt;Show Passwords, it asked me to verify my identity by entering a password.  I don't have a Windows master password for my desktop computer.  I have Thunderbird also running on a laptop computer where I *do* have a master password, and there I could enter that password to reveal the account passwords.
