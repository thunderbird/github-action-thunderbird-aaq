Opened it and re-entered all my accounts. The first one brought up exception sayin google did not have valid certificate!!!!! I granted an exception. Closed thunderbird and reopened it. Downloaded messages and exception request did not come up. So I have achieved a work arround but why does Thunderbird not accept Google certificate? Apple does on my iphone. </p>,auskartdyno,false,0,0

This involves intercepting encrypted email traffic, decrypting it using its own certificate, scanning the content for threats, and then re-encrypting it before sending it on to your email provider's server. </p><p>The certificate is generated on the fly, but Thunderbird rightly complaints about it because the issuer of that cert (Norton) is unknown and hence not trusted. To avoid errors or warnings in Thunderbird, you may need to import Norton 360's root certificate into Thunderbird's trusted certificate store. </p><p>Some users may have privacy concerns about a third-party like Norton 360 having access to the content of their emails sent via an encrypted connection, as well as having access to their email password. </p><p>Alternatively you can disable Email Protection within Norton 360 in order to get things working again. </p><p>Personally, I'd get rid of Norton 360 altogether and stick with Windows Defender. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

Guess they are somewhere, local here but likely some upgrade created a new archive area - folder somewhere - that I had no idea about.  Searched, but to no success.  Guess I'll keep trying. </p>",ngonline-uk,false,0,0
