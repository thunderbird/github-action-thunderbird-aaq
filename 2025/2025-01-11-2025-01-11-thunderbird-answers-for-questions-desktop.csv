This involves intercepting encrypted email traffic, decrypting it using its own certificate, scanning the content for threats, and then re-encrypting it before sending it on to your email provider's server. </p><p>The certificate is generated on the fly, but Thunderbird rightly complaints about it because the issuer of that cert (Norton) is unknown and hence not trusted. To avoid errors or warnings in Thunderbird, you may need to import Norton 360's root certificate into Thunderbird's trusted certificate store. </p><p>Some users may have privacy concerns about a third-party like Norton 360 having access to the content of their emails sent via an encrypted connection, as well as having access to their email password. </p><p>Alternatively you can disable Email Protection within Norton 360 in order to get things working again. </p><p>Personally, I'd get rid of Norton 360 altogether and stick with Windows Defender. </p>",christ1,false,1,0

Alternative answers are those as seen in the other numerous threads (disable email protection or delete Norton).

From that page: </p><p>The certificate file is C:/ProgramData/Norton/AntiVirus/wscert.der   The instructions say to copy this to the desktop.  No idea why; I assume it's simply convenience since that's where the TB import selection box will default to. </p><p>1.    In Mozilla Thunderbird, click the menu icon (three lines) &gt; Settings. 2.    On the left pane, select Privacy &amp; Security. 3.    Scroll down to the Certificates section, and then click Manage Certificates. 4.    On the Authorities tab, click Import. 5.    Locate the wscert.der file, select the file, then click Open. 6.    In the alert that appears, check Trust this CA to identify websites, and then click OK. 7.    When the Certificate Manager screen appears again, click the Servers tab.  Ensure that there is no entry for Norton Email Protection. 8.    If any entry exists, delete it and click OK to save the changes.  The Email Protection certificate from Norton is now imported to Mozilla Thunderbird. </p><p>For me, the issue only started a few weeks ago on one PC and a few days ago on the other.  Imported the certificate and all is fine now. </p>",User1415950,false,2,0

I installed the ImportExportTools extension.  To be honest, I am confused about what is what - the native Import vs the I-E-T-Extension.  I think I have tried both with always the same result - I can see the imported folder structure (1 folder per month ...) in the Local Folders section, but no messages. Then I created a mbox zip file - 1.94 GB (just under the limit) and the same thing happened ... Then I used the I-E-T-Extension Folder Context menu to import ""All EML Messages from a Directory + Subdirectories"" - this replicates the Apple Mail subfolder structure in the .../V10 folder - not very useful, but at least the messages are there, ""All EML Messages from a Directory"" or ""Individual Messages"" just report 0 files imported instantly. Repeating the same process on 2 additional years' worth of messages lead to the same result that I described in the original question - importing happens (Finder reports 2 lots of 10,000+ items being added to the Profiles folderstructure, but the disk space used only creeps up minimally) - the folder structure in the mbox files gets imported but the messages don't. So, I have now imported 3 years worth of Apple Mail .mbox export folders into the Local Folders of Thunderbird.  2 of these years' messages I can see and on the other 2 ( = the same year repeated twice into a different local folder) there are just the Apple Mail folders visible, but no messages. &nbsp;????  I am thoroughly confused&nbsp;!!! Eventually the process hangs with 174 of 12246 EML files imported, none nof them visible. Is there a way that I can make all messages in a folder tree ""Unread"", which would make them easier to spot in the sidebar? </p>",kjahn1,false,0,0

Where did you get those .emlx files from? Apple Mail stores its messages in the .emlx format.

You seem to do everything in the Finder: in the user Library you open the folder (Apple) ""Mail"", copy some folder like 2022-Archive.mbox and paste it in ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/sgdhdfhg.default-esr/Mail/Local Folders/  just as I did in a test for my screenshot below <strong>This CANNOT work!!</strong> You are right saying the Apple message format *.emlx is very similar to Thunderbird's *.eml format. You can rename an Apple *.emlx <strong>message</strong> to *. eml by deleting the ""x"" and drag it directly in any folder in opened Thunderbird (and not in the TB profile folder). <strong>But you cannot copy/paste a </strong>folder<strong> like 2022-Archive.mbox neither directly in Local Folders in the Thunderbird profile folder nor in the Local Folders in the Folder Pane.</strong> Thunderbird has a very different folder/subfolders hierarchy versus Apple Mail structures and <strong>in its profile doesn't recognize neither folders with the *.mbox extension nor files with an *.eml extension </strong> </p> <em><p>kjahn1 <a href=""#answer-1703417"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> I also tried your suggested alternative method with a drag and drop of messages to a new folder.

I didn't mean to drag/drop the <strong>folder</strong> containing the exported .eml files but the <strong>entire pack of the .eml files</strong> in a folder in the opened Thunderbird. One more description &amp; a screenshot to illustrate the action&nbsp;:  In Apple Mail Inbox I select all messages and drag them in the folder ""Essai"" which I created on my desktop. Now 263 messages are stored in folder Essai as 263 .eml files.

Your last message with the screenshot makes it very clear and I have followed it successfully.  Where I went wrong all along was my expectation that someone in the Thunderbird community would have come up with a way to traverse the mbox file hierarchy to extract the .eml files for import, but that is probably a bit naive (I am not a programmer!)

When you open this folder you'll see it contains an file named ""mbox"". This is an mbox file compatible with the Thunderbird message folder format.

My popstate.dat isn't corrupted. I ran several tests, deleting it every time and starting fresh. About the different name/username being logged, I don't get it. popstate.dat isn't logging those, so how could that be the issue? </p><p>I tried the following: - Made two identical copies of the entire TB directory structure. - On the first copy, started the Windows client -&gt; duplicates get downloaded. - Copied popstate.dat from first to second copy. - Started Windows client on the second copy -&gt; nothing gets downloaded. </p><p>This proves that popstate.dat is the only source of the problem, and the only difference in the popstate.dat files are the timestamps. So why does an old timestamp make the Windows client think it has to download the messages again, although identical messages with the same UIDL are located in its Inbox? This smells like a bug to me. </p>",bomat,false,0,0

As I said, as soon as I fix one problem another one crops up.  Upon ChatGPT's suggestion, I tried deleting <em>all</em> *.msf files in my profile, then restarted Thunderbird and let it recreate them.  This seems to have fixed the problem I wrote about - I can now compact all folders.  Hurray! </p><p>(2) However now I find that Thunderbird is not checking for mail on at least one of my accounts, though it is on other accounts.  (All my accounts are POP accounts.)  I have all accounts set to ""Check for new messages at startup"" and ""Check every 10 minutes"".  I tried to delete the password for the problem account to force Thunderbird to ask for it and thus indicate it was checking the account for mail.  However when I went to Settings&gt;Privacy&amp;Security&gt;Passwords&gt;Saved Passwords&gt;Show Passwords, it asked me to verify my identity by entering a password.  I don't have a Windows master password for my desktop computer.  I have Thunderbird also running on a laptop computer where I *do* have a master password, and there I could enter that password to reveal the account passwords.  (And, BTW, the laptop Thunderbird *does* check for mail on the subject account.)  On my desktop computer I tried leaving the password field empty but that didn't work. </p><p>(3) I tried doing a search for new mail that might be hiding somewhere but find that searching on Local searches some mailboxes (first-level folders) but not others.  This problem dates back several days. </p><p>(4) When I set up columns as I want them and do ""Apply current view to.. &gt; Folder and its children &gt; Local"", it applies the view to some mailboxes but not others. </p><p>Any suggestions re my latest problems?  Thanks! </p>",coffent1,false,0,0
