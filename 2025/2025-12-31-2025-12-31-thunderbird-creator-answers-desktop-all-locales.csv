I made a new profile to confirm it's not just an old profile which should not be an issue anyway and I get greeted with the original nice onboarding tool, I enter my email and click continue, it pops a window asking for my oauth2 crap and its done and setup! Perfect now I go to add another account and get a Different window/page from before, Ok cool enter email Oauth2 pops and I do that, then sends me to the password page asking for a password and ""Your login"" whatever that's suppose to be. entering a password does nothing but fail (makes sense since outlook only likes oauth2 at the moment) and I have no idea what to fill ""Your login"" with. the Continue button is greyed out and closing the login window shows it was never added. </p><p>now to make this worse this started with being unable to send an email. there is NO way that I can find to refresh the outgoing server auth token if it either expires or breaks (which does seem to happen even if it's not ""suppose to""), apart from removing and re adding the account but as stated above that is also broken you can't send emails from thunderbird unless you save the draft and send it from another device that works </p><p>more testing and the ""new"" login tool failed and worked at the same time it didn't ask for oauth the second time I tried but worked and could send... </p><p>like it's mainly two things that are broken, the newish login tool and the inability to refresh oauth tokens if it fails I'm running linux but this happens to people I know that use this In a work and personal capacity on windows as well. like do some basic login testing at least with outlook accounts like that might be the main issue but still they are one of the big players and this is unacceptable for a email client </p>",piman13;MattAuSupport;mozilla98;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0;solver_id:7300245,4,0,1,,,
