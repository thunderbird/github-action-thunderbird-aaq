Specifically, it attached the content of an old file (sent to the same Recipient X 8 days ago) that happened to have the identical filename. </p><p>File A (New, in .eml): Filename file.enc, Size 2MB (Correct) </p><p>File B (Old, sent 8 days ago): Filename file.enc, Size 500KB (Incorrect) </p><p>Sent Email contained: File B's content (500KB) masked under File A's name. </p><p>Expected Result: Thunderbird should have extracted and sent the specific attachment embedded in the .eml file I was forwarding, ensuring a unique temporary path to avoid collisions with previous file handles or cached data. </p>",thunderbird;attachments;,thunderbird,attachments,it,1790374;,avv.francescocantiero
