It's likely you are invoking a shortcut. </p> <ul><li> Rewrap message text	'Ctrl' + 'R' </li></ul> <p>This would mean the text you are typing would now go the very bottom. </p><p>You say it does not happen every time you press 'r' and that would be correct, but it seems on some occasions you may be depressing the 'Ctrl' key at the same time. The Ctrl key is positioned in bottom left and bottom right of keyboard, so possible you have your hands more flat and leaning on the corner.  </p><p>In which case I would also warn you that if you do that whilst pressing Enter to go to a new line, you could accidentally invoke a send. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I might have misunderstood your (quite clear) instructions so I am attaching a screenshot of the resulting userChrome.css file. Basically, I simply added the line you mentioned and saved the file. </p><p>To ensure there was nothing conflicting with my configuration, I: - created a new user profile  - added ../chrome/userChrome.css to the new profile - started Thunderbird with that new profile - switched the flag ""toolkit.legacy..."" to True - restarted Thunderbird - changed from the default card view to table view in vertical mode I still just get a dark continuous background instead of a zebra pattern. </p><p>Please, let me know whether I am missing anything obvious. BTW, I noticed that when starting Thunderbird from a terminal (/Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird, I'm on a mac today) I do get a lot of error messages with the same content: ""...Rethrowing (from nts_ValueForProperty:) NSInternalInconsistencyException: Unhandled error (NSCocoaErrorDomain, 134092) occurred during faulting and was thrown: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=134092 ""(null)"" CoreData: error: Unhandled error occurred during faulting: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=134092 ""(null)"" ({ })"" ... but Thunderbird does open normally and this doesn't seem related to the problem at hand. I am listing here just in case this might be causing any issue. </p><p>Anyways, thanks for your help. Any hints/pointers would be welcomed. </p><p>Best regards, Paulo ... </p>",ad23,false,0,0
