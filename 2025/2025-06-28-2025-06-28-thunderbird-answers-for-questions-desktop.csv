I might have misunderstood your (quite clear) instructions so I am attaching a screenshot of the resulting userChrome.css file. Basically, I simply added the line you mentioned and saved the file. </p><p>To ensure there was nothing conflicting with my configuration, I: - created a new user profile  - added ../chrome/userChrome.css to the new profile - started Thunderbird with that new profile - switched the flag ""toolkit.legacy..."" to True - restarted Thunderbird - changed from the default card view to table view in vertical mode I still just get a dark continuous background instead of a zebra pattern. </p><p>Please, let me know whether I am missing anything obvious. BTW, I noticed that when starting Thunderbird from a terminal (/Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird, I'm on a mac today) I do get a lot of error messages with the same content: ""...Rethrowing (from nts_ValueForProperty:) NSInternalInconsistencyException: Unhandled error (NSCocoaErrorDomain, 134092) occurred during faulting and was thrown: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=134092 ""(null)"" CoreData: error: Unhandled error occurred during faulting: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=134092 ""(null)"" ({ })"" ... but Thunderbird does open normally and this doesn't seem related to the problem at hand. I am listing here just in case this might be causing any issue. </p><p>Anyways, thanks for your help. Any hints/pointers would be welcomed. </p><p>Best regards, Paulo ... </p>",ad23,false,0,0

Are you using any specific theme? </p><p>David: FYI, when I used your code with the new profile it did not work. I then changed the theme from default dark to the default light mode and now I see the zebra pattern. Yet, it does not seem to work on the dark mode. I believe the theme settings are overwriting the code. Does your Thunderbird installation uses dark mode?  Also, when I move for my regular profile it does not work with any of the themes so this seems to be a hard-to-track issue. </p><p>I'll keep testing. </p>",ad23,false,0,0
