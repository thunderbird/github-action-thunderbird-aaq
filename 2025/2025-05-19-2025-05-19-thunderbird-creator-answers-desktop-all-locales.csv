This is only happening for my IMAP account and not the 2 Gmail accounts (which are also IMAP). I see the ""new message"" count but no new messages are displaying. I see TB connecting, logging in and opening my IMAP inbox without errors. IMAP is configure according to my Network Solutions email provider (Port 993, SSL/TLS, normal password). After closing and opening TB several times sometimes the messages load. Sometimes once a new email is received that and other new messages will display. </p><p>The uploaded image shows my inbox with a new message count of 47, quick filter set to unread and no messages displaying. </p><p>Not sure if this is related but TB also is having occasional issues copying messages to the sent folder after sending. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jeff20

I can also see that I can write a new message from that template, no problem. However, I cannot for the life of me, figure out how to reply to an incoming message with the template I have created. I can see that 'reply with template' appears in the message filter but since the template reply could be relevant to a number of 'keywords', it isn't practical to set it up as an automatic filter and response. Please can you advise how to manually 'reply with template' to an incoming email. Thank you </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1734532;,Acorn50
