Thunderbird does not do any form of blacklisting, so I would assume you are getting some form of message on sending the email or some form of reply to mail you send. </p><p>I have seen a number of posts here from various US based ISP'srecently that blacklist any internet address except those they issue from connecting to the internet using their service from accessing their mail servers,  others get sensitive about their sending servers. </p><p>In those cases using a hotspot, any hotspot, be it wifi, bluetooth or a VPN will see you blacklisted until you connect using one of the providers IP addresses.  So without any specific information I have ventured a guess.  If you want to try and get something specific, you might want to share the exact error message you receive and how you get it.  I know about you and your problem exactly what your tell me, and so far I have iut you are getting blacklisted. </p><p>So what is the IP address that is generating the error (it is usually in the error message) and who is the mail provider (the company whose names comes after the @ in your email address usually. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Nothing needs to be introduced to implement it,  you just need to set it that way in settings. </p><p>See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_per-account-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_per-account-settings</a> </p><p>However if you use IMAP you become subject to whatever spam policy your IMAP provider has and yahoo at least offer no way to opt out of their spam ""service""  I am not sure many of them let you opt out these days.  That is not something Thunderbird has any control over, or can exercise any control over, it is something implemented server side and syncronised into the folders on Thunderbird. </p><p>In addition to that many antivirus products force junk /spam filtering into Thunderbird using their own hacking techniques of the running Thunderbird application.  So if you antivirus comes with any form of spam/scan or junk filtering it will be messing with Thunderbird to provide it.  Disable it out of hand. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
