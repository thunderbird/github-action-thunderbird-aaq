Nothing needs to be introduced to implement it,  you just need to set it that way in settings. </p><p>See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_per-account-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_per-account-settings</a> </p><p>However if you use IMAP you become subject to whatever spam policy your IMAP provider has and yahoo at least offer no way to opt out of their spam ""service""  I am not sure many of them let you opt out these days.  That is not something Thunderbird has any control over, or can exercise any control over, it is something implemented server side and syncronised into the folders on Thunderbird. </p><p>In addition to that many antivirus products force junk /spam filtering into Thunderbird using their own hacking techniques of the running Thunderbird application.  So if you antivirus comes with any form of spam/scan or junk filtering it will be messing with Thunderbird to provide it.  Disable it out of hand. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
