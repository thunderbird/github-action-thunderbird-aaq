Thunderbird now asks for my password twice in quick succession upon logging in. This has never happened before. There are now error messages or pop-ups. To see my inbox with new emails, i have to enter the second one. I can see the inbox after the first password entry, but not the new emails. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",pumpernickel

I do not have the time for this. I also don't want to invest time into a mail merge set up like Chimp or Octopus.  I just want to email 30+ people without the others seeing each other.  But when I have tested with thunderbird with one customer email and my own as BCC - when I get the email in my inbox it literaly says - FROM: MY BUSINESS. -   TO: MY CUSTOMER.. (yes my customers email address - not mine).. What is going on here?? I can not spend 45 minutes sending the same email... using copy and paste etc.. </p>,thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",hamster540

If Thunderbird can actually save all the passwords, there must be a way to do it. I tried various wording in asking the site for answers, but received zero hits on this particular subject. Thank you for any assistance in this matter. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,"",muchtested

But now I've lost all the appointments and recurring dates on my original calendar. I can't find any sort of backup. Nor any synchronisation. This is going to cause me a ton of trouble and extra work. Can this be rectified?  I have a basic knowledge of email so any technical stuff will need to be done by you. I really hope you can help. oh and please don't redirect me to some webpage which offers generic help. I need some hands on help please Kind regards Paul </p>",thunderbird;events;,thunderbird,events,en-US,"",ucanpaint1
