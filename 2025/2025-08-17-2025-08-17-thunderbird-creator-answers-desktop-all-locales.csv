I do not have the time for this. I also don't want to invest time into a mail merge set up like Chimp or Octopus.  I just want to email 30+ people without the others seeing each other.  But when I have tested with thunderbird with one customer email and my own as BCC - when I get the email in my inbox it literaly says - FROM: MY BUSINESS. -   TO: MY CUSTOMER.. (yes my customers email address - not mine).. What is going on here?? I can not spend 45 minutes sending the same email... using copy and paste etc.. </p>,thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1757556;,hamster540

I have the automatic updates setup on Thunderbird and until recently had no issues at all, until the last update. When Thunderbird first started with the newest update the calendar details were visible and then Thunderbird disabled the Calendar and Task and no matter how many time I click the Enable button or edit the properties to say enable Thunderbird immeadiately sets it back to Disabled. I have uninstalled Thunderbird, and relinstalled an older version - problem there doesn't seem to be a profile to match, so I just kept manually updating Thunderbird to a newer update until the absolute latest, but there were issues with the profiles again.  I then uninstalled and installed the latest version available directly from the website and was able to get another profile to work for my local folders - I had saved some docs locally to conserve disk space on the email server.   But no matter what I cannot get the calendar to work at all.  There are no posts that cover this particular situation. Any idea how to fix this????   Thank you to anyone that offers assistance with this issue. </p>",thunderbird;calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",saltandpepperrogers
