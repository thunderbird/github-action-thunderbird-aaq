I have the automatic updates setup on Thunderbird and until recently had no issues at all, until the last update. When Thunderbird first started with the newest update the calendar details were visible and then Thunderbird disabled the Calendar and Task and no matter how many time I click the Enable button or edit the properties to say enable Thunderbird immeadiately sets it back to Disabled. I have uninstalled Thunderbird, and relinstalled an older version - problem there doesn't seem to be a profile to match, so I just kept manually updating Thunderbird to a newer update until the absolute latest, but there were issues with the profiles again.  I then uninstalled and installed the latest version available directly from the website and was able to get another profile to work for my local folders - I had saved some docs locally to conserve disk space on the email server.   But no matter what I cannot get the calendar to work at all.  There are no posts that cover this particular situation. Any idea how to fix this????
