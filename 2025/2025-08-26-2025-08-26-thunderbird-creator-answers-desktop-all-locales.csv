Was advised to use ""regular"" TB.  PAB did not have the entries I needed, so was advised to copy entries from Google Contracts address book.  Didn't know I had to hold down CTRL key and I ended up MOVING them, which emptied all my Google Contact from the Google Contacts address book.  Tried to sync to get them back.  Didn't.  That address book is linked to <a href=""https://www.googleapis.com/carddav/v1/principals/dalemwebb****@gmail.com/lists/default/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.googleapis.com/carddav/v1/principals/dalemwebb****@gmail.com/lists/default/</a>.

This should be a simple task of changing the servers in Thunderbird, right? </p><p>So I did that, but the SMTP server and email address keeps switching to the other account. </p><p>I set up <a href=""http://foo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">foo.com</a> with my email address and password, then I go to <a href=""http://foo.net"" rel=""nofollow"">foo.net</a> and it has the .com info already there. If I change that to the .net info and go check the .com account, it has been changed to the .net info. </p><p>I tried reverting the .net account back to the old server, but it copied that info right back to the .com account! </p><p>There is a dropdown box on the main Account Settings page where you can choose any account for your SMTP, but it only displays one of these, whichever one is currently filled out. </p><p>How do I un-link these accounts? They were not previously linked in any way - they each sent emails from their own .com and .net accounts. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",saladgoat

It's like I'm using an old version of Microsoft office on a Windows 3.1 machine.  I see in the settings I can change the font sizes for composing emails but how about the system interface?  Others say ""just download a theme"" but could someone recommend one?  This current font makes me want to delete this software and look for alternatives.  I only checked out this software because Microsoft sucks.  And I'm about ready to leave this one also. </p><p>Thunderbird version 142.0 (64-bit) Windows 11 build 26100.4652 Intel Core i5-9400F 32GB ram </p>",thunderbird;themes;,thunderbird,themes,en-US,"",eph320
