Was advised to use ""regular"" TB.  PAB did not have the entries I needed, so was advised to copy entries from Google Contracts address book.  Didn't know I had to hold down CTRL key and I ended up MOVING them, which emptied all my Google Contact from the Google Contacts address book.  Tried to sync to get them back.  Didn't.  That address book is linked to <a href=""https://www.googleapis.com/carddav/v1/principals/dalemwebb****@gmail.com/lists/default/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.googleapis.com/carddav/v1/principals/dalemwebb****@gmail.com/lists/default/</a>.

This should be a simple task of changing the servers in Thunderbird, right? </p><p>So I did that, but the SMTP server and email address keeps switching to the other account. </p><p>I set up <a href=""http://foo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">foo.com</a> with my email address and password, then I go to <a href=""http://foo.net"" rel=""nofollow"">foo.net</a> and it has the .com info already there. If I change that to the .net info and go check the .com account, it has been changed to the .net info. </p><p>I tried reverting the .net account back to the old server, but it copied that info right back to the .com account! </p><p>There is a dropdown box on the main Account Settings page where you can choose any account for your SMTP, but it only displays one of these, whichever one is currently filled out. </p><p>How do I un-link these accounts? They were not previously linked in any way - they each sent emails from their own .com and .net accounts. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",saladgoat

It's like I'm using an old version of Microsoft office on a Windows 3.1 machine.  I see in the settings I can change the font sizes for composing emails but how about the system interface?  Others say ""just download a theme"" but could someone recommend one?  This current font makes me want to delete this software and look for alternatives.  I only checked out this software because Microsoft sucks.

This started about a month ago and may be due to changes in the 140esr release (I was on 128esr previously). </p><p>Suppose I set an appointment for tomorrow at 9pm and ask the calendar to notify me a day in advance. If Thunderbird is executing at 9pm on day before, this works fine. If Thunderbird is not active, the notification is never made when I open Thunderbird after 9 pm on the day before the appointment. </p><p>This problem also occurs if I Snooze the notification and do not have Thunderbird running when the snooze period is completed. If does work if Thunderbird is open at the time of Snooze completion. </p><p>I have tested this on two different computers, a desktop and notebook, both running Windows 10.
