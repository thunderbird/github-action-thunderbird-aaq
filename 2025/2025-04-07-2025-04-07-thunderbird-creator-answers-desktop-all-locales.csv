I want to use the theme image with a light TB theme but it appears the tab background text color determines the theme color (light or dark).  This image has some darker colors and a light/white tab text looks the best, but this color seems to force a dark theme for the rest of TB (White text -&gt;dark theme).  If I change the manifest file to use a different tab background text color I can change the overall theme to light or dark.  Using a darker or black tab background text color the theme changes to a light theme.  Light tab background text color changes to a dark theme and darker tab background text colors forces a light them. I'm guessing there is a threshold 1/2 way between black and white text that will force the theme one way or another. </p><p>The articles I have read on this json file don't provide any examples and this is as far as I have been able to get. I'm new to both TB and modifying this json file.  Any help would be appreciated </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1723853;1723857;,carlkmail
