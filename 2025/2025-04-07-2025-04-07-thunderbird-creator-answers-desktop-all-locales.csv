I want to use the theme image with a light TB theme but it appears the tab background text color determines the theme color (light or dark).  This image has some darker colors and a light/white tab text looks the best, but this color seems to force a dark theme for the rest of TB (White text -&gt;dark theme).  If I change the manifest file to use a different tab background text color I can change the overall theme to light or dark.  Using a darker or black tab background text color the theme changes to a light theme.  Light tab background text color changes to a dark theme and darker tab background text colors forces a light them. I'm guessing there is a threshold 1/2 way between black and white text that will force the theme one way or another. </p><p>The articles I have read on this json file don't provide any examples and this is as far as I have been able to get. I'm new to both TB and modifying this json file.  Any help would be appreciated </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1723853;1723857;1723946;1724031;,carlkmail

Ve výsledku to vypadá tak, že když spustím Thunderbird, nejprve vidím, že mám nějaké nepřečtené zprávy, a pokud jich je víc, než fyzicky vidím na obrazovce, už vím dopředu, že jsou označeny jako spam a ""skrývají"" se kdesi u datumu 20. srpna 2024.

My goal is to create an offline copy of a 13 GB gmail account in local folders and then delete all the custom IMAP folders to regain some free space in gmail storage. </p><p>I am achieving this by: 1) Setting up an IMAP account in Thunderbird for the gmail account. 2) Enabling local storage of all folders (in Settings and set config flag, etc). Changed gmail settings to unlimit the number of IMAP downloads. Set Thunderbird account concurrent connections to 15 (gmail max). a) Edit/Preferences/Advanced/General/Config Editor: mail.server.default.check_all_folders_for_new = true 3) Click on each IMAP folder in Thunderbird to initiate download of that folder. I don't see this documented anywhere but it doesn't seem to download the messages in each folder until I do this. 4) Turn Thunderbird offline and ask it to download all emails before going offline. 5) Copy all folders from the gmail account in thunderbird to local storage. 6) Turn Thunderbird back online. 6) Delete custom IMAP folders in Thunderbird gmail account to clean up gmail online storage. </p><p>In my mind, step 2 should be enough to force a download of all emails in all IMAP folders. I added steps 3 and 4 because it's unclear when this process is complete.

I'm experiencing the typical gmail login issues and throttling due to too many concurrent connections and given this it could take days if Thunderbird can even keep track of which messages downloaded and which got errors back from gmail. </p><p>How do I know when Thunderbird has finished downloading messages prior to going offline? Does it notify me with a dialog or do I just have to keep hovering over the Offline toggle periodically until it actually says offline? </p><p>Any constructive tips on how to confirm everything is downloaded or process improvements, etc. </p><p>Thanks, pi </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1724095;,pindividual
