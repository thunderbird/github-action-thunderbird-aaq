Now I get a circle with a line in it, and my folders are all messed up. For example, Woodworking used to be a folder by itself. Now it is a sub-folder of Retire. Many other similar folders are messed up.  Is there any way to recover?  How can I move Woodworking to be a folder by itself, not under Retire. I have rebooted. No help. </p><p>Windows 7, Thunderbird is up to date. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jambe

The following were the steps I took after Thunderbird was reinstalled: 1. I then copied my profile data from a data backup to my laptop into  C:&gt;Users&gt;username&gt;AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Thunderbird&gt;Profiles using internet explorer. 2. I then changed my Thunderbird Account settings to use my original profile in Server settings under Local Directory.  3. At the same time I also changed my mail server from <a href=""http://imap.bigpond.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.bigpond.com</a> to <a href=""http://imap.telstra.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.telstra.com</a> however it still recorded the server type as POP Mail Server. </p><p>When Thunderbird application restarted after the above changes, I noticed in the Mail Folder display that my Inbox folders had duplicated along with Deleted, Trash, Draft, Archive &amp; Sent folders e.g. it showed Inbox and relevant sub folders and INBOX-1 with the same relevant sub-folders. Some of the sub folders in Inbox were missing stored emails and these were found under the INBOX-1 subfolder.  Also under the Local Folders section it also displayed current emails under the Inbox folder which are recorded in the Mail Inbox folder. So not knowing why this occurred or to resolve, I decided to uninstall Thunderbird and then download it again. By doing this, it has fixed the display issues mentioned above in the Thunderbird application but I still have duplicated Inbox, Sent, Deleted &amp; Archives on my laptop under my Thunderbird profile folders. So my query is....do I attempt to move the data from the duplicated folders to the main folders or just leave it as is seeing it appears to be working? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Rosalie.Connarty
