Now I get a circle with a line in it, and my folders are all messed up. For example, Woodworking used to be a folder by itself. Now it is a sub-folder of Retire. Many other similar folders are messed up.  Is there any way to recover?  How can I move Woodworking to be a folder by itself, not under Retire. I have rebooted. No help. </p><p>Windows 7, Thunderbird is up to date. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jambe
