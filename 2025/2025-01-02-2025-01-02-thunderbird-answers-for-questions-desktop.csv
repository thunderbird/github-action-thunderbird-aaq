Once all your accounts/email addresses are using same password..... </p><p>2. In microsoft account accessed via a browser If you have more email addresses or hotmail addresses etc , microsoft now regard one is 'primary' and all others are alias to the account. This is not a problem when it comes to receiving mail, but can be an issue when you want to send. When it comes to 'sending' - that is smtp setting in Thunderbird - it can only send using the 'primary' email address.  In webmail account, you can choose what you want to be set as 'primary', but whatever email address you set up as 'primary' - only that email address can be used for SMTP for all accounts using outlook server. So if you want to send using hotmail email address then make sure it is set up as the primary email address. But then if you have an <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account as well, it will only be able to send using the hotmail primary email address. So choose the email address which you want to set up as 'primary'. </p><p>Then in Thunderbird Account Settings , all your accounts that use outlook server must have the SMTP set to use whatever you set up as primary email address. </p><p>If you have done the above and still have issue then have you contacted the authors of the Owl add-on for Microsoft Exchange? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I have the same OpenPGP encryption keys imported there for the same email accounts as in Thunderbird.  While I had the advanced settings under End-to-End-Encryption in Thunderbird set to NOT send public key and signature verification with every email, I *DID* have them set to send with every email in the Proton online settings. Turned this off in Proton -- problem gone. </p><p>So --initial problem solved. </p><p>For anyone else trying to figure out how to deal with Thunderbird and Proton when it comes to OpenPGP settings: </p><p>1) For encrypted emails between two Proton accounts in the same Thunderbird client on the same laptop:  DOES NOT WORK.  Let Proton use its own security and do not also engage OpenPGP encryption.  (This would not happen in the wild, but does happen when I'm trying to do testing!) </p><p>2) For encrypted emails between a non-Proton account and a Proton account in the same Thunderbird client on the same computer:  ALSO DOES NOT WORK.  Of course this does not exist in real life -- it just has also made my testing a living hell. </p><p>3) For encrypted emails between a Gmail account (online in Web interface) and a Proton account (in Thunderbird):  WORKS PERFECTLY!  So -- for this scenario -- Proton and Proton Bridge do not mess-up OpenPGP functioning.  Please note that once the public keys for the Gmail account have been imported and accepted into Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key Manager, there is no indication when opening the message from the Gmail account in the Proton account (in Thunderbird) that the email arrived encrypted.   </p><p>I will need to test two additional situations out later: </p><p>4) Two Proton accounts in two different Thunderbird clients on two different laptops.  (This is stupid as there is no need to do this given Proton built-in security, but why not see?) </p><p>5) A non-proton account and a Proton account -- each in two different Thunderbird clients on two different laptops.  (This one does matter and could happen in real life.) </p><p>Please note that creating the OpenPGP keys in Thunderbird Open PGP Manager and then trying to import them into Proton (web interface) does NOT work.  Instead, the OpenPGP keys have to be created in Proton's web interface, and then imported into Thunderbird. </p><p>More later. </p><p>Thanks, Michael </p>",michael737,false,0,0

The messages when arriving in the Proton account in Thunderbird indicate that the message is signed but NOT encrypted (it WAS sent encrypted).

Ik weet niet zeker of ik geïmporteerd heb als bestand of als 'Andere Thunderbird installatie'/'ZIP-bestand', maar ik denk dat dat niet veel uitmaakt.

De grootte van de profielmap is 1,5 GB, dat zou het probleem dus ook niet moeten zijn. </p><p>Uiteindelijk heb ik nu maar de hele profielmap as-is overgezet en de naam gewijzigd naar de naam van de profielmap op de nieuwe laptop.

If it is to have all messages appear as one, that is available if using Unified Folders setting.  Third, you have not explained what you are doing in moving messages to local folders.

No, there is no need for Mozilla to make IMAP work like POP. If people want POP, they should use accounts that allow POP and not put the onus on the email client. Possibly, if you share screenshot of one of your message filters, we can help. What you're wanting to do seems straightforward. To clarify, a unified folder is only a view, not the actual move of messages to a single folder. I think, with example of your filter, we can help you resolve your concern. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
