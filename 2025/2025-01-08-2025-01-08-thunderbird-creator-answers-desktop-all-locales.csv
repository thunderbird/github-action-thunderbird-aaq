When I click on a hyperlink in a message, the link is hi-lighted but the browser does not load.  If I right click on the hyperlink, a window pops up and I can choose among options to open link in browser or copy link and a couple of others.  Open link in browser gives the same results as clicking on the hyperlink.  If I click on copy link, I can then bring the browser up myself and paste and go and everything works as it should.  I should note that I can click on links to other programs and they open as expected.  I copied a hyperlink to a browser to a word document and when I clicked on it, the browser did open. I have changed default browsers and restarted the computer and Thunderbird to no effect.  I looked at your general trouble-shooting guide and went through the first three steps and everything seems to be ok.   I had this problem a year or so ago and it just went away after some time had passed.  This time it’s been a couple of weeks. Any ideas?

I, of course, just want the universal inbox to include the inbox folders of my various accounts. I understand that I can right click the universal inbox and click 'Choose' to manually unselect the folders but I have hundreds of subfolders over many email accounts and it's an extremely tedious process. I am also setting up several computers. </p><p>So, a few solutions I have thought of: 1- Is there a way to change the universal inbox to include only the top level inbox? 2- Is there a way to change the default universal inbox to include nothing and I manually select the inbox folder(s)? 3- Could a 'select none' button be added on the 'Choose folder' dialog? </p><p>On a related note, another annoying thing is now anytime I create a new subfolder it automatically is added to the universal inbox so I have to go to the properties, find it, and deselect it. Since I use several computers every time I create a new subfolder I have to repeat this process on each computer.  </p><p>Thunderbird is still awesome - updates just changed this behavior and I find it very annoying.

I have put in the correct ports for both servers according to the information provided by Astound for users in Texas (I live in Austin).  I suspect that my provider is the source of this situation but I am bound and determined to find a solution as I have used Firefox and Thunderbird for a good while. </p><p>It seems like I have had similar problems connecting to GrandeCommunications in the past. I can confirm security exemptions and check the box for Thunderbird to remember this confirmation.

I spent more than two hours on the phone with the ISPs help line trying to resolve this issue. They also use Thunderbird at their help desk, and the agent I talked to was familiar with your program. She (the agent) was not able to replicate the issue on their system.  We then tried to set up a NEW email account. I carefully entered all the info needed for a new account, following instructions from the agent, then hit the 'Test' button. I got the following message onscreen: ""THUNDERBIRD FAILED TO FIND SETTINGS FOR YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT"" The answer to the original issue suddenly became very clear - Thunderbird cannot, or refuses to, connect with the email server, therefore NO EMAIL. We tried everything in her toolkit to resolve the problem to no avail. We finally tried UNINSTALLING Thunderbird (and the Maintaince program). Once Uninstalled, I used the Registry Tool on CCleaner to remove any entries in the registry referring to Thunderbird (there were several), then restarted my computer. I then downloaded and installed a totally NEW Thunderbird program. When I ran the Thunderbird again, I found all my account(s) info was still present, and Thunderbird was still unable to find the server. I'm at my wits end trying to resolve this issue, and REALLY HATE to go back to Microsoft OUTLOOK to get my email. Anybody got any ideas??? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
