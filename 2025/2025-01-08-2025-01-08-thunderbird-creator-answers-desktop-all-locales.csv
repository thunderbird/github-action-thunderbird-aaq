When I click on a hyperlink in a message, the link is hi-lighted but the browser does not load.  If I right click on the hyperlink, a window pops up and I can choose among options to open link in browser or copy link and a couple of others.  Open link in browser gives the same results as clicking on the hyperlink.  If I click on copy link, I can then bring the browser up myself and paste and go and everything works as it should.  I should note that I can click on links to other programs and they open as expected.  I copied a hyperlink to a browser to a word document and when I clicked on it, the browser did open. I have changed default browsers and restarted the computer and Thunderbird to no effect.  I looked at your general trouble-shooting guide and went through the first three steps and everything seems to be ok.   I had this problem a year or so ago and it just went away after some time had passed.  This time it’s been a couple of weeks. Any ideas?

Problem is that although the Reply in Conversation is high-lighted with a yellow star on the Inward Mail Icon when an Email arrives I can't tell which email the Reply is for.. </p><pre>I get Lots of Email Replies so which Email line is it?.. </pre> <p>There is a Small icon in the left margin for a Reply or two but no more that that.. Some of my Emails have up to half a dozen Replies in Conversation..very frustrating.. Which means I have to hunt thru my Emails to find what Reply Received is for which Email.. I would like Mozilla Thunderbird to add (somehow) a high-light for the Reply in Conversation &amp; which Email it belongs to... That would save me a lot of searching... Any idea's.. Thank-You .. </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",bcpatterson01
