When I click on a hyperlink in a message, the link is hi-lighted but the browser does not load.  If I right click on the hyperlink, a window pops up and I can choose among options to open link in browser or copy link and a couple of others.  Open link in browser gives the same results as clicking on the hyperlink.  If I click on copy link, I can then bring the browser up myself and paste and go and everything works as it should.  I should note that I can click on links to other programs and they open as expected.  I copied a hyperlink to a browser to a word document and when I clicked on it, the browser did open. I have changed default browsers and restarted the computer and Thunderbird to no effect.  I looked at your general trouble-shooting guide and went through the first three steps and everything seems to be ok.   I had this problem a year or so ago and it just went away after some time had passed.  This time it’s been a couple of weeks. Any ideas?
