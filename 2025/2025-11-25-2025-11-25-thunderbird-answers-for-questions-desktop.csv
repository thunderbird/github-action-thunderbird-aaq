Please check through each one to ensure all is ok. Make sure you have completely removed all stored gmail passwords.  </p><p>Gmail uses Oauth2, so you need to make sure a few things are set up correctly first. </p><p><strong>Firewall:</strong> Access Firewall - it might be the defaulton computer or controlled by an Anti-Virus prgram. Set up Thunderbird program as 'allowed' so nothing gets blocked. Confirm Thunderbird is set up as allowed program. </p><p><strong>VPN:</strong> Check computer for a VPN. Some Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and I have come across some peopl who did not realise one had been enabled. Switch off VPN (or create  split tunnelling and set it up for Thunderbird to use).  Gmail does not like VPN as it atempts to hide your IP address, so gmail decides you might be hacker so it auto blocks access. Confirm VPN is switched off </p><p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Do you have anything using the localhost? People who manage websites may typically use eg: Apache Xampp. You need to switch of any program using the localhost whilst setting up gmail. You can enable it again afterwards. I had to switch off Apache Xampp. Confirm nothing is using localhost.  </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Web Content </li><li> Select 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li> Click on 'Exceptions' button </li><li> Enter this&nbsp;: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> </li><li> Click on 'Allow </li><li> Click on 'Save Changes' </li></ul> <ul><li> Whilst in that area - scroll to Passwords section </li><li> click on 'Saved Passwords' </li><li> If you see any mention of the account you are trying to set up - select the relevant lines and click on 'Remove' - that inludes any mention of imap://imap.gmail.....smtp://smtp.gmail...oauth://accounts.google.... </li><li> Click on Close </li></ul> <p>I would switch off the following as it's still experimental. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Account Hub </li><li> uncheck this checkbox: 'Create accounts in the new Account Hub' </li></ul> <p>Then create the mail account </p> <ul><li> Menu app &gt; New Account &gt; Email </li><li> Enter name </li><li> Enter gmail email address </li><li> Enter password </li><li> Select checkbox to remember password. </li><li> Click on 'Continue' </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird by default will look for the IMAP server settings.
