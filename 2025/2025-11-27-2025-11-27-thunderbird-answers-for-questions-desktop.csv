Senders whose email address is in a whitelisted address book are exempt and will not be automatically marked as junk by Thunderbird. But you can still manually marking a message containing a whitelisted address as junk.  It is recommended that you enable whitelisting to help ensure that messages from people you most care about will not be marked as junk. </blockquote> <blockquote>Tell Thunderbird what is NOT Junk  Sometimes Thunderbird's junk filter might get it wrong and mark good messages as junk. Therefore, it is just as important to tell the filter which messages are not junk, especially on a new installation of Thunderbird.  Note: You should frequently (daily or weekly) check your Junk folder for good messages wrongly marked as Junk by Thunderbird and mark them as Not Junk. This will recover the good messages and improve the correctness of the filter for the future. </blockquote>",Yu5tiqX9og,false,0,0

Appears problem started with the Thunderbird update I installed 11/20/25, or possibly the latest Win 11 security update 11/12/2025 (or, unlikely, Win 11 feature update 11/19/2025).  I am only running Windows Defender (no other firewalls or antivirus/malware programs). The last Windows defender security alert was 9/15/2021. There have been no Windows crash reports since 3/13/2025. Safe mode doesn't help, nor does working off-line.  I keep my spam and trash folders clean more than daily. No themes, calendars or add-ons are used. Thunderbird behaves totally normally for all receiving and sending, storing, retrieving and file folder functions  - the problem is <strong>only</strong> when typing or editing a new message and can occur after two or as many as 10 lines of text (no special fonts or characters used). When it crashes, there is no unusual or interesting activity seen in task manager (so I could have grabbed a screen shot). </p><p>Attached is  the Thunderbird-generated troubleshooting information (excluding the final ""graphics information - file too big to attach).
