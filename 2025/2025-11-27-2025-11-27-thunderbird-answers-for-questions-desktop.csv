Searching for format date came up with calendar.date.format and changing this from 0 to 1 fixed the date problem. </p><p>Maybe you should suggest this option for fixing the date. It may require that the general configuration of Ubuntu is set to local (in my case English(UK) for the system date. I had to add in English (UK) as the language and for the dictionary to make the date at the top of the screen display in the correct format for most of the world when I first set it up. </p>,martin.connelly.home,false,0,0

Senders whose email address is in a whitelisted address book are exempt and will not be automatically marked as junk by Thunderbird. But you can still manually marking a message containing a whitelisted address as junk.  It is recommended that you enable whitelisting to help ensure that messages from people you most care about will not be marked as junk. </blockquote> <blockquote>Tell Thunderbird what is NOT Junk  Sometimes Thunderbird's junk filter might get it wrong and mark good messages as junk. Therefore, it is just as important to tell the filter which messages are not junk, especially on a new installation of Thunderbird.  Note: You should frequently (daily or weekly) check your Junk folder for good messages wrongly marked as Junk by Thunderbird and mark them as Not Junk. This will recover the good messages and improve the correctness of the filter for the future. </blockquote>",Yu5tiqX9og,false,0,0
