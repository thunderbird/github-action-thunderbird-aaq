However, one of the two accounts will not send email from Thunderbird, but will on my iPhone and iPad. The other AOL account is working fine. I also verified that the SMTP port is 465. So I have done everything on my end, I think there's a Thunderbird glitch. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1738588;,cg.risd5

With help from the admins at the domain registry, I altered the account settings in Thunderbird.  I got errors which said: ""Sending of usernamedid not succeed.  Mail server <em>pop.servername</em> responded:  invalid format for plain response"" The server settings were: Connection security: STARTTLS Authentication method: Normal Password We changed Connection security to SSL/TLS We still got the same response. </p><p>I set up Thunderbird on a laptop in the same house, &amp; the account was working fine, both sending and receiving.  The only problem was that the e-mails in the inbox were from that point in time and all my old e-mails were not shown. </p><p>I have tried backing up the profile on my original computer, uninstaling and re-installing Thunderbird, and I nstill get the same problem.  So I am thinking backup the e-mails from the profile, remove everything Thunderbird, (Program + profile), from the original computer, then re-install Thunderbird and setup the account (as I did on the laptop), and then restore the old e-mails if the account is successfully working.  The problem that I have with this approach is I do not know how to backup &amp; restore just the e-mails from a profile without all the other settings and configurations associated with that profile.   </p><p>Any advice with regards to this situation would be gratefully received. </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Neil Harland </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",cct667
