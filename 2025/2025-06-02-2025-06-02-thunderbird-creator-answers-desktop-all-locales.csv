However, one of the two accounts will not send email from Thunderbird, but will on my iPhone and iPad. The other AOL account is working fine. I also verified that the SMTP port is 465. So I have done everything on my end, I think there's a Thunderbird glitch. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1738588;,cg.risd5
