Your reference suggested that I edit the Config file to change values associated with authmethod fo 10.  Indeed, I found that some of these values, apparently the ones that weren't working, had a value of 3.  When I changed these to 10, then the value of the Authentication method box changed to OAuth2.  But OAuth2 still did not appear in the drop-down list, and Thunderbird still was unable to login to send messages.

The filter could COPY those that are typically to you ( such as those from your personal or business contacts) her filter could the same. Then, browse through other mail in the inbox and copy those to the HIS folder. You would each be able to 'see' the others folder, but you're in a trusting relationship so that wouldn't be an issue.
