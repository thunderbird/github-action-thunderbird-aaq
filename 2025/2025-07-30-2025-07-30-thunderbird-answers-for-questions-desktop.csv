Your reference suggested that I edit the Config file to change values associated with authmethod fo 10.  Indeed, I found that some of these values, apparently the ones that weren't working, had a value of 3.  When I changed these to 10, then the value of the Authentication method box changed to OAuth2.  But OAuth2 still did not appear in the drop-down list, and Thunderbird still was unable to login to send messages.  So I think no needed values were reset.   </p><p>Everything was working fine under Thunderbird 128.1; the problems came up when v. 141 was installed.

The filter could COPY those that are typically to you ( such as those from your personal or business contacts) her filter could the same. Then, browse through other mail in the inbox and copy those to the HIS folder. You would each be able to 'see' the others folder, but you're in a trusting relationship so that wouldn't be an issue.

From my perspective the actions I see don't match the remedy your describing - I'm certain because I'm a novice at Thunderbird file structure, or database file structure in general - and instead show obfuscated data. For example: </p><p>In step 3 the available ""profiles"" I can only presume are because I had 3 email accounts Thunderbird was handling.  I also had a number of local folders that were an amalgam of (I.E. insurance that would handle insurance docs from 2 different email accounts... homeowners and vehicle) the 3 email accounts. </p><p>As you can see, none say the actual word profile.

So in effect it shows up there but I think TB thinks it's the default profile with no data. Hitting launch just pulls up a new window wanting me to create a new profile with no data in it.  However when I go look for the address book following instructions it does show at least some of the saved contacts there.

I tried clicking past the screen wanting a new email and password entry and there are no local folders available nor any accounts and trying an address out of the address book does nothing.
