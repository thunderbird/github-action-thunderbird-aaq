Anyway, with IMAP, I suggest you each set up filters to COPY desired messages to a separate folder. You would each have to folders other than the inbox, HIS and HERS. The filter could COPY those that are typically to you ( such as those from your personal or business contacts) her filter could the same. Then, browse through other mail in the inbox and copy those to the HIS folder. You would each be able to 'see' the others folder, but you're in a trusting relationship so that wouldn't be an issue.  A BENEFIT of an IMAP account is that you could then read messages on your phone. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
