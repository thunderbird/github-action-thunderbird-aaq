Before that, I backed up the profile file to a backup drive. There were a lot of subfolders on the inbox prior to the transition. Afterwards, I tried both copying and importing the profile folder from the backup drive. In both cases, the subfolders didn't reappear but the messages in the inbox did. Is there any way to recover them? I'm running Thunderbird 137.0.1 on windows 11. The mail is on a POP server. Thanks for any advice. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",dlockesf1

Now all the messages in my All Mail folder are showing up in my inbox folder, all 6033 of them. When I delete a message in my inbox folder it's deleted in my All Mail folder. I've used Tunderbird to organize my mail for many years. This has never happened, so I assume it has something to do with having to use the gmail recovery tool. There should only be 50 or 60 messages in my inbox folder. But if I try to delete the duplicated messages in my inbox, they all disappear in my All Mail folder. I've tried to repair the inbox folder, but it just reconstitutes the 6033 messages. Can this issue be corrected? </p><p>Thanks for anyone's help. </p><p>Jason </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1725560;,tigerstime

The problem is that it copies in some moves/copies the messages in an order that I am unable to comprehend, hence the folder move keeps getting interrupted with the same error. Is there an option in the settings/configurations that can be used to force TB to continue copying/moving even if it encounters an error? I got around this using the ImportExportNG extension, that did not stop the transfer if it encountered an error, but I had to export the folders through the extension before importing them. I'm now working on a nested directory, and I am hesitant to use the export/import option to avoid confusion. </p><p>Errors like this appear often: ""The current command did not succeed.
