I've used Tunderbird to organize my mail for many years. This has never happened, so I assume it has something to do with having to use the gmail recovery tool. There should only be 50 or 60 messages in my inbox folder. But if I try to delete the duplicated messages in my inbox, they all disappear in my All Mail folder.

The problem is that it copies in some moves/copies the messages in an order that I am unable to comprehend, hence the folder move keeps getting interrupted with the same error. Is there an option in the settings/configurations that can be used to force TB to continue copying/moving even if it encounters an error? I got around this using the ImportExportNG extension, that did not stop the transfer if it encountered an error, but I had to export the folders through the extension before importing them. I'm now working on a nested directory, and I am hesitant to use the export/import option to avoid confusion. </p><p>Errors like this appear often: ""The current command did not succeed.
