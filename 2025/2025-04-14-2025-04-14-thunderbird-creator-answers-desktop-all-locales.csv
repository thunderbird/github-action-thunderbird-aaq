A long time ago I set up Thunderbird to connect to my gmail accounts. I was a broker before I retired recently and wanted a more professional looking email address so I configured something (do NOT remember how I did it) so that when I emailed someone or someone responded to my 'callmoss@gmail.com' address using the pseudonym 'Ben@callmoss.com' it would be recognized by both gmail and by Thunderbird and arrive as if it had been sent to the actual 'callmoss@gmail.com' address. A lot of changes have been being made at Thunderbird but suddenly around 2/26/2025, all my email sent to Ben@callmoss.com stopped arriving and were bounced back. If it's a gmail problem, I'm screwed because I will never be able to contact a Google (Alphabet) human being as that is flat out impossible by phone, mail, email or any other communication known to man or gawd. However, if it's a Thunderbird adjustment that can be made, you guys are always great about helping users out. If you have an idea what I am talking about and can suggest a solution, I would really appreciate it. That email was my main one and a lot of people must be wondering why I suddenly disappeared off the face of the earth. Thanks so much!

TB created installs.ini and profiles.ini files, both with the following as the last line: </p><p>Locked=1 </p><p>This line had not been in either .ini file on the old installation. </p><p>I edited these files to point to the backed-up TB profile from the old machine, but I decided to leave the Locked=1 line in the .ini files. </p><p>Was this a mistake? I have a strange problem with the new installation, which I won't report until I understand what the ""Locked=1"" means, and whether I was ill-advised to leave it/them in. Fortunately there has been no evident loss of mail data. </p><p>Thanks in advance, Phil </p>",phil194;wsmwk;,true,false,false,";solver_id:5337243;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data""]",3,0,0,,,
