Before that, I backed up the profile file to a backup drive. There were a lot of subfolders on the inbox prior to the transition. Afterwards, I tried both copying and importing the profile folder from the backup drive. In both cases, the subfolders didn't reappear but the messages in the inbox did. Is there any way to recover them? I'm running Thunderbird 137.0.1 on windows 11. The mail is on a POP server. Thanks for any advice. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",dlockesf1

Now all the messages in my All Mail folder are showing up in my inbox folder, all 6033 of them. When I delete a message in my inbox folder it's deleted in my All Mail folder. I've used Tunderbird to organize my mail for many years. This has never happened, so I assume it has something to do with having to use the gmail recovery tool. There should only be 50 or 60 messages in my inbox folder. But if I try to delete the duplicated messages in my inbox, they all disappear in my All Mail folder. I've tried to repair the inbox folder, but it just reconstitutes the 6033 messages. Can this issue be corrected? </p><p>Thanks for anyone's help. </p><p>Jason </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tigerstime
