In my All Mail folder there many emails promoting misc items, in fact over 1000 that I do not want.  I have set server settings to delete immediately but no matter how I try the deleted emails reappear.  They are not in the Bin or Trash.  I get the same results using either the laptop or the desktop. Any ideas? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",b.chapman093

I chose ""download complete message "" thinking that would work. But no. The files don't appear in the downloads folder so I'm going to download each one separately. But I'd still like to find where the ""complete message"" was saved so I can delete it. Regards, Ian </p>",thunderbird;attachments;,thunderbird,attachments,en-US,"",IanStar
