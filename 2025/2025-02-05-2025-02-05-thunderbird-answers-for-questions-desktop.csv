I chatted with a midco tech, who said ""yes, midco acquired the wowway accounts, but not yours.""  Obviously untrue, but I think it means that the account has disappeared from midco's records.   In server settings, I adjusted the Port number to agree with the functioning midco account -- no success.  and  I tried changing the connection security to ""password, transmitted insecurely"". </p><p>When I click between accounts, in the lower left corner both accounts say ""loading messages"" on both accounts.

If you may fix the problem changing that, fine, but there could be something else going on here, namely that Gmail can be configured to <i>apparently</i> let you use its outgoing server to send from other addresses, but it doesn't really do that, what it does is <i>silently</i> change the ""From"" address of the messages you send through it to the Gmail address associated with the SMTP server… </p><p>This is why, contrary to what is recommended, I configure my Gmail accounts to save a copy of sent messages, only I save them to a <i>Sent</i> folder in Local Folders instead of to the <i>Sent</i> folder used by Gmail on the server.

I was told that ""importexporttools"" was not suitable for my version of TBird. </p><p>This time, when I selected Export, it gave me a list of the accounts and a Save button. I right clicked on the account but there was no option for importexport. I selected the account and then Save. The window showed the export to a zip file 0-100%.  When it got to 100%, TBird hung and after a few waits, I restarted Tbird.  The zip file is 25.9GB which looks like the whole TBird database! </p><p>I am wondering about rebooting the whole PC? I'll do that and come back here to report any change. </p>",FoxJT,false,0,0

Mozilla recommends not exporting more than 2 gb, and that export is always problem-prone. To save what you want, exit thunderbird and access the profile from Linux file manager. I am no Linux guru but I think profile is .thunderbird and what you want is in the Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; folder - inbox, sent, etc. Copy them and paste into the Mail\Local Folders folder while thunderbird is not running and then restart thunderbird and I think they will appear - ignore the msf files, as thunderbird will recreate them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I used the Terminal for UNIX commands as the UBUNTU file manager couldn't see beyond the ""hidden"" directory .thunderbird. </p><p>A thought does occur in that all the emails in my account are already held on my hard drive, so, when the email account disappears they won't disappear from there, will they?

What is iikely, though, is that thunderbird may keep attempted to download mail from the account and that may generate error messages each time that there is a problem with the account. If true, that will become annoying quickly. Otherwise, there would be need incentive to move them. I defer on the file manager commands. I have a Mint setup and the .thunderbird folder is fully accessible, but I avoid any specifics, as there is so much I don't know there.&nbsp;:)  I'm glad it all worked for you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Then save that file separately for viewing. However, it's only a copy of current content.  It does mean you can select another font or use 'Find' to locate anything like folder name or filter name, but it's not exactly something that gets auto updated. It's a view of file in current state when opened, but does faciliate a means of searching.  </p><p>I would not advise editing directly as anything appended will be using whatever Thunderbird is designed to use. </p><p>But if you exit Thunderbird first and then right click on filterlog.html and choose 'Edit with Notpad++' it is possible to Add Text which can be read via the 'Filter Log' button. But it's not exactly going to achieve much.  Possible to use as a quick marker if you use capitals.  It's a lot of effort for no real gain. </p><p>One benefit of editing is to remove older logs, but keep recent - not an option offered directly in Thunderbird.   </p> In Thunderbird via the 'Filer Log' button you can choose to clear the content and start afresh BUT that's it - view something that gets bigger and when you clear it also gets rid of recent logs. But you could use the Edit method to remove just the really old logs and therefore do a partial clearance. Please note you must only edit/remove each paragraph which starts and ends with the open <p> and close </p> and those are inclusive which means you need to know what you are doing as it is written using html.  <p>I've just used this to remove everything prior to 1st Jan 2025. So I still have all my recent logs, but the list is less lengthy and easier to view via normal method. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
