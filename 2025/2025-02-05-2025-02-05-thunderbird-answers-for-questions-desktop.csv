I chatted with a midco tech, who said ""yes, midco acquired the wowway accounts, but not yours.""  Obviously untrue, but I think it means that the account has disappeared from midco's records.   In server settings, I adjusted the Port number to agree with the functioning midco account -- no success.  and  I tried changing the connection security to ""password, transmitted insecurely"". </p><p>When I click between accounts, in the lower left corner both accounts say ""loading messages"" on both accounts.
