I chatted with a midco tech, who said ""yes, midco acquired the wowway accounts, but not yours.""  Obviously untrue, but I think it means that the account has disappeared from midco's records.

Using another mail client might, not because there is anything wrong with Thunderbird in this regard, but because you'd have to set up the account again and that could reveal some mistake you made when setting up the account in Thunderbird.

They're different things. </p><p>You may have a profile without a profile folder if you deleted the profile folder in the filesystem but didn't remove the profile from Thunderbird. Similarly, you may have a profile folder not associated with any profile if you copied the profile folder from elsewhere into the <i>Profiles</i> folder in the filesystem. </p><p>In the screenshot on the left, you're seeing the profiles that exist in Thunderbird. In the screenshot on the right, you're seeing profile folders you have. There is a mismatch between them because you have a profile in Thunderbird without a corresponding profile folder and also a profile folder without a corresponding profile using it. </p><p>Merely placing a profile folder in the <i>Profiles</i> folder doesn't cause Thunderbird to recognise it as a profile or create a profile to use it. You do still need to manually create a profile for it and then associate the profile with that profile folder or, alternatively, let a new profile folder be created when you create the profile, then replace the contents of that new profile folder with the contents of the profile folder you want to use. </p><p>A bit confusing, I know, but does that clear things up? </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

All are pop3. The two accounts that are not gmail download their messages to a global inbox folder. The gmail account has its own inbox folder. I have had this type of set up for a couple of years with no issues. What I want is that only the downloaded gmail goes to the gmail/inbox folder and the other two emails download into the local/inbox folder. I had this set up working for a couple of years but recently had to set up a new laptop. Now things don't work like they used to. </p>,rjr6860,false,0,0

My second thought would be to see if the non-gmail account is forwarding to the gmail account. My third thought is to go online to the gmail account itself to see if the non-gmail messages appear there. That research may explain the issue. I am not familiar with the POP global inbox, but searching the thunderbird settings seems the nore unlikely to have captured one account and displayed it in a separate account on its own.

I did this so that when my windows machine craps, I don't lose all my emails. Once again, this is the way I've had it set up for a couple of years and didn't experience problems. Originally gmail would capture all emails but the thunderbird gmail account would only download those emails addressed to the gmail account. Now the thunderbird gmail account is downloading all of retrieved emails. I still don't know if I am being clear. My guess is that this is probably a gmail issue and not the thunderbird issue but I can't figure it out. Maybe it won't work this way anymore but it used to. </p>",rjr6860,false,0,0

That makes sense if Microsoft’s OAuth tokens remain valid even after a password change. </p><p>However, I want to ensure that whenever I change my email password, the accounts with the old password can no longer be used in Thunderbird, and it should prompt for a new login immediately. The reason I change my password is to enhance security, and I want to make sure that any previously used authentication is no longer valid. </p><p>Is there a way to configure Thunderbird (or Microsoft 365) so that changing the password forces a reauthentication in Thunderbird, requiring me to enter the new password? If so, how can I set this up? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",naomiyangwork233,false,0,0

I suppose the same can be done in the case of Microsoft… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Key steps to set this up: </p><p>Open Thunderbird Account Settings: Go to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Account Settings"".  </p><p>Select Server Settings: In the left pane, choose the relevant Microsoft account and click ""Server Settings"".  Change Authentication Method: Under ""Security Settings"", select ""OAuth2"" as the Authentication method.  Outgoing Server (SMTP): If necessary, also change the authentication method for your outgoing server (SMTP) to OAuth2.  </p><p>Important points to remember: </p><p>Microsoft Authenticator App: You will need the Microsoft Authenticator app installed on your phone to receive verification codes when prompted.  </p><p>Administrator Approval: Depending on your organization's setup, you might need administrator approval to use OAuth2 authentication with Thunderbird.  </p><p>My summation is set you authentication method to oauth in Account settings and see if you still get this error message.  I think the authenticator is only required for other authentication methods than oauth.  I am certainly not getting such a message on my Hotmail accounts. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
