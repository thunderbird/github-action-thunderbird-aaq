My contacts from Outlook are a mess as over the years I did not always enter them by manually as a field at a time. Sometimes the address entry was pasted into Outlook or via a download and this produces a .csv with a poor data structure. There is no way I would expect to get a decent data transfer from such a jumble so in an effort to supply Thunderbird with a half decent .csv file I decided to edit the Outlook exported .csv to match a Thunderbird .csv export. I made up a new Address Book in Thunderbird with a few names and addresses and exported it to a .csv. Unfortunately when I look into the exported file some data does not appear to have been exported. For example I only have one phone number exported under 'Work Phone' although there are two or more listings in my made up contact in the address book. The same with email addresses, only the first two listings are exported under 'Primary Email' and 'Secondary Email' although I have more in the made up contact in the Thunderbird Address Book. I wonder if anyone else has undertaken this task and can share any tips for the best way to approach this, or maybe tell me where Thunderbird is putting the data that it does not export? I note that Thunderbird structures the phone numbers as 'Work Phone', 'Home Phone', 'Fax Number', 'Pager Number', but the ""New Contact"" screen does not have any of these input options. I'm a bit stumped at the moment so any ideas or help would be most appreciated. Regards.
