My contacts from Outlook are a mess as over the years I did not always enter them by manually as a field at a time. Sometimes the address entry was pasted into Outlook or via a download and this produces a .csv with a poor data structure. There is no way I would expect to get a decent data transfer from such a jumble so in an effort to supply Thunderbird with a half decent .csv file I decided to edit the Outlook exported .csv to match a Thunderbird .csv export. I made up a new Address Book in Thunderbird with a few names and addresses and exported it to a .csv. Unfortunately when I look into the exported file some data does not appear to have been exported. For example I only have one phone number exported under 'Work Phone' although there are two or more listings in my made up contact in the address book. The same with email addresses, only the first two listings are exported under 'Primary Email' and 'Secondary Email' although I have more in the made up contact in the Thunderbird Address Book. I wonder if anyone else has undertaken this task and can share any tips for the best way to approach this, or maybe tell me where Thunderbird is putting the data that it does not export? I note that Thunderbird structures the phone numbers as 'Work Phone', 'Home Phone', 'Fax Number', 'Pager Number', but the ""New Contact"" screen does not have any of these input options. I'm a bit stumped at the moment so any ideas or help would be most appreciated. Regards. Greg </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1708623;1708636;,greg239

When I get one of those emails, in TB I get no notification (fine) neither the message count in the folders bar gets updated. What is worse, if I go and I click on ""Get messages"", nothing happens (I get a ""no new messages in server"" message), </p><p>At this point, if I have received one of those emails, there is no way for me to know whether I have something new or not.  </p><p>However, if I happen to click on the folder where they lay... tada! after a second or two, the email shows up, and the number in the left bar gets updated! </p><p>I wonder if this is some sync issue or has to do with some option I have marked. But this is a very bad issues, as it can take days until I notice that I have received an email. </p><p>Any hint of what might be happening and how to solve it (if possible)?  </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1708766;1709119;,ermoya31

Kiedyś jak klikałem lewym przyciskiem myszy to byłem przenoszony od razu do przeglądarki, w której była wyświetlana odpowiednia strona. A teraz pojawia się ikona lupy+ i obrazek jest powiększany zamiast przenoszenia do przeglądarki. Chciałbym powrócić do poprzednich ustawień, ale nie mogę nigdzie tego znaleźć.  Pozdrawiam Marcin </p><p>I have a problem with graphic links in emails. In the past, when I clicked with the left mouse button, I was immediately taken to the browser, which displayed the appropriate page. Now, the magnifying glass icon + appears and the image is enlarged instead of being taken to the browser.
