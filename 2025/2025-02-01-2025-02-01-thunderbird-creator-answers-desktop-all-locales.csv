I have tried to select what I want put into the Mail Channels Quarantine Digest and I find the process very difficult and frustrating. I object to some program deciding what I want to have quarantined. I did not ask to have this program installed on my system. If whoever maintains this program gets it to where I can with one or two mouse clicks put something in the digest it seems like a good idea. Until then please let me  opt out of having it on my system. If that is not possible I will start using a different e-mail program. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1708408;,Feredkonersman

Instead, the cursor changes to a ""zoom/unzoom"" icon, and that's what it actually does, zooms and unzooms.  I've found this with emails from different sources, both for .png and .jpg images.  But those same emails when viewed in a web-based client, the graphic links work correctly as expected.  What's up with Thunderbird?
