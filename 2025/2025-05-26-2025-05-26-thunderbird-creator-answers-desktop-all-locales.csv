After moving a message from InBox to another folder, TB announced that it was unable to compact InBox because it was read-only (which was obviously false).  Various combinations of compacting InBox, stopping/starting TB, and rebooting the machine, seemed to work. </p><p>On 5/23/2025 things escalated.  TB would not show the body of any messages in the Preview window, usually after I moved or deleted a message.  Opening a message would open the appropriate window, but not show the body content; Reply showed neither body nor To:.  Restarting and compacting InBox did no good.  Other folders seemed to behave normally. </p><p>Taking the next step, I opened Properties for InBox and clicked Repair.  The result was the disappearance of all my InBox messages back through 5/19/2025.  Very irritating to lose several dozen messages. </p><p>On into today (5/26/2025) TB has been pretty well behaved (though I did update from 138.0.1-1 on 5/25/2025 as a hopeful pre-emptive strike).  Then I moved a message from InBox and the Preview window failed to reflect the body of the now-current message or any other InBox message.  Again, other folders were fine.  No improvement with Compact, so I tried Repair again.  This time it deleted InBox messages back through 5/6/2025. </p><p>I can restore from today's early a.m. backups, but have no idea how to reconcile with the current state of InBox.  Obviously something is seriously wrong and I have no idea what to do.  Meanwhile, I will deal with email clumsily on my phone. </p><p>PLEASE HELP!!
