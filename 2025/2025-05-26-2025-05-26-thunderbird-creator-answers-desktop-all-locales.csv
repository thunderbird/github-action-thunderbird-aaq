Which folders move is random. Then message filters don't work properly so the filter is unchecked until I move the folder back where it should be and reenable the filter. (2) Occasionally folders disappear completely, so I have to recreate and repopulate them. (3) Sometimes filters are disabled with no apparent cause. (4) More recently, Thunderbird filters can't find folders (though they appear to be in the correct place) so the filters also get disabled. Reenabling the filter doesn't help, and I have not found a workaround for this. Seems to be more and more frequent. (5) Yesterday whole folders were empty of messages that had been there the day before. One folder (on a W11) hasn't any messages for the last month, though on MacBooks the filter that feeds it is working OK. </p><p>I am not doing anything to cause this.

After moving a message from InBox to another folder, TB announced that it was unable to compact InBox because it was read-only (which was obviously false).  Various combinations of compacting InBox, stopping/starting TB, and rebooting the machine, seemed to work. </p><p>On 5/23/2025 things escalated.  TB would not show the body of any messages in the Preview window, usually after I moved or deleted a message.  Opening a message would open the appropriate window, but not show the body content; Reply showed neither body nor To:.  Restarting and compacting InBox did no good.  Other folders seemed to behave normally. </p><p>Taking the next step, I opened Properties for InBox and clicked Repair.  The result was the disappearance of all my InBox messages back through 5/19/2025.  Very irritating to lose several dozen messages. </p><p>On into today (5/26/2025) TB has been pretty well behaved (though I did update from 138.0.1-1 on 5/25/2025 as a hopeful pre-emptive strike).  Then I moved a message from InBox and the Preview window failed to reflect the body of the now-current message or any other InBox message.  Again, other folders were fine.  No improvement with Compact, so I tried Repair again.  This time it deleted InBox messages back through 5/6/2025. </p><p>I can restore from today's early a.m. backups, but have no idea how to reconcile with the current state of InBox.  Obviously something is seriously wrong and I have no idea what to do.  Meanwhile, I will deal with email clumsily on my phone. </p><p>PLEASE HELP!!
