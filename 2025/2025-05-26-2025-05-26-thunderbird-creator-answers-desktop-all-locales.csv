These folders exist on Outlook as viewed with a browser. I could not force the addition of those folders. Sometimes, I could rename a folder and it would show content for some days before disappearing.  </p><p>I am also having problems that a folder exists with not individual email account, but two subfolders have their full content. I cannot use Thunderbird to add content to a folder with empty content, except for the working subfolders. I have tried ""Repair Folder"" with no success. If ""Foothill.msf"" exists, it has zero or little content. I can generate new folders. I've been running Thunderbird for decades without a problem this severe.  </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>  Outlook via browser is now missing the Foothill folder, but one of the subfolders exists on Thunderbird.! </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rstehle

From Thunderbird to Android, sync works correct. New items and changes show up on Android. But from Android to Thunderbird, nothing syncs.  From Android to the Radicale server, all seems well, because the changes show up in the Radicale collection, as show when you download the .vcs file. </p><p>So the problem seems between Radicale and Thunderbird. Can someone please help to debug this problem? E.g. is there a log of Thunderbird for the sync of the addressbook?  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",mp+firefox

I've reinstalled my system but I'm still experiencing the same problem. I have a simple use from internet applications: firefox, thunderbird, agenda, joplin in their latest versions. I installed the latest version of the bios but it didn't improve the situation much. I've installed the latest standalone versions of Firefox, including thunderbird 138.0.2 (64 bits). </p><p>At each launch, I have a sudden increase in cpu (which resets after 20 to 30s) and the temperature doesn't drop much below 90°C. I've noticed the same thing with Firefox, but I'm posting here because if I'm not active on the PC, I still connect to my numerous mailboxes periodically. If I close my applications and do nothing, it goes down again after about 30 minutes. As this is a new configuration on the latest Ubuntu 25.04 version, I wonder if there could be a problem with TB or Firefox? </p><p>My processor&nbsp;: Intel Core i3-1115G4 (Dual-Core 1.7 GHz - 3 GHz / 4.1 GHz Turbo - 4 Threads - Cache 6 Mo) - RAM = 32go </p><p>Regards </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1736425;,HdInfAutre

I have a few accounts on my Thunderbird, and all of them are running smoothly regarding downloading messages, so I can read all of them, but I can send new messages only from non-gmail accounts. To use gmail I have to log to the web service.  I tried to remove and add again gmail account, but it didn't help. I have the newest and actual version of Thunderbird. I didn't install any new apps last week.  The message is: Sending the message failed. The message sending failed because the connection to the outgoing mail server (SMTP) timed out. Please try again or contact your network administrator. Hope someone can help me&nbsp;:) Best, Iwona </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",iw.zurek
