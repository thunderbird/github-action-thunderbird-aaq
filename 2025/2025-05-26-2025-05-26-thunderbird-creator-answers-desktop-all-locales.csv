These folders exist on Outlook as viewed with a browser. I could not force the addition of those folders. Sometimes, I could rename a folder and it would show content for some days before disappearing.  </p><p>I am also having problems that a folder exists with not individual email account, but two subfolders have their full content. I cannot use Thunderbird to add content to a folder with empty content, except for the working subfolders. I have tried ""Repair Folder"" with no success. If ""Foothill.msf"" exists, it has zero or little content. I can generate new folders. I've been running Thunderbird for decades without a problem this severe.  </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>  Outlook via browser is now missing the Foothill folder, but one of the subfolders exists on Thunderbird.! </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rstehle
