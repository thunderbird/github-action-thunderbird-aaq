These folders exist on Outlook as viewed with a browser. I could not force the addition of those folders. Sometimes, I could rename a folder and it would show content for some days before disappearing.  </p><p>I am also having problems that a folder exists with not individual email account, but two subfolders have their full content. I cannot use Thunderbird to add content to a folder with empty content, except for the working subfolders. I have tried ""Repair Folder"" with no success. If ""Foothill.msf"" exists, it has zero or little content. I can generate new folders. I've been running Thunderbird for decades without a problem this severe.  </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>  Outlook via browser is now missing the Foothill folder, but one of the subfolders exists on Thunderbird.! </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rstehle

Premetto di avere le stesse configurazioni su tutti gli account in uso, identiche a quelle impostate su tutti gli altri device, e di non aver apportato alcun tipo di modifica. </p><p>Pur disinstallando e reinstallando Thunderbird il problema non si è risolto. Per Aruba, ove l'account di posta è attivo, non ci sono anomalie. </p><p>Quale potrebbe essere il problema? </p><p>Grazie in anticipo per il supporto. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,"",trader.holland.nl

From Thunderbird to Android, sync works correct. New items and changes show up on Android. But from Android to Thunderbird, nothing syncs.  From Android to the Radicale server, all seems well, because the changes show up in the Radicale collection, as show when you download the .vcs file. </p><p>So the problem seems between Radicale and Thunderbird. Can someone please help to debug this problem? E.g. is there a log of Thunderbird for the sync of the addressbook?  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",mp+firefox
