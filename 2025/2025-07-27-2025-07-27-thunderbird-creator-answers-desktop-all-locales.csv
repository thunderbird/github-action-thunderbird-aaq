Here is the message from Thunderbird - ""The certificate for <a href=""http://pop.scdconline.org"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.scdconline.org</a> is not valid for that server.""  The current version of Thunderbird on my Windows 11 PC is 141.0 (2025072114:12:26).  It was installed on 7/22/25 at 2:18:53PM.  The last email I received through Thunderbird was on 7/23/25 at 6:18PM (EDT).  I can still access the email account using webmail. Prior to this issue, I have been using Thunderbird for this email account since the first of this year with no issues.  I'm out of idea, any suggestions? </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",rgounaud
