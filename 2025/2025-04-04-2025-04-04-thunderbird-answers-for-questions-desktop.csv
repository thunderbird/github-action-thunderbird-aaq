Might as well say someone died because his heart failed, or he had a stroke, or he had cancer, or he bled to death, or...well thanks, but it hardly clarifies matters. As far as I can tell, I've done everything right, except that obviously I haven't, which is a wee bit frustrating. </p><p>Where do I go from here? There's only email address, password, and settings, and I've tried all the permutations I can think of. Although I've already tried it and it didn't work, is there any benefit to typing out the random character string behind the secure mail key or is the mail key itself the preferred way? </p><p>I'm at a total loss, here. This is supposed to be simple and automatic and all, but it's not working. </p><p>Thanks, Grey </p>",greyrollins,false,0,0
