After a reboot yesterday, Tbird stopped misbehaving. I got to thinking (a rare gem for me) and realized that this started happening after I began doing some website updates for a not-for-profit I work with. I've had DreamWeaver open for a short time each day, and the Thunderbird lock-up errors would happen after I was done with the web chores. Sequence was:  DreamWeaver was open, but Thunderbird was either closed or just sitting idle. I'd close DreamWeaver, go in to use Thunderbird, and Tbird would freeze up and force me to close it whenever I tried to write/answer an email. Reopening it again wouldn't help. Yesterday, after rebooting the computer, Thunderbird was fine. So, I am very suspicious that there is a conflict with DreamWeaver, which is hanging on to resources that Thunderbird requires, even after DW is closed. I did a brief search, and apparently others have reported issues with DW in this regard. I'll be experimenting with this a bit before following your advice below.  </p><p>I will now stop piggybacking on this thread; I just wanted to report the update.  </p><p>And, most importantly, to say, ""Thank you."" </p> <em><p>Wayne Mery <a href=""#answer-1748531"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote><em><p>GayzeN <a href=""#answer-1748497"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> I am on Windows 11.
