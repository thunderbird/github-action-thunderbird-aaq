Usually in the antivirus, firewall or VPN categories. </p><p>Having just read the titles of your plethora of questions (No that is all I read) I would guess you have a third party antivirus product installed that has caused most of the issue you have reported. </p><p>Do you have an exception for Thunderbird's profile folder from antivirus scanning in your antivirus?  Not having that can be the cause of unsaved settings changes, sluggish behaviors and general failures to synchronize. </p><p>Have you ensured that the firewall component is set to allow Thunderbird regardless of version? Post update lots of folks have issue with getting their mail or even sending it.  This is usually a result of alarmist security settings in the firewall that see the new version of software entrusted and blocked from the internet by the firewall for up to 2 weeks.  Depending on the product and how long it takes it to phone home and learn there is a new version number is can trust. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Thunderbird must be set up as an allowed program otherwise firewall might block access. </p><p>Check VPN Have you enabled a VPN? Please double check - some Anti-Virus products come with a VPN which may have been auto enabled. Most servers do not like VPN as it hides IP, so server might think you are a hacker and block you. So switch off VPN or create a split tunnelling and set it up to allow Thunderbird to use it. </p><p>What settings are using?
