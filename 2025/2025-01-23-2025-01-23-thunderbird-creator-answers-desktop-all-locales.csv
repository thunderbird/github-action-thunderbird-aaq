I only preview. </p><p>Is there a setting in Thunderbird to allow read email to download or would it wreak havoc?  My workaround is to mark emails unread from within the gmail app. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1705840;,pinkmeat3

This is a clean installation on a brand new Windows 11 computer. I have reinstalled Thunderbird three times, deleted saved passwords, deleted only the SMTP and IMAP saved passwords (preserving OAuth2 passwords), deleted Thunderbird's access in Gmail security settings to force it to re-request access, followed every instruction on every forum and help page I can find, but Thunderbird refuses to send and receive mail. Thunderbird finds the correct configuration and sets it up (correct ports, IMAP, SMTP, correct servers, OAuth2, etc.) I used my Gmail address and the same password as I use for webmail.  </p><p>I am presently using Outlook for Gmail because it connected immediately using the same credentials as I am trying with Thunderbird. When I delete access permission in Gmail security settings, then add Gmail to Thunderbird again, it prompts for access to Contacts and Calendar but not to mail (one time it flashed a screen saying it could not because Java is not enabled in my web browser--but Java is enabled on both my default browser, Edge, and on Chrome; the page that came up appears to be some internal browser in Thunderbird). </p><p>The attached images show the configurations for IMAP server, the SMTP server, and that the saved passwords contain two OAuth2 URLs, one for contacts and the other for the calendar, but nothing for mail. </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird for years, and have a massive archive of emails in it, would really like to use it as my email client rather than Outlook. Installation and configuration has never been this difficult. Does anybody have any thoughts on what to do next? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1705879;,allanpmustard

It didn't seem to do any thing until I checked a check box which followed the blurb about making the changes permanent. So I may have accidentally asked it to make them permanent. Not sure because the UI was unclear what it was asking me to do. Why are there 2 separate dialogs popping up? Do I have to tick something to make it enter TbS mode? Not clear.
