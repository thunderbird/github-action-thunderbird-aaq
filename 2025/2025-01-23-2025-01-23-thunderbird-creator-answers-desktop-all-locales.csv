This is a clean installation on a brand new Windows 11 computer.

When I delete access permission in Gmail security settings, then add Gmail to Thunderbird again, it prompts for access to Contacts and Calendar but not to mail (one time it flashed a screen saying it could not because Java is not enabled in my web browser--but Java is enabled on both my default browser, Edge, and on Chrome; the page that came up appears to be some internal browser in Thunderbird). </p><p>The attached images show the configurations for IMAP server, the SMTP server, and that the saved passwords contain two OAuth2 URLs, one for contacts and the other for the calendar, but nothing for mail. </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird for years, and have a massive archive of emails in it, would really like to use it as my email client rather than Outlook.
