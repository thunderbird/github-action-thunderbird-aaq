During the day I receive them just sporadically or not at all - even when I try to retrieve them manually. Also Thunderbird will not synchronise my mail accounts on my phone, tablet and notebook. When I log in with my mail provider I have no problems. The mails are there and I can open and read them. But Thunderbird will not retrieve them. I'm able to send mails but they are not copied into the sent folder and/or I get a error message that they could not be saved in the sent folder or not be sent at all.
