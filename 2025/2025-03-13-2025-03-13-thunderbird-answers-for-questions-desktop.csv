But your instructions were too general for me to follow with confidence. </p><p>It seems that this should be simpler than it is. But I also am not technical. My goal is to merge the two folders from Thunderbird on my PC to Thunderbird on my mac book. And I'd like them all to be accessible within Thunderbird along with the already existing emails on my mac book. I'm not sure if this means the ""same folder"" as you mentioned. </p><p>Is there a way to move the two folders from TB PC to TB Mac manually and have the two moved folders accessible within my already existing mac book TB email? </p><p>What folder on mac book should they be moved to in order to access all within mac book TB? And I also would like move my address book/contacts. But that is secondary, unless it can be done at the same time. </p><p>Regarding the import/export tool. I did attempt this. The export is easy. It's the import that concerns me. I want to move both the folders. But it didn't seem to allow me to choose those two main folders. It showed all the items in within those folders and there are many. And having never used the import/export tool, I don't want to guess and then overwrite existing emails. </p><p>I'm now at a loss of how to move forward. There seems to be so many options I've become more confused. But it seems my goal is very simple. Merge my personal emails from my work PC Thunderbird to my personal Mac book Thunderbird without overwriting the emails already on my Mac book. </p><p>I've resigned from my job ironically at a major tech company that I have been at just short of 25 years. I can't bear to loose years of personal emails, many from my parents who both passed away in 2024 with pictures, voicemails, just so many memories. </p><p>Are there any visual instructions I can view?

There is actually an option to move specific folder sets up or down in the menu for that pane.  So my 'Favourite folders' <em>are</em> displayed at the top of everything.

I don't want to be using my keyboard when reading/filing messages. How quaint! But it's also worse than right clicking and navigating through the 'move to' menus. I don't want to be navigating through 3 layers of menus, scrolling back up to the top of the folder tree, or typing in things to perform frequent moves of emails. They are passable alternatives which certainly work. But the fact is that in the Outlook I use for work, it's a zero-effort and zero-thought task to move any item from any account into a Favourite folder, and in Thunderbird it just isn't. </p>",bigthicko,false,0,0

"" </p><p>That means it's not an imap account, so therefore you cannot subscribe to see any folders on the server. So in Account Settings, do not not use the settings I stated for an IMAP account.  </p><p>Pop accounts just have permission to access the server Inbox and download whatever has not been previously downloaded. Pop accounts do not synchronise with any folder on the server. They are completely independent copy of folders and emails on your computer. </p><p>Yahoo by default will store any email you send via smtp in the webmail account folder used for sent mail. Gmail does the same and they do it via default just in case Pop users want to use their webmail account or change to an imap account. So the fact you can see those saved sent emails on the server is not relevant in your case - but is useful. </p><p><strong>RE: POP account</strong> I need to know how this pop account is set up. </p><p>Did you set up the pop account as a deferred account which uses the 'Local Folders' account as a global Inbox?
