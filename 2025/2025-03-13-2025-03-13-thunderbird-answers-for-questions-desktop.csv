There is actually an option to move specific folder sets up or down in the menu for that pane.  So my 'Favourite folders' <em>are</em> displayed at the top of everything. But the point is that when I scroll down to see some of my other accounts, the whole of the 'Favourites' panel scrolls off the top of the window.  Making hard to simply drag a message from my 'work' account into my 'accounts' (favourite) folder. Or from my Google Play account into my 'Steam and Games' (favourite) folder. </p>",bigthicko,false,0,0

I don't want to be using my keyboard when reading/filing messages. How quaint! But it's also worse than right clicking and navigating through the 'move to' menus. I don't want to be navigating through 3 layers of menus, scrolling back up to the top of the folder tree, or typing in things to perform frequent moves of emails. They are passable alternatives which certainly work. But the fact is that in the Outlook I use for work, it's a zero-effort and zero-thought task to move any item from any account into a Favourite folder, and in Thunderbird it just isn't. </p>",bigthicko,false,0,0
