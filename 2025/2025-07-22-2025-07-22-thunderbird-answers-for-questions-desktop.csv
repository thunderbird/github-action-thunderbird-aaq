Sorry to hear about your troubles! </p><p>It sounds to me like Thunderbird is installed on your new computer, but it's asking for your email account password (not a Thunderbird password, since Thunderbird itself doesn’t require a password). </p><p>The good news is we can help you with the steps to recover your email account password.  Here’s how to do it: </p> <ul><li> Figure out who your email provider was (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) </li><li> Go to that provider's website &amp; try signing into your email on the web (example: <a href=""https://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gmail.com</a>) </li><li> If you can’t log in, use the “Forgot password?” link to reset it </li></ul> <p>(Once you know your email address and working password, open Thunderbird) </p><p>When prompted to add an account: </p><p>Enter your name, email address, and the password you just recovered Thunderbird should set everything up automatically from there. </p><p>Good luck &amp; I hope this helps! </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0
