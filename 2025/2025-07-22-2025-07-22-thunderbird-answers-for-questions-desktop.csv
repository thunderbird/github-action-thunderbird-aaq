Once you enter your credentials the first time in Thunderbird, it should auto-configure everything from there. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0

Let's try this solution: </p><p>Go to Thunderbird in the top menu and go to Settings --&gt; General --&gt; Scroll to the very bottom --&gt; Click on Config Editor. </p><p>Once your in the config editor, ignore that silly-little caution sign and click on the ""Show all"" button. Once you do, a list should show, also a search bar.  In the search bar, start to type in ""layers.acceleration.disabled"" until you find the match.  Press the little left/right arrow icon next to this property to toggle it to ""TRUE"".  </p><p>Then, Restart Thunderbird and see if you issue is corrected. If this does not correct your issue, then repeat the above steps to toggle the property back to its original setting, false.  </p><p>Good Luck. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0

(e.g. @tpg.com.au, @iinet.net.au, etc.)? </p><p>This information might help us to confirm if your email account has migrated to the Messaging Co.   IF you already feel confident that your account migrated over to TMC, then skip to the next step.  </p><p>If we confirm your account did migrate over, then you will have to authenticate and regain access to your email via <a href=""http://themessaging.co"" rel=""nofollow"">themessaging.co</a> website. Once that is done, we can update the account settings in Thunderbird to match your new email provider's settings.  </p><p><a href=""https://support.themessaging.co/hc/en-au/articles/8524389433615-I-need-support-Contact-the-the-support-team?utm_source=chatgpt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.themessaging.co/hc/en-au/articles/8524389433615-I-need-support-Contact-the-the-support-team?utm_source=chatgpt.com</a> </p>",Thundamike,true,0,0

Thunderbird is an email client for viewing and organizing your emails, so you can use it to manage multiple accounts from different providers, like Gmail, Outlook, Mailfence, Yahoo, (or any provider) all in one place. Each account stays separate with its own inbox. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0
