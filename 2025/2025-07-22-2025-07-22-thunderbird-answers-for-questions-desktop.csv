Sorry to hear about your troubles! </p><p>It sounds to me like Thunderbird is installed on your new computer, but it's asking for your email account password (not a Thunderbird password, since Thunderbird itself doesn’t require a password). </p><p>The good news is we can help you with the steps to recover your email account password.  Here’s how to do it: </p> <ul><li> Figure out who your email provider was (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) </li><li> Go to that provider's website &amp; try signing into your email on the web (example: <a href=""https://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gmail.com</a>) </li><li> If you can’t log in, use the “Forgot password?” link to reset it </li></ul> <p>(Once you know your email address and working password, open Thunderbird) </p><p>When prompted to add an account: </p><p>Enter your name, email address, and the password you just recovered Thunderbird should set everything up automatically from there. </p><p>Good luck &amp; I hope this helps! </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0

Once you enter your credentials the first time in Thunderbird, it should auto-configure everything from there. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0

Let's try this solution: </p><p>Go to Thunderbird in the top menu and go to Settings --&gt; General --&gt; Scroll to the very bottom --&gt; Click on Config Editor. </p><p>Once your in the config editor, ignore that silly-little caution sign and click on the ""Show all"" button. Once you do, a list should show, also a search bar.  In the search bar, start to type in ""layers.acceleration.disabled"" until you find the match.  Press the little left/right arrow icon next to this property to toggle it to ""TRUE"".  </p><p>Then, Restart Thunderbird and see if you issue is corrected. If this does not correct your issue, then repeat the above steps to toggle the property back to its original setting, false.  </p><p>Good Luck. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0
