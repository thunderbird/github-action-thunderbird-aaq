I get the error message per the screenshot below concerning SMTP. </p><p>I have a MacBook Air with Mac OS Sequoia 15.7.2. The error started yesterday (21 November). Just finished conversing with Optus support and they say that it's not at their end: webmail works okay, can receive email and send it (will note there was a brief hiccough earlier today when could not send from webmail, but okay now). All settings as recommended (port for incoming server actually different from what Optus recommends, but when I changed it from 995 to 110, Thunderbird stopped being able to download emails, so changed it back again. Port for outgoing is as recommended, 25.) I tried lowering security, as suggested by Thunderbird help list, and no change so restored it. </p><p>I have the latest version of Thunderbird for Mac, 145.0. </p><p>My partner, who also uses Thunderbird, cannot receive emails either.
