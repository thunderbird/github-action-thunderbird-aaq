I was missing '465' and I have now learnt that by seeing it in my NEW Account which just popped up in front of me??? I did the set up, and it seemed to be going OK, however, I only have a Deleted Items and Junk Folder, with absolutely NO CONTACTS.  After doing some reading up, apparently I should have an update bar at the bottom right hand corner - NO.   Now the Icon seems to have disappeared as well.  So I can no longer look at the NEW account. Simply fixing my OLD email account by (possibly) adding '465' into Port section of the STMP Server page would be good. Wow, YES, it now allows me to use my OLD account to SEND an email - Yeehaa!    HOWEVER, I cannot download new emails.  So, on my Computer, the latest email coming IN is dated 12/01/2025.   My emails DO come in to my iPad, so I am not totally missing out, however ALL of my Historical Emails which are VITAL to keep due to legal repercussions, are on my Computer and I am no longer able to add items to those folders.
