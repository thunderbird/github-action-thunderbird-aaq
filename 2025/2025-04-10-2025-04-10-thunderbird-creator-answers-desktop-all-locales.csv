I was missing '465' and I have now learnt that by seeing it in my NEW Account which just popped up in front of me??? I did the set up, and it seemed to be going OK, however, I only have a Deleted Items and Junk Folder, with absolutely NO CONTACTS.  After doing some reading up, apparently I should have an update bar at the bottom right hand corner - NO.   Now the Icon seems to have disappeared as well.  So I can no longer look at the NEW account. Simply fixing my OLD email account by (possibly) adding '465' into Port section of the STMP Server page would be good. Wow, YES, it now allows me to use my OLD account to SEND an email - Yeehaa!    HOWEVER, I cannot download new emails.  So, on my Computer, the latest email coming IN is dated 12/01/2025.   My emails DO come in to my iPad, so I am not totally missing out, however ALL of my Historical Emails which are VITAL to keep due to legal repercussions, are on my Computer and I am no longer able to add items to those folders.

It stopped retrieving from my POP3 account that was transferred to Yahoo from Cox Communications 2 years ago. Our IMAP accounts have no problems. I CAN send emails, and the new messages do show on the web portal. My phone can also receive messages. on my PC TB tries for about 10 minutes to get the messages, then shows an error message ""The DELE command did not succeed, error marking a message as deleted. Mail server <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a> responded too many requests"". For a couple of weeks I found some messages never downloaded (most did) but now I get none. Interestingly today when it happened I would hear the audio announcement for the account there was mail, but none showed. Server settings are what is specified, tried restarting in Troubleshoot mode to no effect, and updated TB to next version. Still stuck.  Any help is appreciated! </p><p>p.s. Just to complicate more, Windows did an update dated April 8, installed sometime on April 9. </p><p>Solution found: I found a year-old backup of my TB profile and replaced the existing one with it (after first copying the existing one for safety). That worked, except ALL messages were downloaded again. It appears every time TB tried to access messages it started at the beginning, so there were multiple copies of each old one to delete. A small price to pay for getting TB back online. So the problem was a corrupted profile, reason unknown. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",DSW1950
