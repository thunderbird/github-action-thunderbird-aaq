It seems that the ""Recent Destinations"" list is only saving (or maybe just displaying) folders with names beginning with ""A"" - ""N"". If I move an email to a folder with its name beginning with ""O"" - ""Z"", the email will be moved to the appropriate / selected folder, but the folder (destination) name will NOT appear in the ""Recent Destinations"" list. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",blkalish
