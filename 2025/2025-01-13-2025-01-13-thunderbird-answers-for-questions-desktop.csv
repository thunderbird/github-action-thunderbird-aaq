I have the same email addresses hooked up on them. In addition, we have the same email addresses set up on 2 smartphones (in the outlook app and gmail).  At the moment it is the case that on computers when emails come in, they are marked as unread. The problem is then when the same emails come in on the smartphone, they immediately convert as read in Thunderbird, even though I haven't moved them at all on the smartphone. This applies to one email account. On another one it is so that in Thunderbird it is marked as unread all the time, but when I read it there, on the other computer in Thunderbird it is deselected and it is read, even though I have not opened it. Why is this happening? How to make all messages that fall into a particular Thubderbird to be marked as unread all the time, as long as we actually read them only in this particular program? I hope everything is understood </blockquote> <p>Hard to diagnose without knowing which accounts are POP or IMAP.  With IMAP, a message that is read or deleted on one device is marked as read or deleted on other devices - that is synchronization.  With POP, messages that are downloaded to one device without being deleted from the server, can be downloaded on other devices, but the actions on one device are not synchronized with other devices. </p><p>IMAP is almost always the best option for accounts on multiple devices, besides other advantages such as syncing all folders such as Sent, Junk, user-defined folders etc.  POP downloads the Inbox only. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I see this topic and I see a <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1429697"" rel=""nofollow"">topic from 2 years ago</a> about Thunderbird donations.  Nothing really related to Thunderbird at all. </p><p>I know it is complicated,  but posting in these support forums gets you other product users,  not some paid support person.  There are n paid support people for Mozilla products. So if you have something to say it has to be exact and very complete.  We are completely unable to access any non public information about you or your use of the products or web sites. </p><p>""One of the messages from you said your couldnt find   wwwoolf."" This statement is actually meaningless in the context. </p><p>A message from whom?  No one reading your text has any idea what you were doing to generate that message (actually I would consider it an error).   Did you get that message in an email.   From a web site?; What was the URL of the web site that gave it to you? (I have accounts on at least five Mozilla web sites.  They are all different so knowing exactly what web site has an issue is critical. </p><p>My first wild guess based on zero information from you is that you have cookies or JavaScript disabled in Firefox and you therefore get issues because both are required for the PayPal website.  Both of these things are enabled by default in Firefox and Thunderbird,  but there are still some wayward security products that routinely disable them.  There are also some folks who think they can surf the modern web without them and protect their privacy.  They almost always have issues and lodge complaints about things being broken. </p><p>Is there actually a question in here about Thunderbird the mail client software?

I was under the impression that somehow previous messages could be viewed like in an email thread.  And I don't seem to get or see the notifications when I post a question so I was really glad to see your message in an email. </p><p>The question involving Thunderbird was that I was recently trying to donate to Thunderbird after seeing an email solicitation link. When I tried to use Paypal on Firefox,  I got error messages after Paypal recognized me.     This is the message: ""Paypal Something went wrong Please go back to MZLA Technologies Corporation and choose another way to pay. PayPal isn't available at this time."" </p><p>Today I tried to purchase something using Paypal while on Firefox and kept getting "" something went wrong...  return to merchant"" messages.     But I had no issue with Safari with the purchase or donation. </p><p>So its something with the Firefox settings.   I tried to add the merchant to the cookie and site exception list but maybe I didnt click Save Changes.... or designate Allow or Allow for Session.&nbsp;?? I went into Firefox settings and see the merchant has cookies listed.   So does <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> I don't know about Java....don't understand it or if I have it disabled.   And not that every single site has a conflict with Paypal.   I only use Safari if I cant use Firefox. </p><p>What I want to know is if I get another Paypal block while on Firefox, what setting do I need to change to allow the transaction to go through? </p>",wwwwoolf,false,0,0
