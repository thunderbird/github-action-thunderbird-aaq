I have the same email addresses hooked up on them. In addition, we have the same email addresses set up on 2 smartphones (in the outlook app and gmail).  At the moment it is the case that on computers when emails come in, they are marked as unread. The problem is then when the same emails come in on the smartphone, they immediately convert as read in Thunderbird, even though I haven't moved them at all on the smartphone. This applies to one email account. On another one it is so that in Thunderbird it is marked as unread all the time, but when I read it there, on the other computer in Thunderbird it is deselected and it is read, even though I have not opened it. Why is this happening? How to make all messages that fall into a particular Thubderbird to be marked as unread all the time, as long as we actually read them only in this particular program? I hope everything is understood </blockquote> <p>Hard to diagnose without knowing which accounts are POP or IMAP.  With IMAP, a message that is read or deleted on one device is marked as read or deleted on other devices - that is synchronization.  With POP, messages that are downloaded to one device without being deleted from the server, can be downloaded on other devices, but the actions on one device are not synchronized with other devices. </p><p>IMAP is almost always the best option for accounts on multiple devices, besides other advantages such as syncing all folders such as Sent, Junk, user-defined folders etc.  POP downloads the Inbox only. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

These are the facts and at the end I've identified the likely cause. This issue has been known for a long time and in all that time the issue has never been Thunderbird and it still is not Thunderbird. Read on: 1. The error message is generated by the xfinity server and not Thunderbird. I have already explained why you get the error message. 2. Once you see the error message then Xfinity has blocked all pop, imap and smtp access. So jumping around onto other devices to keep attempting is a total waste of time - your password will be rejected and it only tells me you still do not understand what 'server blocking access' actually means. 3. It is not Thunderbird who does not like the password. It is the server who does not like it and the reason has already been explained  - the server is blocking all pop imap and smtp access, so it's probably not the actual password. 4. The server will block all pop imap and smtp access for a set period of time once that error message has been generated. You are fortunate that Thunderbird has the ability to display error messages sent by the server. 5. It is blocking access because the server is getting too many attempts to logon from different apps and devices, so it thinks someone is trying to hack the account. That logon is attempts to get incoming mail or send. 6. The most common reason is usually, but not always, a phone which has a mail account set up to access emails and it has been set up to auto synch, so it is continually trying to access the server. It is important to make sure the auto sync has been switched off.  7. You need to check  all devices to see whether they have other apps/programs that been set up to access the comcast account. - but as you said ""Now my phone has begun receiving emails again.  No rhyme or reason."" -  <strong>Answer and reason&nbsp;:</strong>The server has released the temporary block on the account and because you have got the phone mail app set up to auto sync with your comcast account then it can suddenly get access server to download mail.  So now you know what is causing the problem. It is the app on the phone.  It is constantly making attempts to see what is on server and download it.  It's probably making these attempts every few minutes and it's doing it all the time. Most people have their phone switched on so people can phone them. Whether you are using it or not, if that phone is switched on then the app will keep pestering the server untill you switch off the auto synch meaning the app will only attempt to access the server. <strong>To fix </strong>: On phone - switch off the auto sync so it can only attmept to connect or and I would advise you do this - completely remove the comcast account from the phone mail app.  You have a laptop and a desktop which can use Thunderbird, so the phone is just not necessary in your case and it's causing the problem. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It cannot receive emails because the server has applied a temporary block to your account.  </p><p>As I've repeated stated. It's the server blocking the account - this issue has nothing to do with Thunderbird. You have a device constantly attempting to auto synch with server - that is what the error message is all about - and I would say it's your phone. It will keep working in the background trying to access server because you've probably got it set up on auto synch. As you are getting older then I would say you need to simplify things and start off by removing the mail account from your phone or find a good friend who can help you to disable the auto synch meaning it only works manually. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

They are all different so knowing exactly what web site has an issue is critical. </p><p>My first wild guess based on zero information from you is that you have cookies or JavaScript disabled in Firefox and you therefore get issues because both are required for the PayPal website.  Both of these things are enabled by default in Firefox and Thunderbird,  but there are still some wayward security products that routinely disable them.  There are also some folks who think they can surf the modern web without them and protect their privacy.  They almost always have issues and lodge complaints about things being broken. </p><p>Is there actually a question in here about Thunderbird the mail client software?  If there is I am not seeing it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I was under the impression that somehow previous messages could be viewed like in an email thread.  And I don't seem to get or see the notifications when I post a question so I was really glad to see your message in an email. </p><p>The question involving Thunderbird was that I was recently trying to donate to Thunderbird after seeing an email solicitation link. When I tried to use Paypal on Firefox,  I got error messages after Paypal recognized me.     This is the message: ""Paypal Something went wrong Please go back to MZLA Technologies Corporation and choose another way to pay. PayPal isn't available at this time."" </p><p>Today I tried to purchase something using Paypal while on Firefox and kept getting "" something went wrong...  return to merchant"" messages.     But I had no issue with Safari with the purchase or donation. </p><p>So its something with the Firefox settings.   I tried to add the merchant to the cookie and site exception list but maybe I didnt click Save Changes.... or designate Allow or Allow for Session.&nbsp;?? I went into Firefox settings and see the merchant has cookies listed.   So does <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> I don't know about Java....don't understand it or if I have it disabled.   And not that every single site has a conflict with Paypal.   I only use Safari if I cant use Firefox. </p><p>What I want to know is if I get another Paypal block while on Firefox, what setting do I need to change to allow the transaction to go through? </p>",wwwwoolf,false,0,0

Após um dia apresentando o comportamento descrito na descrição acima, o Thunderbird retomou o comportamento usual, sem problemas com a pasta Lixeira da conta Hotmail ou qualquer outra pasta em qualquer das 2 contas.
