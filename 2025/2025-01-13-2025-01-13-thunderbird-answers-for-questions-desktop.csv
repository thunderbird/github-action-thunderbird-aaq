I have the same email addresses hooked up on them. In addition, we have the same email addresses set up on 2 smartphones (in the outlook app and gmail).  At the moment it is the case that on computers when emails come in, they are marked as unread. The problem is then when the same emails come in on the smartphone, they immediately convert as read in Thunderbird, even though I haven't moved them at all on the smartphone. This applies to one email account. On another one it is so that in Thunderbird it is marked as unread all the time, but when I read it there, on the other computer in Thunderbird it is deselected and it is read, even though I have not opened it. Why is this happening? How to make all messages that fall into a particular Thubderbird to be marked as unread all the time, as long as we actually read them only in this particular program? I hope everything is understood </blockquote> <p>Hard to diagnose without knowing which accounts are POP or IMAP.  With IMAP, a message that is read or deleted on one device is marked as read or deleted on other devices - that is synchronization.  With POP, messages that are downloaded to one device without being deleted from the server, can be downloaded on other devices, but the actions on one device are not synchronized with other devices. </p><p>IMAP is almost always the best option for accounts on multiple devices, besides other advantages such as syncing all folders such as Sent, Junk, user-defined folders etc.  POP downloads the Inbox only. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
