I notice that not all Zendesk-Emails have those dark background maybe dependend on senders settings, then it's fine and I can write an answer. But a lot have. I started this issue because other clients like M$ Outlook or even Open-Xchange manage it to set a white background color when answering on those emails. Exactly this is the moment I'm so much disappointed from thunderbird (there're a lot of other annoying things...) although I'd like to have more open-source in the world and I like mozilla, I use for more than 20 years. </p><p>What would you do if you need to answer such an email from ticketing system with dark background? The only poor idea I have for thunderbird is to draw a new table cell at the top of the answering email, set a white background and start typing there. </p><p>Now I checked the source code of one of the emails and find: </p><p>&lt;style data=3D""cr/theme""&gt;=0D /*=0D $color-Main_background: #F1F5F7;=0D $color-Outer_text: #082137;=0D $color-Content_background: #FFFFFF;=0D $color-Text: #082137;=0D $color-Background_misc: #cccccc;=0D $color-Links: #1155CC;=0D $slider-Maximum_width: 800px;=0D =0D </p><p>Or even in other emails like Hermes parcel service: </p><pre>       &lt;style type=3D""text/css""&gt;            body {                background-color: #F3F3F3&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>Yes, maybe it's not easy to modify those css background-color - tags but other clients can do it.
