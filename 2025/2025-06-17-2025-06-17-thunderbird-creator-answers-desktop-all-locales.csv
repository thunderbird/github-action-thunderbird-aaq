When I receive appointments from Australia, the time should update to NZST if the appropriate info is in the ICS file.  However what is actually happenning is that Thunderbird is simply storing the appointment without converting the time zone, so a 2pm AEST appt becomes 2pm NZST not 4pm.   </p><p>I have checked the appointments contain the appropriate information - see attached screenshot from Thunderbird for an example, showing the appointment details for an appt sent a few days ago.  However when I accept this, the appt appears in my Calendar at 2pm.   </p><p>I have checked and reset the local time zone as Pacific/Auckland and tried setting in manually and restarting and tried converting back to automatic and restarting. I have searched the help base on Mozilla.  This suggests that Calendar SHOULD convert time zones so I am unsure why this not happening.   I have even asked Chat GPT for help, with no success&nbsp;:-) </p><p>I am an avid Thunderbird supporter and have been a donor for many years. My Australian work is becoming more and more important and this problem is now reaching a point where it is affecting my work.
