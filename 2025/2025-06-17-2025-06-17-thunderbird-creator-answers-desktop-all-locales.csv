I have contributed earlier and would continue to do so. But I do not wish to provide any credit card information for payment, but there are many other ways of paying thru UPI, Net banking, etc which do not ask for any credit card info. Please review your policy and make it convenient for your customers to make quick payments without asking for credit cartd info.

Upon checking with Microsoft, they indicated that the root cause seems to be related to the failure in properly updating the UIDL map and UIDL history.
