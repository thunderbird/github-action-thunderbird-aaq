Each of us has our own copy of Thunderbird 140.1.0esr (64-bit). For years, we have used a shared Email from Yahoo/ATT which used POP protocols. The Thunderbird app allowed us to make a setting which said ""Leave messages on server"" for some length of time. This allowed each of us to always get ""all the messages"" from the POP account into our Thunderbird Input box. I would delete those Emails which were for my wife and keep what mattered to me. When she would start-up Thunderbird, she would get the same original set of Emails, and proceed to delete those Emails that were for me, and keep what mattered to her.  Recently, due to being scammed a great deal, we decided to get a new Email account through Google. Since this account uses IMAP, our Thunderbird settings no longer allow us to ""Leave all messages on server."" So when I start-up Thunderbird, I get all the Emails from the server Input box. If I delete any of these Emails, then when my wife starts up Thunderbird later in the day, all the Emails I deleted are no longer on the server, and she never sees what she was interested in. I have not been able to find any settings at Google Mail or in Thunderbird that would give us the old POP capability of ""Leave messages on server.""
