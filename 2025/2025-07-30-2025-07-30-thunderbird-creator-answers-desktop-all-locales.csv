I've been doing that quite a lot for my friends and coworkers and never had a problem.  Right now im having an issue where thunderbird while using send to on a file through windows or through diferent app <strong>does not create a blank mail template with an attachment</strong>. Alredy tried: - fixing by running thunderbird installer from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> (did nothing) - setting up default sendto protocol up in windows to browser or thunderbird(did nothing) - in thunderbird settings its set as a default mail app (that usualy did the trick if i had problems with it) - disabling antivirus because maybe they are interfering (did nothing) To describe the issue more precisely: you use send to mail recipient and thunderbird pulls up, but without created blank template with attachment, i see just my inbox. Maybe i'm missing somthing thats why i decided to post, i hope sombody has an answer and i hope its just my fault and i dont have to reinstall the whole system again. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",sievie97
