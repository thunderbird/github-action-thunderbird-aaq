They get created in the account as used in the 'From' email address of email being composed. So, a 'Drafts' folder will appear when you are creating an email and choose to save as draft and a 'Sent' folder appears when you send from the account. If you have used an email address just to receive mail, but have never sent an email using that email address then the Pop account will not have those folders. </p><p>This is unusual..... In 'Local Folders' account: There is a folder which says Drafts on an account and also two Sent folders for different accounts. This is a bit odd so I'm wondering if at some point you tried to set your pop accounts as deferred accounts using a Global Inbox.

The one with 'Kay@' has an Inbox with 12267 emails - that's alot of emails to keep in one simple text document - that's a separate topic which maybe advise on later.

Click on Tools and then Account Settings. </p><p>Locate ""Outgoing Server (SMTP)"": In the left-hand pane of the ""Account Settings"" window, scroll down the list of accounts. At the very bottom, below all of your email accounts, you will see an entry called Outgoing Server (SMTP). Click on this. </p><p>Find and Edit Your Server: In the right-hand pane, you will now see a list of all the outgoing (SMTP) servers that have been set up in Thunderbird. Each of your accounts should have its own entry here. </p><p>Select the server you want to edit (e.g., the one for your Xfinity, Gmail, or AT&amp;T account). </p><p>Click the Edit button. </p><p>Verify the Settings: A new ""SMTP Server"" window will pop up. This is where you can confirm or change the settings for your outgoing mail. Double-check the following for each account: </p><p>The correct address for the outgoing server. </p><p>Xfinity: <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a>    Gmail: <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a>    AT&amp;T: <a href=""http://smtp.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.yahoo.com</a> (as you correctly noted, AT&amp;T email often uses Yahoo's servers) </p><p>The correct port number Xfinity: 587, Gmail: 465 or 587 (465 is for SSL/TLS, 587 is for STARTTLS), AT&amp;T: 465 or 587 </p><p>Connection Security: This should be set to SSL/TLS or STARTTLS depending on the port. </p><p>Authentication Method: This should be OAuth2 for modern accounts like Gmail or Normal password for most others. </p><p>User Name: Your full email address. </p><p>Save Changes: After making any necessary changes, click OK to save the new settings. Then, click OK again in the ""Account Settings"" window to close it. </p><p>Since you are receiving messages but not sending them, the problem is almost certainly with the outgoing SMTP server settings, but other factors could be at play. </p><p>You mentioned you use Norton 360. While you have the VPN turned off, your antivirus or firewall software might still be blocking Thunderbird's connection to the outgoing mail servers. Try temporarily disabling Norton 360's firewall or email scanning feature and see if you can send a message. If that works, you will need to add Thunderbird as a trusted application in Norton 360's settings. </p><p>For services like Gmail and AT&amp;T (which uses Yahoo), if you have Two-Factor Authentication enabled on your account, you cannot use your regular account password in Thunderbird. You need to generate a specific ""app password"" from your email provider's website. This unique, one-time password is what you will use for the password in Thunderbird's settings. You would need to do this for each account. </p><p>The error message ""Access Denied... <a href=""http://login.xfinity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.xfinity.com</a>"" strongly suggests an authentication problem. This means that while Thunderbird is connecting to the correct server, the server is denying your login attempt. This could be because of: </p><p>An incorrect password. </p><p>The need for an app password (if 2FA is on). </p><p>A server setting that is not correctly configured to accept your login credentials (e.g., incorrect authentication method selected in Thunderbird). </p><p>I hope this helps you get your emails sending again! </p>",norhorn,false,0,0
