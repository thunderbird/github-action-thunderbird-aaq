Close Thunderbird and go to your profile map. Delete or rename all these msf.files and also that json.files in that profile map there and restart the program again then to see there if the problem is gone and retained now. </p><p><br> Strong software that can interrupt thunderbird of having some normal process on that desktop screen of normally closing the program can be that problem there , software tools like cc cleaner or others can be those bully s so delete them for a while . You can use the profile manager to create that new profile if is needed there close thunderbird and open that profile manager it and click on create new profile there. To getting to the profile manager </p><p>Open windows go to the search option for system. Or press that window logo together with the letter r. Type thunderbird.exe -p </p><p>If that profile works correctly you can transfer that data into that profile now. </p><p><br> Greetings googlethunderbird. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

Perhaps that may be why I'm having such trouble with the profile in the brand new installation on the other computer. And I have different browsers on each machine, so I can't blame anything but Bird.   Do you have a site with the older versions on it to download? </p><pre>Is it possible to roll back the new version?

If the Gif is a remote image downloaded from a website you can block the website domain in your router and never see it again.

(this is a public forum and your  Sterrence name is attached to 54 support topics.  It is not as if the name goes anywhere but into the display name field in the default identity for the account.
