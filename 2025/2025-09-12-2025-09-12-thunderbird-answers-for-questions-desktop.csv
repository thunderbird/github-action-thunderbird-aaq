There is clearly an issue with the download for that account as those files should not be visible. Looks like the download record store file has been corrupted. But that's another issue. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:This account actually has a ""draft"" folder, unlike most of my other accounts in Thunderbird, which I also cannot figure out and no one has helped me with.</strong> </p><p>I checked your Profile and this is the only question you have asked - so not sure what you mean by 'no one as helped me with'.  I cannot see a question asking about it. </p><p>I'm assuming all those accounts are Pop mail accounts. </p><p><strong>General Info:</strong> In Pop accounts, folders get created when you use them. They get created in the account as used in the 'From' email address of email being composed. So, a 'Drafts' folder will appear when you are creating an email and choose to save as draft and a 'Sent' folder appears when you send from the account. If you have used an email address just to receive mail, but have never sent an email using that email address then the Pop account will not have those folders. </p><p>This is unusual..... In 'Local Folders' account: There is a folder which says Drafts on an account and also two Sent folders for different accounts. This is a bit odd so I'm wondering if at some point you tried to set your pop accounts as deferred accounts using a Global Inbox. Or whether you have got the 'Account SEttings' &gt; Copies &amp; Folders' for the account incorrectly set up. </p><p>You have two accounts with a very similar name Kay@ and Kei@ and identical part after the @. The one with 'Kay@' has an Inbox with 12267 emails - that's alot of emails to keep in one simple text document - that's a separate topic which maybe advise on later. But I notice there is a 'drafts - kay@etc' folder in 'Local Folders' Lets check this first: </p><p>For the '<strong>Kay</strong>@email address' account </p> <ul><li> Account SEttings  &gt; Server Settings </li><li> Click on 'Advanced' button located on the right side </li><li> Please make sure this set up to say 'Inbox for this account' </li><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul> <ul><li> Select 'Copies &amp; Folders ' </li></ul> <p>Check you have correct settings </p> <ul><li> Select 'Place a copy in' </li><li> Select 'Sent folder on' and choose correct account name 'Kay@correctdomain' </li></ul> <p>Now check Archives,  </p> <ul><li> Select 'Keep message archives in' </li><li> Select 'Archives folder on'  and choose correct account name 'Kay@correctdomain' </li></ul> <p>Drafts and Templates </p> <ul><li> Select 'Drafts folder on'  and choose correct account name 'Kay@correctdomain' </li><li> Select 'Templates folder on'  and choose correct account name 'Kay@correctdomain' </li></ul> <p>Then start to create a new message using From as the 'Kay@email address Just enter subject as Test and put some random text in compise then click on 'Save as Draft' </p><p>Does a Draft folder appear in that Kay@ account? Does it contain the draft test message&nbsp;? </p> <hr> <p><strong>re: the email you were composing which you say does not appear in the expected drafts folder</strong> Is it possible you were actualy composing using the wrong From email address&nbsp;? Look in Local Folders and select the 'Drafts -Kay@accountname' folder Is that draft saved in this location&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Thank you for your reply. Last time I asked a question was in a thread from someone else with the same problem. His was resolved, mine wasn't. I'm not very geeky so would appreciate input to keep things working!  The draft email I really wish I could retrieve right now was in address kei@super...  I've used Thunderbird for some 20 years. Migrated from laptop to laptop maybe 4 times. In 2020 I switched email provider in a big way, from Telus to Bluehost (under domain name super... ). So all the telus accounts on Thunderbird are not functioning anymore, just left there as archive for reference...is that a bad idea?? ""Popstate..."" items all to do telus accounts which I'm not concerned with.  The only functioning email accounts are the 4 super... and the compassionkey. All are IMAP except for Kei@super... on POP.  When I follow your instructions to click on ""Advanced..."" button. This is what I get(below two screenshots). Is the ""IMAP server directory"" supposed to be filled in? If yes, I have attached the Bluehost webmail list of settings, would you please tell me what to type in? </blockquote>",kei7,false,0,0
