I now have version 128.7.0esr. I have read other conversations here about this problem but they are WAY over my head, and seem to do with PCs. Can you help me restore my local folders with instructions I can hopefully understand? Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",kitty6

I've been unable to change text style back to the original setting of the email.   What I pasted will have ended in a footnote in superscript and I can't change the text style back to no specific text style or any other text style.   IIf i click on discontinue text styles (in Format menu)  if I try to continue typing email message it'll still be in superscript.  This has happened multiple times.   I can skip to the next line, doesn't matter, superscript will still be the text style, not the original text style of the email. </p><pre>How do I return the text style to the original settings? </pre>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",azure7

OS Name	Microsoft Windows 11 Home Version	10.0.22631 Build 22631 I use two monitors: Monitor 1 is physically straight in front of me, and Monitor 2 is to the left, so in Settings &gt; System &gt; Display the box on the right is numbered 1, and the box on the left is numbered 2.  </p><p>Since the latest TB update, each time I switch on the PC in the morning, TB (and FF) open on Monitor 2, even though I closed them down on Monitor 1 the previous night. This behaviour used to happen occasionally, now it seems to happen every time. Also, occasionally during the day, the TB Reminders window will jump to Monitor 2 while it's minimised. </p><p>I suppose the first question is - is this a TB/FF problem or a Windows problem? I'm thinking it must be a TB/FF problem, because this behaviour only seems to be happening with them. </p><p>Any suggestions would be welcome. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",bxcfilm
