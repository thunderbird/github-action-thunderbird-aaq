I now have version 128.7.0esr. I have read other conversations here about this problem but they are WAY over my head, and seem to do with PCs. Can you help me restore my local folders with instructions I can hopefully understand? Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",kitty6
