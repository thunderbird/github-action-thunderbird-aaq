Initially each account used its default Local Folders archive folder path (i.e. Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders &gt; Message Archives), I had selected the first option, 'Keep message archives in ""Archives"" folder on Local Folders'. For the archive options, I selected to retain the original email account folder structure and to organize archived messages by year. This all worked fine but it resulted in a combined group of archived messages without any obvious separation of emails by IMAP account. I prefer to have emails archived and grouped according to email account just like they are organized in the main Thunderbird email account and folder hierarchy. </p><p>I then noticed the Account Settings archive messages option to select ""Other"" where I could point the archive to a custom-named folder on Local Folders. Hence, I created three new Local Folders, named ""Archive-Gmail"", ""<a href=""http://Archive-Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Archive-Outlook.com</a>"" and ""Archive-Polarismail"", and then selected each of these ""Other"" archive local folders in their respective IMAP account's Archive settings. However, when I archived a bunch of emails from one of the folders in my Polarismail account, the emails got archived back into the default Thunderbird Local Folders &gt; Archives folder (which I had deleted, but it got recreated). That is, this new archive was stored under the folder tree ""Local Folders/Archives/&lt;foldername&gt;/&lt;year&gt;"". </p><p>Thinking that perhaps Thunderbird didn't like my use of the ""-"" for the archive folder name, I then tried renaming my Polarismail archive folder to ""ArchivePolarismail"" and then tried again to archive some emails from the Polarismail account. Again, the archive got placed in ""Local Folders/Archives/&lt;foldername&gt;/&lt;year&gt;"". </p><p>It seems that the ""Other"" option for creating a custom Local Folders archive folder and pointing the email account archive to it in the Settings doesn't work, at least not as I expect, in which case what function does this option serve? It appears that Thunderbird insists upon using/creating its archive folder with the ""Archives"" name, regardless of what parameters are set under the ""Other"" archive option. </p><p>I then briefly looked in the Thunderbird Config.editor settings and using the filter keyword ""archive"",  found the following group of ""archive"" settings. There appear to be a bunch of old or redundant Archive folder location records since there are several entries for ""mail.identity.id1.archive_folder"" all of which are set to mailbox://nobody@Local%20Folders/Archives. </p><p>I don't recall if/when I might have created and deleted archive locations within Account Settings, but the multiple entries (each with a different id#) containing the setting mailbox://nobody@Local%20Folders/Archives suggests that this is the case. </p><p>I'm wondering if the order in which the mail.identity.id1.archive_folder entries are listed determines whether Thunderbird uses that particular entry or not and if Thunderbird is using the first few entries of the mail.identity.id1.archive_folder parameter to decide where to archive emails? </p><p>In any case, since I don't know what all this Config information does or affects, I'm afraid to haphazardly go about deleting any of the seemingly redundant entries - I would have expected Thunderbird to manage that from its Account Settings menu. </p><p>extensions.quickfilters.assistant.exclude.archive	true	 mail.identity.default.archive_enabled	true

I need to enter updated password in it's permanent location in Thunderbird setup. When I search the internet, I can read that you must erase the existing password then manually enter the new password and apply it, but it is not available as the information indicated is not available on anywhere of my Thunderbird APP or on any of my Comcast email delivery screens. When I listen to instruction being spoken by Instructor on the internet, I can listen and see the instructor doing the steps. I use CC to better understand the instructor. I can see the instructor's screens that looks like what the Win11 Start Button brings up. When you press ALL on the upper right of my Start Screen, the screen is expanded, then you can search and find the Thunderbird entry. The instructor's screen also shows the APP to the right of Thunderbird, but my screen does not show that APP.  If I click the Thunderbird icon, it brings up my Comcast Email application with email messages on the screen then pops up a small box that indicates: ""Enter your password for your (my user name / email address)"" in a box that has a check box to remember this password (so it can be viewed for the next time, I guess), if I enter the correct password, the email APP will go active and load my new emails. There is not any way I have been able to make the new password active on startup. Please help. This is the way it has been working since installed - for 5 years plus, until just recently I changed password twice and have same results. Thank you, your help is much appreciated. Please let me know if you would like any additional information. Best Regards, Tom T. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",tsquared313
