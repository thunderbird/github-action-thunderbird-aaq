It would be nice if the ""Spam"" button became a ""not Spam"" button. </blockquote> <p>&gt; It would be nice if the ""Spam"" button became a ""not Spam"" button. It actually is. On a message sent to Spam, just click the Spam icon. That tells TB to unmark it as spam and moves the message back to your Inbox. </p>",siffemoz,false,0,0

First, check that cookies are accepted at settings&gt;privacy&amp;security Then, check that the account hub feature is NOT checked (see attached screenshot)  On setup screen, enter name and email address, and do NOT enter password  Setting up as an IMAP account will let you see everything on your PC. That will be a COPY of what is on the server. That is, the messages will physically be on the PC, but if you delete on PC, it's deleted also on server. If you delete from server, it's deleted on PC. IMAP keeps both in sync. IMAP is also preferred if you may access account from other devices, such as a phone. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

That means that you can download only those incoming messages still remaining on the server and that you would probably need a tool to import all mail files from the old Thunderbird profile to Local Folders in the Thunderbird profile on the new PC. </p><p>If Thunderbird is still running on your old PC I advise to move your actual ""Thunderbird"" folder on the new PC to another place such as the Desktop and replace it with the ""Thunderbird"" folder from the old PC. The application Thunderbird must be closed when you execute this procedure.  </p><p>If you want to keep your actual Thunderbird installation but have access to your old received, sent, archived.... etc messages, addresses, calendar events.... you would have to import all your mail files as well as address book and calendar files separately from the old to the new PC. This method would be more difficult and more time consuming... </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
