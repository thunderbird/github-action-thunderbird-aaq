But there is a subtle difference.  SPAM is unsolicited commercial email.  No such definition exists for Thunderbird use of Junk.  I think the ""idea"" dates to Netscape Communicator (which I loathed because it was so slow)  but it is not an issue worthy of a lengthy debate as popular culture basically uses the two words interchangeably. </p> <blockquote> Why do people use such unprofessional terms? It is Spam.  </blockquote> <p>Actually is is whatever the mail server designates the folder name to be in the context of IMAP.  I would direct you to <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1979511"" rel=""nofollow"">this bug </a>which is under development at the moment where some of the subtleties of the issue are covered.   My opinion is that everything that has been done to standardize the names used as your suggest has done nothing but complicate the issue.   Yahoo used the folder name ""bulk"" rather than junk or SPAM,  then used something else in their webmail just to really confise their users. </p> <blockquote> Even ""Folder"" is childish to someone who started with Dos 5.0 although it is sort of correct. </blockquote> <p>DOS used the term directory, something Thunderbird still uses in account settings for the location of the files for an account the ""Local Directory"".  OS/2 and MacOS used the term folder to describe the same thing.  This is also a context issue.  In the Unix world there is no drive C: as such mount points designate volumes and they are virtual.  We may feel that words used to describe something are ""wrong"" or ""childish""  but that does not make them incorrect.  I offer bug as a perfect example.  In it's original mainframe context it meant literal a creepy crawly (insect) that had got loose in the circuitry.  Now if an application does not work as someone expects,  they call it a bug.  Often when the application is functioning exactly as designed. </p> <blockquote> I just find it weird and confusing that there is no convention followed. </blockquote> <p>It is that you do not know the convention used,  not that there is not one. </p><p>Thunderbird allocates the special folder icons based on a number of criteria.  The most basic is history. When Thunderbird was first released,  most accounts were POP and Thunderbird was coded to use the terms and folder names of Junk, Trash among others for POP accounts.  IMAP introduced a complication as in that context the server gets to designate the folder names for ""special folders""   using the IMAP list command.  See <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6154.html#section-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6154.html#section-2</a> </p><p>So  you see you think this is a simple case of everyone standardizing on a term.  But what is the drafts folder actually called in say simplified Chinese or Romanian.  The system does not care, as long as the folder is flagged with the drafts flag.  This is a global community of users and standards and you might find the fact that you don't get to designate the icons to be odd.  but as they follow purpose,  you do have some control.  In a pop account is you create a new folder and then designate it to be used in account settings as the draft folder,  the icon will change on the user interface to reflect your change.  In the case if an IMAP account you may find a duplicate use of the icon as your account settings say the folder is one thing and the server days it is another, so both get marked, but the server will follow it's rules, not Thunderbird's.  So it will place spam mail into whatever folder it designates for SPAM. </p><p>So you saw a brief notification of a mail arriving.  Have you looked in the windows notification center for the full details of the notification? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
