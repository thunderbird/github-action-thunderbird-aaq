There is no benefit in periodically deleting older archives from the Thunderbird profile. I.e. it won't make Thunderbird running faster, and disk space is cheap. </p><p>What's highly recommended though is backing up your Thunderbird profile on a regular basis. And it certainly would make sense to store backups on an external device. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile</a> </p>",christ1,false,0,0

I just thought that by getting rid of old archives I could reduce the size of the profile and make Thunderbird generally more efficient. But from what you say, that seems not to be the case. So I won't bother. </p><p>Very helpful reply. Thanks again. </p><p>Mike </p>",MikeEdi,false,0,0

It was all working fine up until maybe a couple of days ago.  Ive checked and I'm on 140.4.0esr (64 bit) which was maybe installed around then.   </p><p>I do have the Signature Switch add on installed, but only use that occasionally.  If I turn it off completely, the problem still occurs.   It doesn't seem to matter what recipient address I use, I get the same result every time, as soon as the recipient address is entered, the signature disappears.  </p><p>If there is any extra info that I can offer that may help work out whats going on, let me know. </p><p>Cheers,  Bill </p>",Bill_S3,false,0,0

I just tried disabling the add-on again, and restarted TB, and the default signature behaviour seems to work OK.  I'll have a look and see how I can give feedback to the developer.   Hope this helps,  Cheers Bill </p>",Bill_S3,false,1,0
