DOZENS OF TIMES A DAY? </blockquote> <p>Lot of folks that refuse to sauthorise Thunderbird to access their mail etc but insist on setting up an account with them in account settings are probably in the same boat as you. </p> <blockquote> Mozilla Thunderbird Email wants to access your Google Account undefined my <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> account: This will allow Mozilla Thunderbird Email to:  More info: Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail Click for more information  More info: See, edit, download, and permanently delete your contacts Click for more information  More info: See, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar Click for more information  By clicking Allow, you allow this app and Google to use your information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. You can change this and other Account Permissions at any time. </blockquote> <p>So this is entirely normal and you must allow this if you actually want your google mail account to work ion Thunderbird.  If not remove the account from Thunderbird. </p> <blockquote> HOW CAN I DISALLOW Google to do anything with my account and contacts? </blockquote> <p>You are being asked to allow Thunderbird access to, I am guessing, your gmail account so it can download messages and refusing to allow that. I assume you initially added a gmail account to Thunderbird, otherwise it would not be trying to gain access.   </p><p>So instead of asking how to stop it,  either finish the job of setting up your gmail account by allowing the required access or remove the account from Thunderbird as you do not wish your mail managed for that account in Thunderbird.  Either will fix the request.  <strong> You do not get another choice.</strong> t is one of those two. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
