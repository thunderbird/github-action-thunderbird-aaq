When I tried to signed into the Donor Portal a month or so ago, I didn't have a new email address yet, so I (apparently) used my old gmail, to which I no longer have access.  i moved overseas and neglected updating gmail.  In any case, I can't log in to the Donor Portal to fix this.  I thought I already did get this straightened out several weeks ago, until yesterday, when my bank account showed a debit from Thunderbird.  I really appreciate your help, and if you have any further ideas, please let me know.   ronaxelsonygm@tuta.com </p>",ronaxelsonygm,false,0,0
