When I tried to signed into the Donor Portal a month or so ago, I didn't have a new email address yet, so I (apparently) used my old gmail, to which I no longer have access.  i moved overseas and neglected updating gmail.  In any case, I can't log in to the Donor Portal to fix this.  I thought I already did get this straightened out several weeks ago, until yesterday, when my bank account showed a debit from Thunderbird.  I really appreciate your help, and if you have any further ideas, please let me know.   ronaxelsonygm@tuta.com </p>",ronaxelsonygm,false,0,0

Many thanks in anticipation! </blockquote> <p>The files are created when the file is unavailable due to file contention,  Thunderbird just goes off and creates a new file and gives it a number in that circumstance.  Folk that more the location data is stored from the default %appdata% folder are those most likely to have issues as they tend to place exceedingly large file into the general documents storage so their antivirus spends half it's time rescanning the same 4 or 5gb file each time a single email is added to it or marked read. </p><p>Most likely cause is your antivirus scanning the folder the emails are stored in prevent that and see how you go. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
