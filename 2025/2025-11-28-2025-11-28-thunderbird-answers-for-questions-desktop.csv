Now when I display a message from my sent folder, it shows the ""short version of headers"" (as Toad-Hall describes it) and when I print the message these headers are printed.  That's good.  What confuses me though is that I didn't change any setting to produce this effect (other than to make the Menu Bar display by default).  And when I change it back to the way it was before (the Menu Bar is not displaying), and I click on a sent message, the short version of headers STILL displays.  This is good of course, but it makes no sense.  It's as if there was a bug that was preventing the short version of headers from displaying, and that the act of turning the display of the menu bar on fixed that. </p><p>I did try the other way you mention in your message, but there is no ""Customize"" option in my three meatball (aka hamburger) menu.

I had to manually configure all settings and close/restart the Thunderbird app.  It would not connect until I finally went back to the email list view, and suddenly it started to connect, after multiple close/restart of the app.  The setup wizard worked easily and beautifully setting up both iCloud (using app-specific password) and Yahoo email.   Thank you for your help. </p>",kurtjk,false,0,0
