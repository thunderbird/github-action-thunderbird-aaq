That may be due to a misconfiguration of the setup, or the provider may have different requirements for passwords when used from a PC (Gmail is an example of that.)

Some files could not be copied on the source machine. On the target, it would not allow me to ""remove"" the folders, so I tried to overwrite them. That also did not work. Now the target version of TB does not work at all. Fortunately, I cloned the SSD of that machine and am restoring it now.   I am giving up on this for now. </p><p>My current problem is that TB does not start up automatically when I turn the source PC on any more.    Not sure why. I added a shortcut to the Start folder. Thoughts please. </p>",hccsc005,false,0,0
