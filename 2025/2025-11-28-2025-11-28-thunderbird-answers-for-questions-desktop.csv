With my description of the problem (view/top of left column/folder name: inbox), you should be able to find the folder in question, which can set up and collect virtual folders. Suddenly, it's no longer working for me on one of my PCs. I add you 3 screenshots to show you the views: 1) shows how it should look but at my LG. Unfortunally it shows only the inbox but with no needed subfolders. 2) shows the view where I normally can choose the folders I want to collect  under 1). 3) shows the menu where I can define the folders which should be grouped in 1) (but this doesn't work!!!).

I am using a free personal version of outlook that is decades old. When creating the email connection account I have only been entering in my email address and password.  No other fields are exposed.  If however I go to “Manual Configure” I will then be able to set IMAP which it defaults to.  However there is an Error in the Host Name field.  It shows.  “ .outlook.com”   I have no idea what the server address should be or what other fields should be set to.  I have tried server addresses I have seen when googling around. But they have not worked. </p>,kurtjk,false,0,0

I had to manually configure all settings and close/restart the Thunderbird app.  It would not connect until I finally went back to the email list view, and suddenly it started to connect, after multiple close/restart of the app.  The setup wizard worked easily and beautifully setting up both iCloud (using app-specific password) and Yahoo email.
