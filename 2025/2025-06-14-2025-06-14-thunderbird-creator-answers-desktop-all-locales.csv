No emails were shown in the list, although the total number of emails in the folder appeared as usual above the list. </p><p>Thunderbird then downloaded over 100 emails, according to the status bar. These messages were previously present on the server, and were downloaded via POP3 with the option to delete on the server once downloaded selected. </p><p>Having closed Thunderbird and relaunched, the folder with all the existing emails appeared. However, there are no emails now on the server, this having been verified by logging in to webmail. </p><p>Where have the emails gone? </p><p>If they are indeed lost then why does Thunderbird proceed with downloading messages when a folder has not loaded? Why is downloading of messages not conditional on the folder having loaded?
