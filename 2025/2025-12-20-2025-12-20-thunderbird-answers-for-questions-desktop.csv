DO NOT reinstall unless you are prepared to lose data.  If the emails you did since the crash are unimportant, then a restore is easy. Do this:  - exit thunderbird if running - enter %appdata% into the search box on windows task bar and press enter - this should take you to the appdata\roaming folder  = paste the recovered appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder to overwrite the existing appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder - restart thunderbird and all should be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
