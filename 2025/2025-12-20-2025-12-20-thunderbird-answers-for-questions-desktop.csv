The message will be sent using the current sending address with the settings for the identity Eric Fries Guggenheim &lt;eric.friesguggenheim@orange.fr&gt;.

Sadly the original person gave the wrong outgoing server information causing me a day. The second tech gave me the correct outgoing server but then gave me a new WRONG incoming server!!.  As I was able to send emails but not receive I took it upon myself to try the original incoming server information, thankfully. Mybe this might help someone else. Kind regards WS new incoming server <a href=""http://pop.bellaliant.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.bellaliant.net</a> port 110 </p>",stepnoutnb,true,0,0
