Sadly the original person gave the wrong outgoing server information causing me a day. The second tech gave me the correct outgoing server but then gave me a new WRONG incoming server!!.  As I was able to send emails but not receive I took it upon myself to try the original incoming server information, thankfully. Mybe this might help someone else.
