It's been around for years and by now one would think it would be so 5 star cutting edge that no other client could possibly touch it. In my experience, not so. </p><p>I had TBird many years ago and then became an early adopter of cloud based email. I used the provider's interface. I now use three email providers and thought that going back to TBird would help me concatonate all of my accounts in one easy interface. While it has done that, why has it taken so long to configure? </p><p>i'm an expert user. I always configure my accounts manually with non-default ports, etc,... I know what I'm doing. It took me a few hours to figure out how to configure them all in TBird AND make them work. I should have been able to have all accounts setup and operational in 15 minutes or less. What I'm finding is that TBird functionality is not very intuitive. I've even had to resort to doing online searches to find out how to do things. That does not speak well for what should be a very mature product. It's not as if Mozilla does not have resources to develop a professional product. It seems that they let the product be developed and then forget about quality control and gaining user feedback with focus groups. if they did this, TBird would be known as very mature AND POLISHED! </p><p>Another area I'm having nothing but issues is the calendar. Like email it should be an easy process to connect Tbird's (app) calendar with an external calendar and have it operate two way. I've been trying to connect my TBird calendar with Apple calendar so that I can have a reliable calendar on my iPhone. I wouldn't have to do this if there was a TBird iOS calendar app.  The fact is that two weeks later and I'm still putzing around with it trying to make them talk to each other. The online help is virtually useless. There is a lot of old information. How do I know this? The instructions say to look for something and then that something is not in the current version of TBird. Then I have to go at it solo and try to figure it out. </p><p>Also, I find the TBird interface a little dated but more important not at all intuitive. Trying to do simple things like compose a new message takes time to figure out. Yes, I finally found the ""Ctrl N"" command, however, I am now so accustomed to graphics interfaces that I resist going back to Ctrl keyboard commands. I'm not new at this game, I've been around PC's since the original IBM PC that ran IBM-DOS so command lines and keyboard commands are nothing new to me. I simply don't want to use them any more. TBird forces me to do that. It's as if the developers are all stuck in the 80's-90's and don't really want to take this product into the 21st Century. </p><p>Don't get me wrong, it's a very good product from the back end, however, I have distaste for anything that forces me to change my workflow and that is what has happened. I don't mind making some changes, however, going back to TBird makes me feel as if I'm starting all over learning about email and calendars.  I'm a professional. At one time I enjoyed hacking and making things work the way I wanted. Those days are gone and now I need tools that work out of the box as I value my time.  </p><p>Tbird needs is a LOT OF SPIT AND POLISH for it to be regarded as a product that can be used easily by professionals, neopites and everyone in between. At this time, it doesn't hit that mark. </p>",thunderbird;undefined;,thunderbird,undefined,en-US,1750905;,jmrobinson

Unlike the virtual realms of games like Assassin’s Creed, where wanted posters can be torn down to ease tensions, resolving hostilities in Skull and Bones requires a more nuanced approach to <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Skull and Bones Items</a>. Here, we delve into the strategies and tactics essential for reducing hostility and restoring peace amidst the chaos of pirate-infested waters. </p><p>Understanding Hostility Dynamics </p><p>In Skull and Bones, hostility towards your vessel is represented by a meter prominently displayed in the upper-left corner of the screen. This meter serves as a visual indicator of your standing with various factions roaming the seas. When hostility is high, the risk of encountering hostile ships increases, leading to inevitable confrontations that can jeopardize your endeavors. </p><p>The Art of Evasion </p><p>When facing the wrath of a hostile faction, evasion becomes your most potent weapon. Unlike the swashbuckling escapades of yore, where confrontation was often the only option, Skull and Bones offers players the opportunity to slip away from danger unnoticed. By staying out of sight of enemy ships for a prolonged period, the hostility meter gradually decreases, signaling a return to neutral ground. </p><p>Strategic Retreats </p><p>One effective strategy for reducing hostility is strategic retreat. By leaving the territorial waters where a particular faction holds sway, you can effectively break the line of sight with hostile vessels and buy yourself precious time to regroup. For instance, if pursued by the formidable Ungwana along the Coast of Africa or the relentless French Companie Royale near the Red Isle, swiftly departing from their domain can alleviate immediate threats. </p><p>Diversions and Distractions </p><p>In the vast expanse of Skull and Bones' open world, opportunities for diversion are plentiful. Engage in activities that divert attention away from your vessel and allow hostility to dissipate naturally. Seek refuge in bustling outposts, where the presence of neutral or friendly factions offers sanctuary from pursuing adversaries. Engage in leisurely pursuits such as fishing or exploring uncharted territories, all while keeping a vigilant eye on the hostility meter as it steadily declines. </p><p>Leveraging Fast-Travel Systems </p><p>Harnessing the power of fast-travel systems can serve as a lifeline in dire situations. When faced with overwhelming hostility, swiftly navigate to distant regions of the map where hostile factions hold minimal influence. Utilize this window of respite to reevaluate your strategies, restock essential supplies, or embark on lucrative ventures far from the prying eyes of your adversaries. </p><p>Patience and Persistence </p><p>Reducing hostility in Skull and Bones demands patience and persistence. While the waters may seem turbulent and fraught with peril, maintaining a cool head and a steady course is paramount. Remember that hostility levels gradually decrease over time, allowing for a gradual return to amicable relations with previously antagonistic factions. </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>In the ever-shifting seas of Skull and Bones, the ability to navigate hostility with finesse is a skill coveted by seasoned pirates and aspiring captains alike. By mastering the art of evasion, strategic retreats, and leveraging the myriad distractions the open world offers, players can effectively reduce tensions and ensure smoother sailing on their maritime adventures to <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">buy skull and bones boosting</a>.

Players who would like a classic PvP fight are discovering new ways to <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Elden Ring Runes</a> fight back. The results are fun and shocking, but will they be enough to stem the tide of Elden Ring's latest exploit? </p><p>There are few things gamers enjoy more than not playing, but still being rewarded for it. AFK farms are very popular and Elden Ring, it turns out, is not exempt from. There are a lot of players who have been nabbed into PvP invasions where their opponents are MIA, and it's pissing them off. Many players are hopeful that developer FromSoftware will fix the flaw However, some players are making matters their own hands. </p><p>So how does Elden Ring's most recent AFK rune farm operate? The most well-known variant involves heading toward the First Step spawn where the game begins, and going towards another cliff. Then, by using their mount Torrent players are able to double jump to an even lower ledge. They then utilize Furlcalling Finger Remedy followed by Taunter's Tongue in order to lure enemies into their game. They also maintain their White Cipher Ring turned on to summon hunters to fight for their cause. In the end, most players either) quit because they are unable to find the AFK famer,) die trying to reach them from the edge of the cliff or) die by one of the allied hunters. </p><p>Another method of attack involves using Torrent to climb the highest building in the Site of Grace. Since mounts cannot be summoned until PvP battles begin which makes them unreachable by anyone else. For additional security, some AFK rune farmers also like to use the Mimic Veil in order to turn into an object that opponents cannot auto-target to secure. As one would expect, YouTube is already flush with videos called things like ""NEW 100 MILLION RUNE AFK FARM IN ELDEN RING!"" and propagators of this technique claim they've managed to produce more than a million runes per hour. Others suggest that the rate even at extremely high amounts, is around 100,000. But free runes is free runes, and every day more and more players are seeking to get theirs. </p><p>As the game is becoming more famous and more well-known, there are ways to combat it. In the Elden Ring Subreddit has been filling up with brief clips of players employing creative new strategies to kill those AFK farmers. One method is to leap off the cliff , and using the Agheel's Fire in mid-air in order to change into dragons to kill them while coming downwards. It's also possible to employ ballistas in order to throw them off the edge or kill them outright. It is also possible to use the Hand of Malenia katana has also been successful. Due to its long length and unique swinging animations players can utilize it to get to the ledge by themselves, without the need for Torrent. </p><p>As GamesRader points out the effect of these new strategies is that in some cases , it's actually the AFK farmers that are being used for farming. ""With my Dragon Breath strat and the physick , I'm keeping all the souls , and you don't need to be taking them out each when I die, after having killed the person who was hosting it,"" wrote one player on the subreddit. ""Have 50+ rune arcs just this morning from my assaults there are many people trying this exploit and you'll be able to fill your inventory with arcs , if you'd like."" </p><p>Others have begun thinking about thinking outside of the box. ""I've been doing AFK'ing with these guys,"" wrote another player on the subreddit for <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">best site to buy elden ring items</a>. ""I throw on a good movie or some humorous YouTube videos and wait till I feel the sound of my free Rune Arc.""

Combat Mechanics: </p><p>Engaging in combat can involve utilizing shields and weaponry. Remember that using a lasgun against a Holtzman shield can lead to explosive consequences. Master defensive maneuvers and don’t rush into battles unprepared. Engage enemies tactically to keep your shield intact. Overcoming Challenges: Social and Technical Issues Connection and Glitches: </p><p>As with many online experiences, players have reported issues such as high ping or glitches affecting resource storage. If things get too buggy, don’t hesitate to check community forums for solutions or workarounds. While some glitches may be resolved in future patches, keep backups of essential materials and be cautious when utilizing storage options. Community and Collaboration: </p><p>Consider joining a guild or forming alliances with other players to enhance your gameplay experience. Engaging with the community can provide valuable insights, resources, and support.

Many users face difficulty importing MDaemon to Gmail when their emails contain a large amount of data. I also recently migrated my MDaemon emails to Gmail. I find it difficult to perform this process manually.  So, I prefer the professional solution to migrate MDaemon to Gmail. Use the Yota MDaemon Backup Wizard to import MDaemon emails to Gmail.  This easy solution will allow you to export all the emails from MDaemon to Gmail in bulk with attachments. It will allow you to specify filter options according to your needs, like date ranges, keywords, or file size. You can also try the free version before making the full commitment. This tool is easily compatible with all Windows operations, such as Windows OS, including the latest version, Windows 11. </p><p><strong>Simple Steps to Import MDaemon to Gmail are as follows:</strong> </p> <ol><li> Download and install the MDaemon Backup tool on your PC. </li><li> Go to the Open &gt;&gt; Email Server &gt;&gt; MDaemon Files. </li><li> Next, go to the Export option and select Gmail to import MDaemon to Gmail </li><li> Then, enter Gmail login details and hit the Save button. </li></ol> <p>That's all!  I personally preferred this solution. There is also a manual solution available to import MDaemon to Gmail, but the manual process is time-consuming and lengthy. You have required some technical knowledge to use the manual configuration. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lilyw7853

I clipped a portion of the html from one of these emails (attached) and you can see from the ""font-size"" values why the size is so large with values like ""8889%"" versus ""18px"".

The emails (sent and received) span 30 years. They originated from 20 different, separate email accounts (including several DIFFERENT email accounts in each of <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a>, <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.com</a>, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, etc.). Each email from each different email account was synced from each email account’s online webserver with the Outlook email client of Microsoft Office's Outlook desktop app. Each email from each different email account was then MOVED from the Microsoft Office's Outlook INBOX of each different email account into FOLDERS (each organized by category and/or subject matter) corresponding to the category and/or subject matter of each email from all the different email accounts. </p><p>Person1's current modus operandi has been to save ODF1 on 2-3 external hard drives in order to (i) safeguard the integrity and posterity of all 20GB of emails and (ii) facilitate transitioning from a previous OLD computer to a future NEW computer. </p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft has made the latter process onerous and expensive by transitioning from (a) the Home Use Program (HUP), which supplied “permanent” software (e.g., perpetual license for Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016), which was sold to member-employees for $10 and had updates for at least 10 years (effective user cost ca. $1 per year over 10 years), to (b) the Workplace Discount Program (WDP) which merely provides a 30% discount off the $100/year Microsoft 365 Personal subscription each year (effective user cost ca. $70 per year) ==&gt; WDP effectively costs 70x what HUP used to cost each user. </p><p>Consequently, person1 wants to abandon Microsoft products altogether (especially since person1 uses only Word and Outlook) and find an alternative way to use ODF1 substantially and substantively the same way as person1 currently uses Microsoft Office's Outlook FOLDERS to save all the emails from all the various email accounts. </p><p>For example, Google Docs is more than adequate to replace Microsoft Word for Person1’s use. But person1 has not yet found an alternative for how person1 currently uses Microsoft Office's Outlook FOLDERS to save all the emails from all the various email accounts. </p><p>QUESTION:  Will Thunderbird enable person1 to continue to use ODF1 substantially and substantively the same way as person1 currently uses Microsoft Office's Outlook FOLDERS to save (and transfer) all the emails from all the various email accounts, BUT WITHOUT using any version of Microsoft Office nor Microsoft 365 Personal? </p><p>If NOT, why not? </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1750907;1750923;1750929;,yitzmitz
