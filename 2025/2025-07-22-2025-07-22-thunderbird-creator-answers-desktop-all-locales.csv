Her email address must have gotten on somebody's bad list because this just started happening after years of relatively little spam. It comes in huge bursts. </p><p>We had turned to Thunderbird because it was supposed to be good at isolating spam. But no matter what I do, it won't move ANY spam to the Junk or Bulk folders. Yahoo uses Bulk so I told Thunderbird to use that folder. I also told it to use SpamAssassin. It is EXCELLENT at marking all these emails with the little symbol for SpamAssassin, but it doesn't automatically move them. And there's no rule system that can move them. I've tried it at the local level, account level, every possible setting, and the old ones stay in the Inbox and the new ones go directly to the Inbox. I've even turned off antivirus to see if that was interferring. </p><p>I really don't want to give up Thunderbird, but this isn't working and it's the reason we came to Thunderbird. Can anyone shed some light on this? </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",keith77

Today wh attempting open inbox, a window popped up from ""the Mssaging Co"" asking me to renew my subscription for their service.  I have previously cancelled and much prefer Thunderbird.  The program opens but can't enter the inbox. How can I prevent this happening? I'v tried deleting Tbird and re installing  but no good.  I can't open Messaging co because they say they don't recognise my name and/or password. I want nothing to do with them but they seem to be able to prevent me from going about my life.  I would like some help and advice. Thanks in anticipation. Michael </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;needsinfo;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1750738;,michaelfarrow
