Gmail recommended <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78892"" rel=""nofollow"">settings for Thunderbird</a> do even (incorrectly) tell users to <i>not</i> move deleted messages to Bin/Trash and just mark them as deleted instead. And they say the following for mail clients in general: </p> <blockquote>Don't change your IMAP settings to save deleted messages in the Trash. When you do this, any messages you delete from your email client will get permanently deleted from Gmail in 30 days.</blockquote> <p>So they tell users to configure the mail client so that deleting a message there does <i>not</i> work the same as deleting the message in webmail, and the reason is… that if the user does otherwise the message will get permanently deleted after 30 days, just like it would if it was deleted in webmail… This is absurd, but is what Gmail recommends, so many users may do that not really understanding why. </p><p>Second, we were talking about removing messages from <i>All Mail</i>, remember? Not from some other folder. So even if you do correctly set up the mail client to move deleted messages to the Trash, they will still remain in <i>All Mail</i> for 30 days, so the fact remains that you cannot accomplish what you wanted when you tried to delete the messages (i.e. remove them from <i>All Mail</i>) until 30 days later. And that's assuming you don't make the mistake of configuring the mail client so messages get permanently deleted from Trash before the 30 days that it takes for Gmail to do it, because if you do that what will probably happen (haven't checked, but is what I would expect knowing how Gmail works) is that the Trash label will be removed from the messages and hence never be deleted from the server… </p><p>Now, IF you configure the mail client properly (i.e. <i>not</i> following Gmail recommendations) AND don't subscribe to <i>All Mail</i> AND don't really care that you cannot make messages to be removed from the server until 30 days later AND make sure you always do copy+delete instead of just moving, THEN you may find that Gmail works as expected, but that's because you've adapted your expectations to the way Gmail works, not a matter of semantics… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

This is mostly Thunderbird's fault, not yours, in that when you setup a new account, Thunderbird <i>reuses</i> existing outgoing server settings that may already exist as a result of having previously created another account for the same server (but different username / email address), without telling you those settings are being shared across multiple accounts nor giving you the option to create new separate outgoing server settings specific for this account during the account setup process. </p><p>Thunderbird lets you create and manage multiple outgoing server settings for the same server, though, just not from within the main account settings. You have to do that from a separate <b>Outgoing Server (SMTP)</b> settings pane you may open by selecting the corresponding option at the bottom of the list of accounts in Account Settings. The following article has a screenshot that illustrates what I'm talking about: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages</a> </p><p>You can add there as many settings for the same outgoing server as you need, with each entry having its own username, and then assign the right outgoing server settings to each account in the main account settings. </p><p>This can be confusing and threads discussing this issue tend to be a bit messy. Let's see if we can make a shorter and clearer one this time…&nbsp;:) </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
