(Norton sell a product that can almost be expected to cripple the Thunderbird setup wizard a state of affairs they have apparently been happy with for around a decade and several corporate reinventions of the parent company) </li><li> Do you have an VPN? These also offer extreme issues with setting up a mail account.  Many providers simply block attempts to set up an account while using them as it appears to them you have been hacked.  Your phone is in say Islamabad and you VPN says you are in Anchorage.
