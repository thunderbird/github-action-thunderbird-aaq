Thunderbird will take care of upzipping it and placing it in the proper place.

Yes I'd seen that large files should be handled manually, but I'd assumed that if it were too large, it would throw an error message of some kind at the time.  It went fairly quickly until it got to about 50%, then more slowly to 53%, 57%, hung around for a while to 59%, seemed to stay there a while, then all of a sudden was at 99% and finish.  It seemed odd but I had backed it up yesterday (thinking I had the latest download but I didn't, so I cleared that one and backed it up again after updating) and it acted the same way both times.  My initial reaction was to use import thinking if it knew to zip the b/u, it should know to unzip the import.  It did mention that the size was at or near the limit, so perhaps I missed that fact.  I've pretty much spent my quota of time at the keyboard for  today (very bad neck), but if it won't impose on you too much, I would appreciate your instructions for doing it manually.  I'll take another flash drive and try anew tomorrow. My old machine is still in tact and will be so for awhile.  It IS an eclipse today, and while the effects of it  will last for a few months, perhaps today wasn't such a great day to try this.  Thank you Lin, I appreciate it.

I'm using Windows 11, McAfee antivirus, and the newest TB dld is Eclipse. &gt;/blockquote&gt; Uninstall McAfee and see if things get better.  There is a host of manual things you have to do to make McAfee work with Thunderbird.  Back in 2012 they released a new heuristics engine (Just a short time after Intel bought the company from it's founder John McAfee.  In my opinion that was the beginning of the end for McAfee.  They have been crashing Thunderbird, blocking mail and generally not doing a good job of allowing folk to use their mail client ever since.   There is no distinct alphanumeric error message for the oldest problem, just the usual ""Login to server with username failed. Retry/Enter New Password/Cancel."" All passwords are correct. None of my passwords are ""saved"" in the TB program, and I'm having trouble locating where to tell it to do otherwise.  Screencap and copy/paste attempts to grab second error message failed, but it looked like ""RETR failed, one message expunged."" So far, it's a one-time error, which I can live with.

You are not ""just a login to retrieve my gmail""  Gmail uses the oauth authentication method,  this method requires a browser to set up and provide the initial authentication as well as cookies. oAuth is at it's heart a browser specific authentication method which Thunderbird was able to meet by leveraging the inherited parts of the Firefox browser from the Mozilla platform on which it is built.  </p><p>See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache</a> for clearing the cache in Firefox. </p><p>In Thunderbird go to the appmenu, select help and then the troubleshooting information.

I mentioned the oauth authentication requirements for gmail.
