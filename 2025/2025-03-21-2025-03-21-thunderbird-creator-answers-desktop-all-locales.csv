It normally takes the lower third of the screen.  Any ideas on getting it back? Expanding mail to almost full screen just to see if you want to keep it seems counterproductive. It was working fine at Noon.  It was about 5 PM PDT when I next went to Thunderbird, it updated and hasn't worked right since!

In Thunderbird, the junk mail folder - which AOL call ""Bulk Mail"" for some reason - has moved to the Trash folder and I can't get it out. It's a Thunderbird problem - if I go onto my account at <a href=""http://AOL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">AOL.com</a>, everything is normal. How do I get it out? I've tried cutting and pasting it, creating a new folder...nothing seems to work.

Within Thunderbird, the message and invitation arrive just fine: you can read everything when the email arrives in the normal message area. However, when I send the invitation to clients using Outlook, they only see an empty email with the option to accept the invitation (or not). Once they accept, the email disappears from their inbox (which is probably a different problem). More importantly, when they open the appointment in their calendar, they have to click on an attachment before they see the description (i.e. the link to an online meeting). </p><p>It seems that the invitation sent by Thunderbird is not fully integrated. </p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?
