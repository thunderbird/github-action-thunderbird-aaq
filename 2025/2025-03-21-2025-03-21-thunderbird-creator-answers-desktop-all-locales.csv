It normally takes the lower third of the screen.  Any ideas on getting it back? Expanding mail to almost full screen just to see if you want to keep it seems counterproductive. It was working fine at Noon.  It was about 5 PM PDT when I next went to Thunderbird, it updated and hasn't worked right since!
