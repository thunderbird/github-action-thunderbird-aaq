To elaborate, I had moved from Eudora email app to TB some time ago, but thought it was wise to keep the Eudora emails handy. Since I stored my TB archive locally on my PC, I figured to do the same with whatever TB could make out of my Eudora files (though I never actually tried to retrieve any of them.)
