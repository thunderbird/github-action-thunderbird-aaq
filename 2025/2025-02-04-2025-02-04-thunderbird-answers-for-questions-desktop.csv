Eine andere Möglichkeit wäre, das zuletzt benutzte Profil (bzw. den Profilordner) vom alten PC zu kopieren, auf dem neuen PC im Verzeichnis .thunderbird einzufügen und dann mittels des Profil-Managers neu einzubinden. Wenn dein Screenshot die neue Installation anzeigt, dann fällt auf, dass sie vier verschiedene Profile enthält. Es ist völlig unklar, welches das aktuelle Profil ist. Falls du nur die Profilordner vom alten auf den neuen PC übertragen hast, dann kann das nicht funktionieren, denn TB befragt beim Start die profiles.ini Datei um zu wissen, welches Profil zu öffnen ist.
