The only sqlite files of substance would be the abook.sqlite and history.sqlite if you had used Thunderbird to store contacts. In that case, look for the largest ones.  Thunderbird just uses one profile, and if you succeed in getting all message folders together, you will have success. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Eudora would compress in-content photos to save space and transmission time. </blockquote> <p>Eudora is from a time when bandwidth was scarce and folk like me hated getting mailing list entries from those in the USA where huge signature graphics were popular and all you could eat data limits were applied.  Now I don't think there are many that actually know what bandwidth is, let alone care about the size of their emails,  or they would trim the fat when they reply. </p> <blockquote> If T-Bird performs a similar action, is that compressed file saved somewhere? </blockquote> <p>Attachments, and embedded graphics are attachments just hidden ones are and always have been since email has had attachments, transmitted as MIME encoded text.  Attachments on the whole grow around 30% by virtue of the mime encoding process.

They are not. They are a part of the body text of the email that is defined as an attachment.  </p><p>This addon I think does the resizing of images you talked of. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/inline-image-resizer/?src=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/inline-image-resizer/?src=search</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
