Thunderbird è un software gratuito sviluppato da un piccolo gruppo di persone e supportato da utenti volontari. Non dispone quindi di risorse per offrire un supporto tecnico. Questo è solo un forum per gli utenti. </p><p>Per quanto riguarda il tuo problema, con Aruba ci sono stati casi simili (fai un ricerca nel forum) e per quanto ricordi non si era trovata una soluzione. </p>",@next,false,1,0

Could this be another scam? </blockquote> <p>Since they were calling you, this should already ring all the alarm bells. So yes, I think it was unwise to let them onto your computer, and most likely that was another scam. </p> <blockquote> The Web Services person also sold me an anti-hacking firewall, which is supposed to also provide network security. </blockquote> <p>Windows has a built-in firewall, and, along with Windows Defender as anti-virus software, that's all you need. So I'd remove whatever software was installed by ""The Web Services"" person. </p> <blockquote> I have been dealing with the problem of the requirement to sign in to Thunderbird using Google. </blockquote> <p>You do not login to Thunderbird. You do use Thunderbird to login to Google's Gmail server. </p> <blockquote> I enter my e-mail address, click next, and get a second window that says ""Error 400"". </blockquote> <p>Please post a screenshot of the error message. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem</a> </p><p>Also, please post your Troubleshooting Information.

So I had to install the AOL account again in Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>If 'install again' means you deleted the existing account in Thunderbird, and then re-created it, then this was completely unnecessary. </p> <blockquote> I created an app password in AOL and put it in Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>AOL uses OAuth2 authentication. With that you don't need an app password. You'll have to use your main AOL account password. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
