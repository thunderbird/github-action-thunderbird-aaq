The problem is most likely in your Thunderbird profile. All your data such as messages, passwords and user preferences, and changes made while you use Thunderbird, are stored in a special folder called a profile. Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there.

How would a technician working on my computer be able to determine that, and fix it?  I see there is a Wizard for creating a new profile.  If he uses the Wizard to create a back-up profile, will the back-up profile have the same problems as the Profile that is now stored on T-bird? </p><p>It is my understanding that there must be a back-up profile created in order to ensure that all the local folders will be preserved, when T-bird is removed to a different computer, and then a new, fresh version of T-bird is installed on the new computer.  After that, the files could be returned from the external  computer back to my computer.  Does the back-up-profile have to be removed from the computer with the T-bird files when the corrupted version of T-bird is removed, and then moved back when the T-bird files are put back onto my computer into the newly installed version of Thunderbird?  Can a profile be moved from one computer to another?  I will look forward to getting more of an explanation.  Thank you very much. </p>",cyanicka46,false,0,0

You would have to look at the source of the email to really get a handle on the cause, but historically I have seen issues particularly with certain European language senders like German that still enforce the German windows code page in their emails.  I have also seen it coming from ancient mail clients using poorly supported things like ansi code pages and fonts.  Think Eudora and very old Outlook versions.  Some folk can still get them working but the stuff they send is not very friendly to modern standards of unicode email. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
