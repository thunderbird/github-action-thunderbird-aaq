I can use emails on my phone via mobile data with wifi turned off (different email client on the phone, though). Optus checked all the settings on my PC with me and they are all correct. They insist that it is a Thunderbird issue (doubtful, IMHO) and that I contact you. Is there an issue with Thunderbird connecting with Optus email? If so. is there any resolution to the issue? If not, can you confirm no problem from your end so I can get back to them (again!) </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1785022;,grahaman

Got an Unable to Load Profile type of message. And my attempts at a fix seem to just send me further down a rabbit hole.  I started out by renaming my profile.ini file, but I really didn't know what the heck I was doing and possibly caused more harm than good. Then I tried to find my profile file/folder itself, using the Thunderbird &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Profile Folder path and doing an import from inside TBird but that ended up with various problems such as drilling down to the profile folder from within TBird but then when I clicked Select Folder in Thunderbird, that didn't trigger any sort of import. </p><p>I also spent a good deal of time trying to find my AppData folder, finally being able to view it (a hidden folder, apparently), and saw several recently-dated profile types of folders, but again, I couldn't manage to ""hook up"" any of those folder/files from starting inside TBird and selecting Import... I ended up just stuck inside a folder, not triggering any Importing activity. </p><p>Finally I found a profile folder at a higher level on my PC than inside that long AppData Roaming Thunderbird path.  THIS profile was inside: D:\DOCS\Thunderbird\Profiles </p><p>Now THAT folder I managed to get an Import to trigger. But the result was an Error Message telling me to go find my Error Console.  Can you please see the attached and tell me there's hope that this was at least the right file but just poor results that I can fix somehow??? </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",alysenet1
