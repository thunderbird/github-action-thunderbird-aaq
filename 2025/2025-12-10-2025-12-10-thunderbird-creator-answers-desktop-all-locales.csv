Got an Unable to Load Profile type of message. And my attempts at a fix seem to just send me further down a rabbit hole.  I started out by renaming my profile.ini file, but I really didn't know what the heck I was doing and possibly caused more harm than good. Then I tried to find my profile file/folder itself, using the Thunderbird &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Profile Folder path and doing an import from inside TBird but that ended up with various problems such as drilling down to the profile folder from within TBird but then when I clicked Select Folder in Thunderbird, that didn't trigger any sort of import. </p><p>I also spent a good deal of time trying to find my AppData folder, finally being able to view it (a hidden folder, apparently), and saw several recently-dated profile types of folders, but again, I couldn't manage to ""hook up"" any of those folder/files from starting inside TBird and selecting Import... I ended up just stuck inside a folder, not triggering any Importing activity. </p><p>Finally I found a profile folder (5yed...) at a higher level on my PC than inside that long AppData Roaming Thunderbird path.  THIS profile was inside: D:\DOCS\Thunderbird\Profiles </p><p>Now THAT folder I managed to get an Import to trigger. But the result was an Error Message telling me to go find my Error Console.  Can you please see the attached Error Code display screengrab and tell me there's hope that this was at least the right file but just poor results that I can fix somehow??? </p><p>The following is my copy/paste of the text I see in the Error Console display that's in my screengrab after trying to import the above 5yed... profile, in case it helps you see it better: </p><p>1765349209272	addons.xpi	WARN	Checking C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\distribution\extensions for addons WebGL context was lost. 2 Troubleshoot.sys.mjs:727:17 Content-Security-Policy: This site (<a href=""https://www.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org</a>) has a Report-Only policy without a report-uri directive nor a report-to directive.

Then it just sits there and doesn’t show any new emails, just kind of frozen.  She can send emails but not receive them.. Previously another friend had downloaded BT software to act as an alternate to access her @btinternet.com emails…. Strangely she hadn’t received any emails for a few days…. I found that her emails were being auto forwarded to an unknown email.  I disabled that and her emails arrived and were visible on the BT site.   I downloaded the thunderbird app to her mobile and attempted to set her account up , with no luck. </p><p>Any suggestions.

Then I noticed two problems. I couldn't open new emails. It said connecting to server or loading content but email was blank. Also when I sent an email it could not copy to my sent folder due to network or file access errors. I could open and read all the other emails in my Inbox, just not three new ones. So I selected Inbox properties and repair. After the repair, my inbox is completely empty. It had thousands of messages. When I do a search for common emails I know were in my inbox, it only shows emails from subfolders. When I go to Inbox properties, it says number of messages: 0 </p><p>Is there any chance I could talk with someone? Or that someone would call me? I'm not experienced in Thunderbird or email settings.
