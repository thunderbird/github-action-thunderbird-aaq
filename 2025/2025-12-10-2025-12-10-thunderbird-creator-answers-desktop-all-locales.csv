I can use emails on my phone via mobile data with wifi turned off (different email client on the phone, though). Optus checked all the settings on my PC with me and they are all correct. They insist that it is a Thunderbird issue (doubtful, IMHO) and that I contact you. Is there an issue with Thunderbird connecting with Optus email? If so. is there any resolution to the issue? If not, can you confirm no problem from your end so I can get back to them (again!) </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1785022;,grahaman
