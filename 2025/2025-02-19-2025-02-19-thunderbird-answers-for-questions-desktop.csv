You can only set up/modify a password for the account via the organisations webmail account. Never tell anyone the password. </p><p>So do not post anything about the password in this or any forum, but you need to confirm the following: Can you logon to the webmail account via a browser?

If the email has a return receipt you will be prompted to send it just the same as if the email was read in it's own tab or windows.

If you tell Thunderbird to delete an IMAP folder, it will try to do with the folder the same it would with a message, according to your account settings, i.e. move it to the account <i>Bin/Trash</i> if that's what you've told it to do with messages. The server may not allow that for some reason, but Thunderbird will definitely try to do that if you've configured it that way. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Both the 'source' and 'destination' mail accounts are in my Thunderbird mail client on Linux.   The problem is that it appears that 'moving' messages from source to destination does not move messages but copies them.  The message count in the source account (the Yahoo mail account) does not decrease.  That is, I do the following: 1.   Move some messages  2.  Observe the message count decrease 3.  Close Thunderbird  4.  Re-open Thunderbird 5.  Observe that the message count in the Yahoo account is the original number (not decreased by the number of messages I 'moved') </p><p>So now I _might_ have a lot of duplicates in the destination (Outlook) account.

I know I could do this from macOS, but I no longer have a mac. </p><p>I'll try what you suggested.

There are only a few things I know for sure: 1. All this started when the Thunderbird update caused me to loose my address book and my Local Folders. I searched for sqlite files and restored SOME/MOST of my address book, but not all. I have been unable to find the Local Files. 2. A number of years ago (how many?? a lot.) my email provider (<a href=""http://ca.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ca.rr.com</a>) went away and I had to move to <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>. There were three different email logons (cbournes, shakjazzdeb, and craigtb) but I have nothing to know what the passwords were for them. 3. I am getting non-stop popups asking for a password for each of the logons. Nothing that I've tried has caused any change in the problem. </p><p>You suggested going into Safe Mode, which I did, and while in that mode, I did not see any of the popups, but now, back in normal mode, I have them occurring again. </p>",cbournes222,false,0,0
