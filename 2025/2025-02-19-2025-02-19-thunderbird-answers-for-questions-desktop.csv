If the email has a return receipt you will be prompted to send it just the same as if the email was read in it's own tab or windows.

If you tell Thunderbird to delete an IMAP folder, it will try to do with the folder the same it would with a message, according to your account settings, i.e. move it to the account <i>Bin/Trash</i> if that's what you've told it to do with messages. The server may not allow that for some reason, but Thunderbird will definitely try to do that if you've configured it that way. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Both the 'source' and 'destination' mail accounts are in my Thunderbird mail client on Linux.   The problem is that it appears that 'moving' messages from source to destination does not move messages but copies them.  The message count in the source account (the Yahoo mail account) does not decrease.  That is, I do the following: 1.   Move some messages  2.  Observe the message count decrease 3.  Close Thunderbird  4.  Re-open Thunderbird 5.  Observe that the message count in the Yahoo account is the original number (not decreased by the number of messages I 'moved') </p><p>So now I _might_ have a lot of duplicates in the destination (Outlook) account.

I know I could do this from macOS, but I no longer have a mac. </p><p>I'll try what you suggested.

The imap account is a working inbox where I read, and retain for a time, tagged messages that need action. Finalized messages are dragged and dropped to the pop account where they keep their tags. For some reason, possibly something in settings or some careless keystroke, tbird moves 95% of the messages in the imap account to the pop account - moved messages loose their tags. This is a big ACK to recover from. Is there a way to recover from it, and f this isn't a bug, how can I prevent it? Thank you. </p>",RodMiller,false,0,0
