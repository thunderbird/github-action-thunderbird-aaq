So my main problem now is i only have 26 emails.  Not the thousands that I used to have complete with folders.  Is there anyway to recover them&nbsp;???

Make sure you choose the right account first and don't delete the wrong account by mistake. </p><p>You'll be given the option to delete only the <i>account info</i> (settings) or also the <i>message data</i>. Choosing <i>message data</i> will only delete mail and folders stored <i>locally on your computer</i> (within your profile folder), not anything stored on the server. Mail <i>on the server</i> will remain there after removing the account from Thunderbird regardless of whether you choose the option to remove <i>message data</i>.
