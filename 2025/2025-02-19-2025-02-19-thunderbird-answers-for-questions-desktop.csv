If you tell Thunderbird to delete an IMAP folder, it will try to do with the folder the same it would with a message, according to your account settings, i.e. move it to the account <i>Bin/Trash</i> if that's what you've told it to do with messages. The server may not allow that for some reason, but Thunderbird will definitely try to do that if you've configured it that way. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
