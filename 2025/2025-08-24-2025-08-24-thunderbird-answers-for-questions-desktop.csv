My Outlook account is configured as passwordless, meaning I typically sign in via Microsoft Authenticator, biometrics, or a security key. I have already tried deleting and recreating my Thunderbird profile, but the issue persists. Since this is my first time adding this Outlook account, there is no existing outgoing server (SMTP) entry for Outlook in Thunderbird’s list. I attempted to manually configure the SMTP server (<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>, port 587, oauth2), but the same password prompt appears, and I cannot proceed. </p>",cepvor,false,0,0

As oauth is the default for office265 and <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>  perhaps you are using some other domain for you email address.  Oauth is only offered where the server names are detected to be those of office365  so if you are using a hosted domain I would guess that the setup will not correctly identify the hosting server type and the result will be a request for a password. </p><p>Is this with the account hub thingy or an existing account in Thunderbird?  You might have to go the manual route is you are in the account hub and create a non working account.  Correct the server names and then close and reopen the server settings so the authentication types are refreshed and finally get your oauth authentication setup. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
