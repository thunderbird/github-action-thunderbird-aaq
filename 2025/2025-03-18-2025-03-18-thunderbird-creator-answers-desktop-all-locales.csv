I am developing an application for an organization that uses Thunderbird in a Windows environment. Among other features, it is necessary to implement the transfer of mail client settings from one workstation to another. Built-in Mozilla Thunderbird tools are not suitable. I am still considering implementation options (autoconfig or direct work with files), and I have several questions. I will be very grateful for any help. 1. What is the minimum required files in the appdata folder that I need to create (transfer) so that the profile works without errors on the new workstation? No need to transfer messages, they are all on the server, and offline work is not used 2. How does the installs.ini file work? I need to avoid creating a new profile when starting Thunderbird for the first time, do I need to create an entry in installs.ini, and if so, where can I get the correct installation code? 3. Is it possible to transfer saved passwords to a new workstation? What are the requirements for this?
