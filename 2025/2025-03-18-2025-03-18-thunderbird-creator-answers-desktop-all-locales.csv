However I don't care which acount an email arrives into. So I have a rule that transfers anything comming into all but one of the inboxes into one 'main' inbox. All the sub accounts are kept collapsed so I can see my main acount folders. Well and good. However when I want to trash an email I have to look which acount it came into, expand that acount, drag the email into that trash, and then collapse that acount. Selecting the rclick trash bin icon only works for emails into my main account. Is there any way I can simply trash an email from any acount - preferably into one bin? </p><p>Win 11 23H2, 128.8.0esr (64-bit), Imap </p><p>Peter </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",29847gv

She and I use 2 different computers, both with the same version of Thunderbird, which is the latest version, both with the same build and version of Windows 11, and both with the same outgoing server settings. Yet I never have the same issue when I send emails. Can someone please help us by explaining what my wife needs to do for Thunderbird to stop asking for her password? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",colinbodkin
