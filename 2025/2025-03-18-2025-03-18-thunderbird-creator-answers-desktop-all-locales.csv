However I don't care which acount an email arrives into. So I have a rule that transfers anything comming into all but one of the inboxes into one 'main' inbox. All the sub accounts are kept collapsed so I can see my main acount folders. Well and good. However when I want to trash an email I have to look which acount it came into, expand that acount, drag the email into that trash, and then collapse that acount. Selecting the rclick trash bin icon only works for emails into my main account. Is there any way I can simply trash an email from any acount - preferably into one bin? </p><p>Win 11 23H2, 128.8.0esr (64-bit), Imap </p><p>Peter </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1719180;,29847gv

I am using Thunderbird 128.8.0ESR (64bit) on Windows 11 Home (version 24H2) on BOTH COMPUTERS!  When I use the Thunderbird Tools Export function from my old Window 11 computer to my new Windows 11 computer it copies all my email and folders correctly. I can send and receive email fine on the new computer. However, it fails to copy over my Thunderbird address book and my email lists (the address book and lists are blank).  I tried multiple times. My profile is 76GB large. So I tried navigating to C:/Users/Profiles/app data/thunderbird/roaming/profiles/profile name to perform the move manually. Still no luck.  </p><p>About 2 years ago. Thunderbird versions had the ability to export address books separately. That option is no longer available. So if you know of a way to export my lists of addresses (each lists is a thousand email addresses) That would also solve the problem. -Eileen </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1719178;,emsamitz14

I am developing an application for an organization that uses Thunderbird in a Windows environment. Among other features, it is necessary to implement the transfer of mail client settings from one workstation to another. Built-in Mozilla Thunderbird tools are not suitable. I am still considering implementation options (autoconfig or direct work with files), and I have several questions. I will be very grateful for any help. 1. What is the minimum required files in the appdata folder that I need to create (transfer) so that the profile works without errors on the new workstation? No need to transfer messages, they are all on the server, and offline work is not used 2. How does the installs.ini file work? I need to avoid creating a new profile when starting Thunderbird for the first time, do I need to create an entry in installs.ini, and if so, where can I get the correct installation code? 3. Is it possible to transfer saved passwords to a new workstation? What are the requirements for this? I am very grateful for any answers </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1719197;,sunhunter512
