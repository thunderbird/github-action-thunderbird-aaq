Problem is that it doesn't work reliably.  For example, I have a plain text email in my inbox from a few days ago with some content in the message body ""view your paycheck"".  Just a random example.  I would expect this message to show up in the global search results when I type in the phrase ""view your paycheck"".  It does not. </p><p>If I use the classic search function ""Search Messages"" (which as far as I can tell is only accessible by right clicking on an account or folder), the results are as expected. </p><p>I've already tried repairing the folder or deleting the database file.  Those are workarounds that treat the symptom, but don't cure the problem permanently.  It may 'solve' the issue for a while, but the problem always returns.
