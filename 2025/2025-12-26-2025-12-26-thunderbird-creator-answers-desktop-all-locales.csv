Problem is that it doesn't work reliably.  For example, I have a plain text email in my inbox from a few days ago with some content in the message body ""view your paycheck"".  Just a random example.  I would expect this message to show up in the global search results when I type in the phrase ""view your paycheck"".  It does not. </p><p>If I use the classic search function ""Search Messages"" (which as far as I can tell is only accessible by right clicking on an account or folder), the results are as expected. </p><p>I've already tried repairing the folder or deleting the database file.  Those are workarounds that treat the symptom, but don't cure the problem permanently.  It may 'solve' the issue for a while, but the problem always returns.  I can't trust the Global Search results. </p><p>On the other hand, the classic search is flawless.  It's even more reliable now that I have IMAP server doing service side indexing with Apache Solr. </p><p>My question is, can we have the Global Search configured to instead send the query to the server just like the option currently present in classic search? </p><p>Or at the very least, make an option so that classic search is a first class citizen instead of the global search. </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,1789035;,tuaris

I've used this for many years without an incident. It remains on my structure when I open my email via a web browser, but is absent from Thunderbird.  </p><p>What changed? Is there something now forbidden about the name?  </p><p>As I have message filters created to sort all my emails, it is a real problem now with Thunderbird. I would be grateful if someone can enlighten me on how to solve this issue. Jerry </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1789044;1789062;,jwpw2

I do not delete emails from purchases until the item is received.  I leave it in my inbox and often will mark it unread.  I went into it yesterday to check to see when I should receive a certain item and the email is gone.  I have looked in all folders (spam, trash, archive, all mail) and it is not there.  I blamed G-mail originally but now wonder if it is Thunderbird and if there is some way to retrieve it.  Is there a defunct setting somewhere that I do not know about or understand?  I have plenty of storage.  Can someone answer this for me? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Extrastuff1973
