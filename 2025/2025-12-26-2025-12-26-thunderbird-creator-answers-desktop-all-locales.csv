Problem is that it doesn't work reliably.  For example, I have a plain text email in my inbox from a few days ago with some content in the message body ""view your paycheck"".  Just a random example.  I would expect this message to show up in the global search results when I type in the phrase ""view your paycheck"".  It does not. </p><p>If I use the classic search function ""Search Messages"" (which as far as I can tell is only accessible by right clicking on an account or folder), the results are as expected. </p><p>I've already tried repairing the folder or deleting the database file.  Those are workarounds that treat the symptom, but don't cure the problem permanently.  It may 'solve' the issue for a while, but the problem always returns.  I can't trust the Global Search results. </p><p>On the other hand, the classic search is flawless.  It's even more reliable now that I have IMAP server doing service side indexing with Apache Solr. </p><p>My question is, can we have the Global Search configured to instead send the query to the server just like the option currently present in classic search? </p><p>Or at the very least, make an option so that classic search is a first class citizen instead of the global search. </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,1789035;1789874;,tuaris

I do not delete emails from purchases until the item is received.  I leave it in my inbox and often will mark it unread.  I went into it yesterday to check to see when I should receive a certain item and the email is gone.  I have looked in all folders (spam, trash, archive, all mail) and it is not there.  I blamed G-mail originally but now wonder if it is Thunderbird and if there is some way to retrieve it.  Is there a defunct setting somewhere that I do not know about or understand?

Part of this is making sure that certain heavily used applications can be relied-upon in Linux. A couple days ago I successfully installed Thunderbird and moved my Profiles into the Linux version of Thunderbird. (This really needs better guidance from Mozilla! What I found on the subject was definitely NOT accurate!! Instructions should NOT be identical for all platforms). In a cautious abundance of excess, I repeated the same transfer onto a second Linux machine. Now I have Thunderbird running on my desktop Mac Mini AND on two separate Linux machines. Eventually, it will be removed from the Mac. What I never expected was that every time I received, deleted, read, etc., email, the same action would occur on the other two machines, regardless of on which machine I made changes. All accounts are set up as POP accounts, BTW.  How is this possible? are the three instances of Thunderbird aware of each other on my local network? Or, is there some sort of updating processing happening from my ISP? Regardless, I am thrilled that I can potentially use Thunderbird simultaneously on different machines, but... Down Side: Apparently, not everything is mirrored. I just moved a newly received email from the inbox to a local folder inside Thunderbird. That action was NOT copied on the other two machines. Is there anything I can do to keep ALL the folders in sync?  Thanks very much. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1789228;1789243;1789248;1789251;1789398;1789437;1789477;1789489;1789495;1789498;1789499;,davidkachel.photographer
