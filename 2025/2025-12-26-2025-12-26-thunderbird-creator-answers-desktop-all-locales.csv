Part of this is making sure that certain heavily used applications can be relied-upon in Linux. A couple days ago I successfully installed Thunderbird and moved my Profiles into the Linux version of Thunderbird. (This really needs better guidance from Mozilla! What I found on the subject was definitely NOT accurate!! Instructions should NOT be identical for all platforms). In a cautious abundance of excess, I repeated the same transfer onto a second Linux machine. Now I have Thunderbird running on my desktop Mac Mini AND on two separate Linux machines. Eventually, it will be removed from the Mac. What I never expected was that every time I received, deleted, read, etc., email, the same action would occur on the other two machines, regardless of on which machine I made changes. All accounts are set up as POP accounts, BTW.  How is this possible? are the three instances of Thunderbird aware of each other on my local network? Or, is there some sort of updating processing happening from my ISP? Regardless, I am thrilled that I can potentially use Thunderbird simultaneously on different machines, but... Down Side: Apparently, not everything is mirrored. I just moved a newly received email from the inbox to a local folder inside Thunderbird. That action was NOT copied on the other two machines. Is there anything I can do to keep ALL the folders in sync?  Thanks very much. </p>",davidkachel.photographer;mozilla98;MattAuSupport;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",11,0,0,,,
