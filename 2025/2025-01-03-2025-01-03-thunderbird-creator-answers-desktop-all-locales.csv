At present these are Mojave and Catalina on a MacBookPro and Mojave and Sequoia on a Mac mini. Either can be opened in target mode so that the other can access the single common Mail folder on one of them or in an external disk. This won’t work with Apples Mail app because the Mail folder contents aren’t compatible between OS versions.
