I set mine to be on all the time. Back when release 115 was the official release, I created the attached graphic to show what were then all (or most of ) the menus. I see people hunting for menus here on the forum daily. Once you figure out the ones you want, it's fine, but for new people, it can be a steep cliff.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

In my case the popup window doesn't even fit on the screen.  (I cannot see the top and bottom bars.)  When it pops up it's not actually ""active"" or ""selected"" - so I have to stop what I'm doing, click on the white space, then hit the ESC key to get rid of the stupid thing for a while. </p><p>It wants me to login to a different Google account than the one I'm already logged into.  All my family's different email accounts are loaded into one instance of Thunderbird, on the same computer - which has worked fine for years.  I bet as soon as I do login to the other Google account like it wants, it will start demanding I log into the previous one. </p><p>Email still works fine on all accounts, so this pointless ""log into Google account"" window pop-up is change for the sake of change. </p><p>If the popup were at least ""active"" or ""selected"" when it appears, I could at least hit the ESC key while typing.  But no - instead I have to remove my right hand from the keyboard, use the mouse to click on the white space - hit ESC - then turn the light on (I mostly work at night) to re-position my right hand on the keys (because the locating nub on my ""J"" key is worn flat).  It's driving me nuts. </p><p>If they don't remove this ""feature"" in the next couple of updates, obviously that means they plan to keep it.  So over the next few weeks I'll have to clean up all the email accounts, turn off the downloading of new email somehow, then email all the emails we want to keep to those same accounts so they become ""new"" email in the inbox (to make sure nothing is lost).  Then I'll uninstall TB and find another email program, and download all the ""new"" email again. </p>",RealFamilyMan,false,2,0

Maybe it will be resolved in a future release as you suggested, and I'll wait and see what happens.
