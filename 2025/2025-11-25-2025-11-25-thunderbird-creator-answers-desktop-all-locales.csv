I have years of mail and don't want to lose it. </p><p>There are too many options in the help for me to know which are actually related to my situation.

The only option in TB is to change the colour of the email envelope icon. There used to be a extension that achieved this but fell by the wayside in TB 115 I researched this on TB forum on reddit.... <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/17unvb1/different_account_colors_in_thunderbird_115/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/17unvb1/different_account_colors_in_thunderbird_115/</a> </p><p>It made interesting reading and I did download the 'account colours' zip to install and see if it worked. Only thing is that I do not know how to install it........can someone brighter than me tell me how to install it and to remove it if it doesn't work. Many thanks. </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,"",michaelwayne69

The developer has done a great job and has one thing I do like and that is the ability to colour the highlighted email account rather than just the envelope icon. Experiences are appreciated so I can make the informed decision on which to use.  Should I decide to use it how does one just port TB and its settings over to Betterbird.? </p><p>Thanks for views. </p>,thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,"",michaelwayne69
