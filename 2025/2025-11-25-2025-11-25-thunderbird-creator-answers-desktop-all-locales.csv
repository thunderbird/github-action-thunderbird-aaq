The only option in TB is to change the colour of the email envelope icon. There used to be a extension that achieved this but fell by the wayside in TB 115 I researched this on TB forum on reddit.... <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/17unvb1/different_account_colors_in_thunderbird_115/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/17unvb1/different_account_colors_in_thunderbird_115/</a> </p><p>It made interesting reading and I did download the 'account colours' zip to install and see if it worked. Only thing is that I do not know how to install it........can someone brighter than me tell me how to install it and to remove it if it doesn't work. Many thanks. </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,"",michaelwayne69

The developer has done a great job and has one thing I do like and that is the ability to colour the highlighted email account rather than just the envelope icon. Experiences are appreciated so I can make the informed decision on which to use.  Should I decide to use it how does one just port TB and its settings over to Betterbird.? </p><p>Thanks for views. </p>,thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,1781907;1781923;,michaelwayne69

Thunderbird si comporta come se fossero tre programmi diversi. L'unica cosa che li collega è che se leggo una mail su un dispositivo risulta letta anche sugli altri. Inoltre con lo smartphone android ho delle difficoltà quando invio le mail: mi dice sempre che non sono inviate ma in realtà lo sono. Rimango in attesa di Vs istruzioni/suggerimanti. Grazie Mauro </p><p>Good morning, I installed Thunderbird on three devices (Desktop, Android tablet, and Android smartphone), but they don't communicate with each other: if I send emails on the desktop, it's not visible on the other two devices, and vice versa. I have to delete the emails three times (basically on each device). Thunderbird behaves as if they were three different programs. The only thing that connects them is that if I read an email on one device, it appears read on the others. I also have trouble sending emails on my Android smartphone: it always says they haven't been sent, but they actually are. I'm waiting for your instructions/suggestions. Thank you. </p><p>Mauro </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,it,"",fm5601
