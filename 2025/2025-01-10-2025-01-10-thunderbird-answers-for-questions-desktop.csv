Forgot to add that I've read through the release notes/FAQ's for 128 Nebula so I see that it's the same version so maybe my question should be more of 'how to I get it to look like the old one even though it's the same version albiet with a different number."" </p>",chris119,false,0,0

I'll have a play around and see if I can get the elements I want from settings.  Will update soon. </p>",chris119,false,0,0
