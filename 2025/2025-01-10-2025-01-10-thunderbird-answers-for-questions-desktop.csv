I searched this on line and found numerous posts about this very issue and I think it is from people, Like me, who are thinking of moving from Outlook and would like to keep the process available in Outlook where you would like to to keep the amount of files held in inbox low by filtering / rules and moving to trash(junk), and maintaining unread status in trash(junk) of files that do not merit moving/copying to dedicated folders. It is convenient if a later a ""second look"" of messages that are filtered or manually cleared quickly maintain their correct status as ""unread"". I cannot think why ""read"" is applied automatically when the message has not been ""read"" even if the ""Reading &amp; Display"" / ""Automatically mark messages as read"" configuration is ignored! Coming to Thunderbird from an Outlook users point of view it appears strange and pointless to work this way. </p><p>HOWEVER - I note that if you just drag your unread message to trash it works fine!

If yes: What server are you trying to connect to eg: outlook, gmail, comcast, BT, yahoo&nbsp;? </p><p>Check: <strong>1. </strong>Firewall - Exit Thunderbird and Access the Firewall. The Firewall may the default that came with computer or it may be controlled by an Anti-Virus program you  installed. Thunderbird program must be set up as an allowed program otherwise the Firewall may block access to internet. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> VPN Most servers do not like VPN because it disguises your IP address, so servre thinks someone may be hacking the account. If you have a VPN or even if you ar not sure, please check, some Anti-Virus have VPN which might be auto switched on. Switch off any VPN. </p><p><strong>3. </strong>Many webmail accounts require that you enable POP and/or IMAP so that those types of accounts can be set up. Logon to webmail account via a browser and see if there is a setting you need to select to enable  Imap and Pop. Logon to webmail account anyway because this will provce to you that the password works. </p><p><strong>4. </strong> email addresses that use these servers&nbsp;: outlook,gmail and yahoo 1) -  Make sure nothing is using the 'localhost' - eg: programs such as Apache Xampp or similar. Often this effects people who create or maintain websites. Switch off any program that uses the 'localhost'; you can enable it again after setting up OAuth token. </p><p>2) - To connect to these servers which use 'Authentication Method: Oauth2', you need to make sure the following is set up in Thunderbird. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt;Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Under 'Web Content' </li><li> Select checkbox 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li> Accept third party cookies: 'Always' </li></ul> <p>You can also add the appropriate server data&nbsp;: click on 'Exceptions' button Example: For gmail enter: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> For Microsoft enter eg: <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>, <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> </p><p><strong>Process to create a mail account:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Click on the 'Menu app icon' (it h as 3 horizontal lines) </li><li> Select 'New Account' </li><li> Select 'EMail' </li><li> Enter Name, Email address, Password and select checkbox to Remember Password </li><li> Click on 'Continue' </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird attempts to locate server settings as it knows most of the more common server settings. By default Thunderbird also tries to set up IMAP.

I have an email address via another company: <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a>. What I can do is change the password for Outlook.

This afternoon I couldn't do the latter anymore because Microsoft is asking for a code which I would receive via Microsoft Authenticator - but I didn't.

One reason is that I have an account on Thunderbird for my emails via Outlook. I have about 5 years of emails on Thunderbird and I like to access them. I can do without of course but that would be a pity. I like Thunderbird. It has a much better layout than Outlook - as the inheritor of Eudora (which I used since its inception). I also have other email accounts on Thunderbird. So there are good reasons for me to continue with Thunderbird: an existing email, an attractive lay out and other emails that are working well. </p><p>I have tried to add an email provider: Outlook and its password.

I spent time in daily life. </p><p>I will respond to each of your questions, but let me first summarise what my 'problem' is - or rather the situation I would call at present <em>uncomfortable'’.  </em> </p><p>In my <em>normal</em> situation I had two email accounts accessible via Thunderbird. The first one is with google (domain name <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>). The second one is with <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a>, a company that arranges and sells domains (in my case <a href=""http://cict.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">cict.uk</a>) by connecting to Outlook and hence to Microsoft. This was my <em>normal</em> situation therefore: two email accounts, both accessible via Thunderbird. </p><p>Then, on December 15, I lost access to Outlook (and Microsoft), but not to Google. This is what I would call my <em>unacceptable</em> situation. It took me 18 days of nearly daily contact with people from <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a> to reestablish access to my email account with Outlook and Microsoft (these people finally decided to disable the mfa with Microsoft). This means that I now am in an <em>uncomfortable</em> situation, as referred to above. </p><p>This situation is characterised by the fact that I can use Thunderbird to access my email with domain name <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>, but that I cannot use Thunderbird to access my email with domain name <a href=""http://cict.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">cict.uk</a>. I now access the latter email (sending and receiving) via Safari and Outlook - for which I know the password (meanwhile changed a number of times).  </p><p>This is where I need help: <em>To get out of the unpleasant situation and into what I call the </em>normal<em> situation, i.e. I wish to be able to access my email account on Outlook via Thunderbird.</em> </p><p>In my view this situation is not impossible. In fact, I have been in it for many years (at least five years). I have thousands of emails (including Christmas addresses).  </p><p>Now to your questions.  Permission to use the Outlook account has been given by the <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a> organisation. It is implicit in the money I pay for my domain (<a href=""http://cict.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">cict.uk</a>). Their engineers did help to reestablish access to my account with Microsoft and Outlook.  My <a href=""http://cict.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">cict.uk</a> account on Thunderbird follows a procedure to log in to the Outlook account – with address and password. Unfortunately, this procedure does not work anymore. I don't want to set up another account with Microsoft as I already have an account (for many years) via <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a>. The Authenticator came into play when I tried to get access to my <a href=""http://cict.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">cict.uk</a> email with Microsoft. It has now been disabled by the <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a> people to enable my access to Microsoft.  Safari and Google have nothing to do with my <em>unacceptable</em> situation - except that Thunderbird supports my gmail account but not my cict account and that Safari helps me to log in to both my cict account and my gmail account. This means Safari and Google are necessary but are non-essential: they help to formulate my <em>uncomfortable</em> situation but do not contribute to its existence. And yes, I am trying to re-set up the cict account on Thunderbird. </p><p>To formulate what I want in my personal terms (demonstrating my lack of computer knowledge) the following seems to hold: I have an account via <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a> with Outlook and Microsoft that I could access via Thunderbird, but no longer, and I wish to re-establish access. </p><p>What I do know is how to set up a new account with Thunderbird, but this type of knowledge is useless given that I already have an account. I know where to find my password in Thunderbird for access to Outlook and Microsoft, but I cannot change it. My formulation of what I need is that look for a way to reset the existing password to my account for cict in Thunderbird.  </p><p>As I said I am an outsider (i.e. I am an Apple user; its philosophy is that what you have to do is visible on the screen; this is useful (the same philosophy helps to drive cars)). As such it is surprising that nowhere in the manuals did I find a way to change the password to an existing account in Thunderbird and that I also didn't find such a way in the correspondence. </p><p>I hope I have clarified what I need help with. I realise that in our interaction you may feel like the doctor who asks the patient what he needs help with and gets the answer: 'I have pain in my body'. I fully respect the feeling this answer engenders. My field of expertise is research methods. In my interaction with others, there usually was a moment when I understood how I could help - but also moments where I decided to stop.
