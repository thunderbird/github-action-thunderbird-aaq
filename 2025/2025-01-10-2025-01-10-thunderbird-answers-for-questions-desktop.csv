I searched this on line and found numerous posts about this very issue and I think it is from people, Like me, who are thinking of moving from Outlook and would like to keep the process available in Outlook where you would like to to keep the amount of files held in inbox low by filtering / rules and moving to trash(junk), and maintaining unread status in trash(junk) of files that do not merit moving/copying to dedicated folders. It is convenient if a later a ""second look"" of messages that are filtered or manually cleared quickly maintain their correct status as ""unread"". I cannot think why ""read"" is applied automatically when the message has not been ""read"" even if the ""Reading &amp; Display"" / ""Automatically mark messages as read"" configuration is ignored! Coming to Thunderbird from an Outlook users point of view it appears strange and pointless to work this way. </p><p>HOWEVER - I note that if you just drag your unread message to trash it works fine!

If yes: What server are you trying to connect to eg: outlook, gmail, comcast, BT, yahoo&nbsp;? </p><p>Check: <strong>1. </strong>Firewall - Exit Thunderbird and Access the Firewall. The Firewall may the default that came with computer or it may be controlled by an Anti-Virus program you  installed. Thunderbird program must be set up as an allowed program otherwise the Firewall may block access to internet. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> VPN Most servers do not like VPN because it disguises your IP address, so servre thinks someone may be hacking the account. If you have a VPN or even if you ar not sure, please check, some Anti-Virus have VPN which might be auto switched on. Switch off any VPN. </p><p><strong>3. </strong>Many webmail accounts require that you enable POP and/or IMAP so that those types of accounts can be set up. Logon to webmail account via a browser and see if there is a setting you need to select to enable  Imap and Pop. Logon to webmail account anyway because this will provce to you that the password works. </p><p><strong>4. </strong> email addresses that use these servers&nbsp;: outlook,gmail and yahoo 1) -  Make sure nothing is using the 'localhost' - eg: programs such as Apache Xampp or similar. Often this effects people who create or maintain websites. Switch off any program that uses the 'localhost'; you can enable it again after setting up OAuth token. </p><p>2) - To connect to these servers which use 'Authentication Method: Oauth2', you need to make sure the following is set up in Thunderbird. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt;Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Under 'Web Content' </li><li> Select checkbox 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li> Accept third party cookies: 'Always' </li></ul> <p>You can also add the appropriate server data&nbsp;: click on 'Exceptions' button Example: For gmail enter: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> For Microsoft enter eg: <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>, <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> </p><p><strong>Process to create a mail account:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Click on the 'Menu app icon' (it h as 3 horizontal lines) </li><li> Select 'New Account' </li><li> Select 'EMail' </li><li> Enter Name, Email address, Password and select checkbox to Remember Password </li><li> Click on 'Continue' </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird attempts to locate server settings as it knows most of the more common server settings. By default Thunderbird also tries to set up IMAP.

Even without knowing what it stands for I appear to have gone to the right places. </p><p>My email provider is Microsoft via Outlook. I have an email address via another company: <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a>. What I can do is change the password for Outlook. This morning I could access my email via Outlook via a changed password - but not via Thunderbird. This afternoon I couldn't do the latter anymore because Microsoft is asking for a code which I would receive via Microsoft Authenticator - but I didn't. The people from <a href=""http://Names.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Names.co.uk</a> have now disabled the 2fa. In an hour I can try again, </p><p>So, in essence I will be able to login to Outlook – in an hour.  </p><p>If this proves indeed possible (fingers crossed), I still have the problem that I want to access my emails via Thunderbird. One reason is that I have an account on Thunderbird for my emails via Outlook. I have about 5 years of emails on Thunderbird and I like to access them. I can do without of course but that would be a pity. I like Thunderbird. It has a much better layout than Outlook - as the inheritor of Eudora (which I used since its inception). I also have other email accounts on Thunderbird. So there are good reasons for me to continue with Thunderbird: an existing email, an attractive lay out and other emails that are working well. </p><p>I have tried to add an email provider: Outlook and its password. The response is that there is an existing log in and that it cannot be replaced. So I need an alternative: bypass the adding of an email account and returning to the existing one - albeit with a new password. </p><p>This is my problem: how to get back into my existing email on Thunderbird with a new password. </p><p>Maybe an analogy explains my problem a bit better. I refer to one of my other emails. It is with Google. I can access my account via Safari (which I use when I travel), but also via Thunderbird (when I am at home). I want something similar with my account with Microsoft: accessible via Safari or Outlook as well as via Thunderbird. </p><p>Thank you for your time! I do apologise for my earlier explanations.
