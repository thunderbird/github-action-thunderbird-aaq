If it is only the inbox, it might be you have to make a choice in that 3 weeks to either archive (which will move the mail from the folder), delete the mail or perhaps move it to local folders so it is removed from the mail server completely and no longer under the control of your mail provider. </p><p>Or you could just add the account again in Thunderbird as POP and it will behave as your laptop does.
