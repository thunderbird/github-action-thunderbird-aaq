Often I search for emails from a particular sender. I know I've received something from that sender within a week or two. I'm frustrated to find the search function only returns email from many months ago, when I know for a fact I got an email from the particular sender 10 or even 2 days ago. The most recent emails are just not appearing in the search results. The problem started in the last week or two of December and has continued and compounded since. I had been hoping that it would clear itself up, but no amount of re-booting my computer or the program seem to be re-settting the archive that the search function looks through. I'm coming into the tax season and I really do need the search function to support me sift through and find the details I need from my clients. Help! Thank you!

Nothing has happened, but when I reinstalled this morning Templates was missing from my newly created email address I created a new folder in my account in thunderbird yesterday, but it has only synched and appeared on my ipad or iphone accounts this morning. Local folders account only has two things in it:  Outbox and Deleted I am a real dinosaur with regard to techie issues and just don't know where to start to try and resolve the issues that I am experiencing. Has there been a recent update that has caused all these issues? I set up a new email account this morning thinking I would transfer everything from my existing email account to the new one and ditch my old email address, but both old and new accounts are missing Templates (which I use a lot) I have used Thunderbird for years and it is by the far the nicest email platform that I have ever used and I would like to continue with it as everything is so clear to see and sort.
