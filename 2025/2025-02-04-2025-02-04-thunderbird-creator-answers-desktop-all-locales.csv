Often I search for emails from a particular sender. I know I've received something from that sender within a week or two. I'm frustrated to find the search function only returns email from many months ago, when I know for a fact I got an email from the particular sender 10 or even 2 days ago. The most recent emails are just not appearing in the search results. The problem started in the last week or two of December and has continued and compounded since. I had been hoping that it would clear itself up, but no amount of re-booting my computer or the program seem to be re-settting the archive that the search function looks through. I'm coming into the tax season and I really do need the search function to support me sift through and find the details I need from my clients. Help! Thank you!
