Also, some (but strangely, not all) older mails have vanished from various sub-folders I set up. </p><p>I searched the forum, but the answers I found relate to a setting that I do not have in Thunderbird. </p><p>I am using Sky email, which is an IMAP server. On my old laptop I used Outlook 2010 and old emails NEVER disappeared - when I look at it now, I can see all the mails which have vanished on Thunderbird. So I know they are still on the server. </p><p>Please help! Thanks, Mark. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",MarkWatson26
