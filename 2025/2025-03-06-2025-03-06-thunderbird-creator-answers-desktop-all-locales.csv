From Help/Troubleshooting Profiles, I get: </p><p>Default Profile	yes Root Directory	C:\Users\Randy\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ohig3f3m.default Local Directory	C:\Users\Randy\AppData\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles\ohig3f3m.default </p><p>The root directory is 1.37 Gb The local directory is 8.23 Mb I also have d:\data\thunderbird which is 14.7 Gb. There is no Profiles subfolder here. </p><p>The two profiles folders show ohig3f3m.default was updated today. All three folders show files as recent as today. </p><p>The file sizes shouldn't be surprising. I have saved emails back to 2007 and I'm a prolific email writer. </p><p>I'm guessing that some time years ago, with a much smaller main hard drive,  there was an option to save Tbird data to a different location than the default. So I set it to be on my D drive.  </p><p>So what do I do now? I could copy all three directories to a new machine in the same locations. I think that should work. But is there some way I could or should simplify things, or should I just leave well enough alone. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1716299;,rbrook1

""GMAIL settings are out of date"" and ""Yahoo settings are out of date"".  Then, a about a month ago when I opened Thunderbird I noticed that it was trying to download almost 3000 Gmail emails.  I had always believed that only new Gmail messages would download on start up? Whilst this was happening it was impossiblle to do anything on my laptop as I had limited internet access. The only way I could see to stop this was to delete my Gmail account from Thunderbird. When I opened Thunderbird I continued to get the messages ""settings are out of date"" for each of my mail accounts. So I deleted my email accounts from Thunderbird with the intention of re-adding them. I then downloaded and re-installed Thunderbird to ensure I was on the latest version. I then tried to re-add my mail accounts, letting Thunderbird find and load the correct email settings for each account but I now get an error message saying ""Unable to Log In at Server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password"". Refer to attached screenshot. I can log in to my Mail Accounts OK using Firefox so I know my username and password are correct. I also tried adding my mail accounts manually in Thunderbird but I contiue to get the same message. I am unable to add my mail accounts to Thunderbird and I have run out of ideas regarding diagnosis and resolution. I need help please. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1716297;,graeme.hurst16

I also have 2 old/existing Hotmail accounts that too are working perfectly through both Outlook &amp; Thunderbird. All accounts are set-up in Thunderbird using POP3 using OAuth2 authentification for both POP3 &amp; SMTP servers. Unfortunately, I am having trouble adding both the 2 new Hotmail accounts to Thunderbird. When adding an account &amp; inputting ""Name"", ""Email Address"" &amp; ""Password"" &amp; then enter I receive the message in a green bar stating ""Configuration found in Mozilla ISP database""............brilliant&nbsp;!!! I then select the ""POP3"" button &amp; hit the box ""Done"" Normally, all would be accepted to which I would finally click on the box ""Finish"" &amp; my account would be added. Instead, I now get an error message in a yellow box stating ""Unable to log in at srver. Probably wrong configuration, username or password""&nbsp;? These are 2 new Hotmail accounts I have only JUST set-up. The details entered are all correct &amp; log me into Outlook with no problems &amp; work perfectly sending &amp; receiving. As for ""Configuration"" I just let Thunderbird set the POP3 settings as done with the 2 old/existing Hotmail accounts which go in perfectly through Thunderbird.
