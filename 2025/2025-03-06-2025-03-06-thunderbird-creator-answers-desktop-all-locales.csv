From Help/Troubleshooting Profiles, I get: </p><p>Default Profile	yes Root Directory	C:\Users\Randy\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ohig3f3m.default Local Directory	C:\Users\Randy\AppData\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles\ohig3f3m.default </p><p>The root directory is 1.37 Gb The local directory is 8.23 Mb I also have d:\data\thunderbird which is 14.7 Gb. There is no Profiles subfolder here. </p><p>The two profiles folders show ohig3f3m.default was updated today. All three folders show files as recent as today. </p><p>The file sizes shouldn't be surprising. I have saved emails back to 2007 and I'm a prolific email writer. </p><p>I'm guessing that some time years ago, with a much smaller main hard drive,  there was an option to save Tbird data to a different location than the default. So I set it to be on my D drive.  </p><p>So what do I do now? I could copy all three directories to a new machine in the same locations. I think that should work. But is there some way I could or should simplify things, or should I just leave well enough alone. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1716299;,rbrook1

""GMAIL settings are out of date"" and ""Yahoo settings are out of date"".  Then, a about a month ago when I opened Thunderbird I noticed that it was trying to download almost 3000 Gmail emails.  I had always believed that only new Gmail messages would download on start up? Whilst this was happening it was impossiblle to do anything on my laptop as I had limited internet access. The only way I could see to stop this was to delete my Gmail account from Thunderbird. When I opened Thunderbird I continued to get the messages ""settings are out of date"" for each of my mail accounts. So I deleted my email accounts from Thunderbird with the intention of re-adding them. I then downloaded and re-installed Thunderbird to ensure I was on the latest version. I then tried to re-add my mail accounts, letting Thunderbird find and load the correct email settings for each account but I now get an error message saying ""Unable to Log In at Server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password"". Refer to attached screenshot. I can log in to my Mail Accounts OK using Firefox so I know my username and password are correct. I also tried adding my mail accounts manually in Thunderbird but I contiue to get the same message. I am unable to add my mail accounts to Thunderbird and I have run out of ideas regarding diagnosis and resolution. I need help please. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1716297;,graeme.hurst16

(2025) I don't know if I am doing something wrong or is this a thunderbird bug report? </p><p>I am using AOL, as my email provider.  Goal is the create a folder of each year with all the emails received and sent that year into an archive folder. How I preform this task.  1. I create folders with thunderbird, these folders are then pushed into my AOL email account called archive folders. (works fine)  2. I move (highlight and drag) my inbox emails into a folder by a year, which removes them from my inbox, and this puts a copy of each email into the archive folder that I dragged them too. (works fine)  3. I do the same function (highlight and drag) my <strong>sent emails</strong> as I did in step 2 above. (deletes all the emails, that were in that folder that were inbox emails (received emails) that I wanted to save.  </p><p>Here is the question. Why would moving my sent emails to the same archive folder, <strong>delete </strong>my saved INBOX EMAILS in that were in the archive folder? I lose completely and can't find them, not in trash, only the Sent emails are left in the file after 3 above is performed.  </p><p>I would have thought that both the inbox (received emails) and sent emails would coexist in the same file! With maybe the sent arrow to identify the sent emails from the inbox emails. I tested this a few times with small batches of emails and each time I lost the inbox email in the Archive folder. </p><p>When I created the Archive subfolder for <strong>2023 Sent</strong> year see below, (photo) to store my sent emails, nothing we deleted in my 2023 Archived inbox saved emails. Conclusion: for some reason, both Received INBOX and SENT emails<strong> can not be combined in one Archive folder? </strong> Really?
