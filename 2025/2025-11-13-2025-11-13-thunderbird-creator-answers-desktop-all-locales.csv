It shows up in the new folder and is deleted from the folder where it was, which is what you’d expect if the same procedure was carried out with the “Move To” command.  In effect, for me “Copy To” is broken.  Running latest version on Windows 11.

With the new Thunderbird downloaded version, 144.0.1, If Mailwasher is not already open to receive any email from Comcast, It goes right into Thunderbird before I open Mailwasher Pro and choose the emails to keep, mark as spam, or blacklist.  It has become a real problem, but I can find no way in the settings to set it as receiving the email 2nd, after Mailwasher ""washes"" the mail to it. Why did it always work correctly from the beginning, but not now? </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",cksdjs

This is inconvenient during mass password changes. </p><p>Question: Is there a way to configure Thunderbird to automatically sync with domain password changes? </p>",thunderbird;save-passwords;,thunderbird,save-passwords,en-US,"",artem100739
