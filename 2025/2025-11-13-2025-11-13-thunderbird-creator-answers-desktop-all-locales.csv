With the new Thunderbird downloaded version, 144.0.1, If Mailwasher is not already open to receive any email from Comcast, It goes right into Thunderbird before I open Mailwasher Pro and choose the emails to keep, mark as spam, or blacklist.  It has become a real problem, but I can find no way in the settings to set it as receiving the email 2nd, after Mailwasher ""washes"" the mail to it.

Di recente la situazione sta diventando fastidiosa perchè quando eseguo ricerche all'interno delle cartelle che ho creato su thunderbird e mi sposto tra i contenuti (mail) cliccandoci mi si apre la finestra di outlook come se il sistema non sia in grado di leggere i contenuti e voglia dare precedenza alla gestione mail tramite outlook dentro thunderbird. In allegato trovate uno screenshot per farvi capire cosa vedo. </p><p>Chiaramente, se chiudo la finestra e provo a muovermi dentro thunderbird mi si riapre la finestra di outlook interna. Questo accade anche quando ricevo notifiche o nuove mail: mi apre automaticamente la finestra di outlook. </p><p>Immagino sia un bug, vi chiedo gentilmente di risolvere questa problematica. </p><p>Grazie, Andrea Baggio </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,it,"",andrea.baggio
