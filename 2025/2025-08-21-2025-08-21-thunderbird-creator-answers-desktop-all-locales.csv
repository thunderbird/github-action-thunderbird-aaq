""Connection to Server mail.besttelecom.net.au was reset"".","<p>For the past two weeks, since my IP provider renewed security certificates, I have not been able to send or receive emails in Thunderbird. I can access my emails fine using one of my android devises through Thunderbird, biut my Windows 11 devices refuse to co-operate. I deleted certificates in the hope that Thunderbird would download and attach new certificates, but this has not happened either. I have tried changing ports and security TLS. I can however, access my <a href=""http://mail.besttelecom.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.besttelecom.net.au</a> emails using outlook. I have been using Thunderbird since it's first appearance and prefer it to any other email manager.I have heaps of data stored in it which I access regularly, so I would prefer not going to another email manager. </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",peefjay
