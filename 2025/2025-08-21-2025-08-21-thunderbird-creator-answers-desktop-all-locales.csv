Uso Thunderbird su una casella GMAIL con PGP: ho creato le mie chiavi private e  pubbliche, che sono riconosciute da PROTON (servizio di mail crittografata che uso da web o client), infatti le mail verso PROTON sono correttamente decriptate. Ovviamente anche PROTON ha le chiavi PGP e scambia mail regolarmente con GMAIL, che Thunderbird decripta correttamente. Problema: se metto una foto nel messaggio email che mando da PROTON a GMAIL, Thunderbird quando la riceve mi dice che blocca i contenuti remoti e non mi permette di scaricarli (manca il bottone delle opzioni), ma me la ritrovo come allegato alla mail che posso aprire (vedi Thunderbird.png). Ho provato a mettere la eccezione dell'indirizzo email nelle impostazioni di Privacy e sicurezza dell'account GMAIL, ma segnala lo stesso il problema. Se mando da GMAIL a PROTON una mail con una immagine, in PROTON vedo un segnalibro di ""oggetto mancante"" (quindi non viene mandata) -- e non arriva NULLA, nemmeno come allegato (vedi PROTON.png). Come ultimo tentativi ho anche abilitato ""permetti contenuti remoti dentro i messaggi"" dalle impostazioni globali, ma Thunderbird continua a dirmi che ""ha bloccato i contenuti remoti"". </p><p>C'è qualche spiegazione? può essere che la crittografia PGP abbia problemi con le foto?
