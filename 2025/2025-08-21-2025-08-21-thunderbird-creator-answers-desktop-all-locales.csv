Uso Thunderbird su una casella GMAIL con PGP: ho creato le mie chiavi private e  pubbliche, che sono riconosciute da PROTON (servizio di mail crittografata che uso da web o client), infatti le mail verso PROTON sono correttamente decriptate. Ovviamente anche PROTON ha le chiavi PGP e scambia mail regolarmente con GMAIL, che Thunderbird decripta correttamente. Problema: se metto una foto nel messaggio email che mando da PROTON a GMAIL, Thunderbird quando la riceve mi dice che blocca i contenuti remoti e non mi permette di scaricarli (manca il bottone delle opzioni), ma me la ritrovo come allegato alla mail che posso aprire (vedi Thunderbird.png). Ho provato a mettere la eccezione dell'indirizzo email nelle impostazioni di Privacy e sicurezza dell'account GMAIL, ma segnala lo stesso il problema. Se mando da GMAIL a PROTON una mail con una immagine, in PROTON vedo un segnalibro di ""oggetto mancante"" (quindi non viene mandata) -- e non arriva NULLA, nemmeno come allegato (vedi PROTON.png). Come ultimo tentativi ho anche abilitato ""permetti contenuti remoti dentro i messaggi"" dalle impostazioni globali, ma Thunderbird continua a dirmi che ""ha bloccato i contenuti remoti"". </p><p>C'è qualche spiegazione? può essere che la crittografia PGP abbia problemi con le foto?

Only when I ""Turn dark mode off"" with the dark mode ""drop"" in the message menu does it revert back to normal. This is quite annoying as it has to be done every time I want to read an email.
