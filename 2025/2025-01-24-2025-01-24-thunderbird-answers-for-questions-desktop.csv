Feedback and ideas should be posted here <a href=""http://connect.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">connect.mozilla.org</a> </p><p>Junk processing is not IMAP or POP dependent in its function and utilises the same code within  Thunderbird. The onjmly different I am aware of is IMAP is a syncronised protocol so junk fioltering done at the server level will appear in the junk folder in Thunderbird. </p> <blockquote><p>rvdude <a href=""#question-1488111"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p><em> </em> <p>imap junk detection doesn't work... </p> </blockquote> <p>There is no such thing as ""imap junk detection"" there is only junk filtering within Thunderbird,  but how it determines if a message is junk is not dependent on the protocol used to fetch it.  See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a> </p><p>So are you asserting that junk filtering per se is not working for you?    If that is the case perhaps you could share some information on what lead you to this conclusion.  Note here that it works for me o n a windows 11 computer without fail really. </p> <blockquote> will probably end up dumping thunderbird... </blockquote> I see this a lot.  I really do not know why fellow users think anyone on this peer forum really cares if they choose another mail client.  What I do know is such statements are entirely irrelevant to the support process.  What is far more relevant is to clearly state the issue and that you have not done.  Things like what is happening that you did not expect and what what mail provider it happens with is also very relevant.  Especially for those using Microsoft (outlook,hotmail,MSN,office365 etc) or Yahoo mail providers. They do not allow the user to opt out of their IMAP spam/scam filtering so you have to work around it often when using the IMAP protocol. <blockquote> imap email is garbage and nothing like pop3... </blockquote> <p>Many would disagree,  I am not sure that I do.  Perhaps that is why many of my accounts are still POP not IMAP.  However you are welcome to your opinion either way.   It certainly should not be relevant to your choice to use POP or IMAP however as Thunderbird supports both.  </p><p>For completeness I reviewed your previous topic here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1482947"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1482947</a> where you asserted like here that you were ""forced"" to use IMAP.  My guess based on what I know now is that you simply did not change the default. </p><p>I looked at that providers web site and they support POP mail  <a href=""https://support.allocommunications.com/article/email-client-settings-for-allophone-com-email-addresses/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.allocommunications.com/article/email-client-settings-for-allophone-com-email-addresses/</a>  So perhaps the issue is your choices in setting up your accounts within Thunderbird/  </p><p>If you want to use POP you have to configure manually in the setup and actually select POP instead of IMAP as the protocol to use. </p><p>Here is one I just configured using Dude as I did not want to mess with anything you might have there as RVDude.for you to copy from. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-01-23-21-25-50-4e5125.png""> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

What I think you want is to convert HTML to plain text. And a large part of the content are the headers. Anyway, this product (which I have not used) may be what you're seeking:   ... </blockquote> <p><br> No, David, sorry, but that's not what I want, and that product is not what I need. I'm <strong>not</strong> interested in plain-text <strong>visualization</strong> or in <strong>converting</strong> HTML into text. I'm interested in <strong>saving disk space</strong> by deleting the HTML part of <strong>multipart</strong> messages. </p><p>Such messages (which can also be <strong>sent</strong> by Thunderbird) contain several parts, and may contain one part with the text in HTML and another with the same text stripped of any tagging. Other parts may contain attachments, if any — that's how they're organized in a message (and Thunderbird <strong>can</strong> delete attachments, I've already seen that it can; since the HTML is also just a ""part"" in this format, Thunderbird should be able to delete it as well). </p><p>I'm aware that the headers also take up some space, but they pale in comparison with what some professional emails do with their HTML part. They don't just add a short tag here and there for bold or Italics. They are complex Web pages of their own, complete with long JavaScript routines, embedded cascaded style sheets, division formatting, and much more, not to mention that they often use inefficient, verbose, and repetitive HTML <strong>code</strong> (not just merely ""tagging""). This is exactly why (correct me if I'm wrong) Thunderbird must use <strong>Gecko,</strong> the same HTML rendering engine in Firefox — it needs nearly all the bells and whistles of a full-fledged browser. The result is a monster-sized message. See my example of the newsletter in my initial question above. </p><p>And I'm also aware that some messages don't contain an alternative plain-text part. I don't intend to delete the HTML in such cases. My current mailer not only allows me to delete the HTML part, it automatically detects if the message doesn't have a plain-text version and refuses to delete the HTML in such cases, for safety. It can also show me the two parts separately and even allows me to configure which I want to see by default. Maybe that would be asking too much (I said that it's a product for power email users), but I'd be happy just with the option to manually decide that. </p>",goytabr,false,0,0
