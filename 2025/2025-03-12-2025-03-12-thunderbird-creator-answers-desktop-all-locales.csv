I have T-Bird ver 136.0 (64 bit) running on my side working perfectly.  We just tried installing her old T-Bird account on her side, and after a while, we got it installed and are able to RECEIVE mail--also on ver 136.0 (64 bit), but can't SEND.  However, there are two problems: </p><pre>  1.  Our two versions look quite different on our individual sides of the computer.  Why?   2.  As best we can determine, all our settings are the same; however, she can only receive--can't send emails.  She gets an instant constant error msg:  Unable to send, outgoing mail server xxxxxxxxx has timed out.  It's the same server I'm using!  We have triple-checked all settings between our two accounts, but still no luck.  We have checked with our email service provider (WOW!/Knology), and they have shown us how to set up their internet email account to use at a hotel when traveling, but not at our home PC.  Any help here would be GREATLY appreciated! </pre> <p>Many thanks, Jay </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Juvat1

I'm having a problem with adaptive junk filtering: it thinks everything is junk until I tell it otherwise. </p><p>By default, it leaves putative junk messages in the Inbox, but displays a yellow ribbon above a junk message's preview with ""Learn more"" and ""Not junk"" buttons. In this configuration, having it assume everything new is junk is just a nuisance. </p><p>But eventually I will finish training it, and I'll want it to move junk to the Junk folder automatically. Then this behavior will be a disaster. </p><p>Using made-up numbers to illustrate, suppose I get 1000 messages per day. Of these, 998 are from addresses it recognizes, so it knows that 993 of them are junk and 5 are legitimate, because I've received email from those addresses before, and I've told it what to do with them. That leaves 2 messages which may or may not be junk. </p><p>It should leave those messages in the Inbox, preferably with some kind of warning, and let me decide whether they are junk or not. Instead it's going to move them to Junk, and I'll never know I got them unless I review all 995 new messages in the Junk folder... which would defeat the whole point of having a junk filter. </p><p>Is there a way to make the junk filter default to ""not junk"" when it doesn't know? I've looked at the configuration dialog, and I don't see one. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1717552;,jsachs.sac
