I've sent a test message with Thunderbird for Android. This worked as expected. And the answer to your question if the SMTP server is the same as the ones that are ok, the answer is no. It is a different one. I wanted to try to the suggested setting for work-around no. 1, however it is not possible to set this anymore in Thunderbird. I cannot find the menus Display or the Format tab in Thunderbird 128.8.0esr. How do I find these settings now? All I can do is to set  ""mail.strictly_mime"" to true. After I did that mails have now a CTE base64. I wanted it to be quoted-printable. So I'm a bit puzzled because I couldn't find the menu structure mentioned for the work-around. Do you have an idea? I should not forgot to mention that these are postfix 3.8.6 servers which are advertising ""8BITMIME"" support. These are my own servers. </p>",tamo_bln,false,0,0
