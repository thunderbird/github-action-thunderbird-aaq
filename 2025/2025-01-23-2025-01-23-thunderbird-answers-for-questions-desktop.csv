There is no folder ""Spam"" in defect address and in all other addresses.  </p><p>You have already stated very clearly and I quote: 1. On AOL in <strong>SPAM</strong> 15 messages,  I presume you are saying you logon to webmail account via abrowser and see a server default folder called SPAM </p><p><br> That means the server has a default folder called 'SPAM' and it uses it. It means you have to use it as well in the Imap account. </p><p>Follow my 'Stage 1' set of instructions so you can see it in the IMAP account set of folders. </p><p>There is no problem with the code because only you have the problem and you have the problem because your setup is wrong. </p><p>Mozilla is not Thunderbird. Thunderbird is separate and has been for a very long time.  </p><p>re&nbsp;:I have created the sybfolder ""Scam""  </p><p>Is that a Typo error&nbsp;? do you mean 'Spam'&nbsp;? What do you mean by 'created the subfolder'&nbsp;? You are using an IMAP account - you do not create default folders - you subscribe to see them. I need to know that you have 'Subscribed' to see the default SPAM folder. </p><p>re&nbsp;:Modzilla does not support Thunderbitd beginning from 01/01/2025 </p><p>I've just read some incorrect information on the Mailbird webpage which basically says and I quote ""The biggest Thunderbird vs. Mailbird difference is that the former is not being updated anymore."" </p><p>Load of nonsense. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The server will not allow deleting of any folder if a default folder - only folders you create.  For some reason this user has two Junk folders,  no one knows if the user created this 'Junk' folder or whether because it's an old default, it gets recreated autromatically. Hence - unsubscribe so it does not become an issue in the imap account.  Then if user cannot remove off server it does not matter - it's gone from the imap. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
