This fails both with drag and drop and with using the right-click menu. </p><p>When I created a folder without diacritics (Sarunas) the emails can be moved into the folder. </p><p>Letters with diacritics are an essential part of spelling and not having them can significantly change the meaning of the words.  What do I need to do in order to use folder names with diacritics? </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1708786;1708792;,surlyc

I have read that deleting the file global-messages-db.sqlite from my profile folder, with Thunderbird closed, and then restarting Thunderbird should result in any email on my gmail server being redownloaded. I see the global-messages-db.sqlite file being re-created but Thunderbird does download anything off of the server. My gmail server has about 4,000 email on it all the way back to 2023. </p><p>Any thoughts on another way to force them down would be greatly appreciated! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1708785;1708789;1708791;1708794;,antaresbda
