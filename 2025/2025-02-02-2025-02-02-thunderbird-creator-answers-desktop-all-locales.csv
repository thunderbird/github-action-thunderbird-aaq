This fails both with drag and drop and with using the right-click menu. </p><p>When I created a folder without diacritics (Sarunas) the emails can be moved into the folder. </p><p>Letters with diacritics are an essential part of spelling and not having them can significantly change the meaning of the words.  What do I need to do in order to use folder names with diacritics? </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1708786;1708792;,surlyc

I have read that deleting the file global-messages-db.sqlite from my profile folder, with Thunderbird closed, and then restarting Thunderbird should result in any email on my gmail server being redownloaded. I see the global-messages-db.sqlite file being re-created but Thunderbird does download anything off of the server. My gmail server has about 4,000 email on it all the way back to 2023. </p><p>Any thoughts on another way to force them down would be greatly appreciated! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1708785;1708789;1708791;1708794;,antaresbda

For each one, the first time I checked my mail, I got a Thunderbird pop up saying ""See, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar"" and another Thunderbird pop-up saying ""See, edit, download, and permanently delete your contacts"", followed by two ""Mozilla Thunderbird Email was granted access to your Google Account"" emails to each account. </p><p>And for all accounts but one, that was the end of it. But for one account, for some reason, I have to go through the whole authorization process again each time I start Thunderbird. I tried deleting the account, and Thunderbird still made me go through the whole authorization process -- for an account that no longer existed! </p><p>I re-created the account. No change. </p><p>Any idea what the problem is? It started after a Thunderbird update. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",pa.sircat

Now this feature no longer appears and Thunderbird is again non-responsive and doesn't download e-mails.  When I click on Get Messages nothing happens.
