After trying to find a solution at <a href=""http://telus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">telus.com</a>, my internet provider, I finally spoke to a real person (after nearly an hour on hold) who informed me that the recent google gmail update now prohibits third party email services, such as Outlook or Thunderbird, from connecting to Telus gmail email. And, that there is no work around or solution and that a supervisor could not offer anything further.  I have been using Thunderbird for telus email for decades, I weathered the storm when Telus email moved to using the gmail platform, and I have many, many folders and subfolders. The Thunderbird third party platform allows permanent offline archiving of emails, which I require for my work. Is Thunderbird aware of this major issue caused by an update via Google?

(I don't know why) </p><p>I have located and read the article pertaining to T-bird self-creating a new profile. My old profile still exists, and I have set my old profile as the default to no avail. </p><p>While attempting to follow the instructions for copying my old profile to a separate drive and bringing it back, I noticed that both the ""Imapmail"" and ""Mail"" folders are missing from the root directory of the old profile. Doing a windows file search on the C drive, the only folders that appear on the drive are those of the new default profile created by T-bird after the power failure. </p><p>Looking inside the ""Mail"" folder in the new default profile, I see that it contains everything from my old profile. I copied the folder and placed it in the old profile root directory to no avail, though I have not done a re-boot of the computer itself. </p><p>One thing I have not tried is deleting the the new profile after selecting the profile as default. I am afraid to delete anything, as in my mind I may permanently delete something if I did. </p><p>How do I get T-bird to return to it's proper function where all my accounts appear upon opening of T-bird? </p><p>What is it looking at (points to) to retrieve each profile or the email accounts&nbsp;? </p>",rnrtot;Mapenzi;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data""]",3,0,0,,,
