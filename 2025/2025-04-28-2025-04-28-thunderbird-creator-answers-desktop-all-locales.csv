When the image opens, I cannot rotate the image.  If I save the image and then open that saved image via the same Microsoft application, the rotate icon in the upper left is operative.  Is this due to the permissions in the image being opened by Thunderbird from alt/local/temp?  Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bsfinkel

I looked on the C: drive under Profiles, and the Inbox showed 0 KB, when a backup from 10/17/2021, was 1.67 GB (1,753,217 KB). I am not sure how this happened.  I think there were Thunderbird updates for a couple of days before I noticed the problem.  I had been having trouble with Windows 10 updates, and saved files on an external hard drive on 4/20/25 to back them up, but by then, the Inbox file in my Thunderbird profile showed 0 KB. I am using POP to download emails. Is there any way I can get my emails back? Are they saved somewhere else? Thank you in advance for your help! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",amyj.mn

When I did, the installations of both Firefox and Thunderbird was deleted and replaced with snap versions. Luckily, before ""upgrading,"" I made copies of the profile directories and ran a 'backup' in Thunderbird. I was finally able to get Firefox to see the saved passwords, but no matter what I do, Thunderbird refuses. I tried doing a 'restore' using the .zip file that 'backup' created, but that didn't work. So then, I deleted that profile and copied the old profile directory over. All of my settings, contacts and emails are still there, but it REFUSES to acknowledge the saved passwords. I need to know how I can fix this. Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",rebeltaz1
