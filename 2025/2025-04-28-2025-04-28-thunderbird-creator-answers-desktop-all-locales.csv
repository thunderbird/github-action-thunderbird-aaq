Daily to install the Calendar event but it stalls on Step 3 of 3 at 0%.  Yet it may show up in the calendar after clicking the Refresh icon.  Then visa versa sometimes it confirms the entry 100%  and after a refresh icon it does not show it up as a duplicate entry.

Install same .ics file from downloads in sequence. Install alternate .ics file from Downloads. </p><p>I have been able to get both .ics files installed in the same main calendar but I am trying to find the pattern when it consistently works or fails. (without much success) </p><p>If I open #1 .ics file , the Import 3 steps succeeds and is finished but does not add a duplicate entry ( good) When I then open #2 .ics file with the event already stored in the calendar, now I get an error message </p><p><em>Status Code: 2,147,500,037, null </em> </p><p>Server Replied with 409 If you're seeing this message after snoozing or dismissing a reminder and this is for a calendar you do not want to add or edit events for, you can mark this calendar as read-only to avoid such experience in future.
