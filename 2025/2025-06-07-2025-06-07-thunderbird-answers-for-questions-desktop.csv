When you deleted all the emails off server then they would have been deleted from imap account as it synchronises with server.  </p><p>If you were running Thunderbird and the imap account folders synchronised to an empty server then it can only display what on server. </p><p>Before anyone ever removes an Account either from Thunderbird or completely deletes the account off server - You would need to get copies of important emails into the 'Local Folders ' account. You would need to right click on batches of highlighted emails in imap folder and use 'Copy to' &gt; select a suitable folder in the 'Local Folders' account. This would mean you have a local copy on computer that is independent of the server. </p><p>Any search in Thunderbird may still return lists of old Account A emails because the Global database is a bit out of date and would need a repair. </p><p>If you select anything in a search result and it only shows a header - no actual email then that's because it does not exist. </p><p>You can check to see what you have in the profile folders: In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Under 'Application Basics'  - half way is 'Profile Folder' - click on 'Open Folder' </li><li> It opens in a new window showing the contents of your 'profile folder name' </li><li> Click on 'ImapMail' folder to see list of imap accounts. </li><li> Select the gmail account name folder (please note as you created additional accounts those will have a number added to the account name)  </li></ul> <p>Emails are stored in mbox text files - they have same name as folder eg: 'Inbox', these files do not have any extension. Inbox.msf files are just index files they do not contain emails. mbox text files can be opened using text editor programs like 'Notepad++' </p><p>You can only recover it if you have made a backup of your profile and then you must import the mbox files into the 'Local Folders' mail account. </p><p>If you deleted the google/gmail account recently then you might be able to contact google and recover it. <a href=""https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6236295"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6236295</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
