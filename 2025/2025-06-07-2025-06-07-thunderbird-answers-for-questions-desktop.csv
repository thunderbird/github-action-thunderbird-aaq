I am thinking your antivirus (if it is other than defender) is most likely the problem,  not Thunderbird at all.  If it is the firewall, malware detection, phishing tools or what I do not know.  What I do know is probably 90+% of folk that appear in these forums complaining about accounts that do not work, images that do not display or links that don't do anything have antivirus issues.  It is therefore important to get that out of the way first in the diagnostic process.  In your case you apparently an not get get into any mail server.  Just a further indication that your have antivirus problems.  Check in the addon manager that you can search for addons,  if that does not work, it will point to the firewall component. </p><p>A quick look as the Utexas web site indicates the mail setting described in this link <a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/documentation/email-configuration"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/documentation/email-configuration</a>  I would however recommend the use of the settings described in the setting up outlook page on their site as it appears you will need to use OAuth as an authentication method. <a href=""https://ut.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&amp;number=KB0019015#utmailtooutlookwin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ut.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&amp;number=KB0019015#utmailtooutlookwin</a> </p><p>DO you see the pages starting at point 6 on that instruction?  That is served by Google and is exactly the same in Thunderbird (except to the application you would be granting access to).  Your only choice with Google now is really oauth authentication and that requires cookies to be enabled in Thunderbird.  Cookies are enabled by default,  but an amazing number of software package and people see them disabled and then can not set up their accounts as a result. </p><p>While on oAuth specifics, the end of an oAuth setup involved an authorization token coming to your device from the web.  This is passed to your localHost, which has an IP of 127.0.0.1,  unfortunately other software like development environments and web server software also monitor and consume packets delivered to that address,  there are also antivirus product that block localhost entirely.  So at times the issue is Thunderbird not getting the token because Visual Studio or Apache or Nortons ate it. </p><p>Just a hint for the future,  removing a mail account because it stops functioning is less than helpful and usually simply covers the cause because it removes any chance at getting to the initial root issue because the error reporting can not longer be relied upon, it is not gone.  Creating a new account does not offer a new anything as Thunderbird  will look in the same computerized way for settings as it did last time you set it up. Hence the generic ""Unable to log in to server.  Probably wrong configuration, user name or password.""  which is the computer equivalent to ""what just happened? I have no idea"".  So if it was wrong before it will most likely be wrong again with less useful diagnostic error messages. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My problem with Thunderbird is still <em>not resolved</em> but there is now a chance that I can fix that.  I will get back to you if I get it done. Thanks, ........ Sam </p>",smyn1118,false,0,0
