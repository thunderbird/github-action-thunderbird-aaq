But it isn't needed in Thunderbird for proper operation.  To remove it from Thunderbird: </p> <ul><li> Unsubscribe - Right click on the gmail account and click ""Subscribe"", find the All Mail folder, uncheck it, then click OK.

Many Anti-virus products now provide a VPN and in some cases it can be auto enabled. So please check this.  If you have a VPN then switch it off because servers do not like VPN as it hides your real IP that means servers think you may be a hacker so they block access. Alternatively, if you really want o use the VPN then you need to set up split tunnelling and set up Thunderbird to use it, so it does not use the VPN. </p><p>IMAP accounts - folders need to be subscribed to be seen.

I would also expect to see 'Spam' not 'Junk'. I would also expect you to be subscribing to see folders and store email on server. However, you also seem to be using 'Local Folders' to store emails. So  let's be clear - you say ""I fear losing all of my sub-folders in my email account"" - you do not have any subfolders in your comcast mail account - all your folders are in the 'Local Folders' default account. </p><p>Let's check something. </p> <ul><li> In 'Account SEttings' </li><li> In left pane </li><li> Select 'Server Settings' for the comcast mail account. </li><li> Look top right for 'Server Type' - What does it say&nbsp;?

In fact it shows you have been receiving emails into the comcast Inbox with no problems. OK you have some junk mail flagged as junk by Thunderbird, but it seems you have not set up your Junk Settings hence why you see junk mail in the Inbox.  </p><p>Please post the images of your Account Settings &gt; 'Server Settings' and 'Junk Settings' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

At this point I'm only receiving emails through my Comcast account, and nothing through my TB account. I believe at this point my only option is to remove the TB account and start all over. The local folders can be retrieved either from my external hard drive, or another source so I shouldn't place too much emphasis on the issue. </p><p>I figure like before, once I remove the TB account the system should automatically decide what it should do and figure in the correct incoming and outgoing servers based on the Comcast servers. I'm going to go ahead and try that now. And then I'd like to get back to you if possible, and update you on what's going on. You've been a tremendous help so far, and I'd like to keep you advised. So here goes nuttin'! I'll let you know. </p>",MKS1,false,0,0

For some reason it was not taking my password, so I created a new password and once that was done TB recognized everything and reloaded all of my missing emails. Also, the Junk file and folder is working as it should so it seems that issue is also resolved. Now....I also went back to the Comcast email account to make sure everything was lining up correctly, and it seems as though it is. So at this point I would say the issue is resolved and corrected. Hopefully! Again, I thank you for your help. It's unfortunate I can't contact you directly through TB if and when in the future I have difficulties. And I'm sure I will! </p>",MKS1,false,0,0
