To remove it from Thunderbird: </p> <ul><li> Unsubscribe - Right click on the gmail account and click ""Subscribe"", find the All Mail folder, uncheck it, then click OK.

Now that I know you use gmail, I can advise that if you UNTICK saving the message in sent folder, that gmail does it anyway. That implies to me that you have it set to store the message, and that is causing you to have two copies.
