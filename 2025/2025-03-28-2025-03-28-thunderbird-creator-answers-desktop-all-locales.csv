Obiettivo: liberare spazio su GMAIL, spostando le mail dal server centrale a cartelle locali, su altri client di posta questa operazione comporta l'automatica cancellazione dal server ma con GMAIL non è successo. Aggiungo che ho fatto questa operazione spostando (mi ha chiesto proprio il comando esplicito) da INBOX e non da ALLMAIL. VIceversa ho visto che spostando le mail nel cestino e cancellandole definitivamente, sul server vengono effettivamente cancellate. La domanda è quindi: per cancellarle sul serve, questo secondo metodo è l'unico? Non c'è un modo per dirgli che lo spostamento in cartelle locali (che comporta la rimozione dalla inbox) comporta anche automaticamente la cancellazione dal server?

This issue has been present since I started using TB  sometime last year, so through various updates. </p><p>I set most of my folders, especially those used regularly (inbox, sent, trash, etc.) to unthreaded, which does sort the messages unthreaded.  (Some folders I use so infrequently I haven't bothered to change them) </p><p>However, in many cases (mostly excluding the inbox), the folder reverts to threaded and I have to do it all over again. </p><p>Not the end of the world, but aggravating.  </p><p>In an ideal world, I'd set ALL of my folders to unthreaded and probably leave them all there forever.  (Although the option to switch on the fly does seem nice and conceivably, I might use it). Reading previous threads, I'm assuming that this needs to be done folder by folder.  But what I have NOT seen is why folders which have been changed revert to threaded.  I haven't figured out any pattern to it;  reversions don't happen every time, so they appear to be rather random. </p><p>P.S. I have 2 email accounts and at various times, I've had to delete and re-install both of them.  For one, it happens with some frequency, for the other, much less so. But I'm pretty certain that there is no correlation between the problem described and reloading the accounts.  And I'm also pretty certain that it occurs from time to time in folders which store emails which are independent of either account and not online. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1721935;1722017;1722064;1722076;1722101;,jsg11

Now it's integral. Until this week it was great -- I get a lot of meeting invites via calendar attachments, and a fair number of cancellations too.  When I clicked on the mail I got a dialog box asking if I wanted to add or delete the meeting, or saying that it already has been.  </p><p>But suddenly it's not working. (This is using 128.6.esr and then 128.8.1.)  Instead, the decoded text of the invite is now being displayed as a text message, and it doesn't give me any way to add or delete the invite unless I do it manually. The attachment is not being processed.  </p><p>The problem seems somehow related to Provider for Google Calendar. I use that so my phone can make calendar entries. It has worked for years with no problem, but the problem I'm describing goes away if I disable Provider for Google Calendar, in which case I don't see a lot of events entered that way, or set it to read only, in which case I can't enter things my cell phone can see, which I used to be able to do. Yeah, I sure wish the two calendar systems could be better integrated so my cell phone could see the Home calendar or the attachments could be directed to Google Calendar, but no go. </p><p>A few days ago, my Home calendar disappeared from T'bird, leaving only the Google one visible. I re-enabled it and everything came back, but the attachments don't work when everything is normally enabled. Maybe that's related.
