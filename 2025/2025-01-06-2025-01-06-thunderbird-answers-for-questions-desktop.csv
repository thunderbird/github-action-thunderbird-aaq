Double-checked that Gmail IMAP was enabled in the account settings. 4.	Ensured the VPN was disabled. 5.	Checked Downdetector (<a href=""https://downdetector.ca/status/gmail/map/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://downdetector.ca/status/gmail/map/</a>) to confirm there were no reported issues with Gmail.

My system time was correct so I then started to look at the time format which I had set using config editor and the Mozilla article at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customize-date-time-formats-thunderbird#w_create-date-and-time-format-override-preferences-using-thunderbirds-config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customize-date-time-formats-thunderbird#w_create-date-and-time-format-override-preferences-using-thunderbirds-config-editor</a> </p><p>I used the article mentioned within the above article on unicode time formats (very complicated but all you need at the end of the day are the listed format combinations) and find that instead of using 'HH:mm' for the time in 24 hours I had used 'hh:mm' which gave the 12 hour time. So a long saga now resolved. </p><p>I am sorry for the time that you have had to spend on this but you did give me the clue which finally allowed the penny to drop and for which I am extremely grateful. </p><p>Best wishes and thanks again. </p>",redroone,false,0,0
