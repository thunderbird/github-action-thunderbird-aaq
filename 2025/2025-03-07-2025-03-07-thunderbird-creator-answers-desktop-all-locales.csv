I am running Thunderbird Ver 45 on the old machine. I tried getting all the profile moved. I got most of the APP set up, but when I load it, I do not get my old/history of the Sent box. Also, when I now try to reply or send an email, it gives an error... Login to server smtp.comcast.new with username 'name'@comcast.net failed - Retry, Enter New PW, Cancel... If I try Enter New PW, nothing happens - it just Retries again and fails. How do I get past these two problems??
