I'll have changed the password.  </blockquote> <p>I would guess we have an antivirus problem.  The settings you posted way back were correct. An attempt to connect using them should initiate a series of web pages from Google asking for your password and permission for Mozilla Thunderbird to access your email, contacts etc at Google.  Do you get these ""Popups""?  I have  frequently seen folk on this forum complain about them and either close them or ignore them and then complain that Thunderbird is not getting their mail,  so I have to ask.  Are you one of them. </p><p>What antivirus are you using? While a password is included in the account setup,  it is not used at all in an oauth authentication process which must be used for google gmail.  You would be just as well leaving it out entirely.   </p> <blockquote> It's now stuck saying ""Looking up configuration. Probing server"" .  It's ok if you want to leave it for now. Thanks for your efforts so far. </blockquote> <p>There should be no server probing going on.  Thunderbird should lookup the settings here <a href=""https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/gmail.com</a> and use them.  That there is probing going on would indicate a firewall issue blocking that lookup.  </p><p>We come back to my assumption you have an antivirus issue as most of those these days come with these fancy anti phishing and scam modules  that actively block the probing.  However as I said Thunderbird should not get to that point because it looked up the settings.  For that to fail indicates a software firewall issue another antivirus component.  I have a pet hate going on with Norton as I have a friend that uses it and have never managed to set up an account on his system without disabling whole chunks of it.  Something called SONAR blocked the new account wizard,  despite it not having anything to do with email according to Norton.  It has a VPN component with a longstanding habit or just re-enabling itself.  Google/Gmail does not do well with a VPN as christ1 alluded. Essentially if you have an antivirus other than Microsoft defender it is suspect </p> </blockquote>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
