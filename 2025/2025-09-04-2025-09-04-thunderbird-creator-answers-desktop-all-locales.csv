Again, some work, some don't. </p><p>Most of the time, an error message or three pops up because the old address wants me to enter my password again, which is no longer valid. And that usually scuppers any attempt to copy a folder manually. </p><p>I have unticked the three boxes under account settings so that it doesn't look for new mails every X minutes, when starting up, etc. </p><p>Is there any clever way I can avoid all this? Would it help if I did all this offline? </p><p>And does anyone know why the blasted folders are so difficult to copy?!! </p><p>Very grateful for any tips - thanks, </p><p><br> Ian </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1761861;1761862;1761865;1761866;1761899;1761907;1761920;1761935;1762094;1762362;1762371;,ianwinick

I don't understand why my mailbox is full when all folders take only 1/5 of the available space. My hosting give me 5GB, a user quota in mailbox is 4.7GB (in the app for computer: the main folder containing all other folders - properties folder - Quota - Storage: 4.7GB), size on disk is 853MB (in the app for computer: the main folder containing all other folders - properties folder - General Information - Size on disk: 853MB), and the weight of all folders is ~1040MB (the sum of the weights of all individual folders in the main folder). None of the numbers match. I understand that the sum of the weights of all folders is probably supposed to be 853MB, that the discrepancy is due to rounding the numbers. I understand that some space may be ""lost"" from the hosting because installation files take up some space, so I actually have 4.7GB to use, not 5GB. However, I don't understand why my mailbox is full, when from 4.7 GB only 853 MB is used? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1761965;1761972;,maia.architekci
