Both these laptops allowed me to setup 2 accounts&nbsp;: </p><p>user1@mydomain.com  user2@mydomain.com </p><p>both are hosted by <a href=""http://ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ionos.com</a>.  The server setup is <a href=""http://imap.ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.ionos.com</a> </p><p>When I went to install Thunderbird on my new Windows 11 laptop, it is too cool for school. Tries to be too cute.     I got user1@mydomain.com set up and working, but it won't let me  setup user2.   If I go through several unnatural acts to get past the ""helpfulness"", it complains </p><pre>that the inbound server is already setup. </pre> <p>I can't help, but conclude there is a bug or two in the latest account setup. </p><p>Any assistance getting around it would be greatly appreciated. If there is a file I can export from the laptops that work and import on the new laptop, that would be nice. </p><p>Thanks much! David </p><p>P.S. I donated. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1761775;1761798;,dvandevate
