Again, some work, some don't. </p><p>Most of the time, an error message or three pops up because the old address wants me to enter my password again, which is no longer valid. And that usually scuppers any attempt to copy a folder manually. </p><p>I have unticked the three boxes under account settings so that it doesn't look for new mails every X minutes, when starting up, etc. </p><p>Is there any clever way I can avoid all this?
