Both these laptops allowed me to setup 2 accounts&nbsp;: </p><p>user1@mydomain.com  user2@mydomain.com </p><p>both are hosted by <a href=""http://ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ionos.com</a>.  The server setup is <a href=""http://imap.ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.ionos.com</a> </p><p>When I went to install Thunderbird on my new Windows 11 laptop, it is too cool for school. Tries to be too cute.     I got user1@mydomain.com set up and working, but it won't let me  setup user2.   If I go through several unnatural acts to get past the ""helpfulness"", it complains </p><pre>that the inbound server is already setup. </pre> <p>I can't help, but conclude there is a bug or two in the latest account setup. </p><p>Any assistance getting around it would be greatly appreciated. If there is a file I can export from the laptops that work and import on the new laptop, that would be nice. </p><p>Thanks much! David </p><p>P.S. I donated. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1761775;1761798;,dvandevate

I thought that would be the hard part but it's actually Thunderbird that is giving me headaches. </p><p>I can send and receive mails fine but need to set up my Thunderbird folders again and copy in all my old emails. In other words, a new account has been set up for the same email address and I have kept the old account for the same email address until I have copied out everything I need from it. </p><p>But copying folders and mails doesn't always work and there seems to be absolutely no logic behind it - sometimes it works and something it doesn't. </p><p>Thunderbird won't let me copy my ""Customers"" folder with 30 subfolders in it so I have to do each of these manually. Again, some work, some don't. </p><p>Most of the time, an error message or three pops up because the old address wants me to enter my password again, which is no longer valid. And that usually scuppers any attempt to copy a folder manually. </p><p>I have unticked the three boxes under account settings so that it doesn't look for new mails every X minutes, when starting up, etc. </p><p>Is there any clever way I can avoid all this? Would it help if I did all this offline? </p><p>And does anyone know why the blasted folders are so difficult to copy?!! </p><p>Very grateful for any tips - thanks, </p><p><br> Ian </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",ianwinick
