And, with your attempt to import (which would only make matters worse or impossible to fix), there may be profile corruption. But, here are my suggestions:  </p><p>Since you have thunderbird running, try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles' - this opens a screen, listing all profiles on drive C. you can click to launch each one to see if it's the right one. Normally, the one named default-relase is the one created initially, but you may have changed since then. If the profiles are not corrupt, you should eventually launch the one with your data.  </p><p>But, if the default is on drive D, you will benefit from the Profile Manager.

As part of my efforts to fix the Unable to load profile message, a suggestion I came across ... likely some google/AI suggestion I saw ... I did some sort of Create Profile step to hopefully eventually drill over to my actual profile like the instructions said I could do.  I'm not sure I finished the process or did it right. </p><p>When I got to About: Profiles, the attached is what I saw. I then wasn't sure what you meant by click ""each one"" so at first I clicked the Open Folder button, but then I didn't know what to do.  So then instead of clicking Open Folder I clicked ""Launch Profile"" button in the two cases of seeing a Launch Profile button.  The first Launch Profile button brought me to an ad screen that also had a tab for ""Account Setup."" So it seemed at that point that Thunderbird still wanted me to set up an account, at least when going down this particular path, so I typed in my mailfence email address and mailfence password.  That resulted in a Thunderbird screen that downloaded 66 emails from the mailfence server.  But of course what I want to see is my tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of emails that I've stored in mailfence over these many years, starting with my earthlink email coming into it and then eventually mailfence around 2022.  </p><p>I had already discovered ""Profile Manager"" back when I was trying to fix the Unable to Load Profile thing.  But I'll look at what your specific link about Profile Manager says now. Thanks. </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0

Attached is a screengrab of what I'm seeing. Everything email-message-wise seems to be there ... the hierarchy, the included recently-dated emails. I haven't managed to get my Address Book in though, even after finding View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize and a bunch of squares that included ""Address Book.""  The problem was:  Now what do I do.  I clicked on Address Book but ""Save"" is greyed out. </p><p>Afraid to close Thunderbird until I get the Address Book into my display. </p><p>Oh yeah ... the final steps I did that seems to have worked for getting the right profile into Thunderbird were: </p><p>1.	 In Thunderbird, I clicked the upper right menu and selected Tools &gt; Import. </p><pre>        An Import Tools screen appeared. </pre> <p>2.	I kept the Import from Another Thunderbird Installation selection.  [in the past, I had mostly kept choosing ""import from a profile"" and had kept trying to find the right profile]. </p><pre>       An Import from a Thunderbird Profile screen appeared. </pre> <p>3.	I kept the “Import from… default-esr” selection.  [not sure I had ever seen that selection before.] </p><pre>       What seems to be the latest emails and hierarchy appeared!  Yay! </pre> <p>My Address Book isn't displaying, it seems, though!  There's no ""Address Book"" tab like I'm used to seeing. And when I found an Address Book spot by selecting Tools &gt; Address Book, it's blank. Dunno how to get just the Address Book in or how to get it to display.  I went into View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize, but selecting Address Book resulted in the ""Save"" button NOT being displayed to then make it ""take."" And seeing that blank Address Book in the Tools &gt; Address Book spot is worrisome. Do I need to import just the Address Book from somewhere? Or just set the display? Or am I in a false ""relatively good position"" at this point, after seeing my email looking good, though with a bit different margins and font than I recall. </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0

Select the 'sqlite' option - your addressbook is named abook.sqlite and your collected addressesbook is named history.sqlite  - browse through your various profile folders ....  appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles, looking for files that appear to have been updated recently or are larger that addressbooks in other profiles. click and it will be imported. repeat for the history.sqlite. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
