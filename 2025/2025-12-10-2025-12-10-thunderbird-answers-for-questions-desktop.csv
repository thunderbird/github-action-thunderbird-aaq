Address Book ....abooksqlite and historysqlite combo, to make them take effect. The below says that doing that Import tool method ""generally"" doesn't require a restart. </p><p>I read this: </p><p>AI Overview When importing an address book using Thunderbird's built-in Import tool, a restart is generally not required; the newly imported address book should appear in the Address Book window immediately.  However, if you are manually adding address book files (like abook.mab or abook.sqlite) directly into the Thunderbird profile folder (a method used for profile migration or recovery), you must restart Thunderbird for the changes to be recognized. </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0

The restart for old MAB files is for them to be converted to sqlite. that was years ago. since you have sqlite files, you are not affected. thundebird backups are severa technical files, not intended for viewing. the message files, such as inbox or sent, may be viewed by any mbox viewer software. or online at  <a href=""https://www.mbox-viewer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mbox-viewer.com/</a>    if you regularly do backups, why didn't you restore one today and eliminate the stress you went through? </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I wasn't clear if you were saying that's a good one or bad one to try importing for creating an address book (you said it's created ""initially"" but I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing) but it only has an abook ""mab"" file no sqlite version it seems, anyways, at least the only default-release folder I've noticed so far. </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0

The imports are giving what seems like the same exact results so many times that I thought I was missing a step.  The one time just now that I did an import and then restarted just to see if I got a better result, I ended up with NO address book contents at all, even though there was a display right before the restart. </p><p>I just now noticed that I have no ""Sent"" folder ever since trying to import a good profile.  I checked my Copies and whatevers folder and it said save a copy to Sent in &lt;my mailfence email address&gt;.  Then I changed that setting to Local Folders and sent a test. Thunderbird did magically create a Sent folder for then holding it.  But I'm still missing my old Sent emails, including a critical legal one. </p><p>I'm so ready to wrap up this Thunderbird/Mailfence dealing.

Solong spock. </p><p><br> Yes,Thunderbird 146 likely did had introduce theme handling , the visual and the ux fixes. It s build for you guys to get involved with a more direct css approach to target specific elements. </p><p>Step 1 . Ensure User Customisations are Enabled Step 2. Create or Modify userChrome.css Step3. Force Colors in the Message Content Pane Step 4. Restart Thunderbird Software. </p><p>1. Ensure User Customisations are Enabled&nbsp;: </p><p>Go to the Thunderbird menu &gt; Settings &gt; General. Scroll to the very bottom and click the Config Editor button. Click Accept the Risk and Continue. Search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets. Toggle the value to true by clicking the double-arrow icon. Close Thunderbird completely.  </p><p>2. Create or Modify userChrome.css </p><p>Next, you need to add specific CSS rules to force the background colors you want. </p><p>Open your Thunderbird profile folder. You can find the location by going to the Thunderbird menu &gt; Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Open Folder (under ""Application Basics""). Inside your profile folder, look for a folder named chrome. If it doesn't exist, create it (note the exact spelling, lowercase). Inside the chrome folder, create a new text file named userChrome.css (again, note the exact spelling and extension). Open userChrome.css with a text editor (like Notepad). Paste the following CSS code into the file to target the relevant panes: </p><p>css /* Force white background and black text in Folder Pane */ </p> <ol><li>folderPane, #folderTree { </li></ol> <pre> background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;  color: #000000&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/* Force white background and black text in Message List (Thread Pane) */ </p> <ol><li>threadTree, table[is=""tree-view-table""] { </li></ol> <pre> background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;  color: #000000&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/* Force white background and black text in the Message Pane content area */ /* This requires using userContent.css (see Step 3) for the actual email b </p><p><br> </p><p>3. Force Colors in the Message Content Pane </p><p>The message content pane (where you read emails) often requires userContent.css because it displays web content. </p><p>In the same chrome folder, create a new text file named userContent.css. Open userContent.css and add the following:  </p><p>css /* Force white background and black text for email content */ @-moz-document url-prefix(""about:blank""), url-prefix(""chrome://messenger/content/messageWindow.xhtml""), url-prefix(""chrome://messenger/content/messageBody.xhtml"") { </p><pre> body {    background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;    color: #000000&nbsp;!important;  } </pre> <p>} </p><p><br> 4. Restart Thunderbird </p><p>After saving both userChrome.css and userContent.css, restart Thunderbird. The folder, message list, and message panes should now have a white background with black text, overriding your dark mode theme selection.  </p><p>This method provides granular control over the UI colors, which is the most reliable way to achieve your desired look in newer Thunderbird versions.  </p><p><br> </p><p>Greetings goiglethunderbird. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

Unfortunately the background was still black.  I have toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets set as true. </p><p>I changed to Thunderbird's own dark theme, but still had a dark background. Does userContent.css and userChrome.css take priority over a dark mode theme?  The system theme-auto, which follows the OS settings, gave me a light background. </p><p>In about&gt;config I set layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override to 1 which forces Firefox to use light mode when it uses a dark mode theme and the OS is set to light mode. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work in Thunderbird. </p><p>Sign, it seems with Thunderbird 146 the devs have coded it so that if you use a dark mode theme, that means dark mode.
