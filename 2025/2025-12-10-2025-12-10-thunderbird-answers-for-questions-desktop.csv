And, with your attempt to import (which would only make matters worse or impossible to fix), there may be profile corruption. But, here are my suggestions:  </p><p>Since you have thunderbird running, try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles' - this opens a screen, listing all profiles on drive C. you can click to launch each one to see if it's the right one. Normally, the one named default-relase is the one created initially, but you may have changed since then. If the profiles are not corrupt, you should eventually launch the one with your data.  </p><p>But, if the default is on drive D, you will benefit from the Profile Manager.

As part of my efforts to fix the Unable to load profile message, a suggestion I came across ... likely some google/AI suggestion I saw ... I did some sort of Create Profile step to hopefully eventually drill over to my actual profile like the instructions said I could do.  I'm not sure I finished the process or did it right. </p><p>When I got to About: Profiles, the attached is what I saw. I then wasn't sure what you meant by click ""each one"" so at first I clicked the Open Folder button, but then I didn't know what to do.  So then instead of clicking Open Folder I clicked ""Launch Profile"" button in the two cases of seeing a Launch Profile button.  The first Launch Profile button brought me to an ad screen that also had a tab for ""Account Setup."" So it seemed at that point that Thunderbird still wanted me to set up an account, at least when going down this particular path, so I typed in my mailfence email address and mailfence password.  That resulted in a Thunderbird screen that downloaded 66 emails from the mailfence server.  But of course what I want to see is my tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of emails that I've stored in mailfence over these many years, starting with my earthlink email coming into it and then eventually mailfence around 2022.  </p><p>I had already discovered ""Profile Manager"" back when I was trying to fix the Unable to Load Profile thing.

""Browse through your various profile folders... appdate/roaming....""

I was curious to see what those 2 files would bring in, and the results looked somewhat good, but in a ""Vitamins Taste"" search, that address book result was missing. </p><p>So I tried finding better abook.sqlite and history.sqlite contestants for Address Book import and therefore did a search on my PC for the ""default-esr"" profile that Thunderbird selected by default when I selected ""Import from Another Thunderbird Installation. There were *FOUR*""default-esr"" search results with different filenames, 2 of those having dates just an hour or so apart. I picked one of each.

I had searched on a Vitamins address book entry I used to have that didn't show up, and my brother's address book entry wasn't complete. </p><p>So now I'm going to find  and look through non-""default-esr"" profiles now to see how those look and/or import. </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0

Solong spock. </p><p><br> Yes,Thunderbird 146 likely did had introduce theme handling , the visual and the ux fixes. It s build for you guys to get involved with a more direct css approach to target specific elements. </p><p>Step 1 . Ensure User Customisations are Enabled Step 2. Create or Modify userChrome.css Step3. Force Colors in the Message Content Pane Step 4. Restart Thunderbird Software. </p><p>1. Ensure User Customisations are Enabled&nbsp;: </p><p>Go to the Thunderbird menu &gt; Settings &gt; General. Scroll to the very bottom and click the Config Editor button. Click Accept the Risk and Continue. Search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets. Toggle the value to true by clicking the double-arrow icon. Close Thunderbird completely.  </p><p>2. Create or Modify userChrome.css </p><p>Next, you need to add specific CSS rules to force the background colors you want. </p><p>Open your Thunderbird profile folder. You can find the location by going to the Thunderbird menu &gt; Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Open Folder (under ""Application Basics""). Inside your profile folder, look for a folder named chrome. If it doesn't exist, create it (note the exact spelling, lowercase). Inside the chrome folder, create a new text file named userChrome.css (again, note the exact spelling and extension). Open userChrome.css with a text editor (like Notepad). Paste the following CSS code into the file to target the relevant panes: </p><p>css /* Force white background and black text in Folder Pane */ </p> <ol><li>folderPane, #folderTree { </li></ol> <pre> background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;  color: #000000&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/* Force white background and black text in Message List (Thread Pane) */ </p> <ol><li>threadTree, table[is=""tree-view-table""] { </li></ol> <pre> background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;  color: #000000&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/* Force white background and black text in the Message Pane content area */ /* This requires using userContent.css (see Step 3) for the actual email b </p><p><br> </p><p>3. Force Colors in the Message Content Pane </p><p>The message content pane (where you read emails) often requires userContent.css because it displays web content. </p><p>In the same chrome folder, create a new text file named userContent.css. Open userContent.css and add the following:  </p><p>css /* Force white background and black text for email content */ @-moz-document url-prefix(""about:blank""), url-prefix(""chrome://messenger/content/messageWindow.xhtml""), url-prefix(""chrome://messenger/content/messageBody.xhtml"") { </p><pre> body {    background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;    color: #000000&nbsp;!important;  } </pre> <p>} </p><p><br> 4. Restart Thunderbird </p><p>After saving both userChrome.css and userContent.css, restart Thunderbird. The folder, message list, and message panes should now have a white background with black text, overriding your dark mode theme selection.  </p><p>This method provides granular control over the UI colors, which is the most reliable way to achieve your desired look in newer Thunderbird versions.  </p><p><br> </p><p>Greetings goiglethunderbird. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
