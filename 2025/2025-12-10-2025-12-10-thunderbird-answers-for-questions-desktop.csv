And, with your attempt to import (which would only make matters worse or impossible to fix), there may be profile corruption. But, here are my suggestions:  </p><p>Since you have thunderbird running, try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles' - this opens a screen, listing all profiles on drive C. you can click to launch each one to see if it's the right one. Normally, the one named default-relase is the one created initially, but you may have changed since then. If the profiles are not corrupt, you should eventually launch the one with your data.  </p><p>But, if the default is on drive D, you will benefit from the Profile Manager.
