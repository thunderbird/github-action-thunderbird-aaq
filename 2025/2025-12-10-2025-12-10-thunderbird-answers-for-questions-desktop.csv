And, with your attempt to import (which would only make matters worse or impossible to fix), there may be profile corruption. But, here are my suggestions:  </p><p>Since you have thunderbird running, try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles' - this opens a screen, listing all profiles on drive C. you can click to launch each one to see if it's the right one. Normally, the one named default-relase is the one created initially, but you may have changed since then. If the profiles are not corrupt, you should eventually launch the one with your data.  </p><p>But, if the default is on drive D, you will benefit from the Profile Manager.

As part of my efforts to fix the Unable to load profile message, a suggestion I came across ... likely some google/AI suggestion I saw ... I did some sort of Create Profile step to hopefully eventually drill over to my actual profile like the instructions said I could do.  I'm not sure I finished the process or did it right. </p><p>When I got to About: Profiles, the attached is what I saw. I then wasn't sure what you meant by click ""each one"" so at first I clicked the Open Folder button, but then I didn't know what to do.  So then instead of clicking Open Folder I clicked ""Launch Profile"" button in the two cases of seeing a Launch Profile button.  The first Launch Profile button brought me to an ad screen that also had a tab for ""Account Setup."" So it seemed at that point that Thunderbird still wanted me to set up an account, at least when going down this particular path, so I typed in my mailfence email address and mailfence password.  That resulted in a Thunderbird screen that downloaded 66 emails from the mailfence server.  But of course what I want to see is my tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of emails that I've stored in mailfence over these many years, starting with my earthlink email coming into it and then eventually mailfence around 2022.  </p><p>I had already discovered ""Profile Manager"" back when I was trying to fix the Unable to Load Profile thing.  But I'll look at what your specific link about Profile Manager says now. Thanks. </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0
