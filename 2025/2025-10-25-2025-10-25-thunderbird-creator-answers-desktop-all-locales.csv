When I go to my account settings, I don't see any fields for editing the IMAP server and password for an existing email account. Which is irritating. Am I missing something?

So e.g. instead of Prullenbak it says trash. I also have Thunderbird on another laptop, but those folders are in Dutch, both local and on the server which seems to be logical to me.  Why is the language of these default files different on both laptops, and why can't I change the language for the default folders on the latest version I downloaded? Does anyone have an answer? </p><p>Thanks in advance Lowell Dykstra </p>",thunderbird;languages;,thunderbird,languages,en-US,1774688;,dykstralowell
