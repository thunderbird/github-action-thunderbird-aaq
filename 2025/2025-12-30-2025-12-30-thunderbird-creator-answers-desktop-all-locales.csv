Specifically, the ""Condition"" and ""Action"" columns in the Message Filter window are completely empty. Furthermore, I noticed that columns in the filters settings for my original email account also seem empty as shown in the attached screenshot.  Even the filter setting looks empty, the original setting seems working correctly. I have uninstall and re-install Thunderbird, but it does not fix the issue.

Overall the client has been fast and easy to use, but we have identified a key functionality gap that impacts our day-to-day operations. </p><p>Previously we relied heavily on the ability to search not only in email body text but also inside PDF attachment contents (e.g., specific keywords within attached PDF files). In Thunderbird this capability is currently missing, existing search and add-ons (e.g., Expression Search – NG, etc.) do not index or find text inside PDFs. </p><p>This feature is critical for business users that need to locate emails based on text inside attachments. We would like to request that full-text search of common attachment types (PDF, Word documents, etc.) be considered for inclusion in a future Thunderbird release, ideally with options for indexing and performance controls. </p><p>If this is already on the roadmap, we would appreciate any guidance on how to enable it or track progress. If not, we would be grateful if the team could evaluate this enhancement. </p><p>Thanks for your work on Thunderbird and wishing you a happy new year! </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,1790087;,ellinasandreas2001
