Been doing this for years.  Well, I did it just now and when TB restarted I got a warning that said Thunderbird is an app I downloaded from the internet, do I trust it?  First time that has happened.d  I clicked on the button that said to go ahead and open it. </p><p>When TB opened, it wasn't aware of any of my email accounts.  It's almost like I was opening it for the first time – except for 187 random old emails in an inbox. </p><p>Is there a way to recover from this?  I had a lot of emails stored in inboxes and outboxes that would be disastrous for me to lose.  They aren't there right now. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1789930;1789931;,clintoconner2
