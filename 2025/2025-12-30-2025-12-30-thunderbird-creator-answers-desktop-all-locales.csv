Been doing this for years.  Well, I did it just now and when TB restarted I got a warning that said Thunderbird is an app I downloaded from the internet, do I trust it?  First time that has happened.d  I clicked on the button that said to go ahead and open it. </p><p>When TB opened, it wasn't aware of any of my email accounts.  It's almost like I was opening it for the first time – except for 187 random old emails in an inbox. </p><p>Is there a way to recover from this?  I had a lot of emails stored in inboxes and outboxes that would be disastrous for me to lose.  They aren't there right now. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1789930;1789931;1789944;,clintoconner2

One week ago, I added a new email account to Thunderbird.  Today I tried to set up filters for the new account in the same way, but they are not working. Specifically, the ""Condition"" and ""Action"" columns in the Message Filter window are completely empty. Furthermore, I noticed that columns in the filters settings for my original email account also seem empty as shown in the attached screenshot.  Even the filter setting looks empty, the original setting seems working correctly. I have uninstall and re-install Thunderbird, but it does not fix the issue. Could you please guide me on how to resolve this issue? </p><p>I greatly appreciate the community's support. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1789981;,tet.suzaki.oregon
