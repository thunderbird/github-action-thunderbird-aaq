It was working for over a decade before this. </p><p>However, going into the normal account folder inboxes DOES allow me to click the ""+New Message"" button and start/compose a new message. </p><p>I can still <em>reply</em> to messages in the local and virtual folders, just not start a new message. </p><p>I have tried disabling all security software. No luck. </p><p>I have ran Help &gt; Troubleshoot mode with no addons.
