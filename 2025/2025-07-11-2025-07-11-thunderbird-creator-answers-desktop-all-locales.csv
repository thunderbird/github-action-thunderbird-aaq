I want the icons off to the right of the text menus, on the same line, the way it's been possible to establish since Tbird was in the low-30s for version numbers. Instead, the update refused to respect my personalizations, and hid the menu bar completely and makes it impossible to combine with the icons. I dimly recall that there was an about:config solution to this in earlier versions, but can't remember or find it (or confirm it would work with Eclipse). </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",Jaws13
