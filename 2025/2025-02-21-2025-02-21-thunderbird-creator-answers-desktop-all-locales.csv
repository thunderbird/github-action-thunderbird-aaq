There has been no changes on my end, nothing different, it just stopped working. No emails whatsoever. Very, very inconvenient I dont need information as to what I can do as nothing has changed at my end.  . </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1713530;,accounts303

It usually starts with trying to forward an email from a trusted source to another because it contains information they want/need. Usually both are family. Even when I have paired it down to just a new outgoing email and only told the other family member that here is the address for our son and the house he and his wife are buying and the address so they can look it up I still get the following message from Thunderbird and denying to send it: ""Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded:  [VO-101] Message blocked due to spam content in the message.. Please check the message and try again."" </p><p>What can I do to sort this out and get my emails working again? Thank you!

With my old email, I would have certain subscriptions signed up with a subaddressed email, or plus addressed- i.e. ""email@domain.com"" being the primary account and ""email+netflix@domain.com"" being for my Netflix account, for instance. </p><p>I've noticed that since transitioning, I don't receive any of those subaddressed emails, but when I check on my Macbook (just the default Mail application) all of them are there. </p><p>Can anyone help me understand why this is? I like Thunderbird as it's been fairly simple to set up and customize how I like to read my emails, and I'm looking for a solution to this - or an alternative. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1713537;1713538;,kattnip.official
