In TB go to menu Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Profile Folder &gt; Open Folder... then quit TB. In the profile folder look for any prefs.js or prefs-x.js files and report them with their names and their sizes </p>,Mapenzi,false,0,0

Largely i think because AOL are not really managing anything it is Yahoo now and as they are owned by bankers it is not really a technology company. </p><p>However it sounds like you settings are not correct.  SMTP should be using oauth as the authentication method and that is initially configured using web pages and an authentication token is stored in the password manager.  But at no time does the little windows asking you for a password appear with the option to save the password,  Re-authentication of Oauth  uses a full page web page, usually badged as AOL IIRC </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
