I'm trying to set up automatic config for DAV contacts and calendars located on my Nextcloud server. I've followed this doc: <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration:ConfigFileFormat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration:ConfigFileFormat</a> and I've managed to get at least the calendar to connect, but with one unfortunate condition: I have to open Thunderbird's about:config and set browser.opaqueResponseBlocking and browser.opaqueResponseBlocking.javascriptValidator to false. </p><p>Otherwise the request to DAV gets blocked by Thunderbird for some reason. Here is some information about my current setup: IMAP and SMTP servers are located at <a href=""http://mail.mydomain.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mydomain.com</a>, and email addresses look like user@mydomain.com. The webserver serving config-v1.1.xml is located there too, but it's behind a reverse proxy, which also proxies <a href=""http://nextcloud.mydomain.com"" rel=""nofollow"">nextcloud.mydomain.com</a>.

I've added this section to the xml file: </p><pre>   &lt;addressBook type=""carddav""&gt;      &lt;username&gt;%EMAILLOCALPART%&lt;/username&gt;      &lt;authentication&gt;http-basic&lt;/authentication&gt;      &lt;serverURL&gt;<a href=""https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/remote.php/dav/&lt;/serverURL&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/remote.php/dav/&lt;/serverURL&gt;</a>    &lt;/addressBook&gt; </pre> <pre>   &lt;calendar type=""caldav""&gt;      &lt;username&gt;%EMAILLOCALPART%&lt;/username&gt;      &lt;authentication&gt;http-basic&lt;/authentication&gt;      &lt;serverURL&gt;<a href=""https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/remote.php/dav/&lt;/serverURL&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nextcloud.mydomain.com/remote.php/dav/&lt;/serverURL&gt;</a>    &lt;/calendar&gt; </pre> <p>(username on the Nextcloud matches the local part of the email address) </p><p>But looking at Network tab of the dev console I can still see that it's trying to get well-known dav from my top level domain.

It will send out maybe 5 messages and then just stick at ""Sending Message"" under the Activity Manager view.  If you close Thunderbird and the Activity Manager and reopen, you can then do ""Send Unsent Mail"" and another 5ish will send before the behavior repeats. </p><p>I attempted deleting the Global Database from Profile directory, rebuilding, uninstalling/reinstalling 144.0.1, eliminating AV scanning, turned off Indexing, emptied out directories, nothing seems to change the behavior.  Sending individual messages works fine. </p><p>Rolled back Thunderbird to the 140.4.0esr release and the program will send normally without the hang. Updated to 141.4, also works fine. Updated to 142.4, this is the first version I see the behavior. I collected a Performance Profile which can be reviewed at https://share.firefox.dev/4nxcltl for the issue happening on the 142.4 version. </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,1775935;1775938;1775946;,winn_bt
