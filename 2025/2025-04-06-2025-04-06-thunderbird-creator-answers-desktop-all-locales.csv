User!,"<p>I am in a bit of a mess so I am hoping that someone might be able to sort me out......and to clear my conscience, I made a small contribution to Thunderbird recently!    Ever since Microsoft had ""Windows Live Mail"" I have been using it and VERY successfully until Optusnet were having difficulties with it communicating with 'any one'.      So recentIy I changed my email address from &lt;gnwalton@optusnet,<a href=""http://com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">com.au</a>&gt; to &lt;gnwalton58@gmail.com&gt; and had Gmail read my optusnet account as another account to read. </p><p>Optus are my ""carrier"" (my access to the internet) and have been ever since their inception many years ago.  </p><p>1.   Please look at Image 1 screen dump:     You can see from this that I have had various spasmodic entrances into Thunderbird, which I would now like to erase.    How? </p><p>2.    Windows Live Mail had a feature where, while I believed it was downloading my INbox and SENT files from the Optus server or Internet, it also automatically saved these files to my own computer hard drive.     I was therefore able to attach a past file (perhaps years ago) to a current email as an attachment........without any archiving!     I have instructed Thunderbird to POP my files - which I believe is not allowing them to reside in the ""cloud"" - so that they now reside IN Thunderbird ON my computer?     Could you please confirm my beliefs,   or otherwise? </p><p>3.     Perhaps all this info is contained somewhere is a separate file so I would appreciate your referral to such info and make life easy for you. </p><p>4.    Perhaps I should also explain I am a retired octogenarian chemical engineer who has been interested in and solving process problems all my life!!     I'm just naturally curious! </p><p>Kind regards,         Geoff Walton           Melbourne, Australia </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",gnwalton58
