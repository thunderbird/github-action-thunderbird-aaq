User!,"<p>I am in a bit of a mess so I am hoping that someone might be able to sort me out......and to clear my conscience, I made a small contribution to Thunderbird recently!    Ever since Microsoft had ""Windows Live Mail"" I have been using it and VERY successfully until Optusnet were having difficulties with it communicating with 'any one'.      So recentIy I changed my email address from &lt;gnwalton@optusnet,<a href=""http://com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">com.au</a>&gt; to &lt;gnwalton58@gmail.com&gt; and had Gmail read my optusnet account as another account to read. </p><p>Optus are my ""carrier"" (my access to the internet) and have been ever since their inception many years ago.  </p><p>1.   Please look at Image 1 screen dump:     You can see from this that I have had various spasmodic entrances into Thunderbird, which I would now like to erase.    How? </p><p>2.    Windows Live Mail had a feature where, while I believed it was downloading my INbox and SENT files from the Optus server or Internet, it also automatically saved these files to my own computer hard drive.     I was therefore able to attach a past file (perhaps years ago) to a current email as an attachment........without any archiving!     I have instructed Thunderbird to POP my files - which I believe is not allowing them to reside in the ""cloud"" - so that they now reside IN Thunderbird ON my computer?     Could you please confirm my beliefs,   or otherwise? </p><p>3.     Perhaps all this info is contained somewhere is a separate file so I would appreciate your referral to such info and make life easy for you. </p><p>4.    Perhaps I should also explain I am a retired octogenarian chemical engineer who has been interested in and solving process problems all my life!!     I'm just naturally curious! </p><p>Kind regards,         Geoff Walton           Melbourne, Australia </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1723662;1723667;1723894;1723923;,gnwalton58

Now, with Thunderbird version 137.0.1 (64-Bit) in Win 10 pro I have the problem that although copying the files to the right place again (roaming) the addressbooks stayed empty, but all the old mail structures and mails came nicely over in the new system. Manually copying the abook.mab (100KB) and history.mab (50KB) to the roaming profiles has absolutely no effect, the addressbooks stay empty stubbornly.  I have deleted and uninstalled Thunderbird, deleted the Roamings and Locals to make a clean new install with re-copying to the profile files - no effect either.  Ten minutes ago while looking for the version a new update rolled in, so I restarted, to no avail - still empty addressbooks.  I could always print these files and manually rewrite the 3 abooks, but this should be the last remedy only. Any ideas what is running wrong? A BIG THANKS for your help!

I'm having some issues with Thunderbird and need some help.  I'm not sure if I have 1 profile or 2 as I restored old messages from a pre windows re instillation a few weeks ago, i followed the directions from Mozilla's support article.  Today I went to compact folder on my main e-mail account and received error that the folder can't be compacted because it contains unexpected data.  I then used the repair folder and when Thunderbird restarted, my inbox message are all gone, about 20 of them.   If i do a search in Thunderbird for a known e-mail message, the search screen shows the e-mail message subject line and when I click on it, the new tab will display no message found. </p><p>Before this happened I did not see the archive folder in the folder pane, but did not think anything about it until now.  I was thinking the messages that are no longer in my inbox would be in the archive folder without being able to show or find the archive folder hoping it may hold the messages. </p><p>Is it possible the messages are somewhere on my PC and can be recovered? If so what is the best way to accomplish this?  In addition how do i get the archive folders to show up on my e-mail accounts.  If this is not the correct forum, please let me know so I can correct this! </p><p>Thanks! MM </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",Matt_McKee

I am able to produce a space between words by holding down the option key while hitting the space bar. Keyboard works fine in other apps. Anyone having a fix for this?

I have several email accounts (Xfinity, gmail) that work well together on my current computer. I've followed the instructions (very good) on your help article and that generally seems to work. Usually, I move messages to subject or correspondent specific subfolders on a local folder (a holdover from Outlook processes to speed up finding related messages in a large data store (3.5 gig?)
