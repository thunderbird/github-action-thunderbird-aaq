User!,"<p>I am in a bit of a mess so I am hoping that someone might be able to sort me out......and to clear my conscience, I made a small contribution to Thunderbird recently!    Ever since Microsoft had ""Windows Live Mail"" I have been using it and VERY successfully until Optusnet were having difficulties with it communicating with 'any one'.      So recentIy I changed my email address from &lt;gnwalton@optusnet,<a href=""http://com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">com.au</a>&gt; to &lt;gnwalton58@gmail.com&gt; and had Gmail read my optusnet account as another account to read. </p><p>Optus are my ""carrier"" (my access to the internet) and have been ever since their inception many years ago.  </p><p>1.   Please look at Image 1 screen dump:     You can see from this that I have had various spasmodic entrances into Thunderbird, which I would now like to erase.    How? </p><p>2.    Windows Live Mail had a feature where, while I believed it was downloading my INbox and SENT files from the Optus server or Internet, it also automatically saved these files to my own computer hard drive.     I was therefore able to attach a past file (perhaps years ago) to a current email as an attachment........without any archiving!     I have instructed Thunderbird to POP my files - which I believe is not allowing them to reside in the ""cloud"" - so that they now reside IN Thunderbird ON my computer?     Could you please confirm my beliefs,   or otherwise? </p><p>3.     Perhaps all this info is contained somewhere is a separate file so I would appreciate your referral to such info and make life easy for you. </p><p>4.    Perhaps I should also explain I am a retired octogenarian chemical engineer who has been interested in and solving process problems all my life!!     I'm just naturally curious! </p><p>Kind regards,         Geoff Walton           Melbourne, Australia </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1723662;1723667;,gnwalton58

Now, with Thunderbird version 137.0.1 (64-Bit) in Win 10 pro I have the problem that although copying the files to the right place again (roaming) the addressbooks stayed empty, but all the old mail structures and mails came nicely over in the new system. Manually copying the abook.mab (100KB) and history.mab (50KB) to the roaming profiles has absolutely no effect, the addressbooks stay empty stubbornly.  I have deleted and uninstalled Thunderbird, deleted the Roamings and Locals to make a clean new install with re-copying to the profile files - no effect either.  Ten minutes ago while looking for the version a new update rolled in, so I restarted, to no avail - still empty addressbooks.  I could always print these files and manually rewrite the 3 abooks, but this should be the last remedy only. Any ideas what is running wrong? A BIG THANKS for your help!
