I have Thunderbird installed on both and the Linux Thunderbird linked to the profile on Windows. This has up until now worked for me. The Windows Thunderbird is on the esr channel (140.0.1esr) and the linux Thunderbird is installed from the software repository. I'm guessing the two Thunderbird versions on Windows and Linux have gotten out of ""sync""? Now when I use the Linux Thunderbird I get the message that the profile has been modified by a newer copy of Thunderbird (the last update on on Windows). </p><p><a href=""http://UbuntuHandbook.org"" rel=""nofollow"">UbuntuHandbook.org</a> details how to install Mozilla Thunderbir via ppa. </p><p>I would really like to access my emails from both operating systems. </p><p>Can I install Thunderbird via the ppa command to get the esr client over the top of the existing Linux Thunderbird or should I uninstall the existing package first?

This way, I can use aliases like alias1@mydomain.com, alias2@mydomain.com, etc., without exposing my actual address. </p><p>This part works perfectly. </p><p>The problem: When replying to a message sent to alias1@mydomain.com, Thunderbird automatically uses secret@mydomain.com as the sender address. That defeats the purpose — the recipient now sees my secret address, which I wanted to keep hidden. </p><p>Thunderbird offers a workaround via identities, but it requires creating a separate identity for every single alias, which becomes unmanageable if you use a lot of them. </p><p>My attempted solution: My idea was to have my mail server insert a header like: </p><p>X-Alias: alias1@mydomain.com </p><p>Then, on sending, the server could rewrite the From: header using that value — thus preserving the alias and protecting my actual address. </p><p>However, I discovered that Thunderbird strips custom headers like X-Alias when sending. That breaks the solution. </p><p>My questions: 1. Is there any way to configure Thunderbird to preserve specific custom headers like X-Alias during sending? 2. Alternatively, is there a better or recommended approach to achieving what I’m trying to do — replying from the alias address automatically, without exposing the real one, and without creating hundreds of identities? </p><p>I’d really appreciate any ideas, insights, or suggestions. Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",fisoc70290

I have just recently installed Thunderbird for Android, and when I view emails in my inbox, I still cannot see emails in the thread, even though I just replied to one of the emails in my inbox. Now Thunderbird does realize that I have sent an email--I can view my email in the Sent folder. But I cannot see that email in the email thread in my inbox. </p><p>This is strange; with other email clients I can see emails that I reply to (meaning, I get an email from someone, see that email in my Inbox, and then reply to that email). I can see those emails that I sent out, in my Inbox in other clients, but not with Thunderbird for Android.  </p><p>Apart from that, I really do like the Android client. Is there any option I need to configure to allow me to view my own emails sent out, in my inbox? I checked the Settings but didn't see anything to switch on/off. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",prr
