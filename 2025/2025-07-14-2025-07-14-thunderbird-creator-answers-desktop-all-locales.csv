This way, I can use aliases like alias1@mydomain.com, alias2@mydomain.com, etc., without exposing my actual address. </p><p>This part works perfectly. </p><p>The problem: When replying to a message sent to alias1@mydomain.com, Thunderbird automatically uses secret@mydomain.com as the sender address. That defeats the purpose — the recipient now sees my secret address, which I wanted to keep hidden. </p><p>Thunderbird offers a workaround via identities, but it requires creating a separate identity for every single alias, which becomes unmanageable if you use a lot of them. </p><p>My attempted solution: My idea was to have my mail server insert a header like: </p><p>X-Alias: alias1@mydomain.com </p><p>Then, on sending, the server could rewrite the From: header using that value — thus preserving the alias and protecting my actual address. </p><p>However, I discovered that Thunderbird strips custom headers like X-Alias when sending. That breaks the solution. </p><p>My questions: 1. Is there any way to configure Thunderbird to preserve specific custom headers like X-Alias during sending? 2. Alternatively, is there a better or recommended approach to achieving what I’m trying to do — replying from the alias address automatically, without exposing the real one, and without creating hundreds of identities? </p><p>I’d really appreciate any ideas, insights, or suggestions. Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",fisoc70290
