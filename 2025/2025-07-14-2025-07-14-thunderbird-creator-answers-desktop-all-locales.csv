This way, I can use aliases like alias1@mydomain.com, alias2@mydomain.com, etc., without exposing my actual address. </p><p>This part works perfectly. </p><p>The problem: When replying to a message sent to alias1@mydomain.com, Thunderbird automatically uses secret@mydomain.com as the sender address. That defeats the purpose — the recipient now sees my secret address, which I wanted to keep hidden. </p><p>Thunderbird offers a workaround via identities, but it requires creating a separate identity for every single alias, which becomes unmanageable if you use a lot of them. </p><p>My attempted solution: My idea was to have my mail server insert a header like: </p><p>X-Alias: alias1@mydomain.com </p><p>Then, on sending, the server could rewrite the From: header using that value — thus preserving the alias and protecting my actual address. </p><p>However, I discovered that Thunderbird strips custom headers like X-Alias when sending. That breaks the solution. </p><p>My questions: 1. Is there any way to configure Thunderbird to preserve specific custom headers like X-Alias during sending? 2. Alternatively, is there a better or recommended approach to achieving what I’m trying to do — replying from the alias address automatically, without exposing the real one, and without creating hundreds of identities? </p><p>I’d really appreciate any ideas, insights, or suggestions. Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1749358;1749468;1749659;,fisoc70290

I have suffered from many upgrades that did not work well with my style of communication. However, the disappointing upgrade events using TB have been well overridden by the successful use of the overall e-mail client. Today’s topic is the latest upgrade, 140.0.1esr. The message page in dark mode shows darker links and text than it did using the add-on (Dark Mode). I have lost the ability to control text colors and the link status colors. I do not want to wander into the Config Editor to try and correct the linking status with a custom CSS entry. I have discovered the switch on the message panel to disable the “Dark Message Board”. I don’t like this method.
