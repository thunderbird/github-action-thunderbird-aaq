The user is responsible for backing up for protection against outages.  Unless you deleted the POP account on your PC, you should still have all downloaded inbox messages and all sent messages. The change done by your email provider would have zero effect on a POP account on your PC. In your earlier post, you indicated that a tech person advised on what to do on your PC, and that you are unsure of what that was.  If that person is available, it may be good to ask. From your post, I infer that the POP account is no longer there. True? If he deleted the POP account and created an IMAP account, he may have destroyed everything you had. So, if the account is not there, I suggest this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'Profiles' and click 'about:profiles'  - on that screen will be listed all profiles thunderbird is aware of  - click the 'open folder' button for each profile and then open the Mail folder to see if your POP account is there.  </p><p>That's the best I can offer, Robin. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
