Second, if you now have an IMAP account, we can quickly (most likely) create a POP account.  - IMAP and POP accounts share the same syntax for the outgoing SMTP server. So, click to 'account settings', highlight the IMAP account in left sidebar, click the 'edit outgoing server' button and write down the server name - now, click the 'server settings' link on 'account settings' pane and write down the incoming server name  - post both of those and I think we can then construct the POP settings.  </p><p>The plan will be to create a POP account alongside the IMAP account and then remove the IMAP account after everthing is working. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

For POP mail accounts everything remains on disk where it always was, it is just a matter of finding it. </p><p>Your account recovery software ""should have identified the file as something like ""inbox"" with a path somewhere in the Windows appdata folders.  If that is the case, not the path and file name, it will save a lot of looking later.  That is the file with all of your message from an account inbox in it,  not just a single email. If it identified a file with WDSEML in the file extension it is a garbage file which may or may not be the complete email as those files are limited to the first 40kb (I think I recall from 20 years ago) of the message and are written for the benefit of windows search.
