Thunderbird is also an email application, be it on Android or one of the other supported operating systems. </p><p>If you could offer any sort of reasoning as what the two have to do with one another it would be most helpful.  My initial feeling is it is like having a BMW and a Audi in the garage.  Both are cars made mostly in Europe but they have nothing to do with one another except share an owner and parking place. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You're referring to a known issue in Thunderbird Address Book version 145 (and similar builds), where drag-and-drop into mailing lists (also called distribution lists) no longer works as it did in earlier versions. </p><p>‚úÖ The problem: In Thunderbird 115+ (including 145), the address book has been redesigned, and drag &amp; drop behavior is broken or changed: </p><p>- You can't drag individual contacts from the main address book into a mailing list anymore. - The mailing list UI doesn't accept dropped items as before. </p><p>üí° Workarounds / Solutions: üõ† 1. Manually Add Contacts to the Mailing List </p><p>You can still: 1. Open the mailing list by double-clicking it. 2. In the window that opens, type the name or email address of the contact manually. Thunderbird auto-completes based on your address book. 3. Click OK / Save when finished. ‚ö†Ô∏è This is tedious for large lists, but still works. </p><p>üîÑ 2. Switch to ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù Address Book (if possible) Some users have had success using older Thunderbird versions (e.g. 102.x), where drag &amp; drop still works. - You can install an older portable Thunderbird version alongside the new one for managing contacts. </p><p>üß© 3. Use an Add-on (if available) Some Thunderbird extensions (like ""Mailing List Tools"" or ""CardBook"") have reintroduced better list handling. Keep an eye on: - <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net</a> - Search for Mailing list management tools or Cardbook üîç Compatibility with Thunderbird 145 must be confirmed before use. </p><p>‚è≥ 4. Wait for Fixes This is a known issue, and many users have <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/</a> and the <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/</a> </p><p>üëâ Developers are likely aware and may fix it in a future update. </p><p>üîö Summary | Option            | Status                    | | ----------------- | ------------------------- | | Drag &amp; Drop       | ‚ùå Currently broken        | | Manual entry      | ‚úÖ Works, but tedious      | | Older Thunderbird | ‚úÖ Drag &amp; drop works there | | Add-ons           | üîÑ May help               | | Future updates    | ‚è≥ Likely fix coming       | </p>",Germanus,false,0,0
