Whodathunk! </p><p>When this problem started, I also encountered intermittent problems connecting to my mouse and keyboard. At first I assumed my tablet PC was causing the problem(s). But then I noticed that my PC sometimes wasn't detecting some thumb drives connected to my USB expander port. Lots of tests I did showed that my PC was fine, but that the problem was with my multiport USB expander. Consequently, I ordered a replacement port expander and did the replacement yesterday. That fixed the intermittent port connection issue. But to my amazement, it also cleared up the Thunderbird to Comcast connection issue! Why the two were related is beyond me, since even when the expansion port seemed to be working, I still had these email problems. In fact, after the replacement, I spent a day or two constantly testing my email to make sure the problem went away. It did, and all is fine now. </p><p>Apparently, the expansion port, even when it was ""working"", was still somehow corrupting the Thunderbird to Comcast connection link. </p><p>Live and learn!

No.  The term in the specification is ""mail drop"" at a practical level most providers use what they call the inbox as the mail drop for POP accounts.

If i do this, is it also possible to make back ups of while it is still downloading?  in case my pc or connection fails mainly. </p><p>- I am still stuck understanding how i can download my folders from the server if i use pop3. can i send the contents to the inbox and then would they be downloaded too?  </p><p>-I have quite a few folders so considered using imap but am concerned that I wont be able to tell what has downloaded fully and with all attachments downloaded. and,that when i delete folders or mail,that I may find that i only have copies of headers and not the full emails. but would impa be a safer option here? and is there a way to make sure that everything is fully downloaded so i can back them up and remove from servers knowing that its all fully there?

So I trashed it. It is not a part of the profile.  Second, what you have in the Documents folder is not  profile but an account. Users sometimes put accounts in other than profile to keep the profile folder small. So, whatever is in the Documents folder was NOT placed there by Thunderbird, but by you at some point in the past. If everything for your accounts is in the profile, the folder in Documents can be safely deleted. BUT, I suggest you first verify that this is true. To do that, I suggest these steps:  - click to 'account settings'  - locate the account in left sidebar that reflects the account in Documents folder  - now, click the 'server settings' pane and look at bottom line - Local directory. Is it pointing to the Documents folder? Be careful here, as the inbox in documents folder has a date of October 18th, 2025. That was yesterday, indicating that this account is live. Don't delete anything without posting back on your findings.  </p><p>For assistance on the profile, I suggest doing a screenshot of the imapmail folder in the active profile and a screenshot of each account folder. To get to the active folder, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'. the imapmail folder is there. If there are POP accounts, click the Mail folder and do screenshots from there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you're concerned about profile size, you might check the Mail folder to see if those same POP accounts are also in the Mail folder. If so, I would check the server settings pane for them to verify that the local folders link points to the appropriate folder. (Same steps as in prior post to verify that IMAP account.) Otherwise, all I can suggest, if saving space is desired, is to unsubscribe from the allmail folders in all accounts, also the Important folders (assuming you don't directly use them). I suggest that because the Allmail folder contains all messages so is a duplicate of inbox and sent and trash and important.  Also, Important is a Gmail managed folder and, unless you need it, I would unsubscribe. You also have a lot of messages in trash in various accounts. IF you do unsubscribe from those folders, you will need to exit thunderbird and delete the folders in windows file explorer to save the disk space. Incidentally, unsubscribing from allmail and important folders also cuts cpu time almost 50% and network traffic by 50%. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If the POP accounts are gone, just delete the folders  For IMAP accounts, if you have thunderbird shut down, you can delete any message folders (such as Inbox.sbd) and thunderbird will recreate on next restart.  If you want the account in the Documents folder put back into the profile, here are the steps: - exit thunderbird - COPY (not move) the 7lwbxty3.Gord folder to the profile folder in the imapmail folder  - now, start thunderbird, click to the account server settings pane - at bottom, where it links to local server, click 'browse' and then locate and select the place in profile where you copied it. Thunderbird will insist on a restart.  - after the restart, check and verify that the account is working properly. you can then delete folder in the Documents folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
