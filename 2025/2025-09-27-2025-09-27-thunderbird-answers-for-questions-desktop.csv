So I am guessing the single click thing is something of a furphy and you simply don't want to be selecting them one at a time and deleting them.  I think it is a very good thing that Windows has natively supported such and action for more than 30 years as does Mac OS but you appear to be using Linux and what it supports is something of a lottery as windows managers are not all created Equal. Each iteration of Mozilla's lists has carried the exact same functionality as that offered by Windows and Mac OS,  so I am assuming it works the same way on your distribution.  Perhaps the place to ask is with the distribution,  not the application.  If Linus does not support these basic operating system shortcuts.  My understanding is Firefox honors the shortcut keys mentioned below and as Thunderbird inherits most of that from Firefox I must assume it will work on Linux. If it does not that is a failing of Linux in my humble opinion. </p><p>So deleting mails.  Selecting them really.  I will quote the Google AI as it provides shortcut keys on more platforms than I was going to and nothing special for Linux,  so I guess it should work there.  </p> <blockquote> The keyboard shortcut to ""select all"" depends on your operating system: Ctrl+A for Windows and most other systems, and Command+A for macOS. This command selects all items within the current context, such as text in a document, files in a folder, or cells on a spreadsheet </blockquote> <p>Once selected depress the delete key.  No clicks required, although you can select the delete icon if you really insist on using your mouse. </p><p>Use the shift and Ctrl keys to fine tune a list selection.  Again I will quote Google AI as it appears to be more erudite than I am. </p> <blockquote> Non-contiguous selection: Holding down the Ctrl key while clicking individual items in a list allows for the selection of multiple, non-adjacent items. This is in contrast to a simple click, which typically selects only one item, or a Shift-click, which selects a range of items. </blockquote> <p>For multiple sections in a couple of clicks </p> <blockquote> Shift + Click for Multi-Selection: When selecting items in a list (e.g., files in a folder, emails in an inbox), clicking an item while holding down the Shift key typically selects a contiguous range of items between the previously selected item and the newly clicked item. </blockquote> <p>So select an entry in a list.  Hold shift and select another distant entry in the list.  Everything between the two clicks including the two list items will be selected.  Now change to holding the Ctrl key and click on the few items in the middle of the list you actually do not want selected and they will be deselected without loosing the selection status of the other items.  Likewise if you click the item a second time it's selection status with reverse. </p><p>Then there is the web way.  You turn on the check box view in the table view list and place a tick in the box of everything you want selected.  No faster than the old click and delete one at a time, unless you use the select all box on the title bar, but apparently something folk think is needed because web sites don't have keyboard shortcuts to select list items. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-09-27-03-55-57-760f50.png""> </p><p>You can change the ""view using this menu.  I suggest any mass activity be done in the table as you can see way more items in the list at one time and the web style check box is available in that view.  It is not in the card view. </p><p>However all of that will be much easier if you sort your lists into something that resembles the order of mail you want to delete.  Like date received if you only want to remove mail before or after a certain date,  or sort by status,  so all read mails are contiguously displayed ready to select. </p><p>You claim you are going to be making some 69 thousand decisions.  Ctrl +A and the delete key can reduce that to a couple of keystrokes and a single decision.  But it is a blunt instrument.  So sorting would make the fire turning of what you want to keep much easier.  But bulk deletions are not a difficult thing to do. </p><p>Just be aware that in an IMAP context each individual mail with have back and forth traffic to the mail server involved,  Also the cases where POP mail has been retained on the server ""until I delete it"" .  Deleting more than a thousand or so at a time can lead to server timeouts and you only think the job is done until 10 minutes later those lists start populating again with all the mails that did not get deleted before the timeout. So do not try with all of your mails in one go unless you have a fibre  internet  connection to the server and about a 1Gbps upload speed (Corporate environments only really, and even then only a few of them) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In  that Thunderbird has never actually managed to log into the mail account using the credentials you provided.

Clicking for a manual setup from that point will create a non functioning account with only an inbox. </li></ol> <p>So perhaps with some answers from you, so folk are not guessing about the what you did or why.

You got Yahoo to work,  so I am not really looking at general oauth failure causes, but mention this one as security software has a rather ugly habit of disabling them without consultation. So check the Thunderbird settings for cookies </p><p>In bug <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1978361#c53"" rel=""nofollow"">1978361 </a>I see it suggested that setting mailnews.oauth.usePrivateBrowser to true in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">Config Editor</a> is a workaround for retained information in the case of Yahoo accounts and ATT.
