Thunderbird is unusable because Yahoo have decided your authorization for Thunderbird has expired and needs to be renewed.  This can occur at any time but my observation is that those using a VPN, often one that comes with an antivirus product, have significantly more issues with re-authentication requests from Yahoo and Google than those that do not use a VPN.  I have never been asked to re authenticate and I do not use a VPN. </p><p>It is just a shame Yahoo do not host the request from a Yahoo domain for these pages. Even worse, they can not help themselves but push advertising whenever and where ever they can. This results in folk seeing what is actually a legitimate password request to gain access as a popup to be dismissed.  Thanks Yahoo. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
