I am totally unfamiliar with this issue but know it involves an encrypted password.  A net search so far is of little help though I did run into a statement that windows doesn't have this issue.  I use linux and searching my package manager I find quite a few SASL mechanism plugins (who knew?) but no way to differentiate any.  ATT's site is useless.  Is anyone here familiar with this problem?  In the meantime, I see 1 called login mechanism plugin - no, thats deprecated of course, says use the plain one so its that one for me.
