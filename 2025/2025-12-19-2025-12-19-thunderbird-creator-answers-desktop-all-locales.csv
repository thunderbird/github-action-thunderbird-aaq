This has been intentionally set to “Split addresses” mode, where (according to Proton) I can “Setup multiple email addresses individually”, and I have also disabled “Show all mail”. </li><li> I have set up a new Thunderbird account for each Proton Mail address. </li></ul> <p>After only a couple of days of migrating my Outlook messages over to Thunderbird (in Proton Mail), two items of concern became apparent – this query here is the much more important issue; I’ll raise another question here on the community for the other problem. </p><p>Now I understand that all of the folders imported or created in Proton Mail have no association with mail addresses.  I also expect – but please tell me if I’m wrong – that on the basis of Thunderbird being configured to “Subscribe” to all folders, as well as having the server setting of “Show only subscribed folders” <em>unchecked</em> for each account, then I should see all messages in all folders across all accounts. </p><p>I’ve only just started the migration, but even now I’ve imported ~7,000 messages and – based upon the presumption that all accounts <em>should</em> see all folders and their messages – it appears to be a very inconsistent (and worrying!) picture (see attachment). </p><p>So far, I’ve: </p> <ul><li> Resynced the Proton Mail Bridge.  And resynced it again.  And again! </li><li> I’ve even run a repair on the Proton Mail Bridge. </li><li> Before any of the two steps above began, I deleted the accounts and data from Thunderbird.  When Proton Mail Bridge has then finally resynced, I added the accounts back in again. </li><li> I’ve even gone as far as deleting my Thunderbird profile to effectively start it all again. </li></ul> <p>And finally, on a second machine (Dell laptop, same config as desktop above), I installed the same three apps and then added only <em>one</em> account to Thunderbird, which returned me just the one single message in the Inbox - absolutely nothing in any of the folders. </p><p>The Proton Mail app does show all messages in all of the correct folders, so could this be a Thunderbird issue, a Proton Mail Bridge issue, a combination, or something completely different. </p><p>As I said at the beginning, any and all constructive and helpful feedback will be most gratefully received. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",TechD

When I immediately revisit Subscribe, it <em>may</em> show one or two folders changed, but it now seems to happily ignore the many others I'd tried to set. </p><p>I can still change the setting <em>one folder at a time</em>, but I literally have hundreds of folders, and with many more hundreds awaiting import (should my other, and I hope separate, key issue be resolved), I really can't face having to trawl through this process for hours on end.  It doesn't help that the Subscribe window always resets to a tiny size - might be nice if it remembered the full size I'd set it to. </p><p>FYI, I have tried deleting the account and its data from Thunderbird and then adding it back in, but that makes no difference. </p><p>Might this be a bug in Thunderbird?  Do i have too many folders for Thunderbird?  To recap - it used to work exactly as you'd expect, but then it just gave up!  Maybe I reached some sort of folder limit? </p><p>Once again, thank you to all who provide constructive and helpful feedback. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",TechD
