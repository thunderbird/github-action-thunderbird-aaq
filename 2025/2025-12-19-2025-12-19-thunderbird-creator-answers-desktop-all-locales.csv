But something has changed.  When I download the file now it gives it the name ""Zul52mNeovl5. Which happens to be the name of the file I'm downloading from. So now I have 3 options of where to put the file - Events, Tasks or this filename. I can't find this file anywhere on my computer. How do I get rid of it? </p><p>Any Help would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;events;,thunderbird,events,en-US,"",aholtby
