So now I have 3 options of where to put the file - Events, Tasks or this filename. I can't find this file anywhere on my computer. How do I get rid of it? </p><p>Any Help would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;events;,thunderbird,events,en-US,"",aholtby

It appears one drive had been messing with them. I had them in a folder on my desktop so I know they got backed up when I did a manual backup with an image using ms backup tool. I do not want to use one drive but it appears TB gets an error when I think I am pointing to the correct folder. How do I undo one drive and put my folders back? Unfortunately I do not have a recent image that have emails in them that are recent and want to save. I also had local outlook pst files on my local drive TB folder Any advice appreciated. </p>,thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",Brian_Durham1
