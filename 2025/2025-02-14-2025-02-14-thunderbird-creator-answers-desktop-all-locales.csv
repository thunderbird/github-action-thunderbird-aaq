I tried the most recent one, didn't like it, so randomly picked a previous release from 2023 (don't remember when I installed the previous one) and hoped for the best.  In the past, I would keep some emails in my inbox and tend to them as needed and then keep or delete when I had done what was required.  I would also need to go to my ISP email's page, to get spam email, because Thunderbird didn't provide me with those.  When there, I would delete what was in the inbox, so I could easily keep letters there to a minimum.  Now, however, when I delete something in my ISP's inbox, it deletes in my Thunderbird portal too.  I can't find settings in my ISP's page to stop it from downloading automatically (so it won't duplicate what I've already received via Thunderbird), and I can't find any settings in Thunderbird, to ask it to keep what I have in my inbox, instead of deleting everything I delete with my ISP.  Do I need to go further back and find an earlier release in order to be able to use Thunderbird as I used to do? Or can I tweak the one I have? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1712007;,alan410

When I look op those emails under ""sent"", some of the later suppressed pictures miss from there.  It looks like TB switches to a ""loose pictures"" mode once and sticks to it for that particular email. It looks like the probability of being hit by this bug increases with the number of pasted pictures. </p><p>Note: This complaint is different from this one <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1183434</a>, where it is about pictures copied and pasted from the web (where it might be the case that instead of the picture an Internet link gets posted: My complaint is about pictures not related to any internet source but rather to pictures from my screenshooter utility, which is xfce4-screenshooter (I am on Linux, in particular on Xubuntu 20.04). </p><p>The first (usually 1 or 2) pictures arrive well at the destination of the email but if the number of pasted screenshots exceeds 4 or 5, the bug shows up. The really bad thing is that when I am composing the mail, everything looks perfectly ok. I can only tell if a mail is affected from this bug, when the email is sent - and then it is too late! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",perpetuum-mobile

I have folks tell me to adjust my GMail settings -- if that is the case,  then why is the message saying Thunderbird wants to access my GMail contacts....see attachment.   </p><p>I have looked at all settings in TB and GMail to no avail.  Every time that I bring up the TB client it asks me.  Whether I allow it or deny it. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",falconscastle
