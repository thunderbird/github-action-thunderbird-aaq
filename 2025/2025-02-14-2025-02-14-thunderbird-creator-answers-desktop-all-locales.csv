Now, however, when I delete something in my ISP's inbox, it deletes in my Thunderbird portal too.  I can't find settings in my ISP's page to stop it from downloading automatically (so it won't duplicate what I've already received via Thunderbird), and I can't find any settings in Thunderbird, to ask it to keep what I have in my inbox, instead of deleting everything I delete with my ISP.

I am contacting on behalf of a friend (Although I am using Thunderbird myself). he has this problem where upon the top button selections of a few windows have disappeared and he is of course forced to use the drop down menus (Where applicable). </p><p>His version is 115.18.0. MAC OS High Sierra. </p><p>I tried the 'restore defaults' but nothing happened. When I tried to customise the windows to defaults - I could not 'see' the SEND option everything else was there. </p><p>So I tried to install the latest up from 115.18.0 (118.18.0) but this just sent me back to the start where upon I had to enter into account details - I just thought it would use the setup already there. I got a bit cautious on that one and stopped.  </p><p>So he is back to 115.18.0 with no buttons at the top. </p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated indeed!. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Pete. </p>",pnuts1;DavidGG;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.6 Safari/605.1.15",1,0,1,,,

I am looking at an add on right on the Mozilla site.  It's called ""Edit Email Subject""  (EES).   This would allow me to organize my emails better by editing the subject line with more detail.  I downloaded it, but Firefox tells me the Add On is not verified and cannot be installed.  Yet it is on your site.  It appears to be what I need, can you help - either by verifiying help, or (?) or by recommending another suitable add on?  Reviews on EES were good, by the way.  Help!
