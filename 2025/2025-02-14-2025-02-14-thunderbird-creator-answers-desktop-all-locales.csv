I tried the most recent one, didn't like it, so randomly picked a previous release from 2023 (don't remember when I installed the previous one) and hoped for the best.  In the past, I would keep some emails in my inbox and tend to them as needed and then keep or delete when I had done what was required.  I would also need to go to my ISP email's page, to get spam email, because Thunderbird didn't provide me with those.  When there, I would delete what was in the inbox, so I could easily keep letters there to a minimum.  Now, however, when I delete something in my ISP's inbox, it deletes in my Thunderbird portal too.  I can't find settings in my ISP's page to stop it from downloading automatically (so it won't duplicate what I've already received via Thunderbird), and I can't find any settings in Thunderbird, to ask it to keep what I have in my inbox, instead of deleting everything I delete with my ISP.  Do I need to go further back and find an earlier release in order to be able to use Thunderbird as I used to do? Or can I tweak the one I have? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1712007;,alan410
