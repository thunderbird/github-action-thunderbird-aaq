Facts:  I have had this desktop primary Thunderbird account for decades.  A few years ago, I set up my phone so it could see incoming e-mails that were coming to my desktop.  It cannot, however, see sent e-mails from my desktop nor can I see on my desktop past e-mails sent from my phone.   Furthermore, if I deleted an incoming e-mail on my phone, it would still appear in my Inbox on my desktop when I open Thunderbird on my desktop. </p><p>This morning (Sat), I went into Spectrum to see what benefits I had and in the process had to create a new password because I had somehow lost the old one.  That evidently changed something with respect to my Thunderbird account.  As I tried different settings in Thunderbird, I somehow screwed up my ability to receive and send e-mails from my desktop.  My phone was unaffected but I rely on my desktop e-mailing for most matters. My current settings on Thunderbird from my desktop are: </p><p>Description:25 Server Name:  <a href=""http://pop-server.wi.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-server.wi.rr.com</a> Port:25 User Name  [my e-mail address] Authentication Method:  No Authentication Connection Security: None </p>",zbadger,false,0,0

Go to the Thunderbird support forum and ask how to use LibreOffice/OpenOffice to send mail. </p><p>Fundamentally I can tell you that OpenOffice does not send mail through a mail client without configuration.

To send the current document in .ODT format:  Choose File &gt; Send &gt; Document as E-mail. <a href=""http://OpenOffice.org"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenOffice.org</a> opens the e-mail program specified in Tools &gt; Options &gt; Internet &gt; E-mail⧼cite_reference_link⧽. The document is attached. In your e-mail program, enter the recipient, subject and any text you want to add, then send the e-mail.  File &gt; Send &gt; E-mail as OpenDocument Text has the same effect.  If you choose E-mail as Microsoft Word, OOo first creates a .DOC file and then opens your e-mail program with the .DOC file attached. Similarly, if you choose E-mail as PDF, OOo first creates a PDF using your default PDF settings (as when using the Export Directly as PDF toolbar button) and then opens your email program with the .PDF file attached. E-mailing a document to several recipients  To e-mail a document to several recipients, you can use the features in your e-mail program or you can use OOo's mail merge facilities to extract email addresses from an address book.  You can use OOo's mail merge to send e-mail in two ways:      Use the Mail Merge Wizard to create the document and send it. See Chapter 11 (Using Mail Merge) for details.     Create the document in Writer without using the Wizard, then use the Wizard to send it. This method is described here.  To use the Mail Merge Wizard to send a Writer document:      Click Tools &gt; Mail Merge Wizard. </blockquote> <p><strong>LibreOffice </strong>offer very similar instructions here <a href=""https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/guide/email.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/guide/email.html</a> </p><p>The difference appears to be Open Office apparently requires manual configuration in the application and LibreOffice uses the operating systems default mail client.   </p><p>But that sort of difference is why I migrated to LibreOffice back when they split from Open Office.  Constant updates with real improvements in usability and compatibility </p><p>In the words of Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org</a> </p> <blockquote> Following Sun's acquisition by Oracle Corporation, development of <a href=""http://OpenOffice.org"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenOffice.org</a> slowed and eventually ended.
