Facts:  I have had this desktop primary Thunderbird account for decades.  A few years ago, I set up my phone so it could see incoming e-mails that were coming to my desktop.  It cannot, however, see sent e-mails from my desktop nor can I see on my desktop past e-mails sent from my phone.   Furthermore, if I deleted an incoming e-mail on my phone, it would still appear in my Inbox on my desktop when I open Thunderbird on my desktop. </p><p>This morning (Sat), I went into Spectrum to see what benefits I had and in the process had to create a new password because I had somehow lost the old one.  That evidently changed something with respect to my Thunderbird account.  As I tried different settings in Thunderbird, I somehow screwed up my ability to receive and send e-mails from my desktop.  My phone was unaffected but I rely on my desktop e-mailing for most matters. My current settings on Thunderbird from my desktop are: </p><p>Description:25 Server Name:  <a href=""http://pop-server.wi.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-server.wi.rr.com</a> Port:25 User Name  [my e-mail address] Authentication Method:  No Authentication Connection Security: None </p>",zbadger,false,0,0

The server may be down or maybe incorrectly configured.  Please verify the correct configuration in the server settings for your mail server in the account settings window and try again. </p>",zbadger,false,0,0
