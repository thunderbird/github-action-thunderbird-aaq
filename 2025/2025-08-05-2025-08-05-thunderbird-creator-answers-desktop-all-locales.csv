For this reason I was a long time with MS at home as well. But now this needs to change. Not keen on MS Copilot BS any more.  I think Thunderbird ticks all my email needs. some things are different, some better some worse, that´s ok.  Personal I think there is a small but very important convenience  feature missing, and that's about rules/filters. </p><p>Currently if you want to set up a rule/filter you need to remember or copy all details you want to reacted on before starting to create the rule, the you need to 1) click on the email-homepage, 2) filter 3) new 4) type in a name 5) type an email/ subject 6) What to do if true 7) save </p><p>it works and it does what is should.  However what I love in MS office is that this can be done in 3 clicks. The function accessible strait on the top and already pre-populated if you go this direct way.  </p><p>What could be added to Thunderbird:  if with a right click in an email, and ""add filter"" option would appear (for example under Organisation) and this brings you strait to the ""new filter"" window with 3 fields filled out:  1) name of the filter contains: the subject of the email 2)subject - contains: subject of the email  3)from - contains: sender of the email  </p><p>Then you only need to change/delete a condition and 90% of the requirements are met. </p><p>It may sounds very silly, but I have to say this functionality in MS saved me so much time, with all ""update"" or ""notice"" email just been sorted away, maybe deleted or whatever.  </p><p>Maybe I am rules/filter junkie but it definitely help with all the noise emails can create. </p><p>I hope i used the right forum, and maybe it helps to make a Thunderbird a little bit better.  </p><p>Daniel </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",Daniel.Mack
