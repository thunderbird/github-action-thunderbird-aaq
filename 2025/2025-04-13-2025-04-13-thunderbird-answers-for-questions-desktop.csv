But still folk jump to it as a first fix. </p><p>My advice is post the actual error message (verbatim) and the details of the mail provider you are having issues with.  Reinstalling is most certainly not going to fix your issue unless your antivirus has gone off the reservation and that is far more frequent than folks realize.  It could well be your issue now even. If your account is with the Microsoft sponsored hotmail, msn,  live, outlook  it may well be that you are using the wrong server name but as you have not supplied any information pertinant to provider or type of error all I or anyone can do is guess. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
