Reinstalling is most certainly not going to fix your issue unless your antivirus has gone off the reservation and that is far more frequent than folks realize.  It could well be your issue now even. If your account is with the Microsoft sponsored hotmail, msn,  live, outlook  it may well be that you are using the wrong server name but as you have not supplied any information pertinant to provider or type of error all I or anyone can do is guess. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The outgoing would likely need two such filters. Experiment with different approaches to find what works for you. The filters would copy messages to holding folders. That doesn't prevent deletes, but would ensure none were lost. For a perfect solution, you would need a server-driven transaction manager, not Thunderbird. Well, that's my opinion. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thunderbird isn't perfect, but it's consistent in what it does or does not do.
