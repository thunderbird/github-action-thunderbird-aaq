Thunderbird gave me a response of 284 items with my search term. When I looked through them NONE of them had the search term I was asking for. They all had portions of the search term but none of them had the full word.  As I said it was a search for a single word. Is it possible to get Thunderbird to search for what I actually asked for? </p>",thunderbird;search-tag-and-share;,thunderbird,search-tag-and-share,en-US,1728519;1728542;,geoff67

If I start reading an old email, a Thunderbird message pop up on screen every few seconds stating that it cannot connect to the dead email service.  This is a real nuisance as the messages cover the screen over time, and each one needs to be separately deleted. Can this Thunderbird response be switched off? </p><p>I wish to keep using Thunderbird for the new email service, but only if I can fix this issue. </p><p>Bill </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1728551;,Bikk+D
