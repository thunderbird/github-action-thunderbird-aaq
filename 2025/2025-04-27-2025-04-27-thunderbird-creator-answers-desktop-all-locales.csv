Never a problem with Tbird on desktop, but sending email from my laptop has always been sketchy with Charter/Spectrum; I've fiddled with switching SMTP ports to allow sending from laptop and often succeeded (using suggestions from web: ports 587, default 465, and a few others).  However, if I managed to send from laptop while at home, when I'd leave town and attempt to send email I'd receive Spectrum's hated message: ""An error occurred while sending...charter.net...cmsmtp...blocked"".  Now I'm unable to find a port on my laptop that the SMTP server won't block. My suspicion is that the problem is caused by the simultaneous installations of Tbird on the laptop and desktop and the SMTP server won't accept mail sent from both when using the same ports. I was able to send a test email from my laptop while my desktop was being updated (and offline, obviously), but as soon as the desktop was updated I was no longer able to send from my laptop again (blocked SMTP server message).   </p><p>Thanks in advance to any users who have some good suggestions. </p>",robertmk2;davidsk;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:137.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/137.0,2,0,2,,,

The book advices from a privacy and sercuity perspective that a email clinet such as thunderbrid should only be used to archive emails and not to send them.  I dont think this is a big risk and I am considering using thinderbird to send emails as well, not just from a browser. </p><p>Are you able to clarify and provide further insight on this&nbsp;?  What are the privacy and security risks of sending an email this way&nbsp;? Please see extracts from book below.  </p><p>I do not recommend using them for daily access to these services, or to send email messages, but only as an archiving solution to make sure you always have a copy of your data offline. </p><p>I use this only as an offline backup of all email in the event I cannot access my Proton Mail account online. I never send email from this application. </p><p>A decade ago, my main concern about email privacy would have been exposure of a true IP address. Most of us still used email clients which shared the local IP address within the email headers of every sent message. he risk today is minimal. If you send an email from within a web browser through a service such as Proton Mail, Tuta, Fastmail, Gmail, etc., the recipient should only see the IP address of the email server. Your true home IP address should not be exposed. If you send an email from an email client while using these services, you are also usually protected. The emails bounce through the service provider's servers before going out and only includes those addresses. However, sending email through a client configured for corporate email may expose your true IP address.

As always, I have to repeat the process of adding my emails to Thunderbird. I was able to add my gmail without too much trouble. However, I am unable to add my hotmails because the link Thunderbird is providing is incorrect.  The login for my hotmail comes up, but when I click to add my password for the email, it gives me the following message. ""You can't sign in here with a personal account. Use your work or school account instead."" I have always had ONLY a personal account. I don't even know what a work/ school account is!  I have never had this problem before.  What the heck is going on here?  Please fix these login links, so I can add my hotmails asap.
