I have tried making the windows 11 display font smaller, but it has no effect on the filter window.  There must be some simple work around for this that is just escaping me.   Appreciate any suggestions or help...thanks DZ </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",dcfz52z

Thunderbird gave me a response of 284 items with my search term. When I looked through them NONE of them had the search term I was asking for. They all had portions of the search term but none of them had the full word.  As I said it was a search for a single word. Is it possible to get Thunderbird to search for what I actually asked for? </p>",thunderbird;search-tag-and-share;,thunderbird,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",geoff67
