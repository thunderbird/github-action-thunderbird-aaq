I have tried making the windows 11 display font smaller, but it has no effect on the filter window.  There must be some simple work around for this that is just escaping me.   Appreciate any suggestions or help...thanks DZ </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728554;1728556;,dcfz52z

Thunderbird gave me a response of 284 items with my search term. When I looked through them NONE of them had the search term I was asking for. They all had portions of the search term but none of them had the full word.  As I said it was a search for a single word. Is it possible to get Thunderbird to search for what I actually asked for? </p>",thunderbird;search-tag-and-share;,thunderbird,search-tag-and-share,en-US,1728519;1728542;,geoff67

If I start reading an old email, a Thunderbird message pop up on screen every few seconds stating that it cannot connect to the dead email service.  This is a real nuisance as the messages cover the screen over time, and each one needs to be separately deleted. Can this Thunderbird response be switched off? </p><p>I wish to keep using Thunderbird for the new email service, but only if I can fix this issue. </p><p>Bill </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1728551;,Bikk+D

In one of them, the notifications have a read more indicator so the whole post doesn't appear in Thunderbird.  However, since the 7th April update to Thunderbird, this is being ignored and the whole post is appearing in Thunderbird.  As the posts include answers to crossword puzzles still to be solved, this is annoying. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",PaulDormer
