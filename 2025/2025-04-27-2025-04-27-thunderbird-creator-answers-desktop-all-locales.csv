Never a problem with Tbird on desktop, but sending email from my laptop has always been sketchy with Charter/Spectrum; I've fiddled with switching SMTP ports to allow sending from laptop and often succeeded (using suggestions from web: ports 587, default 465, and a few others).  However, if I managed to send from laptop while at home, when I'd leave town and attempt to send email I'd receive Spectrum's hated message: ""An error occurred while sending...charter.net...cmsmtp...blocked"".  Now I'm unable to find a port on my laptop that the SMTP server won't block. My suspicion is that the problem is caused by the simultaneous installations of Tbird on the laptop and desktop and the SMTP server won't accept mail sent from both when using the same ports. I was able to send a test email from my laptop while my desktop was being updated (and offline, obviously), but as soon as the desktop was updated I was no longer able to send from my laptop again (blocked SMTP server message).   </p><p>Thanks in advance to any users who have some good suggestions. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728645;1728689;,robertmk2

What are the privacy and security risks of sending an email this way&nbsp;? Please see extracts from book below.  </p><p>I do not recommend using them for daily access to these services, or to send email messages, but only as an archiving solution to make sure you always have a copy of your data offline. </p><p>I use this only as an offline backup of all email in the event I cannot access my Proton Mail account online. I never send email from this application. </p><p>A decade ago, my main concern about email privacy would have been exposure of a true IP address. Most of us still used email clients which shared the local IP address within the email headers of every sent message. he risk today is minimal. If you send an email from within a web browser through a service such as Proton Mail, Tuta, Fastmail, Gmail, etc., the recipient should only see the IP address of the email server. Your true home IP address should not be exposed. If you send an email from an email client while using these services, you are also usually protected. The emails bounce through the service provider's servers before going out and only includes those addresses. However, sending email through a client configured for corporate email may expose your true IP address. As an example, sending an email from your employer's provided address through a traditional emailclient from home could expose these sensitive details. </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1728835;,jeromehmj
