The very emails I wish to access. </p> <blockquote>You could, alternatively, switch off automatic email retrieval under the server settings.</blockquote> <p>I have already switched off any checkbox concerning updating of mails I found. Still, as soon as I select the Inbox, it asks for my password. I assume that the checkboxes only passive retrieval so I can get notifications while Thunderbird runs in the background.

Het klopt dus dat als u in Thunderbird van de pc een bericht verwijderd, dat dat ook uit beeld verdwijnt in Thunderbird op de laptop en vice versa. Deze koppeling is allen te verbreken door de pc niet meer aan het internet te hangen, zodat er niet meer wordt gesynchroniseerd. Echter als u alle bestanden van de pc verwijdert, bijvoorbeeld door de pc te wipen of bestanden in de prullenbak te gooien, dan zal er geen 'signaal' van Thunderbird naar de mailserver worden gestuurd om alle mail weg te gooien.

I get some Junk emails (TB recognises this as junk) arrive in the Inbox folder. I do get Junk I've marked as Junk turn up in Junk - and also Junk assigned as such by the server turn up in Junk. </p><p>But some allocations do seem strange.

This is how I want TB to work. I prefer to have ALL mail go to my global, combined, inbox &amp; decide from there whether I need to reply/delete/forward etc. each email. This set up meant that I never missed an email through it being in the wrong folder.  </p><p>Suddenly (just this year) I have had emails marked as junk go into a junk folder(s). Quite often, as today, I looked at my folder pane &amp; there are no messages showing in junk. However, when clicking on that folder, I discovered that there were actually several emails there, some of them quite important  </p><p>So, currently TB is deciding, quite randomly it would seem, that some emails are junk, but NOT showing them as unread emails in the junk folder in the folder pane </p><p>For each of my email accounts (I have several) I have the exact same settings that I've always had: Selection - nothing ticked Trust junk mail... not ticked Destination &amp; retention - not ticked Global junk preferences - not ticked In some of the above, there is a ""greyed out"" blue button, but as the ""master"" entry isn't ticked/selected, then that is not of relevance </p><p>I have one email account with the exact same settings that doesn't put stuff into junk. The only difference with that account is that all emails to that address are filtered to a different folder on arrival </p><p>Even more frustratingly, today I've discovered that in my ""junk"" folder, I now have 2 or even 3 folders for each email address. It's all getting very strange &amp; I have to say, quite frustrating </p><p>Any ideas?? </p><p>Thanks </p>",debskinner21,false,0,0
