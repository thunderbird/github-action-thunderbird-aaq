They didn't occur by TB automatically creating them without your input. </p><p>I don't know of a way to merge all your calendars - I've looked at the database and the matter doesn't appear to have come up. I'm a little confused by your use of 'tasks' and 'events' - you seem to use the words interchangeably but these are different inputs in TB and are dealt with differently. </p><p>If I was in your position, I would start from scratch with a new Calendar and input events one by one into that new one, deleting the events from the old calendar until nothing was left. Then delete the old calendar. And so on to the next. </p><p>Or maybe start with the most populated calendar and and to that? I don't know... </p><p>However, if you have *thousands* of events, I wonder whether a single calendar is really the way to go? The 'Today Pane' in the Email interface would be so cluttered as to make it almost impractical. And then you have to add your tasks to it. </p><p>You will have to decide how easy you want access to be - but a clean up of the multiple calendars would certainly seem to be the best way to go. </p><p>Oh, and before I did anything, I would be *at the least* saving copies of each calendar to an external source (right click on the calendar name and 'Export') in case something went horribly wrong. </p><p>.oOo. </p><p>Tout d'abord, s'il y a 10 calendriers, c'est parce que vous avez choisi de le faire, que ce soit par accident ou non. Ils ne sont pas apparus parce que TB les a créés automatiquement sans votre intervention. </p><p>Je ne connais pas de moyen de fusionner tous vos calendriers. J'ai regardé la base de données et le problème ne semble pas avoir été soulevé. Je suis un peu dérouté par votre utilisation de « tâches » et d'« événements ». Vous semblez utiliser les mots de manière interchangeable, mais ce sont des entrées différentes dans TB et elles sont traitées différemment. </p><p>Si j'étais à votre place, je recommencerais à zéro avec un nouveau calendrier et j'insèrerais les événements un par un dans ce nouveau calendrier, en supprimant les événements de l'ancien calendrier jusqu'à ce qu'il ne reste plus rien. Puis je supprimerais l'ancien calendrier. Et ainsi de suite jusqu'au suivant. </p><p>Ou peut-être commencer par le calendrier le plus rempli et ainsi de suite&nbsp;?

Le « volet Aujourd'hui » de l'interface de messagerie serait tellement encombré qu'il serait presque impossible à utiliser. Et puis, vous devez y ajouter vos tâches. </p><p>Vous devrez décider du degré de facilité d'accès que vous souhaitez, mais un nettoyage des différents calendriers semble certainement être la meilleure solution. </p><p>Oh, et avant de faire quoi que ce soit, j'enregistrerais *au moins* des copies de chaque calendrier sur une source externe (clic droit sur le nom du calendrier et « Exporter ») au cas où quelque chose se passerait mal. </p>",frisée,false,0,0

In fact, that is quite useful. The problem I'm having is that Thunderbird moves them to my junk folder, even though I set it to not do that. I had it set to move them before, but it was more annoying to have to check the junk folder, because it seems no amount of training (months of it) got it to recognize things properly. All I want is for it to stop moving the mail. Have I missed a setting? In the main Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Junk, I only have ""Mark messages as read: When manually marked as junk"" checked. The other settings are not checked and greyed out. In each account, in Account Settings &gt; Junk Settings, everything is unchecked and greyed out. Any thoughts? </p>",john864,false,0,0
