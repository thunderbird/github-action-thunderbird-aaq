I clicked the Open Directory button next to it as instructed, but nothing happens.  So, since your instructions said that that action would just take me to a .Thunderbird directory anyway, I attempted to search for that with hidden files turned off.  But no joy their, either. </p><p>Can you let me in on a secret, like what is the path is to this hidden folder, rather than having me use your mystery button?  Then I can just move the files myself, if that is indeed the solution. </p><p>Thank you for your assistance. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,1777922;,mozilla768
