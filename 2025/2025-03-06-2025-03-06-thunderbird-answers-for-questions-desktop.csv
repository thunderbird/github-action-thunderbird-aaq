Firstly, I have deleted and re-added accounts in the past to resolve other problems without any issues. In this case it seemed a good solution to try. But it wasn't and you are correct - I am now in deeper water! I had previously paused my Surfshark VPN when attempting to re-add accounts (couldn't use Mozilla VPN as it did not support Australia). This time when trying again I deleted the VPN from my PC and tried again - but still get the same error message. I use the anti-virus feature of Windows and it is still running. When I first start up Thunderbird I get an error message from ""Mail"" (which I assume is from Thunderbird) saying my Gmail, Yahoo, etc settings are out of date. After inspecting my Mail Settings, which appeared OK, this led me to delete and re-add my Mail accounts. I have tried adding using Thunderbird's automatic feature, and I also looked up the settings for each account and tried adding them manually, but still get the same unsuccessful outcome.  The only other thing to note is that I seem to be able to add my Gmail Account successfully, but when I do it starts downloading hundreds (thousands?) of old emails going back years. I can't see how to stop this other than deleting the Gmail account again. I am wondering if this has triggered a spam control feature that has blocked me? I don't know if this feature exists. So I take on board what you are saying about deleting and re-adding my accounts, and I would be interested in what you recommend I should have done - and what I can do next to resolve this problem. Thanks and regards, Graeme </p>",graeme.hurst16,false,0,0

The VPN server is in NY, although I have also used double VPN to do the same without problem. </blockquote> <p>As you mentioned you have no trouble logging into a google web page and they choose to allow you to do so.   You appear to be confusing your ability to access a google web page with email.  They are not the same thing at all.  That web page as much to do with email as the postal service has to do with Fedex.  Both get things from one place to another but because one works it demonstrates nothing about the other.  </p><p>In this case you have identified using the VPN causes you to loose the ability to send mail using mail protocols.  You have also advised it doers not affect your ability to use a google web page which in the background accesses your mail stored on a Google server. </p><p>GMail has some very involved anti spam, anti phishing, and anti hacking protocols they use to protect your account.  Some they publish,  some they don't. Most of the emphasis is on automated connections as those are what hackers will be using, not some screen scraping software and a browser. So mail protocols using mail ports are heavily ""protected""  just as Microsoft does not allow the use of their Alias feature to those using SMTP,  Gmail has it's own issues that have to be jumped over, avoided or simply lived with.  Your issue is not as far as I can see anything to do with Thunderbird and you have not really suggested that it is. </p><p>Everything implies the issue is with the VPN as it's absence removed the issue,  but if you want to investigate the process to determine the why.  We could start with the error messages Thunderbird is offering you.  What are they? </p><p>Then you might want to log the actual sending process (SMTP logging) so you can post the actual discussion between your system and the google system.  <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging#Thunderbird_Logging_Types"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging#Thunderbird_Logging_Types</a> </p><p>So please log the process and post your log.  No not redact random bits of the log file.  It already redacts usernames and passwords and everything else is relevant.  As you have a VPN, I will guess you also have a third party antivirus.  Make sure it is NOT functioning when you undertake at least one sending test, as it may in fact be the underlying cause of your error.  Their routine substitution of encryption certificates can be most problematic. </p><p>I do notice that the Google <a href=""https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/imap/imap-smtp"" rel=""nofollow"">developer documentation</a> says that gmail SMTP supports STARTLS  although Thunderbird's <a href=""https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">default configuration</a> only uses TLS.  </p><p>So you might want to try SSL/TLS on port 587 or STARTTLS on port 465 </p><p>I say try because that same developer documentation says IMAP and POP support SSL and Google deprecated that years ago in favour of TLS.  (2015 vintage I think)  So I have some qualms about the currency of their documentation.  But perhaps using STARTTLS will force early encryption and may change something in how Google perceives the VPN. </p><p>BTW: Thunderbird uses SSL/TLS in dialogs,  but you have to change default in hidden preferences to enable SSL at all. Any reference to SSL/TLS is actually TLS only, unless you have deliberately reduced your security by enabling SSL, and there are still mail servers exclusively using SSL only all these years after it was broken in the wild and folk who use them so the option to run using SSL is still  needed by some folk. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
