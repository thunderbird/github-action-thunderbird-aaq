Firstly, I have deleted and re-added accounts in the past to resolve other problems without any issues. In this case it seemed a good solution to try. But it wasn't and you are correct - I am now in deeper water! I had previously paused my Surfshark VPN when attempting to re-add accounts (couldn't use Mozilla VPN as it did not support Australia). This time when trying again I deleted the VPN from my PC and tried again - but still get the same error message. I use the anti-virus feature of Windows and it is still running. When I first start up Thunderbird I get an error message from ""Mail"" (which I assume is from Thunderbird) saying my Gmail, Yahoo, etc settings are out of date. After inspecting my Mail Settings, which appeared OK, this led me to delete and re-add my Mail accounts. I have tried adding using Thunderbird's automatic feature, and I also looked up the settings for each account and tried adding them manually, but still get the same unsuccessful outcome.  The only other thing to note is that I seem to be able to add my Gmail Account successfully, but when I do it starts downloading hundreds (thousands?) of old emails going back years. I can't see how to stop this other than deleting the Gmail account again. I am wondering if this has triggered a spam control feature that has blocked me? I don't know if this feature exists. So I take on board what you are saying about deleting and re-adding my accounts, and I would be interested in what you recommend I should have done - and what I can do next to resolve this problem. Thanks and regards, Graeme </p>",graeme.hurst16,false,0,0

By default recent macOS versions use a 144 pixel per inch resolution in screen shots versus 72 pixel per inch in earlier versions. I have noticed that when I purchased my first iMac with a Retina 4k screen. All my screen shots were blown up when I sent them or used them in forums. Since several years I regularly edit my screens shots with Preview to resize the images to 50% of their original size.  As an exemple I'll show two screen shots of the ""About Thunderbird"" window, one in the original size and the second resized to about 50% of its original width. </p><p>The 3rd image shows my font sizes for Latin, Other writing systems are the same.
