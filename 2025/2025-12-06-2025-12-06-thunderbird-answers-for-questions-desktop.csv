I have not had any reason to investigate how these corporate settings are used or managed for more than 10 years.  But on windows policies are the control measure of choice I understand. </p><p>BTW Thunderbird does not create any folders for an IMAP account when the account is first setup, they are created based on offerings from the server.  As it synchronizes those offered by the server, it may well be that someone has disabled the setting to offer spam as an IAP folder with Google.  I would guess it would be unlikely Thunderbird would subscribe the spam folder if it's spam settings are disabled. There would be nothing to prompt the subscription.
