My guess is you started out using the VPN and comcast did not like that and blocked you and now you are blocked so nothing you do will fix it until the block times out, however long that is set to be (the use of the word temporarily indicates it will timeout some time.)  or Comcast life the block.  I would recommend the later as I am only guessing as to the cause.
