Quando provo ad aprire un allegato in formato dwg da un messaggio e-mail qualsiasi, mi compare ogni volta la finestra che mi chiede se aprire il file o salvarlo (allego l'immagine per maggiore chiarezza). Io vorrei sempre aprirlo con il programma installato sul mio computer e che uso solitamente, quindi vado a selezionare la voce ""Apri con"" --&gt; ""Altro"" --&gt; ""Sfoglia"" --&gt; seleziono l'eseguibile del programma in questione.  A questo punto l'apertura dell'allegato avviene correttamente, ma se chiudo il file e provo ad aprirne un altro nello stesso formato, Thunderbird non riesce a capire come aprire il file e mi propone di nuovo le opzioni visibili nell'immagine di cui sopra. Ho provato anche a controllare le impostazioni di apertura degli allegati nelle impostazioni generali del programma, ma purtroppo l'estensione dwg non compare nell'elenco in questione e non trovo da nessuna parte un'opzione per aggiungere altri formati a questo elenco. Da quanto ho potuto capire facendo alcune ricerche su internet, il file in cui sono elencati tutti i formati degli allegati gestiti da Thunderbird è ""handlers.json"", all'interno del percorso ""C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default-release"", ma non sono sicuro di come vada modificato e se può effettivamente sortire l'effetto sperato. Avevo anche trovato i riferimenti ad un'estensione (OpenAttachmentByExtension) che permetteva di gestire l'apertura dei vari allegati, ma non risulta compatibile con la mia versione di Thunderbird (138.0.1 64 bit). </p><p>Ringrazio in anticipo chiunque proverà a darmi una mano. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,"",lab6
