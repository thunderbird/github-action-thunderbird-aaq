THIS IS SEGMENT #01. </p><p><br> Thank you, very much for you reply. One thing I need to add before answering your queries, is that I earlier saw references to ""Ccleaner"". I forgot to mention that I do have, and activate Ccleaner on occasion. I don't know it's good or bad, but I needed to disclose that. The only AV product that is active on this system(to my knowledge), is MS Defender. And yes, all of my Tbird accounts(#12), are POP3. </p> <hr> <p>Why are you pressing get messages?  That can in itself be a cause of issues as Thunderbird fetches messages on startup and on a timed basis. </p> <hr> <p>My Tbird is setup to only retrieve messages when I request messages for a specific account. No messages are ever retrieved unless requested. </p> <hr> <p>This will be exacerbated by having Thunderbird profile somewhere other than an internal drive. External says to me network or USB.  Neither of which are as fast as an internal drive bus with the inherent issues of data simply being lost.  If you are locating the account data on another place to the profile using the account directory  best of luck is all I can say.  I want nothing to do with it.  Trouble is all that comes from those setups has been my observation over 15 years of doing this support gig. </p> <hr> <p>If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that my having my email data externally located on a permanent USB drive, if faulty. Perhaps, but as I state, with my very low message volume, and considering the only messages downloading are those explicitly requested. As example, I'm talking maybe 10 messages daily. Besides, the Tbird configuration offers the ability to specify a unique message data repository, at any location I choose. As long as it's permanently available. My Tbird configuration setup goes back to the VRM 115.?? days of Tbird. Before it was overhauled to facilitate the new security synchronitions. </p> <hr> <p>I did look up this Yota thing as I have never heard of it.  I have no interest in migrating my Thunderbird data,  so I guess the best thing you can do is actually describe the issue you think you are seeing in terms of life without YOTA,  seriously I can not see an volunteer in this forum installing it in an attempt to understand your comments. </p> <hr> <p>Well, as briefly as I can..... The YOTA product has absolutely nothing to do with Tbird. But, YOTA is designed to extract email data from the data repositories of several/many email clients. Back in the Tbird VRM 115.?? days, when Tbird signins were frequently failing, I was forced to move to another email product. This replacement email product had several drawbacks that I couldn't live with. One of the major drawbacks that I needed to rectify was it's inability to relocate any email data outside of the software product's domain. IOW, if I received an email from you, and I wanted to permanently store it somewhere outside the domain of the email product, the ONLY way that could be done was to use Print PDF to reproduce that email document else where in the system. Yes, that would work, but if you've ever use Print PDF on a document, to store it else- where, and the document was complex, you would have seen that much of the document's complexity was excluded via the Print PDF process. Document data like  certain umages, URL's special characters, etc, would just be eliminated in the Print PDF process. I'm pretty sure that I could have licensed the Adobe product, which would have enhanced the Print PDF process, but I chose not to do that. So, that bring me to YOTA. </p><p>Finding this YOTA product, which I licensed, did and excellent job of reproducing this email relocation data, so it looked just like the original email text. No only did this enhance the viewing of the email document, but it facilitated possibly forwarding to document to others in the perfectly original condition. </p><p>So, the YOTA product supported Tbird and the other email client that I'd migrated to. So, when I began to return to Tbird, and began experiencing all these excessive system drive memory enlargements, I began using the YOTA tool as a diagnostic device to inspect the emails embedded in Tbird, to determine why so much memory was consumed, for the few little emails/daily that I was working with. </p><p>Well, through the diagnostic use of YOTA, I discovered that if I received maybe 10 emails daily, and immediately re-positioned those emails to their final location(outside of Tbird), and immediately deleted the original emails from Tbird, YOTA would show me that these deleted emails remained in Tbird. Not only did they remain. but if I'd made any changes to the emails before sending them to their final location, there would now still be the Tbird original 10 emails, plus copies of the 1 - 10 emails that I'd changed before the final relocation. Not only that. but even after I'd deleted every one of the original 10 Tbird emails, all the originals were still shown in the Tbird locations, courtesy of the YOTA queries. </p>",twf6714,false,0,0

THIS IS SEGMENT #02. </p><p><br> </p><p>But, although all the original/modified emails remain in the Tbird composite. the Tbird client shows ALL emails(and there could have been 30-40 now, depending on the modifications I'd made), still remain somewhere accessible by the YOTA product. But, not ""locatable"" via the Tbird client's normal facilities. Now, I accentuated this description somewhat to draw a point. But, I assure you that the example, or something very close would actually occur. I'll give you another example, simpler, but did actually happen. I was composing a somewhat lengthy email, in preparation for sending. Nothing complicated, but it had some detail, so for extra care, I was issuing intermediate ""saves"" to reduce my loss if something were to go wrong in the composure. Well, I finally completely the email, issues the send, and was happy for the completion. Then, I thought - ""I'll just go take a look at the Tbird send queue, to see how the sent email appeared"". Well, I was shocked.... When I pulled to the ""sent"" queue via YOTA, there must have been a hundred versions of this single email. After further inspection, I realized that a new full copy had been preserved for every time that I ussued the ""save"" command to safely preserve my progress. And, all these copies cannot be deleted via the Tbird client interface, because they're invisible to that client. </p><p>Backing up to the remotely defined areas, specified in the Tbird definition, used to contain all the email data outside the executable domain. That would be the external ""permanently""  available via USB. Remember that? That USB drive is external to handle ALL the email data to/from the Tbird client, to the Tbird server(s). Well, because the YOTA product would record such volumes of internal email data, that remember, was invisible to the Tbird client. And because I never leave any email data inside the client's repository anyway, I'd just decide to empty ALL of that Tbird USB repository data, and reinitialize Tbird. So, proceeding to each email data repository, I would simply CLEAR ALL data present, before proceeding to the next. Eventually, I'd have all the email data repositories emptied, and I'd restart Tbird. Everything initialized just fine, and all the USB repos- itories are now empty. AND, when I query the Tbird repositories, using YOTA, all email data is gone, and all repositories are clean. </p><p>That is really the reason I directed the email data to that USB repository initially. So, I could access those days areas to eliminate any/all data. But, that still doesn't have any affect on the Tbird client clinbing the ladder on system drive usage. </p> <hr> <p>BTW If you could explain what this means would be appreciative. ""'I've been a long time Thunderbird user, except during the time when Tbird was struggling with many definition changes for POP3 access.""  It might allow me to understand where you are coming from as the statement makes no sense to me, either literally or figuratively. Unless you are referring to the spate of setting changes imposed by Microsoft on the Hotmail,MSN, Live, <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> franchise over the years, and still continuing with their ""modern"" authentication. </p> <hr> <p>Well, I spent so much effort with that proceeding explanation, I'm not sure what you're referring to, for me to explain. But, reviewing the previous text, I suspect that you're asking exactly the meaning of my earlier statement ""Why are you pressing get messages?"" </p><p>I assume that this is the statement you want explained. I'm not sure what explanation is available. But, since my Tbird client is configured dormant, if you want to receive email, this is what is required. First, using the mouse cursor, you highlight the single email account of interest. Then, using the left mouse key, you highlight that email account name. When you highlight this email account name. a drop down menu will appear. Within that menu will appear ""Get Messages"". You then right click the ""get messages"" selection, all email data ready for transport will arrive at the Tbird Client. You can also highlight ALL Tbird account names, and the get messages select will transport all Tbird server email data to Tbird client. But, I don't have any real need for that. It's a perfectly optionally method for one of the many techniques to receive email data. </p><p>Damn. I'm tired. I apologize for the volume of explanation data I've produced here. But, I didn't want any misunderstandings. If you have questions, clarifications, or other information, please contact me. By the way, that YOTA product is free on an introductory basis. I've licensed the product, but if you have the interest, I can probably demonstrate all the accusations here. </p><p>Thanks, for your  interest. </p>",twf6714,false,0,0

Well, I decided to directly access the MS outlook server earlier, to determine if that <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> server, and my Tbird client were in a synchronous agreement that all emails had been deleted. Now remember, I have about 5-6 outlook addresses that I use. So I would have to review each address. Although, some email addresses have a much higher use that others. </p><p>So, I began by accessing the MS <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> server via <a href=""http://www.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.outlook.com</a>. I immediately logged into all six email addresses, and simply worked through the email contents of each address. As expected, most had no contents at all, probably through their minimal use. However, the three email addresses that I use most, were LOADED with residual email content, from as far back as early February. </p><p>So, I ran through these email contents, just glancing at their values to ensure my ownership. The entire content was comprised of my use, and there were many remaining. Eventually, using only the MS <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> server, I deleted all these historical emails. For three of my popular  emails, it took a good while to rid the MS Outlook,com server of the ""over"" 600 emails remaining from the initial/early February. </p><p>Now, my question is, If, I ALWAYS ensure that when I end my sessions to the MS <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> server, via the Tbird client access, there are no remaining email data in any of my accounts, then how do I explain over 600 emails remaining from the initial/early February. It seems that when the Tbird client indicates that all email data is empty, somehow there's a discrepancy among the Tbird client and the <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> server. </p><p>But, at this point, I have no idea if these <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> phantom emails, are causing the Tbird client storage creep, that I'm chasing. To me, it wouldn't make sense that 600+ phantom emails, present on the <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> server, would affect the execution runaway storage of my Tbird client, that reports that all email data is currently gone.  I'm stumped. I see problems, but not the problems related. </p><p>Please pardon any/all of my spelling/grammatical/other errors. </p><p>Thank you - Gary </p>",twf6714,false,0,0

That's when I just logged onto the <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> server, and began seeing ALL these emails. </p><pre>    They were clearly mine, and arose from repositories that apparently didn't feed Tbird.      I have seen a Tbird client receive TRASH before. It usually occurs when I delete some kind      of SPAM from an Inbox, and is passes immediately to the TRASH. </pre> <p>7.    I did make that clear that I had to log into the <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> server, in order to discover the </p><pre>      large volume of retained email. But, there was SPAM lightly mixed up in the email inventory. </pre> <p>I guess I should have engaged a more critical research in assessing this phantom email volume. But, perhaps not in the volume, but it will return I'm sure. There may even be some awaiting on me right now. If I do gain my wits, and discover these phantom email components, rather that cleaning them out in anger, what would you suggest that I perform next. </p><p>Additionally, why don't you try logging into your <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>'s email domain server, and poke  around, using only that server, and your existing Tbird client credentials, to see what you can  encounter.

That's cool </p><p>I spent many years in VSE, VM, and MVS. ""Small world"". What was the name of the VSE guru, from the photography company, in the mid-west? Do those V/MVS/E usenet groups still exist? Great speaking with you. </p><p>But, I've got another simple piece of information, regarding the reason  I'm here, on this group. </p><p>I've kept this real simple.... </p><p>1. Very recently, I had a junk piece of email, from a music company. 2. So, I thought - ""I hadn't really experimented with this as yet. And, </p><pre>   it's simple, let's try it. </pre> <p>3. The music email appeared in the inbox of the Tbird client. So, I just </p><pre>   deleted it using ctrl-del, and made sure it wasn't available anywhere    else. </pre> <p>4. Then, I initialized YOTA, and queried the contents of the Tbird account </p><pre>    that I'd just deleted the junk email from. </pre> <p>5. YOTA showed the deleted email clearly, and another deleted email, </p><pre>    both the only emails received on today 04/05, on that single account.     Additionally, YOTA showed both the emails residing in INBOX. But, I      guess that must be YOTA's inbox, because there's no sign of INBOX     email data, remaining in this Tbird INBOX account, now. </pre> <p>6. But, I'll bet you a ""VSE POPs Manua(BG), that if I'd logged into the </p><pre>    <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> server, that I'd have found the two residual emails sitting     right there in the INBOX, for this account. </pre> <p>And, one other thing I wanted to mention. Since my last talk with you, I examined my Tbird account specifications, and made some changes. These small changes were applied to ALL accounts, alike. </p><p>1. There's an option - ""Keep message archives in:"", that had been tic'd </p><pre>   by default. I untic'd that option. But, it kinda looks like it might still be     active because the option seems still selected, in light grey form.      </pre> <p>2. There another option that's somewhat confusing to me, and that is </p><pre>    the ""Leave messages on Server"". I had initially specified this multi-     part options as follows:     ""YTic Leave messages on server"", ""Ntic for at most 10 days"", and           ""Ytic Until I delete them"". This most recent change re-specified          the multipart options as follows:     ""Ytic Leave messages on server"". ""Ytic for at most 1 days"", and          ""Ytic Until I delete them"". </pre> <p>I don't completely understand the combinations, it seems like it should read differently, but I don't know exactly how. I want to  have the messages saved, but I don't want them saved for eternity. And, I certainly want the ability for self deletion </p><p>Anyway, that's my status. Except for thiis bloated Tbird execution, consuming multi-gigabytes of the OS-drive, valuable space, it's performing perfectly. And again using YOTA to query the status of the Tbird account, shows me that I have an inbox of 27 items, and a trash bucket of 3 items. None, of which is presented to me when accessing the <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> server via the Tbird client. But, if I view the status through the <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> server interface, the status contents are clearly available and accurate. </p><p>Again, I'd like to further recommend this YOTA product. But, under- stand, I have no interest in the product's sales, usage, or any own- ership interest. I did some reading on the product recently, to more fully understand its purpose in life.  </p><p>From what I understand, it's sole purpose in live is to automatically build/perform the transfer instruction criteria that would be necess- ary for a migration from say - ""Gmail"" to Tbird. Supposedly, YOTA will build, and apply the necessary ""heavy lifting"" to reach that complete transition. But, it's your call, just my opinion. </p><p>Thanks, and I've enjoyed out encounter via this site, from our days on the mainframe groups. </p><p>Gary Walker </p>",twf6714,false,0,0

But, that's not the topic here, and I'll just let that be. </p><p>Over our contact, I did update you on the steadily climbing C:drive storage that Tbird was gobbling up as time went on. I also explained that this number represented the ENTIRE C:drive ""in use"" value.

For your protection, I encourage going to settings&gt;general and verify that no update happens without your approval. That is, you do NOT want automatic update.

Also, verify that you have thunderbird set to NOT automatically update.  - If your ver 91 is 32-bit, I suggest uninstalling it. That will not delete the profile. If it is 64-bit and offers 102, go that route and skip next step.   - To get 102, download and install the initial version, 102.0.1. If there are any updates needed, the first release does it. That release is at  this location: Get the EXE version.  <a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.0.1/win64/en-US/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.0.1/win64/en-US/</a>    - After installing, clicking help&gt;about should offer to update to 102.15.1. If so, do it. If it offers a HIGHER number, such as 115. STOP. Instead, download the 102.15.1 yourself and install over the top of the current version. Again, use the EXE version. <a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.15.1/win64/en-US/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.15.1/win64/en-US/</a> - when done, this is a good time to repeat the steps from my earlier response on backing up the profile, because it is now different. Having a backup of the profile can eliminate hours and days of frustration if the PC crashes or other unforeseen problems surface.   </p><p>The addressbook remains as it was, abook.sqlite. 102 is slightly different from 91, but take your time. There are much bigger changes in later releases of 115, 128, and 137. 102 may not suffice forever, but keep it as long as it works well. Take care.
