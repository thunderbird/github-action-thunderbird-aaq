If you were trying to restore from a backup, and have a backup of the enclosing <i>Thunderbird</i> folder, restoring that whole folder should fix the problem, because then you would restore both the profile folder and the <b>profiles.ini</b> file pointing to it. </p><p>Anyway, you may bypass that error message by quitting Thunderbird if it's running and moving the <b>profiles.ini</b> file away from the enclosing <b>Thunderbird</b> folder. The next time you launch Thunderbird, instead of looking for a profile folder that no longer exists, it will create a new default profile and let you proceed. </p><p>You will then be asked to set up a mail account, but you don't have to. You may cancel the account setup process and choose the option to <b>Use Thunderbird without an email account</b> when asked for confirmation. There aren't many things you can do with Thunderbird that way, but one of the few you can do is use the <b>About Profiles</b> built-in profile manager that opens by choosing <b>Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information</b> and clicking on the <b>about:profiles</b> link there. </p><p>Several KB articles make reference to an external Profile Manager tool you have to launch the way you were trying to do, but recent versions of Thunderbird have that built-in version you may use from within Thunderbird itself. I would try using that instead. Both versions of the Profile Manager are documented in the following article: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles</a> </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
