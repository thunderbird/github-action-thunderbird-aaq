Did you type '<em><strong>user'</strong></em> in the ""Filter style sheets"" search box on top of the list of styles?(see image) If your userChrome.css won't be displayed in the left style sheets pane there might be a typo somewhere when creating the userChrome.css file. Did you verify if your profile folder contains a ""chrome"" folder with your userChrome.css file? As I wrote here above you open your preferred editor, save the file (empty or not) as <strong>userChrome.css</strong>, delete the .txt suffixe in userChrome.css.txt and drag the file in the <strong>chrome</strong> folder in the profile folder.  </p><p>You can ask in this forum (or in <a href=""http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewforum.php?f=39"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewforum.php?f=39</a>) what you would like to change, screenshots of the UI area to modify can be very helpful.
