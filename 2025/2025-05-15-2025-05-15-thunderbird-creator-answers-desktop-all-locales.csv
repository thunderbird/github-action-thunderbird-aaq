As a result I LOST all my address books and all my received emails. I am 86 and I am involved in many community groups. Now I have NO email contact addresses and recent emails from people. I went to the local Geek Squad for help and I was told all email addresses and all received emails were truly gone. WHY??  Geek Squad person told me it was a Thunderbird support issue.
