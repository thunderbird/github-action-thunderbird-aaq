The automatic setup option ONLY showed the old POP account which I used years ago on the same email address (jallan32@att.net), so I went to manual configuration, where the default was POP but a dropdown list allowed me to select IMAP.  The first attempt was no good, so I checked the settings for Mail on my iPhone (the ATT web site did not display any configuration at all).  The hostname was shown as <a href=""http://imap.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.att.net</a>, port 993, security was SSL (I selected SSL/TLS), the auth method was password, and my username was my email address.  on the outgoing server, the iPhone had <a href=""http://smtp.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.att.net</a>, port 465, which I copied, SSL/TLS, password, and my email address as username.  the Re-test button also found those same settings (green message box). </p><p>But the Done button, after a short delay, replied ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" in a yellow message box. </p><p>I cannot get any further than this, and have no idea where to turn.  Both the iPhone and the web site on Windows 10 still work, with the same password (which I copied for the mail signin, so I assume that is the password which was submitted to the servers, since there was no place to enter any other  passwords. </p><p>James Allan Richardson [edited email and phone# from community support forum] </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1732929;1732938;,jallan32

Bu durum, hem kullanıcı deneyimini olumsuz etkilemekte hem de iş akışımı aksatmaktadır. Sorunun, uygulama tarafından kayıtlı şifrelerin doğru şekilde kullanılmamasından veya olası bir bağlantı/doğrulama problemlerinden kaynaklı olabileceğini düşünmekteyim.
