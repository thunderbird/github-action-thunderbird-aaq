The automatic setup option ONLY showed the old POP account which I used years ago on the same email address (jallan32@att.net), so I went to manual configuration, where the default was POP but a dropdown list allowed me to select IMAP.  The first attempt was no good, so I checked the settings for Mail on my iPhone (the ATT web site did not display any configuration at all).  The hostname was shown as <a href=""http://imap.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.att.net</a>, port 993, security was SSL (I selected SSL/TLS), the auth method was password, and my username was my email address.  on the outgoing server, the iPhone had <a href=""http://smtp.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.att.net</a>, port 465, which I copied, SSL/TLS, password, and my email address as username.  the Re-test button also found those same settings (green message box). </p><p>But the Done button, after a short delay, replied ""Unable to log in at server.

The concern that I have is that the profile location is hardcoded in several files withing the profile folder, specifically prefs.js, folderCache.json, permissions.sqlite (binary file), addonStartup.json.lz4 (binary file) and extensions.json. </p><p>E.g. especially in prefs.js there are many user_pref entries that have the foldername embedded such as this one: </p><p>user_pref(""extensions.bootstrappedAddons"", ""{\""es-AR@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org\"":{\""version\"":\""2.6.3.1\"",\""type\"":\""dictionary\"",\""descriptor\"":\""G:\\\\tanguero88\\\\Mail\\\\Thunderbird\\\\Profiles\\\\p271pzrc.default\\\\extensions\\\\es-AR@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org\"",\""multiprocessCompatible\"":false,\""runInSafeMode\"":false,\""dependencies\"":[],\""hasEmbeddedWebExtension\"":false},\""pt-PT@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org\"":{\""version\"":\""18.4.18.2\"",\""type\"":\""dictionary\"",\""descriptor\"":\""G:\\\\tanguero88\\\\Mail\\\\Thunderbird\\\\Profiles\\\\p271pzrc.default\\\\extensions\\\\pt-PT@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org\"",\""multiprocessCompatible\"":false,\""runInSafeMode\"":false,\""dependencies\"":[],\""hasEmbeddedWebExtension\"":false}}""); </p><p>and others with pointers to addons and some whose function is not really evident. </p><p>Obviously, just copying the folder to the new computer and pointing the new Thunderbird installation to the new folder is not going to update these hardcoded filenames in the new installation without some kind of a ""smart"" import feature that makes all these little changes. It seems quite tedious (though not impossible) to go in with a text editor and do all these manually, though even then the .lz4 and .sqlite are binary files so not that easy either. And if I don't update, it would seem that something, sooner or later, will break! </p><p>This does not seem to have been documented in any of the articles on the subject that I've read. So what's the deal? Will Thunderbird recreate these? Will it choke on it? Will I just silently lose whatever settings these user preferences correspond to? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1733110;,tanguero88

El correo de mi mujer, en la misma cuenta, no tiene problemas, y el mío, desde thunderbird para android o desde un pc con window8.1 tampoco. ¿Alguna idea para corregir esto? Muchas gracias </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,es,"",pepe.munera

Now we've reached version 138.01. I have realized that the true power of TB is the addons developers' community. Why I'm saying this? Because in reality TB out of the box does not offer any basic but fundamental functions. I'll explain myself. On every TB update there is only correction of code covering TB malfunctions as if Mozilla developers are unaware of users' needs. Now we have the new version but with these fundamental problems i.e. 1. Import/Export tools does no cover full backup/restore functions covering all folders including Local folders content. 2. Lack of internal function to remove the duplicates emails. 3. Lack of full language spelling correction tool when composing an event in calendar. 4. Lack of profile images for all incoming emails. 5. Lack of full functionality of search function ( similar to the addon Expression-Search NG) 6. Lack of internal mail merge function. 7. Lack of more exlicit rules for the creation of filters. Why we have to wait any developer to develop an addon in order to cover TB non existent functions? I'm really tired of waiting and it's time for me to get off TB train and turn to other email clients which respect users needs. This post expresses my disappointment towards Mozilla foundation developers and I dont' expect to receive any comments from other users. The only thing I would like to see is whether other users agree /disagree with my comments. Nobody would like to see that Thunderbird covers only the 0.21% of the market share of all email clients. Our expectations as users would like to see TB only to gain share and not to lose. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lampkaravshops
