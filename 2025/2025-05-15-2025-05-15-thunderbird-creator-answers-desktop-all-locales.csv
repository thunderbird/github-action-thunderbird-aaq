It seems quite tedious (though not impossible) to go in with a text editor and do all these manually, though even then the .lz4 and .sqlite are binary files so not that easy either. And if I don't update, it would seem that something, sooner or later, will break! </p><p>This does not seem to have been documented in any of the articles on the subject that I've read. So what's the deal? Will Thunderbird recreate these? Will it choke on it? Will I just silently lose whatever settings these user preferences correspond to? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",tanguero88;christ1;,true,false,false,";solver_id:6717306;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer""]",2,0,0,,,

Now we've reached version 138.01. I have realized that the true power of TB is the addons developers' community. Why I'm saying this? Because in reality TB out of the box does not offer any basic but fundamental functions. I'll explain myself. On every TB update there is only correction of code covering TB malfunctions as if Mozilla developers are unaware of users' needs. Now we have the new version but with these fundamental problems i.e. 1. Import/Export tools does no cover full backup/restore functions covering all folders including Local folders content. 2. Lack of internal function to remove the duplicates emails. 3. Lack of full language spelling correction tool when composing an event in calendar. 4. Lack of profile images for all incoming emails. 5. Lack of full functionality of search function ( similar to the addon Expression-Search NG) 6. Lack of internal mail merge function. 7. Lack of more exlicit rules for the creation of filters. Why we have to wait any developer to develop an addon in order to cover TB non existent functions? I'm really tired of waiting and it's time for me to get off TB train and turn to other email clients which respect users needs. This post expresses my disappointment towards Mozilla foundation developers and I dont' expect to receive any comments from other users. The only thing I would like to see is whether other users agree /disagree with my comments. Nobody would like to see that Thunderbird covers only the 0.21% of the market share of all email clients. Our expectations as users would like to see TB only to gain share and not to lose. </p>,lampkaravshops;MattAuSupport;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:138.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/138.0,1,0,1,,,
