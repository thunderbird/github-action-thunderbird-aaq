As a result I LOST all my address books and all my received emails. I am 86 and I am involved in many community groups. Now I have NO email contact addresses and recent emails from people. I went to the local Geek Squad for help and I was told all email addresses and all received emails were truly gone. WHY??  Geek Squad person told me it was a Thunderbird support issue.

The automatic setup option ONLY showed the old POP account which I used years ago on the same email address (jallan32@att.net), so I went to manual configuration, where the default was POP but a dropdown list allowed me to select IMAP.  The first attempt was no good, so I checked the settings for Mail on my iPhone (the ATT web site did not display any configuration at all).  The hostname was shown as <a href=""http://imap.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.att.net</a>, port 993, security was SSL (I selected SSL/TLS), the auth method was password, and my username was my email address.  on the outgoing server, the iPhone had <a href=""http://smtp.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.att.net</a>, port 465, which I copied, SSL/TLS, password, and my email address as username.  the Re-test button also found those same settings (green message box). </p><p>But the Done button, after a short delay, replied ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" in a yellow message box. </p><p>I cannot get any further than this, and have no idea where to turn.  Both the iPhone and the web site on Windows 10 still work, with the same password (which I copied for the mail signin, so I assume that is the password which was submitted to the servers, since there was no place to enter any other  passwords. </p><p>James Allan Richardson [edited email and phone# from community support forum] </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1732929;1732938;,jallan32

İlgili hesapların giriş ve SMTP şifreleri, uygulama içerisindeki ""Kayıtlı Parolalar"" bölümünde doğru şekilde kayıtlı olmasına rağmen, uygulamayı her başlattığımda, e-posta gönderimi sırasında veya yeni e-posta kontrolü gerçekleştirdiğimde şifreleri tekrar girmem istenmektedir.  Bu durum, hem kullanıcı deneyimini olumsuz etkilemekte hem de iş akışımı aksatmaktadır. Sorunun, uygulama tarafından kayıtlı şifrelerin doğru şekilde kullanılmamasından veya olası bir bağlantı/doğrulama problemlerinden kaynaklı olabileceğini düşünmekteyim.  Konu hakkında tarafıma destek verilmesini ve gerekli kontrollerin sağlanmasını rica ederim.  İyi çalışmalar. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,tr,"",lakakaersoy
