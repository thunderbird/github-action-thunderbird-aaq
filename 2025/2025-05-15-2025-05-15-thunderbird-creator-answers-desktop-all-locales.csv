As a result I LOST all my address books and all my received emails. I am 86 and I am involved in many community groups. Now I have NO email contact addresses and recent emails from people. I went to the local Geek Squad for help and I was told all email addresses and all received emails were truly gone. WHY??  Geek Squad person told me it was a Thunderbird support issue.

The automatic setup option ONLY showed the old POP account which I used years ago on the same email address (jallan32@att.net), so I went to manual configuration, where the default was POP but a dropdown list allowed me to select IMAP.  The first attempt was no good, so I checked the settings for Mail on my iPhone (the ATT web site did not display any configuration at all).  The hostname was shown as <a href=""http://imap.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.att.net</a>, port 993, security was SSL (I selected SSL/TLS), the auth method was password, and my username was my email address.  on the outgoing server, the iPhone had <a href=""http://smtp.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.att.net</a>, port 465, which I copied, SSL/TLS, password, and my email address as username.  the Re-test button also found those same settings (green message box). </p><p>But the Done button, after a short delay, replied ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" in a yellow message box. </p><p>I cannot get any further than this, and have no idea where to turn.  Both the iPhone and the web site on Windows 10 still work, with the same password (which I copied for the mail signin, so I assume that is the password which was submitted to the servers, since there was no place to enter any other  passwords. </p><p>James Allan Richardson jallan32@att.net 904-343-1766 </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1732929;,jallan32

Is there any way they might have been blocked? It's only from their No Reply team, when it's time to pay, I have no problems receiving mail from any other contacts. I suspect the problem is from their side, as I do get their Customer Support emails, but they are saying different. Cheers. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",19dogman64
