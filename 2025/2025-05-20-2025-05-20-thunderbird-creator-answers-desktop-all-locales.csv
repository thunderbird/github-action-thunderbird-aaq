On looking in the Calendar window I found that all the Tasks had disappeared. How do I get them back? (I do have the computer backed up with Macrium Reflect, so I could restore the file(s) from last week, but I have no idea where the Calendar data is stored.) </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pfvincent
