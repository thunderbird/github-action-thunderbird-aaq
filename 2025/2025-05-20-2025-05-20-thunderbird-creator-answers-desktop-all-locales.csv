On looking in the Calendar window I found that all the Tasks had disappeared. How do I get them back? (I do have the computer backed up with Macrium Reflect, so I could restore the file(s) from last week, but I have no idea where the Calendar data is stored.) </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pfvincent

As previous users have found out, changes were made to Optus's platform which didn't support Thunderbird, all without notifying customers. However, after lengthy discussions with Optus, they have assured me that they now support Thunderbird and after checking all the settings I should be able to receive emails via Thunderbird. However this is not the case and I am still relying on webmail.  Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance. aandr1 </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",aandr1

Plus how do I change it back as not very tech savvy and don't want to have to save yet another file of these old emails to set up again to get them as readable visual emails not links. Have to go to a link to see the emails correctly this is not good when they could contain not wanted information. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",chezbaa7
