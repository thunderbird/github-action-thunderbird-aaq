On looking in the Calendar window I found that all the Tasks had disappeared. How do I get them back? (I do have the computer backed up with Macrium Reflect, so I could restore the file(s) from last week, but I have no idea where the Calendar data is stored.) </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pfvincent

As previous users have found out, changes were made to Optus's platform which didn't support Thunderbird, all without notifying customers. However, after lengthy discussions with Optus, they have assured me that they now support Thunderbird and after checking all the settings I should be able to receive emails via Thunderbird. However this is not the case and I am still relying on webmail.  Does anyone have any ideas?

Il mio pc (molto datato) su cui era installato Thunderbird con quattro diversi account si è spento definitivamente. Non ho quindi modo di recuperare gli account direttamente da Thunderbird e dal pc (con Windows 10) su cui era installato. Ho estratto l'HDD, funzionante, e ho provato a collegarlo tramite adattatore usb ad un portatile con Windows 11. L'HDD viene letto normalmente ma nella cartella Mozilla Thunderbird, naturalmente, non ci sono i profili salvati. C'è un modo, in questa situazione (HDD collegato ad un altro pc con altro Windows), per recuperare i miei profili salvati e le relative mail, dal momento che non posso risalire al percorso delle cartelle nel pc d'origine?
