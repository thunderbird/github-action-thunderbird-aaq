That service also offered a cost-effective email solution for us and I've created a number of email accounts for our office positions and some individuals by name.  At the level of service we have with Hostinger, our website/email account domain is not the same as the email servers. </p><p>That's ordinarily not a problem, since most modern email applications can either pull domain email hostnames from registration records or gives the user a manual process to enter the email hostnames directly (in our case an IMAP and SMTP hostname belonging to Hostinger). </p><p>I had no problem using the manual configuration that Thunderbird supports to set up my first American Legion email address.  Email was received immediately and testing outgoing email worked fine.  Adding a second American Legion email address seemed to go well - email messages came in immediately - but the outbound testing failed with error messages that the sending client was not recognized. </p><p>That sounded like Thunderbird was not trying to authenticate with a password on the SMTP outbound even though I had indicated in the manual setup that a password was required (same as I had in the first American Legion account setup). </p><p>I checked the Thunderbird settings to see what saved passwords were recorded in the Password Manager and sure enough their were three IMAP host passwords but only two SMTP host passwords (the missing SMTP host password was for the second American Legion account). </p><p>I completely deleted the second American Legion account and tried again - just in case I had accidentally indicated no password needed for SMTP the first time - and got the same result (IMAP host password created, but not SMTP).  I then tried deleting both American Legion accounts and then adding them back with the second account being added first this time.  At least the problem was consistent - the first account added had both an IMAP host password record and a SMTP host password created; the second account created had only its IMAP host password saved. </p><p>I couldn't find a menu item for adding a host password in the Save Passwords settings menu; manually removing the IMAP password to force the system to ask for the password again only ended up with the IMAP host password being added back into the TBird Password Manager. </p><p>The version Linux Mint reports for Thunderbird is 1:128.11.1esr+linuxmint1+xia.  As far as I can tell the issue only comes up when Thunderbird cannot auto-detect the email servers on its own and it only has a problem when more than one email account has to be added for a manually configured email domain. </p><p>Is there a TBird menu item I'm missing that would let me add the SMTP host password for the second account manually?  Failing that, is this a known issue that has already been fixed by Thunderbird and should be forthcoming after that version is released as an update by the Linux Mint team? </p>",thunderbird;save-passwords;,thunderbird,save-passwords,en-US,1744848;1744853;1744855;1744860;1744969;,dlj1685
