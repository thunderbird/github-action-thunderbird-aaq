Verify that you have enough disc space, and that you have write privileges to the file system, then try again.""  If I click OK, my list of emails returns for a short while.  I have no idea what to do, as nothing has changed, that I am aware of.  I have a SD hard drive with about 17% space available.  This is on a Dell laptop with i7 processor.  Please help! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",johnking2@comcast.net
