I'm expecting to retain Apple Mail's management of Gmail so Apple Mail can be used to delete/reorganize emails. &lt;– that could be considered one set of data. And I'm also expecting to be able to access and search <em>historical</em> Gmail emails via Thunderbird. &lt;– that could be considered another set of the same data. Hope that makes sense (?) • To clarify, I'm not going to import anything into Apple Mail; I tried that and it failed, so am turning to Thunderbird. </p> <blockquote> Thunderbird never needs to know about any external e-mail accounts, including gmail. </blockquote> <p>That's helpful/reassuring, thank you! I don't want to work in Thunderbird and accidentally be altering what's in Gmail. </p><p>Finally, although I can basically be fine having Thunderbird software live on the Mac while the Thunderbird profile data lives on the USB drive, I'd prefer to have both stay on the USB drive. Only because it feels cleaner that way: 100% of the email backup is on the drive and portable. But, if achieving that involves more than simply dragging Thunderbird to the USB drive during installation...I don't want to deal with it. 😂 Just wondering if it's that's easy? And again, if not, or if <em>maybe</em> not, or we don't know...I don't want to deal with it. So, just wondering. </p><p>Thanks again @Rick and @Michel T for your help! </p>",burntproductions,false,0,0

Whether or not Thunderbird can be installed on an external drive probably depends on the components that Thunderbird installs in different places of the local drive. See the attached screenpic. Caches and plist may be particularly important. I don't know if it is possible to make Thunderbird access such things if it is not installed in the Applications folder. </p><p>You have probably already read: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-thunderbird-on-mac"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-thunderbird-on-mac</a> </p><p>Importing into Apple Mail may have failed because you tried to import everything at once.
