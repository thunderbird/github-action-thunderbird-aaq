I cannot tell from your message how much experience you have with Thunderbird. </p><p>The Thunderbird application and data are separate. Thunderbird on your Mac can access data on an external drive, so there is no need to install Thunderbird on an external drive. Just install it in Applications on your Mac. </p><p>Data is stored in profiles. You can create a profile on your external drive, import the mbox files by copying or moving them into your profile in the file system (not in Thunderbird, but you could do that too), and tell the Thunderbird app to use that profile. </p> <blockquote>how do I make sure TB knows that the data from the mbox(es) I import should ""live"" on the external drive as well? </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure that I understand. Are you expecting to end up with two instances of the data? After you import into Apple Mail, you will want only one instance of the data on the external drive. It will be in your Thunderbird profile and that will be the only place where Thunderbird accesses it. </p><p>Thunderbird never needs to know about any external e-mail accounts, including gmail. </p><p>Is this the approach that you want to take? You may need more information for each step of this process. Please ask again if you do, OK? </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
