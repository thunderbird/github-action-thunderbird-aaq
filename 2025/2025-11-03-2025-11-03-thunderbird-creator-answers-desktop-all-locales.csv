I have used Thunderbird for 9 or 10 years or more.  I know how to find Users and the thunderbird profiles but I cannot figure out what to do next.

Thunderbird seems to have updated itself at some point while this was happening and suddenly it was asking me to log in.  I didn't know whether to imap or pop.  I should have stopped there and gotten help, but i was so bewildered that moments before I was writing emails and several minutes later - poof. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1776701;,anamgirl

The drag and drop of mails from one folder to another, e.g. from inbox to a sub folder, doesn't always work. If I just start Thunderbird and begin dragging emails it works fine, but if I minimize the Thunderbird window and do some other stuff. Then when I go back in Thunderbird, the drag and drop of mails has disappeared. And the only way I get it back is ending Thunderbird and start it up again. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mads.peter.jensen

1544638,2025-11-03 02:54:53 -0800,2025-11-03 07:21:30 -0800,POP3 Message Downloads,"<p>Recently I have noticed some changes in the way my Thunderbird downloads POP3 messages. Previously, it would be common to ask for new messages once a day and receive upwards of one hundred of them. But in the last month, this number has been limited to about 35 at a time. If I ask immediately again, I get about 35 more, and this pattern continues as long as there are messages in queue waiting to be downloaded. I am not sure if this is due to changes in gmail, where most of my received messages originate, or to changes in Thunderbird itself, or to some sort of third-party hack.  Now that I have trained myself to keep on asking until there are no more messages coming down, this change does not cause me much difficulty, although initially it sometimes caused me to overlook messages because I failed to keep asking as long as I should have. Apart from that, it does not seem to be harmful as far as I can tell. I'd just like to know if other people have noticed anything similar, and if anyone knows what is causing it, and whether it has some hidden advantages over the way things used to work. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1776737;,pjmorton

My account needs the option `experimental.mail.ews.overrideOAuth.enabled` set to `true` to specify specific OAuth2 values (Application ID, Tenant ID,...). I see that receiving emails is OK (although the OAUth2 login page is popped up all the time and immediately hidden again, for every email I select, but maybe I have something weird because this is just a test). </p><p>But I cannot send emails using that account. My feeling is the advanced overrideOAuth configuration is not used for the sending/outgoing server. Just for the incoming server part. Am I alright? Is there anyway of setting this overrideOAuth values for the outgoing sending server? </p><p>I have tested the same with evolution and I can receive and send emails. So I'm pretty sure that the outgoing part can work when using the correct overridden OAuth2 values. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",rickyepoderi
