I have used Thunderbird for 9 or 10 years or more.  I know how to find Users and the thunderbird profiles but I cannot figure out what to do next.   This is a disaster for me because earthlink doesn't save my old messages. </p><p>My computer (Surfacepro 6) crashed shortly before this happened.  Thunderbird seems to have updated itself at some point while this was happening and suddenly it was asking me to log in.  I didn't know whether to imap or pop.  I should have stopped there and gotten help, but i was so bewildered that moments before I was writing emails and several minutes later - poof. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",anamgirl

The drag and drop of mails from one folder to another, e.g. from inbox to a sub folder, doesn't always work. If I just start Thunderbird and begin dragging emails it works fine, but if I minimize the Thunderbird window and do some other stuff. Then when I go back in Thunderbird, the drag and drop of mails has disappeared. And the only way I get it back is ending Thunderbird and start it up again. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mads.peter.jensen
