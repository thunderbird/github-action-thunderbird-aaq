Previously, it would be common to ask for new messages once a day and receive upwards of one hundred of them. But in the last month, this number has been limited to about 35 at a time. If I ask immediately again, I get about 35 more, and this pattern continues as long as there are messages in queue waiting to be downloaded. I am not sure if this is due to changes in gmail, where most of my received messages originate, or to changes in Thunderbird itself, or to some sort of third-party hack.  Now that I have trained myself to keep on asking until there are no more messages coming down, this change does not cause me much difficulty, although initially it sometimes caused me to overlook messages because I failed to keep asking as long as I should have. Apart from that, it does not seem to be harmful as far as I can tell. I'd just like to know if other people have noticed anything similar, and if anyone knows what is causing it, and whether it has some hidden advantages over the way things used to work. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1776737;,pjmorton

Thunderbird is not able to retrieve my inbox, but it can retrieve any other folders - both ones at top-level and ones inside Folders or Labels. I am attaching screenshots to show Thunderbird activity - I am subscribed to Inbox, and Thunderbird is retrieving messages from the many other folders of my account. Of note is that sometimes Thunderbird appears to address a folder as  roy@planalp.net/&lt;folder&gt; and sometimes as rpplanalp@proton.me specifically, rpplanalp@proton.me/INBOX appears to be the addressing of the inbox. My original proton account was rpplanalp, before I connected my domain name. </p><p>It has worked fine for a very long time, however, started failing in the last couple weeks and in fact Inbox moved to the bottom of my folders list and I attempted to bring it up to the top. It is notable that I can get the Inbox messages if I subscribe to the All Mail folder, as a poor workaround. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",roy.planalp

I have two email accounts on it, one my university account and one gmail. I have over 500 Local Folders used to keep track of my personal matters, correspondence and tax preparation matters. In the past three or four weeks, during which I updated my Tbird at least once, the Local Folders have become no longer alphabetized and at least one folder I can no longer find. I appears that the most recently used folders are moved to an alphabetized set at the end of my original set. It also appears that the list of folders differs slightly depending on which account from which the list is viewed. Why is this happening and how can I solve it? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",jfa5
