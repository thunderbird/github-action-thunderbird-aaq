Do a Grab of just what you want and then past into your Thunderbird eMail that you are sending out. IT SHOULD WORK, BUT I'M NOT 100% SURE. </p>",JayGee59,false,0,0

I would hazard a guess that the issue is not Thunderbird but other third party software the pokes it's head up when Thunderbird is running.
