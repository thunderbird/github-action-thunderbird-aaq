In your problem transferring the profile, there may have been errors. You need five different SMTP servers defined for the five different accounts. There are several different Spectrum email settings, so I suggest trying the ones that are on the desktop. You also need to ensure that the SMTP server being used is for the same email address as the sending account. It is not uncommon for users with multiple email accounts to have the SMTP servers misaligned. The attached screenshot shows what I am referring to. The SMTP server linked to the account can be viewed/edited as shown in the screenshot. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So,  yes, its a fine back up.  </blockquote> <p>Correct,  but I do know that anyone that considers a local copy of an IMAP connected mail account a backup is someone that does not have a backup.  At best IMAP on the local system can be considered is a local cache to reduce repeated downloads.  It is not and can never be a backup whilst ever IMAP is in the equation as the connection to the server is required and the server is considered canonical. Loos you server copy, either through deletion or something more sinister and your local copy will also cease to exist on the next sync. You need something else. </p><p>Be aware hat there is a relatively long and obscure series of bugs related to storage of Thunderbird data on a remote object.  Be it a server or a NAS.  Thunderbird is not tested on network attached devices and every so often a bug pops up where the network file system is not doing it for Thunderbird, which expects significantly faster speeds of data delivery for it's ""local files"" than any network device can deliver.  Even over fibre it is nothing like as fast as a local platter.  Slow to respond, duplication of files and general corruption are all more frequent on network attached devices than on a local device.  Sometimes it is the length of the UNC path that causes issues especially if you allow the windows search to index your mail in Thunderbird system integration.  Talk about duplication.  That is about as bad as you can get that setting. I offer this as a caution,  not something you can fix.  You are using Thunderbird in what amounts to an unusual manner and your experience may unearth undocumented issues because of that. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

With POP downloading only when active and NEVER syncing the sent folder, I recommend IMAP. It will remove any stress on managing this. The only caveat is that IMAP syncs TO the server. That is, if you delete a message from the phone or a PC, the message is gone for everyone. But that is the intent, keeping all together. On POP, if there is a message you want to delete, you would have to delete on the phone and also on each PC because each has a physically separate copy. Having stated that, if you use IMAP and decide to remove a message yet keep it, it's a simple matter of COPYing it to Local Folders on a PC and then delete it. Let me know your preference, and I will help you get to where you want to be.  If both POP accounts are set to never delete messages, they should stay roughly the same. It's the timing of downloads that will affect how they relate. If messages are not high volume, the two will show the same content after a day or two. For example, if a message comes in, it will download on one laptop, but won't appear on the other  IMAP accounts do this automatically.

I found an email from AOL about a one time password for 3rd party apps and a link. That let me pick a new password and I did. That didn't work either. After dinner, I started to go through my 25+ emails from the day and deleting the ones about 'sales'. Suddenly, the screen flickered and most of the day's emails were gone! I clicked on refresh and they came back. Later I checked on Thunderbird and today's emails are all there! I send myself a test email from another address and it worked. Figure that out!

Go to <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/versions/?page=1#version-12.0.4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/versions/?page=1#version-12.0.4</a>    and download version 12.0.4 .  Then, back on the addons page for extensions, click the gear wheel on the right and then select the 'install addon from file' option, and then proceed as documented previously. We will get through this together. Honest!&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
