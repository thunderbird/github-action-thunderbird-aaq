In your problem transferring the profile, there may have been errors. You need five different SMTP servers defined for the five different accounts. There are several different Spectrum email settings, so I suggest trying the ones that are on the desktop. You also need to ensure that the SMTP server being used is for the same email address as the sending account. It is not uncommon for users with multiple email accounts to have the SMTP servers misaligned. The attached screenshot shows what I am referring to. The SMTP server linked to the account can be viewed/edited as shown in the screenshot. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

With POP downloading only when active and NEVER syncing the sent folder, I recommend IMAP. It will remove any stress on managing this. The only caveat is that IMAP syncs TO the server. That is, if you delete a message from the phone or a PC, the message is gone for everyone. But that is the intent, keeping all together. On POP, if there is a message you want to delete, you would have to delete on the phone and also on each PC because each has a physically separate copy. Having stated that, if you use IMAP and decide to remove a message yet keep it, it's a simple matter of COPYing it to Local Folders on a PC and then delete it. Let me know your preference, and I will help you get to where you want to be.  If both POP accounts are set to never delete messages, they should stay roughly the same. It's the timing of downloads that will affect how they relate. If messages are not high volume, the two will show the same content after a day or two. For example, if a message comes in, it will download on one laptop, but won't appear on the other  IMAP accounts do this automatically.

You can change your password on the server. You'd have to login to your account via webmail to do this. Also, you can delete the password Thunderbird has remembered (in case of an IMAP or POP account), or the authentication token in case of OAuth authentication. But what do you want to 'reset'? </p> <blockquote> I've made an external backup of the whole default profile just in case. </blockquote> <p>That's certainly a good idea. Backups of your Thunderbird profile should be created on a regular basis though. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
