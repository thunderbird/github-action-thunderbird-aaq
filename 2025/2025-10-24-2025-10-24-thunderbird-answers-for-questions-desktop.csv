In your problem transferring the profile, there may have been errors. You need five different SMTP servers defined for the five different accounts. There are several different Spectrum email settings, so I suggest trying the ones that are on the desktop. You also need to ensure that the SMTP server being used is for the same email address as the sending account. It is not uncommon for users with multiple email accounts to have the SMTP servers misaligned. The attached screenshot shows what I am referring to. The SMTP server linked to the account can be viewed/edited as shown in the screenshot. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
