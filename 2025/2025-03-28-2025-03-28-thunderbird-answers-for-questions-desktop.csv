Hold down the control key and press 1. </p><p>Then either leave the spaces toolbar visible so you can fix this in the future or remember control+1. </p><p>You could also show the main toolbar all the time and have a button for the spaces toolbar there.

Quindi rispetto al mio obiettivo, che è quello di liberare il server ma di non perdere i messaggi archiviandoli in locale, il modo di procedere è: - copiare in cartelle locali - cancellarli da thunderbird Non ci sono altri metodi. </p><p><br> A me comunque viene questo dubbio: che senso ha il funzionamento del comando Sposta? Nel senso: nel momento in cui l'ho usato (applicato ad inbox su mail 2025-2020) la situazione che si è creata è la seguente: &gt; LOCALE:  - su Inbox Thunderbird mail 2005-2020 rimosse  - su Cartelle Locali Thunderbird mail 2005-2020 copiate &gt; SERVER - mail 2005-2020 sono ancora presenti. Quindi: - Sposta di fatto agisce come tale solo sul client Thunderbird visto che sul server restano - Se guardo la cartella Inbox di thunderbird NON E' PIU' ALLINEATA AL SERVER, visto che in locale inbox le mail 2005-2020 non le vedo più ma sul server ci sono, non è un pò fuorviante per l'Utente? Uno guarda inbox e pensa sia allineata e invece no. Secondo me lo Sposta dovrebbe comportare un'automatica azione di cancellazione, vi torna? Oppure non sto capendo io... </p><p>Ancora grazie per la pazienza </p>",mt.cattaneo,false,0,0

E spostare una mail è diverso che cancellarla. Se altri client agiscono in modo diverso evidentemente hanno poco a cuore la sicurezza dei propri utenti.

Yes, that's as expected - just did that to show that TB indicates an attachment.   But I normally don't use the view msgs as plain text, I use view as HTML, where the image *does* show. I use HTML view like most ppl because messages are often heavily HTML formatted, and viewing them all in plain text would be unappealing. </p><p>b) re ""STILL the image is shown""  </p><pre>- yes, even though I have ""don't show attachments inline"" and ""always ask"" the images are STILL showing when I'm viewing them in HTML mode.   Again, I want to view my messages, in HTML format, but not load the spam images. </pre> <p>c)  When I select a message for deletion the image is loaded.  The message is NOT  already in the 'Spam/Junk' folder, it's in my inbox. It's often, but not always marked as spam by the mail server, and I'm deleting it.  Anything that TB has put into junk I'm not concerned about, and not looking at. </p><p>d) nope - not clicking ""not junk"" </p><p>Your summary questions: </p><p>1) Where is that email  - inbox 2) When viewing my inbox with View &gt; Message Body as &gt; Original HTML (my normal usage mode) the spam message with image is showing the images. This is what I'm trying to stop.  3) Once the email is selected, deleted and in the trash - I'm not interacting with it. Don't care about it's status at that point, but I assume it's still marked as junk (checked - yes they retain their junk status).  Again, don't care about it once it's deleted. </p><p>So - again - I just want HTML formatted messages arriving in my inbox with attached images to not show the images unless I tell them to show.

For ver 128, it' possible to set one folder and, with a few clicks, include the same setting for all folders within one account.
