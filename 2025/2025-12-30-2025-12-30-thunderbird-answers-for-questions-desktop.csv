When my trash gets pretty full, I empty the trash then restart TB just to have a fresh start.  </blockquote> <p>This is completely unnecessary: when you empty your Trash folder in TB the corresponding ""Trash"" mbox file in the profile is automatically reset to 0 kB. </p> <em><p>clintoconner2 <a href=""#question-1557565"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> Well, I did it just now and when TB restarted I got a warning that said Thunderbird is an app I downloaded from the internet, do I trust it?  First time that has happened.d  I clicked on the button that said to go ahead and open it. </blockquote> <p>This is very odd. macOS only ask this question only once: when you start the first time an application which you have downloaded from internet. Did you download another TB version and replace your actual version? </p><p>Anyway, what you report makes me think that you have unwillingly created a new Thunderbird profile, even if your description doesn't allow me to explain how you did it. Now start TB, go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Profile Folder &gt; Show in Finder, then quit TB. In the Finder window you'll see somewhat like it is shown in my picture. Open the folder ""Profiles"" and make a screen shot of its contents. Then open the ""profiles.ini"" file in Text-Edit and make a screen shot of its contents. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

(Yesterday evening I restarted it at least twice.) </p><p>It seems to be working properly now.  I did make a screenshot of my profiles as you requested, just in case it has a clue about what went wrong, and maybe a clue about how to prevent it from happening in the future. </p><p>BTW, the reason I restart TB each time I empty trash:  After I give the command to empty trash, all of the emails in the trash folder are still visible.

Set up Thunderbird program as 'allowed' so nothing gets blocked. </p> <ul><li> Confirm Thunderbird is set up as allowed program. </li></ul> <p><strong>VPN:</strong> Check computer for a VPN. Some Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and I have come across some peopl who did not realise one had been enabled. Switch off VPN (or create  split tunnelling and set it up for Thunderbird to use).  Gmail does not like VPN as it atempts to hide your IP address, so gmail decides you might be hacker so it auto blocks access. </p> <ul><li> Confirm VPN is switched off </li></ul> <p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Do you have anything using the localhost? People who manage websites may typically use eg: Apache Xampp. You need to switch of any program using the localhost whilst setting up gmail. You can enable it again afterwards.
