In addition to all of the emails that were inboxes and outboxes, I lost all of my emails stored in folders. </p><p>Please help me recover all of my records.   </p><p>Note:  I have Time Machine running on the Mac.  I tried recovering the TB app from a few minutes before everything got screwy and I got the same message about Thunderbird is an app I downloaded from the internet.
