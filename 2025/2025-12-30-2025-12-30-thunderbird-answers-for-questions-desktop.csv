First time that has happened.d  I clicked on the button that said to go ahead and open it. </blockquote> <p>This is very odd. macOS only ask this question only once: when you start the first time an application which you have downloaded from internet. Did you download another TB version and replace your actual version? </p><p>Anyway, what you report makes me think that you have unwillingly created a new Thunderbird profile, even if your description doesn't allow me to explain how you did it. Now start TB, go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Profile Folder &gt; Show in Finder, then quit TB. In the Finder window you'll see somewhat like it is shown in my picture. Open the folder ""Profiles"" and make a screen shot of its contents. Then open the ""profiles.ini"" file in Text-Edit and make a screen shot of its contents. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

The latter might be a very old profile, but possibly it is a ""stub"" profile created at the same time as the first default-release (the one without a number). Without knowing the chronology of your profile creation dates, without knowing how many profiles you use actually and without seeing the contents of the profiles.ini file it is impossible to tell their ""story"" nor what exactly happened yesterday when you restarted TB after emptying the Trash folder. </p> <em><p>clintoconner2 <a href=""#answer-1790101"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> After I give the command to empty trash, all of the emails in the trash folder are still visible.  But after I restart TB the trash folder is empty. </blockquote> <p>Most times I empty my trash folders before they ""get pretty full"" which means for me before they contain thousands or more deleted messages.  So when I empty a trash folder containing a hundred or so messages the effect is immediate.  I might compare your TB trash folder with my Mac's trash bin: sometimes it contains many thousand files and folders and emptying would take half a minute or more. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
