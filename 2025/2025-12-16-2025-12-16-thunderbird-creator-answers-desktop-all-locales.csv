The G Mail account still works.  I tried to reenter my Spectrum Account and I keep getting that my configuration user name or password are wrong.  I checked all settings and they appear to be correct.  I also deleted the account and tried reinstalling it and got the same result. I also tried to enter a new email account that I just got.  I had the same result.  Keeps asking me to reenter the password.  (would be helpful if it would say why it is wrong (password, setting, etc.)  I spent hours on this today.  I worked with the Spectrum agent and we couldn't fix it.  Bur it seems to be a general problem because I get the same result with both accounts. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jjflynn
