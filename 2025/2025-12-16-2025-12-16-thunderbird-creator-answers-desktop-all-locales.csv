The G Mail account still works.  I tried to reenter my Spectrum Account and I keep getting that my configuration user name or password are wrong.  I checked all settings and they appear to be correct.  I also deleted the account and tried reinstalling it and got the same result. I also tried to enter a new email account that I just got.  I had the same result.  Keeps asking me to reenter the password.  (would be helpful if it would say why it is wrong (password, setting, etc.)  I spent hours on this today.  I worked with the Spectrum agent and we couldn't fix it.  Bur it seems to be a general problem because I get the same result with both accounts. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jjflynn

Everything looked OK and after checking it, I let my IOBit Uninstaller get rid of excess files.  It got rid of all of them.  I may still be able to get them back, however in the setup your existing email, it won't log in.  It finds the configuration, income and outgoing and username.  But then comes back with the ERROR Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, user name or password.  I only have one account and it is also loaded on my laptop.  However, that doesn't help me much as I hadn't used the laptop for months until this happened.  Why won't it log in?  Looks the same as the laptop in settings.  My restore points don't work.  It has not been my day.   </p><p>So, how do I get it to log in? I really need that email back.  Thanks  Tori (who will back and save on a stick forever now) </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1786334;,verse
