I have email correspondence in Archives on my Local Folder going back to 1998. On July 10, 2007, Mozilla phone support helped me get my Netscape mail into Thunderbird. For many years, I had no problems loading this old email correspondence in Thunderbird. I'm not sure exactly when it started, but emails from 1998, 1999, and 2000 no longer load. Also, I'm not sure, but it is probably all Netscape mail. I can still see the header information (sender, recipient, date, subject, etc.), but cannot open up the messages to read them. </p><p>Any solution? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1714103;1714106;1714108;,NY2LA

So I set the Inbox to Alphabetic sequence in the ""FROM"" heading so that I can delete say 100 emails from the same sender. This has never been a problem in the past! But now it will not delete the bulk 100 emails! Even though they have been ""highlighted"" in blue, when I press the ""Delete"" button it just changes the blue highlight to a grey highlight. So then I try deleting just one of the hundred emails and it deletes it ok! So then I try just 50 of the 100 and it will NOT delete them!!! So then I try 25 of the 50 and it still will not delete them!!! WHAT IS GOING ON PLEASE? THIS IS RIDICULOUS and makes the deleting task a massive time-consuming nightmare!!!

Instead of being able to click on the link and go to my installed Firefox, it's forcing me to copy the link and manually insert it into the installed Firefox. The third image is my active Firefox window.  The other two (duplicates) is the Firefox screen I get when I click on a link.  My Firefox install appears on the lower menu bar.  The Thunderbird generated Firefox is only accessible by clicking a link in an email.   I hope there's a solution.

Eventually, they implemented a Verify Code process.  When they did, they entered my email address wrong.  They told me they entered it as rbattista2@gmail.com instead of rabattista2@gmail.com.  Since I did not have that email address I could not get their Verify Code.  They told me they cannot change that ... that I have to do that.  I tried to set up an account for rbattista2@gmail.com so I could get the Verify Code and then correct the email address that is wrong.  I have had problems doing that.  I am 94 years old, and on a medicine that makes my hands shake.  (It is taking me forever to type this ... and I cannot use a telephone)  It appears to me that I have finished the part of setting up a new account for rbattista2 ... but somehow, things got messed up when I was trying to set up the password.  Now, I cannot get into that account because I do not have the correct password.  I have communicated with more than one person at Google and they say it will take 5 to 10 days to fix things.  I have NEVER heard back from anyone.  This is very important to me!    Can you help me fix this problem?
