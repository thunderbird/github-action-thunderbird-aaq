I have email correspondence in Archives on my Local Folder going back to 1998. On July 10, 2007, Mozilla phone support helped me get my Netscape mail into Thunderbird. For many years, I had no problems loading this old email correspondence in Thunderbird. I'm not sure exactly when it started, but emails from 1998, 1999, and 2000 no longer load. Also, I'm not sure, but it is probably all Netscape mail. I can still see the header information (sender, recipient, date, subject, etc.), but cannot open up the messages to read them. </p><p>Any solution? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1714103;1714106;1714108;,NY2LA

So I set the Inbox to Alphabetic sequence in the ""FROM"" heading so that I can delete say 100 emails from the same sender. This has never been a problem in the past! But now it will not delete the bulk 100 emails! Even though they have been ""highlighted"" in blue, when I press the ""Delete"" button it just changes the blue highlight to a grey highlight. So then I try deleting just one of the hundred emails and it deletes it ok! So then I try just 50 of the 100 and it will NOT delete them!!! So then I try 25 of the 50 and it still will not delete them!!! WHAT IS GOING ON PLEASE? THIS IS RIDICULOUS and makes the deleting task a massive time-consuming nightmare!!!

I can't see attachments and cannot respond to emails.  Also cannot delete emails. I Iooked it up to see how to fix it and they say to remove the ""lightning"" add on.  When I go under tools and look for this add on, it is not there.  In fact it doesn't seem that I have any add-ons. Something to do with the calendar which I don't even use. It says Thunderbird is up to date. Could you please give any advice how to fix it. Thanks, Matt </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mandrcollins
