If it fails, manually enter your email provider's server settings (IMAP for incoming, SMTP for outgoing) and authentication details (often OAuth2 or username/password) to complete the connection. We always recommend using the secure port as that ensures the connection between your email client and the server will be encrypted. Only use 110 if 995 is not available. </p>",charlotteemma6778,true,0,0
