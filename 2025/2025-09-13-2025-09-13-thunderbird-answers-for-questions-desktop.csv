Perhaps you could share your issue, as clicking the paperclip allows you to select a file to attach to an email. </p><p>Perhaps they are simply to large,  that is not something Thunderbird has influence over,  it is also why there is a filelink process for large attachments.

If it fails, manually enter your email provider's server settings (IMAP for incoming, SMTP for outgoing) and authentication details (often OAuth2 or username/password) to complete the connection. We always recommend using the secure port as that ensures the connection between your email client and the server will be encrypted. Only use 110 if 995 is not available. </p>",charlotteemma6778,true,0,0
