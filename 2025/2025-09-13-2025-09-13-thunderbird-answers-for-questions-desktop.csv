But you're past that. To transfer JUST an addressbook, do this:  - click tools&gt;import&gt;import from a file, and follow the addressbook links to the one allowing import from sqlite files, and then select the abook.sqlite file from your old profile. and then repeat, selecting the history.sqlite file.  Now, if the old profile is gone, then you work with the csv that you exported. to do that, create one address manually in the addressbook, and then export it from thunderbird. open in a spreadsheet program and note the top row. That shows how thunderbird organizes the addressbook. Now, open your exported csv into a spreadsheet program and adjust the columns to match the one from thunderbird. once you have  match, you can import the csv and it should work fine. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Recent PC backups all show similar content in the ...profiles/xxx/mail/local folders subdirectory on the PC. So I presume no data has been lost. Yet most, not all, folders in the ""local folder"" directory within TB show as empty. </p><p>IMAP account Network Solutions </p><p>Again, that's for your help! </p><p>Bob </p>",bobp21,false,0,0

Thanks for the suggestions. - no filter options are marked - view/threads/all is selected </p><p>The panel the TB folders panel on the left shows the number of items in the folders. For 90% of local folders there is no indication of any messages--ie, blank. In fact, that's the case--no messages shown when we open the folder. </p><p>Bob </p>",bobp21,false,0,0
