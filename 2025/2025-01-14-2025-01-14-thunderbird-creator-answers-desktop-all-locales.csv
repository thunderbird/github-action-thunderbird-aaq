In order to protect these accounts a Private Password can be created.  It prevents someone trying to use Thunderbird as you (using your profile) from seeing the passwords or establishing connections to the email servers.    </p><p>The question I have (and I believe was being asked) is, does using a Private Password actually encrypt the account credentials, or does it just block someone when they're using the Thunderbird program?  Asked another way, would a bad actor with access to the profile and access to appropriate sleuthing tools be able to recover the credentials--from the files alone--thus bypassing the private password of the Thunderbird program? </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1703483;,chull_56

Mbox, the default in Thunderbird, creates large files, and if you backup changed files, every backup requires recopying a multi-gigabyte file, because it has changed when even one message was added or deleted. Maildir, the alternative, puts each message in a separate file. But file systems have a lot of overhead and their own limits. When you have hundreds of thousands of messages, especially on a PC, that clutters the computer's file system, and between the file cluster size and directory overhead, it wastes a lot of space and slows down other operations. Two bad options. And let's not be too snarky about what that company from Redmond does in its awful mail system, with a giant proprietary mail database file that sometimes gets corrupted... </p><p>It is obviously a lot to ask to create a new mail file format that scales better. It would not be standard and could break some things anyway, though in the long run it might be a good idea. But I have an idea that might work for Thunderbird. As it stands now, it is possible to create archive files by month or year. Then new mail doesn't require those to be re-copied. WHAT IF a ""virtual mailbox"" could be created that, instead of consisting of one Mbox file or one maildir directory, consisted of a set of Mbox files treated by the UI as one? Quick Filter would filter them all as one, unlike with archives, and you could scroll through them all and sort them and see threads, but they'd be stored as monthly or annual (or whatever) files, the way archives are. Sending and receiving would be unchanged, using the current folders, but periodically the folder could have the oldest ones moved out and still made part of a virtual folder. </p><p>There are some modest virtual folder capabilities now, but I don't see how to do this. Does it seem like a possibility with what's there, or a modest enhancement, or is that the kind of thing that would be a huge effort? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",fred37

How is this process supposed to work in thunderbird? I receive a signed email, what next? Clearly, thunderbird sees the signature but does not add the public key to the contact. This is in contradiction with [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-cannot-encrypt#w_obtaining-smime-certificates-of-correspondents|this"" rel=""nofollow"">page</a>] that states: <em>The standard way of distributing a person's certificate is to send a digitally signed email. If you have received a signed email from your correspondent, click the email to view it. If Thunderbird considers the email's signature and the sender's certificate valid, it will automatically be imported and available when you attempt to encrypt an email to that correspondent using the S/MIME technology. If you don't have a signed email from your correspondent yet, you could ask them to send a digitally signed email to you. </em> </p><p>Note that certificates issued by CAs may have a short validity period. Certificates are no longer usable after the validity period has expired. In that case your correspondent will have to obtain a new certificate. Once that happened they will be able to send you a new digitally signed email with a valid certificate. </p><p>Organizations that operate an LDAP server may configure their server to store S/MIME certificates. If an LDAP server is configured, Thunderbird may automatically query the LDAP server if it needs to obtain a S/MIME certificate. </p><p>To review the list of S/MIME certificates that you already have, you can use Thunderbird's Certificate Manager. <em> </em> </p><p>The certificate shows that it is valid, yet, clicking reply gives ""key issues"" which shows no key available. Similarly, if I sign an email with pgp key and send it, thunderbird sees that it is signed but tells me that i need to obtain public pgp key. So it seems that signatures and encryption are completely unusable. </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",leosenko
