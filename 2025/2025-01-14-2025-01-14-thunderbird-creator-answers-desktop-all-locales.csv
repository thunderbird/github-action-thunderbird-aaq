In order to protect these accounts a Private Password can be created.  It prevents someone trying to use Thunderbird as you (using your profile) from seeing the passwords or establishing connections to the email servers.    </p><p>The question I have (and I believe was being asked) is, does using a Private Password actually encrypt the account credentials, or does it just block someone when they're using the Thunderbird program?

Mbox, the default in Thunderbird, creates large files, and if you backup changed files, every backup requires recopying a multi-gigabyte file, because it has changed when even one message was added or deleted. Maildir, the alternative, puts each message in a separate file. But file systems have a lot of overhead and their own limits. When you have hundreds of thousands of messages, especially on a PC, that clutters the computer's file system, and between the file cluster size and directory overhead, it wastes a lot of space and slows down other operations. Two bad options. And let's not be too snarky about what that company from Redmond does in its awful mail system, with a giant proprietary mail database file that sometimes gets corrupted... </p><p>It is obviously a lot to ask to create a new mail file format that scales better. It would not be standard and could break some things anyway, though in the long run it might be a good idea. But I have an idea that might work for Thunderbird. As it stands now, it is possible to create archive files by month or year. Then new mail doesn't require those to be re-copied. WHAT IF a ""virtual mailbox"" could be created that, instead of consisting of one Mbox file or one maildir directory, consisted of a set of Mbox files treated by the UI as one? Quick Filter would filter them all as one, unlike with archives, and you could scroll through them all and sort them and see threads, but they'd be stored as monthly or annual (or whatever) files, the way archives are. Sending and receiving would be unchanged, using the current folders, but periodically the folder could have the oldest ones moved out and still made part of a virtual folder. </p><p>There are some modest virtual folder capabilities now, but I don't see how to do this. Does it seem like a possibility with what's there, or a modest enhancement, or is that the kind of thing that would be a huge effort? </p>",fred37;Toad-Hall;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:133.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/133.0,4,0,1,,,

How is this process supposed to work in thunderbird? I receive a signed email, what next? Clearly, thunderbird sees the signature but does not add the public key to the contact. This is in contradiction with [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-help-cannot-encrypt#w_obtaining-smime-certificates-of-correspondents|this"" rel=""nofollow"">page</a>] that states: <em>The standard way of distributing a person's certificate is to send a digitally signed email. If you have received a signed email from your correspondent, click the email to view it. If Thunderbird considers the email's signature and the sender's certificate valid, it will automatically be imported and available when you attempt to encrypt an email to that correspondent using the S/MIME technology. If you don't have a signed email from your correspondent yet, you could ask them to send a digitally signed email to you. </em> </p><p>Note that certificates issued by CAs may have a short validity period. Certificates are no longer usable after the validity period has expired. In that case your correspondent will have to obtain a new certificate. Once that happened they will be able to send you a new digitally signed email with a valid certificate. </p><p>Organizations that operate an LDAP server may configure their server to store S/MIME certificates. If an LDAP server is configured, Thunderbird may automatically query the LDAP server if it needs to obtain a S/MIME certificate. </p><p>To review the list of S/MIME certificates that you already have, you can use Thunderbird's Certificate Manager. <em> </em> </p><p>The certificate shows that it is valid, yet, clicking reply gives ""key issues"" which shows no key available. Similarly, if I sign an email with pgp key and send it, thunderbird sees that it is signed but tells me that i need to obtain public pgp key. So it seems that signatures and encryption are completely unusable. </p>",leosenko;MattAuSupport;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:134.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/134.0,3,0,0,,,

Tengo una estructura de carpetas dentro de las carpetas locales donde almaceno por temas lo que me llega. Algunas de estar carpetas pueden tener varios miles de correos. Ocurre que en una carpeta, han desaparecido muchos muchos correos que almacenaba desde 2014 y sin embargo hay algunos de ellos que están cientos de veces. El mismo correo puede estar 1500 veces, en esa carpeta me dice que hay casi 400.000 correos y ocupa 3 Gb. He perdido muchos correos, pero es que trabajar con los que quedan repetidos es muy complicado, se ha vuelto leeento. Puse un plugin de eliminar repetidos y me dice que no hay. Creo que en cierta manera es como si los correos que yo tenía, se hubiesen transformado en solo unos pocos de ellos repedidos muchas veces, pero vamos, ni de lejos tenía tantos, podría tener si unos 15.000. ¿Como puedo hacer para quedarme solo con una copia de cada uno?, el complemento de duplicados que he puesto... me dice que no hay y a mano, es una tarea bestial! </p>",albertoshsh;pcp04;mfgt1949;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",4,0,1,,,

This time I paid closer attention, and noted several things of interest (that may touch on some questions that remain undiagnosed in this forum): </p> <ol><li> TB took longer to start up, as it could find none of the folders cached in folderCache.json, so rebuilt the cache from the new profile location before starting. (I only learned about this from the next effect.) </li><li> The ""Move to"" ""Recent"" folders list was empty; this cached list only gets rebuilt from use (that is, from moving messages manually (not via filter) to destination folders).  This effect led me to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1378700"" rel=""nofollow"">folderCache.json</a>- and also may suggest why the OP in that question could not get resolution of his problem. </li><li> The newly cached folderCache.json was 528 KB, compared to 365 KB at the old location -- and that, in turn, was 170 KB larger than the 195 KB size of folderCache.json at the original location. So each time the cache is rebuilt it grows perhaps 150~200 KB (size depending on the many-times-repeated path length). </li></ol> <p>What causes the file growth? Because each time it is rebuilt, TB checks through all of the cached folder paths, apparently guided by the mailboxes listed in folderTree.json (see image below). [I <em>think</em> TB just checks each path to see whether it is compatible with the current profile location. If yes, the path is cached for runtime; if no, the path is repopulated from the current profile location (which takes most of the startup time).]  But <em>TB never deletes the no-longer-valid paths</em>; it just appends to what was already in the file, so that <em><strong>the list of cached folder paths just grows</strong></em> (thereby increasing TB's startup time, every time).  The best way to get rid of the old stuff is just to delete folderCache.json and let it rebuild on the next startup, to reduce the time needed for subsequent starts. </p><p>Finally, my questions: In addition to folderCache.json (different timestamp in each profile, of course), there are four files which are the same in all profiles: folderCache-<em>x</em>.json, <em>x</em>={1,2,3,4} (see screenshot). These are apparently from actions prior to the profile relocations, as they are simply copied from one profile to the next, unrelated to changes in folderCache.json. Can someone tell me: </p> <ol><li> What actions cause the creation of folderCache-<em>x</em>.json files? </li><li> Why folderCache.json merely appends new folder paths without deleting the old ones? </li><li> Why folder paths are specified explicitly (fully qualified) rather than relative to the profile path? </li></ol> <p>Thanks for any pointers. </p>",kaufmann;MattAuSupport;wsmwk;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:133.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/133.0;solver_id:392715,4,0,0,,,kaufmann
