In order to protect these accounts a Private Password can be created.  It prevents someone trying to use Thunderbird as you (using your profile) from seeing the passwords or establishing connections to the email servers.    </p><p>The question I have (and I believe was being asked) is, does using a Private Password actually encrypt the account credentials, or does it just block someone when they're using the Thunderbird program?  Asked another way, would a bad actor with access to the profile and access to appropriate sleuthing tools be able to recover the credentials--from the files alone--thus bypassing the private password of the Thunderbird program? </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",chull_56
