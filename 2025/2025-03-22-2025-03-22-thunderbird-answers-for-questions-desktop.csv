Some suggestions:  - you can install a new copy of the same version of thunderbird directly over the top of current install. You can locate and download the desired version and language here:  <a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/</a>   - if you want to save your data for a move to new computer, you need a copy of the profile folder.

The image is of Thunderbird on my laptop. </p><p>I went to the list of mail folders  in the left most panel, right clicked, and created folder ""Mozilla"". You can see it now in the image circled at the very bottom of that left panel. </p><p>That folder is the issue. I was not able to create it as an imap folder. To illustrate that, I then copied your email to that folder and selected the folder with that one entry. I then clicked on the email to move it to another folder and that is when I took this screenshot. </p><p>As you can see, when I navigate to my email name I see a partial list of folders (compared to the left panel). I also see ""[Gmail]"" as a slide off and that is the final list on the right. Those are imap folders, not local, and available to any instance of Thunderbird I may run on a phone, my desktop systems, etc. </p><p>There used to be a way to see that ""[Gmail]"" option in the list of folders on the left side so that I had the option of creating a local or an imap folder. Now that option is either gone or hidden. </p><p>I hope that description and the image help describe what I am trying to report.&nbsp;;-) </p><p>To be fair, it is possible that all the folders are now imap'd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding that it is working okay and that the interface got smoothed out but I still need to know what, if any, difference there is between what look like two independent sets of folders. </p>",dmischel1,false,0,0

Fwiw, the left panel _used_ to show the imap folders in a [gmail] slideoff and that disappeared a while ago.

This is the reply. </p><p>I have attached a shot of the Mozilla folder properties window. I didn't know about this but it answers my base question about the folder: it is indeed an imap folder. I thus conclude that all my folders are imap folders and that is why the slideoff disappeared from the left panel.  </p><p>The slideoff is still in the popup menu and that did confuse me, leading to this thread.  </p><p>That having been said, I will mark this thread resolved. </p><p>Remaining is a new task for me: all those Trash folders. I seem to have at least 3 or 4 Trash folders in imap. The properties window helps sort that. I suspect this is due to multiple Tbird installations over the years which specify a Trash location. I have given myself a new task of consolidating them all into a single Trash folder, making deleted message easier to find.&nbsp;;-) </p><p>Thanks for your help, david, getting this sorted. </p><p>&lt; david </p>",dmischel1,false,0,0

If I then exit from Thunderbird and restart, the selected folder appears in the left-hand column. That works, whether or not the box is checked for 'Show only subscribed folders'. What I don't understand is why it's necessary to do that after the 'Show only subscribed folders' box has been unchecked. </p><p>I have tried (1) unchecking the 'Show only subscribed folders' box, exiting and restarting; (2) deleting my account and creating a new one with the box unchecked at the start; and (3) deleting my account, exiting, deleting the profile directory under AppData\Roaming\thunderbird\, restarting, and creating a new account with the box unchecked at the start. The unsubscribed folders still don't appear. </p><p>Edit: I don't see anything that says 'All folders' and 'Subscribe'. I should also say that, although this thread mentioned subfolders at the start, my concern is with folders that don't appear, not just subfolders. </p><p>Edit 2: All of the above was done with Thunderbird 136.0.1 under Windows 11 Home.

But you said ""Samlede mapper"" (=all folders) In which case it should have the mail account name listed first and all the various folders below. BUT - Your image does not show that at all. Also if I do a google translate of 'Unified Folders' - it says danish is 'Samlede mapper' </p><p>So you are using Unified view and the image is displaying a Unified structure. 'Indbakke' means 'Inbox' It contains a mail account Inbox which looks like a mail account name, but it isn't - it's that accounts Inbox - look at the icon - it's an Inbox icon so you cannot use it to do any subscribing. So that means 'Indbakke' is a 'Unified Inbox' That means the Unified Inbox can only display the various Inboxes for all accounts.  The only additional thing it can display is an accounts 'Inbox' subfolders. </p><p>The 'Kladder' folder means 'Drafts' in English. It is also a Unified 'Drafts' folder Currently it does not show a  &gt; chevron to the left so that means no accounts have been selected to display the accounts Drafts folder. </p><p>Same applies to 'Skabeloner' which means 'Templates' - that is a Unified Templates folder and nothing has been selected to display. </p><p>The mail account name folder itself would be at the bottom below all the Unified Folders. </p><p>If you only have one mail account then stop using that view. It is not designed to be used for a single account.  I think it's confusing the issue at this moment. So please remove it. View &gt; Folders &gt; <strong>All </strong>- uncheck any others selected, just select 'All' </p><p>You mention IMAP, but is it really set up as IMAP?  It seems very odd to only have an Inbox - I would have expected that to occur if you had a Pop account. </p><p><strong>Let us start at the beginning.</strong> You mention moving profiles between computers in the past, so it's likely you know to Copy the 'Thunderbird' folder from 'C://Users/user account/Appdata/'Roaming' folder Then on new computer, access same location and past the copied 'Thunderbird' folder into the 'Roaming' folder. </p><p>So I'm presuming you did the above. </p><p>Then maybe you installed Thundrbird and it should have picked up the profile - but it did not - something went wrong. Which then makes me wonder where did you get the Thunderbird download/install program. </p><p>You mention a new computer and Windows 11 OS Where did you get the Thunderbird download installation&nbsp;? Did you get it from the Windows App Store&nbsp;? If yes, then it would explain why you are not seeing all the old data. Windows App Store create a brand new location for profiles - it's a real pain and it's not easy to locate - it also has a much longer directory to access it.  </p><p>I would suggest you uninstall Thunderbird and get a fresh download from the official website at this link: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> </li></ul> <p>Then access the new computer Firewall (either the default that comes with Windows 11 or it's controlled by an Anti-Virus if you installed one) Thunderbird program  - that's the thunderbird.exe - must be set up as an allowed program to ensure nothing gets blocked. </p><p>Start Thunderbird Please make sure you have the following setting: View &gt; Folders &gt; <strong>All </strong>- uncheck any others selected, just select 'All' - it's the option at the top of the list. 'Alle mapper'  = All folders 'Samlede mapper'  = Unified folders </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
