Fangda has recognized this requirement, shaping its product range to reflect both strength and stability. In projects where reinforced concrete or dense stone is involved, users need instruments capable of delivering results without compromising control, and this has transformed the tool into a foundation of professional work. </p><p>Durability is central to equipment design, as tools are constantly exposed to vibration, dust, and heat during operation. A focus on material strength ensures that instruments retain their performance under such challenging conditions. With strict production control, manufacturers ensure stability, so professionals can complete their work with confidence. This approach does not just create a tool, but a long-term partner in construction efficiency. </p><p>Performance is also about accuracy. An unstable drill path can cause damage to surfaces or reduce structural integrity, increasing risks for both projects and workers. Precision engineering minimizes such issues, offering steady alignment that allows users to work faster while maintaining quality. This balance between speed and accuracy is what distinguishes high-level manufacturing from ordinary production. </p><p>Adaptability has also become increasingly important. Construction sites rarely present uniform materials, and the ability to transition across applications is crucial. Instruments designed with versatile performance allow workers to complete a range of tasks without interruption. Such adaptability represents modern thinking, where professional needs are met with thoughtful engineering solutions that combine usability with resilience. </p><p>Reputation plays a significant role when professionals select their tools. Global industries look for manufacturers whose products consistently perform, as trust is built over time through tested results. This connection between brand and user transforms the relationship from simple supply to reliable partnership. It also ensures that tools maintain their place as essential assets in workshops and job sites worldwide. </p><p>Sustainability is another rising topic across industries, with users paying closer attention to the environmental impact of equipment production. Factories that adopt efficient processes and responsible material sourcing provide assurance to customers seeking reliable tools without unnecessary waste. This broader approach strengthens both reputation and responsibility. </p><p>In summary, it continues to integrate strength, precision, and adaptability into construction equipment, and details on SDS Plus Hammer Drill and related tools can be found at <a href=""https://www.fangda-tools.com/product/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fangda-tools.com/product/</a> where professionals may explore further. </p>",seg-spam;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",dgb14352

There was always an authentication issue. This is what I did to get things working. This is for MS365 accounts - this may not work with hotmail or the other free MS accounts, I'm sure there are other useful tips for those accounts. </p><p>1. Firstly, MS365 defaults on an organisation level to not using OATH2 on SMTP for users. Get your MS365 admin to do the following: a) Go to MS365 admin centre (not the exchange admin centre) b) Click on Users-&gt;Active Users-&gt;your user name (side window pops up) c) Click on manage email apps (under Email apps) d) Enable the Authenticated SMTP (this is on a per user basis) </p><p>2. The next trick which is not clear is that editing the server settings in thunderbird do not seem to take affect until thunderbird is restarted.   a) Setup thunderbird account in the usual manner - this is fairly straight forward so won't be repeated here. I selected the IMAP settings which appeared at the top of the thunderbird autoconfiguration list. b) The outgoing server settings should look like this: </p><p>Description: &lt;whatever you like, but email address would make sense&gt; Server name: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> Port: 587 Connection Security: STARTTLS User Name: full email address Authentication Method: OAuth2   </p><p>c) Restart thunderbird. </p><p>3. Another issue with sending to gmail addresses is gmail seems to suspect a typical test message is spam and gets lost in the ether. To get around this, I set up a meaningful signature (which you probably would want anyway with an MS365 account). </p><p>This worked for me, I hope someone else finds it useful. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1763154;,mmackenzie.au
