I presume you have already contacted Jan Hagan; maybe the same Jan Hagan of the Bella Vista Radio Club and informed them of the problem. </p><p>The code specifies Arial which is a commonly available font for most OS, but if you have settings to use a different font and also selected the option not to allow other fonts then the result would not necessarilly be the same.  </p><p>The person writing this email  has chosen to use %, forcing an increase by 126.56%  on the root font size.  That is a very unusual percentage of choice&nbsp;:) Maybe they got that wrong&nbsp;?  The section of code in image does not show if a specific root font size had been previously set up in the section above, but I would expect it was set and so the % increase was based on initial setting.  eg: if root Font size = 16px then 125% would increase to 20px  but 126.56% is more than 20px but less than 21px,  a confusing choice of percentage.  </p><p>Code could have written much better, but I'm only viewing part of it.

Based on the content displayed, I'm not sure why they bothered to create html as it's just simple text.
