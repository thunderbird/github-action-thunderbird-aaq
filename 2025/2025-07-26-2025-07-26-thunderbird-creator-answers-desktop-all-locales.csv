The message ""You have been signed out of this account. This may have happened automatically because another user signed in from the same browser"" strongly suggests a conflict, but it's typically a browser-related error, not a direct Thunderbird logout. </p><p>The most likely culprit for Thunderbird losing access to your Gmail is an authentication issue. Modern Gmail access in Thunderbird relies on OAuth2, a secure protocol. If the OAuth2 token becomes invalid or expires, or if Thunderbird's internal web component (used for the OAuth2 login pop-up) has issues like cookies being disabled, it can repeatedly prompt you for login. </p><p>Less common, but possible, are: Google's security systems detecting unusual activity and temporarily blocking access, or, if you're not using OAuth2 and have 2-Step Verification enabled, an expired or revoked App Password. While less direct, a concurrent, conflicting sign-in in a web browser using the same Google account could also contribute to Google invalidating sessions. </p><p>To resolve this, ensure your Thunderbird Gmail account is configured to use OAuth2 for both incoming (IMAP) and outgoing (SMTP) server settings. Also, verify that Thunderbird is allowed to accept cookies under its Privacy &amp; Security settings, as this is crucial for the OAuth2 process. Removing saved passwords for the Gmail account in Thunderbird and then restarting it can force a fresh OAuth2 re-authentication. </p>",windows-11;thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1752046;,hishi0729

Beginning today, when I try to send an email through my Comcast account, it fails with the following message: </p><p>“An error occurred while sending mail: Outgoing server (SMTP) error. The server responded: <a href=""http://resomta-h2p-555031.sys.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">resomta-h2p-555031.sys.comcast.net</a> <a href=""http://resomta-h2p-555031.sys.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">resomta-h2p-555031.sys.comcast.net</a> EXMTP server not available.” </p><p>The outgoing SMTP server is configured as follows: Outgoing server: <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> Port: 465 Security: SSL/TLS </p><p>For comparison, sending email from my Android phone, using the Gmail client with the same server specs, also fails, thought it gives no information. </p><p>For more comparison, I configured Outlook to test with it, and it was able to send successfully.  I noticed in setting it up that it used the same server name, but with port 587.  Armed with that information, I changed the port setting in T-bird to 587.  With that change, the send still failed but with a different error: </p><p><em><strong>Sending of the message failed. </strong></em> The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> was lost in the middle of the transaction.
