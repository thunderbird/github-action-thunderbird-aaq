The normal POP servers are <a href=""http://pop.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.aol.com</a> and <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a>.  If you already have one of those with correct settings, add export to the server name and see if the older mail is downloaded. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

Mostly stories promoted by folk that sell Microsoft products and do not like the Open Source concept for their business profits I would think.  No money to be made selling Thunderbird as it's use is free and unrestricted. </p><p>A decade ago Mozilla dumped Thunderbird and a new company was formed to run the development of Thunderbird funded by donations from Thunderbird users.  Whilst ever folk keep giving the program will continue in development  last year an Android version was developed on the bones of the K9 mail app. I understand the intention is for an iPhone version next year, so I would say Thunderbird is growing year on year,  not facing extinction. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Storing it like it was some sort of national archive.  The way POP manages to start again each session is because it stores the last email received information somewhere on the local machine.  Thunderbird stores this information in a popstate.dat file in the profile folder,  one file for each account.  In the case of some pop accounts this file can be huge, with a reference to every email on the server.  I have no idea where windows mail stored this information,  probably in the registry.  I will certainly not be looking, as each program maintains it's own ""where am I up to"" information and it is not transferable from application to application. Even if you were to import all the mails from windows mail,  the status would not come over and everything on the server would still be downloaded again. </p><p>So all your mail will have to be downloaded again from the server (unless you provider is like Google and offers some web setting to limit downloads or yahoo who limit downloads per account to 10,000).  There is nothing in the POP protocol to tell the server you only want mail after a certain date. So there is nothing in the protocol that allows any mail client to do what you are asking. You are essentially asking for the last 20 gallons of water that fell into your rainwater tank.  The systems used have no way to identify which 20 gallons is the last 20 gallons.  This is not just a Thunderbird limitation it is a POP IMAP and I think exchange limitation.  As those three protocols probably account for 99% of non webmail email activity I think you need to stop looking for solutions that really do not exist in the mail client sphere and accept the reality of how email works.  If you have changed over yeas ago when Microsoft told you that the program was being retired you would have had years less mail to be downloaded over again. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
