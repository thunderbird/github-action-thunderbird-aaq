Mostly stories promoted by folk that sell Microsoft products and do not like the Open Source concept for their business profits I would think.  No money to be made selling Thunderbird as it's use is free and unrestricted. </p><p>A decade ago Mozilla dumped Thunderbird and a new company was formed to run the development of Thunderbird funded by donations from Thunderbird users.  Whilst ever folk keep giving the program will continue in development  last year an Android version was developed on the bones of the K9 mail app. I understand the intention is for an iPhone version next year, so I would say Thunderbird is growing year on year,  not facing extinction. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Storing it like it was some sort of national archive.  The way POP manages to start again each session is because it stores the last email received information somewhere on the local machine.  Thunderbird stores this information in a popstate.dat file in the profile folder,  one file for each account.  In the case of some pop accounts this file can be huge, with a reference to every email on the server.  I have no idea where windows mail stored this information,  probably in the registry.  I will certainly not be looking, as each program maintains it's own ""where am I up to"" information and it is not transferable from application to application. Even if you were to import all the mails from windows mail,  the status would not come over and everything on the server would still be downloaded again. </p><p>So all your mail will have to be downloaded again from the server (unless you provider is like Google and offers some web setting to limit downloads or yahoo who limit downloads per account to 10,000).  There is nothing in the POP protocol to tell the server you only want mail after a certain date. So there is nothing in the protocol that allows any mail client to do what you are asking. You are essentially asking for the last 20 gallons of water that fell into your rainwater tank.  The systems used have no way to identify which 20 gallons is the last 20 gallons.  This is not just a Thunderbird limitation it is a POP IMAP and I think exchange limitation.  As those three protocols probably account for 99% of non webmail email activity I think you need to stop looking for solutions that really do not exist in the mail client sphere and accept the reality of how email works.  If you have changed over yeas ago when Microsoft told you that the program was being retired you would have had years less mail to be downloaded over again. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

That info is important because it also tells us where to expect the default location of your profile folders. </p><p>Are you talking about a POP or an IMAP mail account&nbsp;? It's important to know because Imap synchs with server to show whatever is on server. That also means we would need to know what are your current settings for what to do with Drafts. </p><p>In 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Copies &amp; Folders' for the mail account What have you got selected for 'Drafts'&nbsp;? Thunderbird would need to know what it's supposed to do with your draft emails. Upload an image showing what settings you are using. </p><p>In 'Settings' &gt; 'Composition' Have you selected the checkbox to 'Auto save every X minutes'&nbsp;? if yes how many minutes is set up&nbsp;? </p><p>When you close a Write new message window you would get prompted to 'Save', 'Discard Changes' or 'Cancel'.

In which case it may be in the 'Sent' folder or if you used 'Send Later' it would be in the 'Outbox'. I have come across some people who have inadvertantly pressed the Enter/Return key and not realised they had also depressed the Ctrl key - those two keys together are the keyboard means of sending. </p><p>Have you checked to see if a filter is operating on the 'Drafts' folder&nbsp;? Select 'Drafts' folder check the following: The 'Quick Filter' - are any of those icons enabled - they would show a blue bar. For example, if the 'pin' icon was selected then it may be applying a previous filter. If 'Show only unread mail' is selected it will show an empty view if there are no unread emails. So make sure none of those icons are selected. </p><p>Using 'Menu Bar' - View &gt; Threads &gt; select 'All (this is the default) - but is it selected?  But it's also worth checking to see if you have inadvertantly set up email as ignored - very easy to do - the 'K' key on keyboard will set an email as ignored. You can check this by&nbsp;: View &gt; Threads &gt; also select 'Ignored threads' - if email displays a red circle icon in the threads column header then it was set up as ignored.  </p><p>Did you check to see if the folder needed to be repaired&nbsp;? </p> <ul><li> Right click on Drafts folder and select 'Properties' </li><li> click on 'Repair folder' button </li><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>This action checks the contents of the mbox file that stores emails, and rebuilds the index file to match it. </p><p>Have you access that mail account email address via any other method which uses Imap connection such as phone, tablet, laptop or work computer or even directly via webmail using a browser? If you did and you deleted, moved, sent etc ect anything then it would update server and thus update the Thunderbird imap account.  </p><p>Find out what is currently displayed in the 'Drafts' mbox file and see if you can recover an email which has been 'marked as deleted' and 'hidden'.  Assuming you are using a Windows OS and assuming you got Thunderbird download /installtion from the official website: </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird if it's running - this is important </li></ul> <ul><li> In windows search type: %Appdata% </li><li> Select the %Appdata% file folder option </li><li> Select the 'Roaming' folder to see contents </li><li> Select the 'Thunderbird' folder to see contents </li><li> Select the 'Profiles' folder to see contents </li><li> Select the 'profile name - various digits' folder to see contents </li></ul> <ul><li> IF POP account - Select the 'Mail' folder to see contents </li><li> IF IMAP account - Select the 'ImapMail' folder to see contents </li></ul> <p>Look for a file called 'Drafts' - no extention  (not Drafts.msf) Open the 'Drafts' file using a simple text editor eg: ' Notepad' </p><p>The oldest emails are at the top.

Have you already read the information that yahoo do make available? <a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/download-email-yahoo-mail-third-party-sln28681.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/download-email-yahoo-mail-third-party-sln28681.html</a> </p><pre>It is lacking in detail sadly and of a generally poor quality.  But then so is just about everything about the service.  Anecdotally it appears that mail from the server name mentioned only downloads and synchronization does not occur. This is reinforced by the last line on the page about two way syncing.   I really do not know though and yahoo appears incapable of issuing anything resembling complete information. </pre> <p>IMAP is as you have demonstrated to yourself is syncronised to the server.  Exactly what the service Yahoo offers does I do not know   but as far as I can see it makes the mail sync server to client but not the other way.  One things to be sure,  unless you manually set the server names for the incoming server your account is currently not configured to use it so I suggest you change the server name and again wait for things to stabilize.  </p><p>Now the next part is to one concerning me.  Are you trying to make something you can access or are you only concerned to make sure you ""have a copy""  The fomats for the export you use will very much depend on your usage going forward. </p><p>However the tools you will use are the same.  This addon <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>The import export tools addon offers many export formats,  but perhaps the best for most archival work is the venerable MBOX format.  That places each email in a folder in a single very large file.  The downside being you have to import the folder to Thunderbird or another mail client that uses MBOX format to read the email. </p><p>You could export to hundreds of thousands of individual eml files.  These can be read by double clicking them in a mail client,  but the trouble is identifying which of the thousands and thousands of email you want to double click on. </p><p>The final option I will mention is to re-import MBOX files immediately to Thunderbird where you can access the folders in the local Folders account the same as you access them in the yahoo account now.  BTW I have no idea how you delete thundreds of thousands of email from yahoo if the sync is one way/ </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I am so unsavvy about programs, emails, internet, etc.  I did reach out to expert help from Yahoo, and they told me to use Thunderbird.  The expert said he didn't know what else to do, and that he could not help with Thunderbird.  I also asked the Tech Geeks at Geek Squad, and they said the same.  They suggested that I go through the thousands of emails and save and/or download any attachments separately.  This would require literally hundreds of hours to accomplish. To answer your next comment about how I want to use the saved emails/attachments is this:  I need to free up my Yahoo account because they are now charging me for it.  I need to access past emails/attachments if I need to look up data for clients or for myself personally.  So yes, I need to be able to access the info on them and thought I could do it by using Thunderbird.   Any thoughts?  Please be very simplistic in your answer and patient with me.  I don't even know what IMAP is, why my yahoo is synchronizing with Thunderbird, etc. Many thanks. </p>",realtormaryanderson,false,1,0

Are the emails appearing in the inbox on the mail server?   </p><p>POP only accesses what the RFC refers to as the mail drop.  In practice most web mail services interpret this to be the inbox as that is where all incoming mail goes. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Then, for the small number of remaining messages, I forwarded each one to myself.  When these new forwarded messages appeared in the Inbox (right alongside the original messages), Thunderbird downloaded them, and deleted them from the Inbox.  My final step was to delete the original messages, leaving my Inbox empty as it normally is (once Thunderbird has downloaded newly arrived messages). </p><p>So, some time wasted, but the problem is resolved and hopefully won't recur, though I may have to periodically look at the mail server to be sure everything's getting downloaded properly. </p><p>Best regards... </p>",amb.biz.1,false,0,0
