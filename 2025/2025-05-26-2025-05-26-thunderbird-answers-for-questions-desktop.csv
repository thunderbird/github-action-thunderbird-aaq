There are too many pitfalls to avoid, a simple period in the wrong place and the file doesn't work. Look at my userContent.css file image and compare with yours. </p><p>If there is no error in your userContent.css file the cause of your font issue is certainly located in your Thunderbird profile but it is difficult to identify this cause. If I go back to your first message it seems that you didn't use Thunderbird on your old Mac, but installed it when you switched to a newer Mac running Sequoia. So your TB profile must be a new  one and not an old profile used with an earlier TB version, transferred from the old Mac. </p><p>The ultimate test would be to create a new Thunderbird profile, set up an account and verify the font size(s). To do this you need to open the TB profile manager: go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Profiles &gt; about:profiles In the About Profiles tab click on ""Create a new profile"" and follow the instructions. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

If you would like to reinstall, then you can get it from: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> </li></ul> <p>BUT please take care when selecting - Channel Release to select: 'Thunderbird Extended Support Release' option as that will get the 128.10.2 esr version. </p><p>IMAP accounts mean all emails are stored on server - the view you can see if you logon to the webmail account via a browser. All folders you create in webmail account or on any computer imap account will be stored on the server. That means all imap accounts on all computers can access the server to see anything on the server. </p><p>IMAP accounts subscribe to see the folders on the server, so if you have a folder called 'Bills', it will be seen if you logon via webmail OR via any of your four computers providing you 'Subscribe' to see it. That means you do not need to create a folder that is already on the server, you just need to subscribe to see it. If you can see a specific folder using eg: Windows 10 or Macbook and it's also visible in webmail, then you can Subscribe to see it in Windows 11 computer.  </p><p>It also means if you delete or move a folder to be a subfolder etc in eg: Macbook computer then it's going to be either deleted or moved on the server.  So when another computer eg: Windows 11 is started up, the IMAP account is not up to date. It's log of folders is now out of date with reality.  It will have info that a folder in a specific position no longer exists in that position meaning you will need to subscribe again to see that folder. </p><p><strong>How to subscribe to see a folder that already exists on server:</strong> </p> <ul><li> In Folder Pane </li><li> Right click on imap account name folder and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> Click on 'Refresh' </li><li> Select the folder you want to see and click on 'subscribe' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:1) Over the past year (maybe more?) folders move in Thunderbird seemingly by themselves.</em> </p><p>Folders are always in a specific order. At the top will be the default server folders. Names may slightly vary eg: 'Sent' or 'Sent Mail' or 'Sent Items' - it just depends upon the server. Inbox, Drafts, Templates, Sent Mail, Archives, Spam, Trash They will be followed by a list of the folders you have created and they will be listed in Alphabetical Order. </p><p>The View you see depends upon what you have selected. By default 'View' &gt; 'Folders' &gt; 'All' is selected. Some people use 'View' &gt; 'Folders' &gt; 'Unified', but in your case that's not useful because you only have the one comcast mail account.  Please confirm you have 'View' &gt; 'Folders'  &gt; 'All' selected on all computers. </p><p>When you say a folder moved - can you offer more info - moved from and to where&nbsp;? It could only get moved either from a top level folder to being a subfolder or vis versa within the same imap account. If you moved it on any other computer or even via webmail then it will show as moved on all computers. So naturally, any filter that needs to move an email to that folder will no longer work. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:(2) Occasionally folders disappear completely, so I have to recreate and repopulate them.</em> If a folder disappears from a Windows 11 computer - does the same folder disappear from all computers at the same time and also - this is important -  disappear off the server as seen if you logon to webmail account via a browser? </p><p>Each computer will store it's own profile and computer puts it in a specific location, but that location varies depending upon OS and where you got the Thunderbird download/installation. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:(4) at least today, it's the Windows 11 laptop with the empty folders, </em> </p><p>Empty folders can be due to several settings. The first most worrying is whether you have an Anti-Virus that is allowed to scan your Profile folders. Windows 11 comes with a default Anti-Virus or maybe you have installed one. Advise you do not allow any Anti-Virus product to scan any profile folder for file because it cannot tell if one mbox file is just one email or thousand - it can end up deleting the contents of an entire mbox file and that means an entire folder in Folder Pane. You need to make your Thunderbird profile exempt from scanning. If you have an folder lean up software  - please make your Thunderbird profile exempt from scanning as you do not want any session data etc being deleted. </p><p>Once that is done we can rule out other programs interfering. </p><p>But to do it - it means you need to know where is the profile located. If you installed Thunderbird from the official Thunderbird download page then this will be the location of your Thunderbird profile folder: </p> <ul><li> C://Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </li></ul> <p>If you installed via a 'Windows App Store' then it will be here: </p> <ul><li> C:\\Users\username\AppData\Local\packages\MozillaThunderbird.MZLA_h5892qc0xkpca\LocalCache\Roaming\<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </li></ul> <p>Please check both locations and tell me what you discover.  Have you got it in both locations or just one and which one?  </p><p><br> If all the other computers and webmail account still have those same folders containing emails, then it might be just a view issue or Folder index needs remapping.

Second, Thunderbird has no spam folder and does not pass judgment on any messages being sent, although it does attempt to help resolve incoming messages that may be spam. Thunderbird is a simple email client that sends messages using the mail server that you provided to it, and using the email address that you provided. If your messages are being rejected as spam, it could be content, or possibly the IP address of your computer, or questionable identity of your email server. My suggestion is to post complete error messages and someone here may be able to offer suggestions to assist. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I am desperate, and I have wasted a lot of time on this without success. Cheers </p><p><br> </p><p><br> Bo A. </p><pre>   Microsoft Agent |    Moderator  </pre> <p>Hi Wavid Dilly, </p><p>Thank you for posting here in Community. </p><p>I totally understand as this sounds incredibly frustrating, especially after all the troubleshooting you've already done. You're dealing with a persistent issue where your Hotmail account stopped downloading new emails in Thunderbird after May 15, 2025, despite updating to the latest compatible version (115.18.0ESR) on macOS 10.13. You've tried multiple fixes, including resetting your account, testing different authentication methods, and even generating an App Password, but nothing seems to work. I can imagine how much time you've spent trying to resolve this, and I want to help you get back on track. </p><p>Here are some troubleshooting steps that might help: </p><p>1. Verify OAuth2 Authentication </p><p>Since you're using OAuth2, ensure that Thunderbird is correctly prompting you for authentication. If you don’t see a Microsoft login popup when setting up your account, try these steps: </p><pre>   Go to Preferences &gt; Privacy &amp; Security in Thunderbird. </pre> <pre>   Ensure Accept cookies from sites is enabled. </pre> <pre>   Remove any saved passwords related to your Hotmail account in Saved Passwords. </pre> <p>2. Manually Reconfigure Your Account </p><p>Try setting up your account again with these settings: </p><pre>   Incoming Server: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> </pre> <pre>       Port: 993 </pre> <pre>       Security: SSL/TLS </pre> <pre>       Authentication: OAuth2 </pre> <pre>   Outgoing Server: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> </pre> <pre>       Port: 587 </pre> <pre>       Security: STARTTLS </pre> <pre>       Authentication: OAuth2 </pre> <p>3. Check Microsoft Account Security Settings </p><p>Since you enabled two-step authentication, ensure that Thunderbird is recognized as a trusted app: </p><pre>   Log into your Microsoft Account. </pre> <pre>   Navigate to Security &gt; Sign-in activity and check if Thunderbird is listed. </pre> <pre>   If not, try adding it manually under App Passwords. </pre> <p>4. Try an Older Authentication Method </p><p>If OAuth2 isn’t working, temporarily switch to Normal Password authentication: </p><pre>   Change authentication type in Thunderbird to Normal Password instead of OAuth2. </pre> <pre>   Use your Microsoft-generated App Password instead of your regular Hotmail password. </pre> <p>5. Check for Server Issues </p><p>Microsoft occasionally updates its email servers, which can cause temporary disruptions. You can check for any reported issues on the Microsoft Community or Outlook Service Status. </p><p>6. Test with Another Email Client </p><p>If possible, try setting up your Hotmail account on another email client (like Apple Mail) to see if the issue persists. If it does, the problem may be with Microsoft's servers rather than Thunderbird. </p><p>7. Consider Upgrading macOS </p><p>Since macOS 10.13 is quite old, some authentication methods may no longer be supported. If upgrading your OS is an option, it might resolve compatibility issues. </p><p>I know this has been a frustrating experience, but I hope one of these steps helps. Let me know how it goes, and I’ll be happy to assist further! </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>Bo | Microsoft Community </p><p>And my reply: Thanks for your reply. I have gone through all your suggestions at least once without success. </p><p>Using Apple Mail is not possible because the operating system is too old and Mail does not support modern security requirements eg OAuth2. Hotmail is working in Mail on my iPhone. </p><p>My iMac will only support up to macOS10.13.06. If I can get Thunderbird working again, it meets my requirements. I enjoy getting the most out of old machines and not wasting valuable resources; therefore, upgrading my OS, with the associated requirement to by a more modern machine, is not compatible with my values. </p><p>I have uninstalled Thunderbird, deleted all library references to it, caches, including any hidden files, etc. </p><p>I installed a new copy of Thunderbird 115.18 esr Released December 11, 2024. </p><p>I ran through your checklist again. I deleted the saved password and cache in settings between attempts to sign-in, and I also shutdown Thunderbird between attempts. When following the recommended procedure, I do get the Microsoft pop-up to authenticate with my Microsoft Authentication app. </p><p>After the 2-step authentication, Thunderbird waits with the message 'Checking Password', and after some time (about 1 min) I still get the error message: </p><p>'Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password.' </p><p>Screenshot attached with the error message. </p><p><br> In alternating attempts, I also inserted my email address in the 'Your login' box that you see is empty in the screenshot. </p><p>Thanks again, and please help. </p>",WavidDilly,false,0,0

Wharever you have set up as your  'Microsoft Account' password must now be set up as your '<a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>' account password. This is important. </p><p>See info&nbsp;: Apparently....this link says:  </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-sign-in-to-hotmail-c378938b-c0eb-40c1-b99e-338dd9e776a8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-sign-in-to-hotmail-c378938b-c0eb-40c1-b99e-338dd9e776a8</a> </li></ul> <p><em>Can't sign in to Hotmail or <a href=""http://Outlook.com?"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com?</a></em> <em>Notes: Your Hotmail or <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> password is the same as your Microsoft Account password.</em> </p><p><br> So you need to logon to the webmail account via a browser and make sure the hotmail account password is the exactly the same as the Microsoft account password. Can you confirm that you have the above set up - all passwords are the same. That is also the same password you used when creating account in Thunderbird. </p><p>Also....any email address in a Microsoft account is now regarded as an 'alias'. I do not know how many email addresses you have in the Microsft account eg: @hotmail.com, @outlook.com etc But whatever email address is set up as 'primary' can only be used for SMTP sending in a third party email client. So please check that the hotmail email account is set up as 'primary'. </p><p>On computer check the following: <strong>Firewall</strong> - this might be the default that came with computer or controlled by an Anti-Virus product you installed. Access Firewall and make sure Thunderbird program is set up as allowed. </p><p><strong>VPN </strong> Some computer OS now offer VPN or Anti-Virus products offer VPN. However, most server do not like VPN because it hides your IP address, so server thinks you  might be a hacker and server blocks acess. SWitch off VPN or create a split tunnelling and set up Thunderbird to use it. </p><p>'<strong>Localhost'</strong> If you use a product that uses the 'localhost' - some people manage websites and might use eg: Apache Xampp Switch off the program until the Oauth2 authentication has been set up. </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li></ul> <p>WEb Content </p> <ul><li> Select 'Accept cookies from sites </li><li> Accept third party cookies 'Always' </li><li> click on 'Exceptions' button next to Accept cookies from sites to make sure you are not blocking cookies from Microsoft sites, such as <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> or <a href=""http://office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">office365.com</a> </li></ul> <p>Scroll down to the Passwords section </p> <ul><li> Click on 'Saved Passwords' </li><li> Click on 'Show Passwords' </li><li> If asked for a 'Windows Security' password - when you start up computer and you get asked for a pasword to logon to your user account - that is the password you need to enter. </li></ul> <ul><li> Look for all lines that relate to the account - eg: imap://account..., mailbox://account... smtp://account, oauth://account.... </li><li> You need to remove all of those lines for the account. </li><li> click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p>Restart Thunderbird to ensure all changes to file info has been updated. </p><p>If you previously created the account then microsoft will prompt you to logon and enter a password and then select to allow Thunderbird access to server. </p><p>If you have not created the account: </p> <ul><li> Menu app icon &gt; New Account &gt; Email </li><li> Enter name </li><li> Enter email address </li><li> Enter password </li><li> Select to 'Remember Passwords' </li><li> Click on 'Continue' </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird should auto detect server settings for IMAP and Oauth2 authentication.

You are restricting the servers that can respond and as no one actually documents the servers at microsoft that might logically be expected to respond to an oauth login attempt, so allow all until it is determined that a limited group will work. </p><p>Are there any OAuth:\\ entries in your password manager after you configure the account for use?  You say you have cleared saved passwords,   but no that passwords are being successfully saved, specifically the oauth token. </p><p>If you have an antivirus product installed beyond the apple basics,  there is a very high probability it is the root cause of any connectivity issues post running the setup wizard.  As you are using <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> as a mail provider, Thunderbird will reach out to <a href=""https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">here </a>to get the settings to be used with the account.  This means that the very first attempt Thunderbird makes to use a mail protocol connection to the mail server comes with the attempt to verify which is your point of failure.  SO frequently is is the antivirus mail scanner that drops the ball,  but we never really get to see that without digging much deeper than the normal user dialogs. </p><p>The first point of failure is mail scanners almost universally use self signed certificates to engineer their man-in-the-middle hack that allows them to intercept encrypted communications. Generally you are asked to manually verify that you personally trust the company that provides the mail scanner.  I don't trust them and don't have mail scanning.  But if you want mail scanning you have to add the antivirus certificate to Thunderbird.  Antivirus vendors routinely provide instruction on how to reduce your security so they can scan. </p><p>Another common cause of oauth failure is other applications listening on the localhost when the oath authentication passes it's token beck to the local machine via localhost.  Things that routinely mess up that process are web server software running locally and development tools/suites that use the localhost.  You assumption that Thunderbird is listening on non standard ports would indicate the issue may well lie on Thunderbird not getting the authorization token because something else is consuming the response on localhost. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

For Outlook .com / Hotmail consumer accounts: Microsoft moved those accounts off the old “<a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>” endpoint and the new tokens are scoped for <a href=""http://outlook.office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office.com</a> (note the missing “365”). </p><p>The Fix: </p><pre>   Account Settings → Server Settings • Server name <a href=""http://outlook.office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office.com</a> (ports and SSL stay the same: 993 / SSL) • Authentication OAuth2 </pre> <pre>   Account Settings → Outgoing Server (SMTP) • Server name <a href=""http://smtp.office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office.com</a> (port 587 / STARTTLS) • Authentication OAuth2 </pre> <p>Save, restart Thunderbird, let the OAuth2 pop-up run once more.  </p><p>Folders instantly fill, Sent copies succeed, and the password loop vanishes. </p><p>Folder housekeeping after it finally connects: </p><pre>   Right-click the account → Subscribe… → Refresh → tick Inbox / Sent Items / Drafts etc. </pre> <pre>   Account Settings → Copies &amp; Folders → map Sent to “Sent Items” (Office365 naming). </pre> <pre>   Re-tick “Place a copy in this folder”. </pre> <pre>   If duplicate .msf indexes (INBOX-1.msf …) still linger, quit TB and delete them—Thunderbird rebuilds clean ones automatically. </pre> <p>Thank goodness.

After the above fix, the emails started to populate again but it did not repopulate the folders and their contents. </p><p>It seems: It looks like—even after manually forcing the real hostnames—Thunderbird 115.18.0 is still trying to contact the old endpoint (<a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>) for IMAP, despite the token being issued with the scope for <a href=""http://outlook.office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office.com</a> In other words, even though you now have the correct settings (and the overridden config values for both IMAP and SMTP), Thunderbird still sends its IMAP commands to the old endpoint, causing Microsoft to reject the connection. </p><p>Based on reports from other users and Thunderbird’s own bug reports, this is a known incompatibility with consumer Outlook/Hotmail accounts on Thunderbird 115. In Thunderbird 126 (beta) and above, Mozilla added changes that recognize the new token scope and correctly use the right endpoint. Unfortunately, macOS 10.13 High Sierra limits you to Thunderbird 115.18.0, so you can’t update to the fixed versions. </p><p>It looks like I will have to wait until Mozilla updates Thunderbird 115.18ESR to fix the problem.
