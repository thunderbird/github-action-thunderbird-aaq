Click the menu button &gt;view&gt;format&gt;classic view&gt;then click the message display list option icon then table view. If the normal way of clicking that function to use that option does not work. Try to startup in thunderbird with that shift key pressed or hold down shift. And by checking the control key toolbars and controls option. Then click confirm changes and restart the software on that pc again. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p>你好 </p><p>您是否點擊了 Thunderbird 中永久使用該功能的按鈕？ 按一下功能表按鈕&gt;檢視&gt;格式&gt;傳統檢視&gt;然後按一下訊息顯示清單選項圖示，然後按一下表格檢視。 如果單擊該功能以使用該選項的正常方式不起作用。 嘗試在按下 shift 鍵或按住 shift 鍵的情況下在 thunderbird 中啟動。 並通過檢查控制鍵工具欄和控件選項。 然後單擊確認更改並再次重新啟動該 PC 上的軟件。 </p><p>Greetings googlethunderbird. </p>,Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

There is for receiving that message a noise to if some incoming messages are there. Or for receiving that sound or notification or stop message pop up for having send that message permanently. </p><p>In Thunderbird you can choose that <em>message delay function</em> that hold's down a message in the message outbox folder. also you can hold a message there manually for a while by yourself and then try to choose for it. So you can create a sort of holding that message aside for a while before you think of sending that message. Just as the delay function it holds that message there in that same mailbox outbox folder before further sending that message. </p><p>email programs can have these good sound functions and other email clients or providers can have  normally other cool functions. </p><p>Greetings googlethunderbird . </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
