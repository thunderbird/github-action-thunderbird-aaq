Please revisit and follow instructions exactly. thunderbird needs to be installed on second PC and should have been downloaded from <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> and installed. After installing, you are to exit it. If you look in the appdata\roaming folder, there should already be a thunderbird folder. Are you possibly pasting to appdata\roaming\thunderbird instead of to appdata\roaming? if you're doing that, you will see ...appdata\roaming\thunderbird\thunderbird which will never be seen by thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It's not infallible - it can make occasional false positives and negatives, but it usually works very well. It's possible, though, that it's training data may become corrupt and it might make more mistakes than usual. To test this, there are two settings you can use: </p><p>Tools | Settings | Privacy &amp; Security | Junk </p><p>Temporarily disable the ""When messages are marked as junk..."" option; </p><p>Tools | Account Settings | Junk Settings </p><p>Temporarily disable the ""Enable adaptive junk mail controls for this account"". </p><p>If that solves the issue and you want to keep using the Adaptive Junk controls, you can reset the training data. It will make mistakes for a while but the more spam it detects, the better at it it gets. </p><p>Tools | Settings | Privacy &amp; Security | Junk | Reset Training Data </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

Is the Read-only attribute box checked? If so, uncheck it and press OK. Now start Thunderbird and test to see if your changes are now saved. </p> <hr> <p>First issue second... Got to Tools | Account Settings | Copies &amp; Folders. Make sure the ""When sending messages, automatically:  [x] place a copy in"" is enabled and points to a valid folder. Also, check that the ""Place replies in the folder of the message being replied to"" option is disabled. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
