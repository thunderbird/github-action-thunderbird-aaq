You might check settings for that situation that you are having now in or on that Bios configuration software that is present on that pc for Linux or look a like software that is running. </p><p>Be sure that the function from both windows and Linux systems on that dual boot system are oké to go.Then it is possible to give it that first try after that update it s a good idea for trying to install that new on the other packages on that other package that already is installed there?And a clean install is not to follow before that wanted installation session. </p><p>It looks like you have to try and be secured and sure of what is coming also with backups on your side and usb devices for back ups.

I am not an expert on how files are managed, but the fact that you are seeing double file structures may be the issue. For example, your first screenshot showed 2021.sbd and also 2021 and 2021.msf. My suggestion is to exit thunderbird and delete the individual files of 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2205, plus their msf entries. That will leave just the sbd folders. restart thunderbird and see if that helps. Also, then check your settings for archive folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thunderbird does not under any circumstance use the word SPAM, let alone insert it into email subjects or bodies.  So the source is external to Thunderbird. </p><p>2. As Wayne suggest SpamAssassin is well known to do exactly that, insert the word spam in the subject of mail. This approach is not limited to that particular tool however.  While is is a popular choice of some email providers, the likes of Outlook, Google, GMX or Yahoo do not use it.  You have not, that I can see, mentioned who provides the email service so I have no idea if that is relevant. </p><p>3. Hosted domains which come with a mail offering, along with corporate email services almost all have some form of server side spam filtering.  This topic at Google discusses determining the source of such a detection by looking in the message source (that is CTRL+U in Thunderbird). <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/thread/14798766/emails-being-sent-to-people-with-spam-headers?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/thread/14798766/emails-being-sent-to-people-with-spam-headers?hl=en</a> </p><p>4.  Some antivirus products think they are the spam police and scan for spam and love sticking big and often incorrect labels on things.  They think it encourages your trust and your commitment to keep paying for their questionable services if they are seen to be doing something.  Do you and your wife share a common antivirus product? </p><p>5. Email headers (ctrl+U) that begin with an X- are non standard headers.  They are also where we get most of the diagnostic information about email being modified by spam filters.  So have a look at the headers for some of your spam messages.  look specifically for things like;   X-Forefront-Antispam-Report: and X-Microsoft-Antispam: they are the filters for office365. <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/message-headers-eop-mdo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/message-headers-eop-mdo</a> </p><p>X-Spam-Level and X-Spam-Status. the SpamAssassin headers <a href=""https://www.mailercheck.com/articles/how-to-read-and-understand-email-headers#bonus-spamassassin-email-headers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mailercheck.com/articles/how-to-read-and-understand-email-headers#bonus-spamassassin-email-headers</a> </p><p>You might even find notes in the headers from your personal antivirus telling you it did the deed.  X-headersis largely a free format thing,  so what is in headers,  while it can look very technical frequently offers a wealth of information to an open mind that is looking for anything that looks ""wrong"" or out of place. </p>  <em><p>bob422 <a href=""#answer-1749102"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>What is ""Collected Addresses""?  I have never touched the settings here. </blockquote> <p>It is a default setting in Thunderbird,  when you send an email to someone you do not have in your address book  that address is added to the collected addresses address book.  <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-14-16-43-10-3aab34.png""> </p><p>By enabling the setting here they are by default now included in the whitelist for Junk filtering when they reply.
