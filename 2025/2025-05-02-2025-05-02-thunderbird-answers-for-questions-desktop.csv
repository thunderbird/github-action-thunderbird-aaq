If no, then server is not receiving them so Thunderbird cannot display them. </p><p>In which case it's possible the sender is sending to wrong email address or the servers spam filters do not like the email and they are blocking it, often the filters will inform the sender about failure to receive the email due to spam. </p><p>Maybe you have reached your server quota and that means until you delete some emails off server, the server cannot receive anything as it's full. </p><p>Do you have a Pop or Imap mail account in Thunderbird&nbsp;? If POP Pop accounts can only access and download from server Inbox, so if server is scanning mail and putting it into the server Spam folder then it cannot be downloaded to a pop account. </p><p>You would only see it via webmail account in the Spam folder.

If yes, then it's not possible to properly delete emails by putting them in the server Trash folder. So, gmail just removes the Inbox label and archives the email in the server  'All Mail' folder. If the quota starts to get used up gmail will be a pain and is well known for not allowing all email to get downloaded in one go for pop accounts. There is only one known fix. Logon to gmail webmail account and access the 'All Mail' folder. Look for all the email that do not have a label and delete them. Gmail expects people who use POP to download mail and delete off server, so gmail can be a pain at times for those using POP. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
