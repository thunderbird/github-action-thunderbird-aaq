It's been a very long time since the old hacking hat hung on my wall.

I would like to take my new Thunderbird email address and make it my only contact account for the website.  </p><p>And if this request is at all possible, would there be a tutorial, online video/pdf, or whathaveyou, that would enable my getting this new Thundermail email going? </p><p>I really hope this can be done simply and readily.
