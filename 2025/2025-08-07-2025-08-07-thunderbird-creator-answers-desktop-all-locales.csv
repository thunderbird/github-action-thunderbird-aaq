I don't want my old accounts connected to Google. Hence why I'm interested in getting VPN, and using Thunderbird. </p><p>I'm fairly tech savvie, but not in a programming way. It's been a very long time since the old hacking hat hung on my wall. So, is there a simple way by which I may establish a new email address through Thunderbird, make it unique to Thunderbirdâ€“in no way associated with any social media, Google, gmail, or any other common sack of crap? </p><p>I have a website hosted by SquareSpace. I would like to take my new Thunderbird email address and make it my only contact account for the website.  </p><p>And if this request is at all possible, would there be a tutorial, online video/pdf, or whathaveyou, that would enable my getting this new Thundermail email going? </p><p>I really hope this can be done simply and readily. I understand that my current email which is connected with my Apple account, the behated gmail address, is where I will be contacted with answers. I can't wait to start moving all my user accounts over to Thunderbird! </p><p>Thanks so much for your help, </p><p>Wren </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",qwg2nf6yvt
