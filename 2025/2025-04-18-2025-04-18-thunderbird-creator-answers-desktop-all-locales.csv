My account is an IMAP account. When I access that IMAP account using the ISP's webmail interface while at work,  it seems that -- often -- the filtering and spam handling on my home machine halts. This might be because I manually delete obvious spam and ""should be filtered"" emails using the the ISP's webmail interface. The Thunderbird app itself (at home) keeps running, though. </p><p>Has anybody else seen something similar?  That is to say: Deleting messages on an IMAP account using the ISP's ""native"" webmail interface results in a separate instance of Thunderbird (running somewhere else, but at the same time for the same account) losing functionality?  (not crashing outright, but filtering and spam handling stops) </p><p>TIA! </p><p>Home tech details: MacOS 15.3.1 (24D70) Thunderbird 128.7.1esr (64-bit) </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1726512;,sinkva
