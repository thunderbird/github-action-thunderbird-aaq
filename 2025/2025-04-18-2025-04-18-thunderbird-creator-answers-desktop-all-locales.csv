My account is an IMAP account. When I access that IMAP account using the ISP's webmail interface while at work,  it seems that -- often -- the filtering and spam handling on my home machine halts. This might be because I manually delete obvious spam and ""should be filtered"" emails using the the ISP's webmail interface. The Thunderbird app itself (at home) keeps running, though. </p><p>Has anybody else seen something similar?  That is to say: Deleting messages on an IMAP account using the ISP's ""native"" webmail interface results in a separate instance of Thunderbird (running somewhere else, but at the same time for the same account) losing functionality?
