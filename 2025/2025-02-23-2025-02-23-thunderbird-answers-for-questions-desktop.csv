Perhaps, but as I state, with my very low message volume, and considering the only messages downloading are those explicitly requested. As example, I'm talking maybe 10 messages daily. Besides, the Tbird configuration offers the ability to specify a unique message data repository, at any location I choose. As long as it's permanently available. My Tbird configuration setup goes back to the VRM 115.?? days of Tbird. Before it was overhauled to facilitate the new security synchronitions. </p> <em><p>Matt <a href=""#answer-1713995"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>I did look up this Yota thing as I have never heard of it.  I have no interest in migrating my Thunderbird data,  so I guess the best thing you can do is actually describe the issue you think you are seeing in terms of life without YOTA,  seriously I can not see an volunteer in this forum installing it in an attempt to understand your comments.</blockquote> <p>Well, as briefly as I can..... The YOTA product has absolutely nothing to do with Tbird. But, YOTA is designed to extract email data from the data repositories of several/many email clients. Back in the Tbird VRM 115.?? days, when Tbird signins were frequently failing, I was forced to move to another email product. This replacement email product had several drawbacks that I couldn't live with. One of the major drawbacks that I needed to rectify was it's inability to relocate any email data outside of the software product's domain. IOW, if I received an email from you, and I wanted to permanently store it somewhere outside the domain of the email product, the ONLY way that could be done was to use Print PDF to reproduce that email document else where in the system. Yes, that would work, but if you've ever use Print PDF on a document, to store it else- where, and the document was complex, you would have seen that much of the document's complexity was excluded via the Print PDF process. Document data like  certain umages, URL's special characters, etc, would just be eliminated in the Print PDF process. I'm pretty sure that I could have licensed the Adobe product, which would have enhanced the Print PDF process, but I chose not to do that. So, that bring me to YOTA. </p><p>Finding this YOTA product, which I licensed, did and excellent job of reproducing this email relocation data, so it looked just like the original email text. No only did this enhance the viewing of the email document, but it facilitated possibly forwarding to document to others in the perfectly original condition. </p><p>So, the YOTA product supported Tbird and the other email client that I'd migrated to. So, when I began to return to Tbird, and began experiencing all these excessive system drive memory enlargements, I began using the YOTA tool as a diagnostic device to inspect the emails embedded in Tbird, to determine why so much memory was consumed, for the few little emails/daily that I was working with. </p><p>Well, through the diagnostic use of YOTA, I discovered that if I received maybe 10 emails daily, and immediately re-positioned those emails to their final location(outside of Tbird), and immediately deleted the original emails from Tbird, YOTA would show me that these deleted emails remained in Tbird. Not only did they remain. but if I'd made any changes to the emails before sending them to their final location, there would now still be the Tbird original 10 emails, plus copies of the 1 - 10 emails that I'd changed before the final relocation. Not only that. but even after I'd deleted every one of the original 10 Tbird emails, all the originals were still shown in the Tbird locations, courtesy of the YOTA queries. </p><p>But, although all the original/modified emails remain in the Tbird composite. the Tbird client shows ALL emails(and there could have been 30-40 now, depending on the modifications I'd made), still remain somewhere accessible by the YOTA product. But, not ""locatable"" via the Tbird client's normal facilities. Now, I accentuated this description somewhat to draw a point. But, I assure you that the example, or something very close would actually occur. I'll give you another example, simpler, but did actually happen. I was composing a somewhat lengthy email, in preparation for sending. Nothing complicated, but it had some detail, so for extra care, I was issuing intermediate ""saves"" to reduce my loss if something were to go wrong in the composure. Well, I finally completely the email, issues the send, and was happy for the completion. Then, I thought - ""I'll just go take a look at the Tbird send queue, to see how the sent email appeared"". Well, I was shocked.... When I pulled to the ""sent"" queue via YOTA, there must have been a hundred versions of this single email. After further inspection, I realized that a new full copy had been preserved for every time that I ussued the ""save"" command to safely preserve my progress. And, all these copies cannot be deleted via the Tbird client interface, because they're invisible to that client. </p><p>Backing up to the remotely defined areas, specified in the Tbird definition, used to contain all the email data outside the executable domain. That would be the external ""permanently""  available via USB. Remember that? That USB drive is external to handle ALL the email data to/from the Tbird client, to the Tbird server(s). Well, because the YOTA product would record such volumes of internal email data, that remember, was invisible to the Tbird client. And because I never leave any email data inside the client's repository anyway, I'd just decide to empty ALL of that Tbird USB repository data, and reinitialize Tbird. So, proceeding to each email data repository, I would simply CLEAR ALL data present, before proceeding to the next. Eventually, I'd have all the email data repositories emptied, and I'd restart Tbird. Everything initialized just fine, and all the USB repos- itories are now empty. AND, when I query the Tbird repositories, using YOTA, all email data is gone, and all repositories are clean. </p><p>That is really the reason I directed the email data to that USB repository initially. So, I could access those days areas to eliminate any/all data. But, that still doesn't have any affect on the Tbird client clinbing the ladder on system drive usage. </p> <em><p>Matt <a href=""#answer-1713995"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>BTW If you could explain what this means would be appreciative.

But, reviewing the previous text, I suspect that you're asking exactly the meaning of my earlier statement ""Why are you pressing get messages?"" </p><p>I assume that this is the statement you want explained. I'm not sure what explanation is available. But, since my Tbird client is configured dormant, if you want to receive email, this is what is required. First, using the mouse cursor, you highlight the single email account of interest. Then, using the left mouse key, you highlight that email account name. When you highlight this email account name. a drop down menu will appear. Within that menu will appear ""Get Messages"". You then right click the ""get messages"" selection, all email data ready for transport will arrive at the Tbird Client. You can also highlight ALL Tbird account names, and the get messages select will transport all Tbird server email data to Tbird client. But, I don't have any real need for that. It's a perfectly optionally method for one of the many techniques to receive email data. </p><p>I've reached my 10,000 character limit, with 10,090 characters. </p><p>Thanks, for your  interest. </p><p>[Wayne has reformatted this reply block for readability] </p>",twf6714,false,0,0

This happens every time I use Thunderbird.  Today I started reading through my emails and got about three done.

It highlighted the next email and hung as seen here.   </p><p>I also have Thunderbird set up to sync with Gmail.  All the folders were previously down in my Local Folders, but I moved them all back to Gmail when I started having problems with Thunderbird.  I was afraid I would lose all my saved emails if Thunderbird was broken. </p><p>Thunderbird seems to hang sometimes when I move an email to a different folder (including trash).

After all, you have an imap account and it can only display whatever is on server and if Anti-Virus decided it did not like something and tried to 'fix' the mbox file, you stand a good chance of losing all emails in that folder and what's worse, losing emails off the server when it synchronised with server. Then you will be reliant on any backup which would need importing into 'Local Folders' account before trying to slowly get it all back onto the server.  </p><p>Then see if this improves performance. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Maybe it would help if you put what you want in one profile on one line and what you want in the other profile on a separate line. Use of unified folders is a user option and not required. Local folders can be easily copied from one profile to another, once you figure what you want. Tell us with more detail of the examples. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In order to combine multiple profiles into one, you'll have to set up the accounts in the profile you want to use. For IMAP accounts you won't have to do anything else, since mail is stored on the server and will appear in the new profile as result of setting up the account there. For POP accounts or mail moved to Local Folders, you may transfer mail stored in one profile to another by merely moving around the mbox files (text files in mbox format without filename extension) that Thunderbird uses to store mail locally on your computer. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
