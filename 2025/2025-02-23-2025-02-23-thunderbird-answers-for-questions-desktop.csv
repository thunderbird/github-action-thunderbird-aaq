Norton make a very good product for doing exactly as you describe when it gets a malformed email in a pop connection.  Is your account set up as pop? </p><p>Why are you pressing get messages?  That can in itself be a cause of issues as Thunderbird fetches messages on startup and on a timed basis. </p><p>This will be exacerbated by having Thunderbird profile somewhere other than an internal drive. External says to me network or USB.  Neither of which are as fast as an internal drive bus with the inherent issues of data simply being lost.  If you are locating the account data on another place to the profile using the account directory  best of luck is all I can say.  I want nothing to do with it.  Trouble is all that comes from those setups has been my observation over 15 years of doing this support gig. </p><p>I did look up this Yota thing as I have never heard of it.  I have no interest in migrating my Thunderbird data,  so I guess the best thing you can do is actually describe the issue you think you are seeing in terms of life without YOTA,  seriously I can not see an volunteer in this forum installing it in an attempt to understand your comments. </p><p>BTW If you could explain what this means would be appreciative.
