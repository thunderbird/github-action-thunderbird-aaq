Single folder in UI. Multiple feeds (3) show up in the queue </li><li> Folder B structure starts to become much more incoherent </li></ul> <pre>   - Feed's are actually folders now. Sometimes.        + Feed1 &amp; Feed3 = folders. But UI 'folder' displays just the one feed, as if it was a feed.        + Feed2 = folder, with the 'actual' feed within it. But then it displays in the exact same way as Feeds 1 and 3    - seem to have contradictions running in both directions.        + If they are feeds, is confusing they display with folder icon        + Not clear why a feed-as-a-folder would display exactly the same as a feed-within-a-folder </pre> <ul><li> ""feed7"" situation I can't understand to be anything other than a bug. </li></ul> <pre>   - Subscribed to the feed within folder C. It instead shows up in the UI in Folder B.         + Which bafflingly *only* includes feed7, and does not roll up or aggregate any of the feed/folders (whatever they are) within it. </pre> <p>Like the integration of having RSS within Thunderbird, but need some clarification.
