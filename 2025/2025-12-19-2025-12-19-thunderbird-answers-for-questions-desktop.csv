I have checked with the SyOps of my server and they have assured me that there is no special settings or hierarchy of the folder structure, which is corroborated by image #2 (_WEBMAIL.png).  How can I correct this because, because as it stands, it just doesn't make sense; how can you have your <strong>Sent</strong> messages in your <strong>INBOX</strong>? ?</blockquote> <p>Yet you say you have spoken with the server admin.  Were they so inexperienced with email that they were unaware that they have configured their mail server to place all folders as sub folders of the inbox.  Usually by specifying the inbox as the server directory for mail.   Open the account settings in Thunderbird then the advanced setting in the server settings pane.  Enter the correct IMAP server directory for the mail server.  It will be some variation of inbox,  but as case is relevant it would really be easier of the mail admin just told you what it was.  But from the images you posted I would guess is is INBOX (all upper case) like as if it was setup and managed by someone that was only familiar with Windows. </p><p><br> Google AI suggest this much more nicely written explanation </p> <blockquote> ""server directory set to INBOX"" is generally a configuration setting for an IMAP email client that tells the client where the main mailbox folders are located on the server. This is a common solution when all your other email folders (like ""Sent"", ""Drafts"", etc.) appear as subfolders nested inside your Inbox, rather than at the top level of your folder list.  How to Apply This Setting in Popular Email Clients The specific steps to apply this setting depend on your email client:      Mozilla Thunderbird / Postbox:         Go to Account Settings (under the Tools or Edit menu, depending on your OS).         Select Server Settings for the specific email account.         Click the Advanced button.         In the field labeled IMAP server directory (or IMAP Path Prefix), type INBOX. (all caps, followed by a period).         Click OK and restart the email client for the change to take effect. </blockquote>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I am not aware of a single paying proton customer that actually offers their time here to support that particular commercial product. </p><p>Thunderbird interacts with Proton through a custom IMAP mail server application that proton provide their paying customers using the name Bridge.

I also presume (without confirmation from Proton) that it's also a localised indexing service to support (for example) full-text search of message content - something that, by default, Proton's infrastructure does not support over the internet. </p><p>Regarding the mail folders, and to quote (whilst also anonymising) the feedback (so far) from a Proton customer support specialist with whom a ticket was raised yesterday: ""If you are using Split mode, all the folders will show under all email addresses.  As the folders are created <em>on the account level</em>, they will be visible under each address."" </p><p>My first line of support enquiry has always been - and will have to remain as - Proton.  Nevertheless, with Proton promoting Thunderbird as a viable client app, it seemed a reasonable opportunity to tap into any potential expertise on here that may ... possibly ... have had similar experiences with Thunderbird and the Proton Mail Bridge. </p><p>Thanks again for your time on this matter. </p>",TechD,false,0,0
