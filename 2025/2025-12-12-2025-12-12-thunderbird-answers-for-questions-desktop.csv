My suggestion is to try the signature on both platforms to see how they look. Then, there may be a need to adjust to fit.

Vpn services could be wrong and detect you as wrong. Sending that file as a draft could create errors. Did this error appeared more frequently lately. Some users did report that these symptoms did vanished after multiple days of waiting. </p><p>To solve or resolve this issue is to check the data that had to be send and remove spammy language s and not valid or suspicious links to. Or use that text that i written above in the first reply. Can you understand this? </p>,Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
