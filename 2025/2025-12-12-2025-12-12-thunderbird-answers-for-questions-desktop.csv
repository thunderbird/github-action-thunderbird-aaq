In passato Gmail poteva essere configurata come una normale caselle di posta elettronica. Ora Google ha imposto che il login debba passare dal loro sito web (come si vede nel tuo screenshot) per cui possono applicare questo genere di blocco. </p>,@next,false,0,0

So it's really a local issue. I went into the mail folder on my hard drive (Users/Username/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/xyz.default-release/Mail) and the missing folder was there alright, but I didn't have permissions (""no entry"" sign). Very peculiar. I checked the permissions and it said I had read/write (even stranger), so I changed it to read only then back to read/write and it still showed the no entry symbol. So I gave read/write permissions to everyone and that solved the permissions problem. I checked the folder again, and the email file had disappeared. The msf file was there, but not the email. </p><p>I have no idea how that happened but I got a backup from Time Machine and put it back. All well now. But a mystery nonetheless. </p>",mwanamizi,false,0,0
