I went to ChatGPT and it walked me through every step and it worked, not only with the one-click problem but with a half dozen other issues. I have a new HP All-in-one computer to get Windows 11. I still can't send email from Thunderbird on my computer. My cell can receive and send. My computer can only receive. I am in touch with Cybermesa but they are in the middle of a new email restructure and even their mailbox is full. Usually one gets an actual tech support person with no delay or a quick call-back. When I try to send email I am asked to enter my password and then I receive another pop-up that says it has timed out, which it hasn't. I tried turning off and restarting computer. I think you are going to advise me to just be patient with the Cybermesa tech team, but I thought you might have a quick fix. Many thanks!!! </p>",lynnell,false,0,0

I guess HP get it for free cause it is not a good product unless the only thing you use your computer for is web browsing.   </p><p>there are procedures available from McAfee to reduce your connection security to work with their product,  there are also options to simply prevent the McAfee product scanning secure connections.

It offers things like test or sometime get certificate if the solution is to allow a non standard certificate generated and produced by your antivirus product.

E' inoltre assolutamente impossibile cambiare nome a queste nuove cartelle perché anche a me sono scomparse dal menu a tendina delle stesse le voci elimina e rinomina.   Inoltre aprendo le Proprietà delle nuove cartelle trovo il nuovo nome (anche qui non modificabile) ma il percorso indica ancora il vecchio nome della cartella (ad esempio: mailbox://nobody@Local Folders/Posta Piero in corso).

You only see emails in other folders because gmail understands it's not an ideal way to see emails. So they created 'labels' as a means of putting a type of tag on an email, so it has a virtual view in any 'label'. Thunderbird has no knowledge of 'labels', it uses folders, so it just downloads to the imap folder eg: Inbox. </p><p>So in Thunderbird, the 'All Mail' folder contains a complete duplicate of everything, incoming, outgoing, archived etc. If you accidentally delete anything from the 'All Mail' folder any copies of the deleted message will be deleted from whatever other folder also has those emails. The 'All Mail' is used by gmail when you choose to 'archive' emails - gmail basically just remove all labels. </p><p>In other words it's dangerous to assume the 'All Mail' is also only the 'Archived' mail. </p><p>Personally, I would not subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder because if it gets corrupted for any reason eg: by an Anti-Virus product trying to 'fix' something, you have a high risk of losing everything. </p><p>This is link to the 'bug reports that are currently being looked at by the developers. </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1998456"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1998456</a> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2001557"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2001557</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Inbox, Drafts, Templates, Sent, Archives, Spam, Deleted. </p><p>In reality this has many problems and can cause a lot of confusion and in the case of 'All Mail' entirely misleading.  I'm one of those who check archived emails every six months or so and choose the get rid of old stuff. If it's important then I would not have archived it.  If people really thought it was just Archives and they decided to clear a load of emails then they could be in for a shock. </p> <blockquote> I now have unchecked ""Keep message archives in:"" I cannot find a way to delete the second (empty) Archives folder on Thunderbird.  Brad </blockquote> <p><br> If this 'Archives' folder is not a server default folder - you created it - then you could try to 'unsubscibe' from seeing it and then logon to the server webmail account via a browser and delete it. </p><p>OR if it's one you created, you could use it instead of the 'All Mail'  ""Keep message archives in:"" and choose  'Other' and 'Archives' folder on account' Then at least you can archive emails in a separate folder. Much easier to see what you choose to be archived. </p><p>You cannot delete any folder that has a flag set - Inbox, Drafts, Templates, Sent, Archives, Spam, Deleted.

I went into the mail folder on my hard drive (Users/Username/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/xyz.default-release/Mail) and the missing folder was there alright, but I didn't have permissions (""no entry"" sign). Very peculiar. I checked the permissions and it said I had read/write (even stranger), so I changed it to read only then back to read/write and it still showed the no entry symbol. So I gave read/write permissions to everyone and that solved the permissions problem. I checked the folder again, and the email file had disappeared.
