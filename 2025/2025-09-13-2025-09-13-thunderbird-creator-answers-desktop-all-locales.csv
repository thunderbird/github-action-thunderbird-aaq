My health is poor so, I only check to see what's new every couple of hours or so. </p><p>When I start to read new emails, I double click on 1st unread to open in its own window, most emails are then deleted, and this is where I have trouble, the next email shows as a blank window, with TB showing the Loading bar in the LR corner. At this point, closing  the email's window &amp; reopening on it, makes no difference, TB just hangs on ""opening email"". </p><p>The only way to fix this is by restarting TB, and even then, it may require 2-3 more restarts to be able to read the rest of the downloaded messages. Then, if I don't try to read any emails within the (approx) 60 minute time frame, the issue reoccurs. </p><p>Thunderbird version: 140.2.0esr (64-bit)  System Details Report --- </p> <ol><li><ol><li> Report details </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>- **Date generated:**                              2025-09-13 18:01:31 </p> <ol><li><ol><li> Hardware Information: </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>- **Hardware Model:**                              ASUS ROG CROSSHAIR VII HERO _WI-FI_ - **Memory:**                                      32.0 GiB - **Processor:**                                   AMD Ryzen™ 7 2700 × 16 - **Graphics:**                                    Radeon™ RX 580 Series - **Disk Capacity:**                               5.5 TB </p> <ol><li><ol><li> Software Information: </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>- **Firmware Version:**                            4603 - **OS Name:**                                     Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS - **OS Build:**                                    (null) - **OS Type:**                                     64-bit - **GNOME Version:**                               46 - **Windowing System:**                            Wayland - **Kernel Version:**                              Linux 6.8.0-79-generic </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",netsurf
