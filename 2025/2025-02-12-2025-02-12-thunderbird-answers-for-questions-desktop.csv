Usually, most servers do not use the word 'Junk', they usually use a folder called 'Spam'. It's important to know what is the correct name for the server default spam/junk folder. </p><p><strong>How to tell what folder is the server default spam/junk folder:</strong> Logon to your webmail account via a browser, it will list the default folders and any other folders you have created. If you select an email and say it is junk where does the server put it&nbsp;? If it puts it into a folder called 'Spam' then that is the name of the folder you must use in the imap account in Thunderbird. So lets assume it is called 'Spam'  Please provide an image of the webmail list of folders so we can check and understand what your server uses. </p><p>In Thunderbird In the Folder PAne you should see the name of imap account and it should also have a 'Spam' folder. </p><p>It would also be very helpful if you posted an image showing what you see in the Folder PAne. You should be seeing exactly the same as the webmail account. </p><p>Assuming it is Spam in webmail and Spam shown in imap..... You need to make sure that mail account junk settings are set up correctly. </p> <ul><li> Account Settings  </li><li> Select 'Junk Settings' for the imap account. </li><li> Select checkbox 'Enable adaptive junk mail controls for this account' </li><li> Select all the address books you want to act as a whitelist now or in the future. </li></ul> <ul><li> Advise you do not select 'Trust junk mail headers set by' unless you really want that option. </li></ul> <p>Destination and Retention </p> <ul><li> Select 'Move new junk messages to' </li><li> Select 'Other' and choose 'Spam on mail account address' </li><li> Advise you do not select&nbsp;: 'Auto delete junk...' </li></ul> <p>Then Exit Thunderbird and wait a short while for background processes to write to files. Start Thunderbird. </p> <ul><li> How to tell what put emails in Junk/Spam: </li></ul> <p>In 'Spam/Junk' folder - Make sure the 'Spam' column header is enabled - it will use a flame shaped icon. If the flame icon is grey then the server put the email in the Spam folder If the flame is red/orange then Thunderbird put the email in the Spam folder - please note if Account Settings instructions are to trust junk mail headers then thunderbird will move the email to Spam/Junk - hence why I advised you do not set that option at this point. </p><p>Is the flame icon grey or coloured&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The status is Running until I click on Thunderbird, then the status changes to Stopped. Just to clarify. Launching Thunderbird is definitely causing the OS to shut down the spooler. I have no idea why that would happen. I've reinstalled the printer driver a few times now and with no effect.
