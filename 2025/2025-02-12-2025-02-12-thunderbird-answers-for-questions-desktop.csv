So lets assume it is called 'Spam'  Please provide an image of the webmail list of folders so we can check and understand what your server uses. </p><p>In Thunderbird In the Folder PAne you should see the name of imap account and it should also have a 'Spam' folder. </p><p>It would also be very helpful if you posted an image showing what you see in the Folder PAne. You should be seeing exactly the same as the webmail account. </p><p>Assuming it is Spam in webmail and Spam shown in imap..... You need to make sure that mail account junk settings are set up correctly. </p> <ul><li> Account Settings  </li><li> Select 'Junk Settings' for the imap account. </li><li> Select checkbox 'Enable adaptive junk mail controls for this account' </li><li> Select all the address books you want to act as a whitelist now or in the future. </li></ul> <ul><li> Advise you do not select 'Trust junk mail headers set by' unless you really want that option. </li></ul> <p>Destination and Retention </p> <ul><li> Select 'Move new junk messages to' </li><li> Select 'Other' and choose 'Spam on mail account address' </li><li> Advise you do not select&nbsp;: 'Auto delete junk...' </li></ul> <p>Then Exit Thunderbird and wait a short while for background processes to write to files. Start Thunderbird. </p> <ul><li> How to tell what put emails in Junk/Spam: </li></ul> <p>In 'Spam/Junk' folder - Make sure the 'Spam' column header is enabled - it will use a flame shaped icon. If the flame icon is grey then the server put the email in the Spam folder If the flame is red/orange then Thunderbird put the email in the Spam folder - please note if Account Settings instructions are to trust junk mail headers then thunderbird will move the email to Spam/Junk - hence why I advised you do not set that option at this point. </p><p>Is the flame icon grey or coloured&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The status is Running until I click on Thunderbird, then the status changes to Stopped. Just to clarify. Launching Thunderbird is definitely causing the OS to shut down the spooler. I have no idea why that would happen. I've reinstalled the printer driver a few times now and with no effect. I am running the latest version of Thunderbird 128.7.0esr (64-bit) on Win 11 up-to-date as of this posting. </p>",mvmone,false,0,0

Please confirm the known password at least works for access to webmail. </p><p><br> If you have recently enabled a VPN then most servers will reject attempts to access accounts as they think you are a hacker.
