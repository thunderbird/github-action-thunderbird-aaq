I'm one of them because I  use some speech input, and a stray word from you or an office mate when the focus is in the wrong place can cause a lot of havoc that's difficult to undo. You can also get in trouble when typing – hitting a stray ""a"" can archive something without you realizing it, and this has happened to me as well. A cat going across the keyboard can also cause an awful lot of havoc that's difficult to track down and reverse.  If we could simply turn off single key shortcuts, that would go a long way toward solving this problem. Even better if we could remap them. There is an extension that does this but it's aimed at developers and also requires full control of your computer, which removes is as an option for more people.  I think you'd make many people happy building in something simpler --  alternate keybindings for single key shortcuts, a setting to turn the single key shortcuts off, or, best yet, the ability to remap them.

It appears that they did something on their end last evening (10/28/25) that made third party software not work.  I have been on the phone with their tech support for over 4 hours and they can not explain, nor fix the fact that I can't get email with Thunderbird and also on my phone with Edison.  If I export all of the current information in my current account (tied to POP), using the export feature and put it on my hard drive and call them back, can I then import it to (IMAP)?  Their potential suggestion although the account was set in POP format last October when I purchased this new computer. </p><p>Please I am at my wits end as I have lost a days work dealing with this. </p><p>Thanks,  John </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",j_mara

When I was able to associate both Thunderbird installations to the same profile it was seamless. </p><p>My need is to continue having Thunderbird on both partitions but to be able to keep synchronization. I can create two identical profiles set up in IMAP but I assume this will allow for messages already downloaded by the first instance and then subsequently downloaded by the second be flagged as unread. This seems trivial but a moderate inconvenience still. Add to that, I have quite a few accounts in this profile and would find it daunting to have to input completely again all this info. Hoping for a simpler solution. </p><p>I also just did the usual copy/paste of the currently used shared profile to the default profile folder for the instance of Thunderbird that alerted me of its inability to use a shared profile but am finding this is not enough to produce an operable profile. Seems it has been flagged as unique to the other partition's Thunderbird (which is on the currently inactive partition).  </p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",trashacct_14
