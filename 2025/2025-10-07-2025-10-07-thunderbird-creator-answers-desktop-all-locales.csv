So this problem started today, and I can't find a solution or reason it is happening.  The only variable is that I grabbed my address books from my old pc and transferred them over to my new pc. I didn't change any settings, just put my address books on a thumbdrive and brought them over. I've been using my new pc for about a week now, and no issues until today. </p><p>Normally when I double click on an email, and it opens in a new window or tab, the status of the email in the email list automatically becomes ""read"", ie the little green dot becomes a little grey dot.  For reasons beyond me, it has stopped working. The email stays in ""not read"" status, the green dot remains. It's driving me crazy, as only pc problems can.  Anyone else having this issue?  Oh, and yes I shut down and cold booted the pc and nothing changed. Thanks in advance!! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",kilena

What an absolute Mess!!!,<p>Thunderbird 143.0.1 </p><p>My TBird updated this morning and everything turned to crap... </p><p>I have TBird set to check for emails every 15 minutes on 4 accounts. There are also 3 accounts that I monitor and check manually... </p><p>As soon as the 143.0.1 update touched home base TBird went ballistic. Withing in seconds of it checking for mail on the four accounts it then started deleting the accounts. Any mail was down loaded then poof!! No mail and No mail account. I had to crash dive my laptop to to stop it. Spent 3 hours trying to recover the emails and accounts and managed to reclaim 3 accounts out of the 4 but lost all the emails... After all that effort I was totally peeved and decided to uninstall TBird and revert to an older version... The icing on the cake TBird wont unistall because the YES button on the TBird Helper window wont activate... </p><p>After more than thirty years of supporting Firefox and Thunderbird... You have really dropped the ball with this one... As far as me getting an email when someone answers the thread... Good Luck... </p>,thunderbird;install;,thunderbird,install,en-US,1770200;,craign1

Instead, they move to a newly created folder in the Local Folders. Furthermore, the special folder settings in the account configuration automatically change to point to the Local Folders instead of the connected IMAPs folder. </p><p>Testing with Thunderbird 128.14.0esr did not reproduce this issue. </p><p>I suspect this issue might stem from a mapping problem with Japanese folder names in the Japanese localization. (e.g., “下書き” as “Drafts”, ‘送信済みトレイ’ as “Sent”, etc...)
