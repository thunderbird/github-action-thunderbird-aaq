So this problem started today, and I can't find a solution or reason it is happening.  The only variable is that I grabbed my address books from my old pc and transferred them over to my new pc. I didn't change any settings, just put my address books on a thumbdrive and brought them over. I've been using my new pc for about a week now, and no issues until today. </p><p>Normally when I double click on an email, and it opens in a new window or tab, the status of the email in the email list automatically becomes ""read"", ie the little green dot becomes a little grey dot.  For reasons beyond me, it has stopped working. The email stays in ""not read"" status, the green dot remains. It's driving me crazy, as only pc problems can.  Anyone else having this issue?  Oh, and yes I shut down and cold booted the pc and nothing changed. Thanks in advance!! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",kilena

I double checked my settings and they are correct, so this should not be happening.  How do I prevent it? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",nancy.brightwings
