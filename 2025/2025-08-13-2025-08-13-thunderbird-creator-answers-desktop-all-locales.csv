When I try to point to the folder where they were stored in the old installation, it says the folder is 'not suitable for message storage'. The result is that I can't access any of my old emails (pop account). They exist, but are inaccessable. These are important business emails and it will seriously impact me if I can get them back. I'd appreciate your ideas on how to bring the old emails on the previous folder into the new installation. Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",bill123
