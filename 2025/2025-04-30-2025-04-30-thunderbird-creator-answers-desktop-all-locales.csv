This makes sense. </p><p>In the same article, it's recommended to unsubscribe from the ""All Mail"" folder for Gmail accounts.  This also makes sense.  However, after doing so, performing the Archive action on an email in Thunderbird causes it to resubscribe to All Mail. </p><p>More generally, unsubscribing from the target of ""Other"" in the ""message archives"" setting for the account will cause the setting to be unspecified (i.e. point to ""Choose Folder""), after which the Archive action seems to use the last-specified target, re-subscribing to it if currently unsubscribed. </p><p>1. Is this the desired/expected behavior of the message archives settings? 2. For users who do wish to retain the habit of ""Gmail archiving"" (to keep the Inbox clean without managing specific labels/folders to move each message to), does the ""unsubscribe from 'All Mail'"" recommendation imply a recommendation to specify a new Thunderbird folder (= Gmail label) for this, e.g. the usual ' ""Archives"" Folder in:' option? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",goatfox

I am currently on release 137.0.2 (64-bit) running on a Linux Desktop.  This computer gets shut down every night, and rebooted the following morning.  When a calendar reminder has been snoozed, and the snooze time expires when the computer is not running, and Thunderbird is not running, those calendar reminders used to show up the next time Thunderbird was started after the computer was rebooted, even if the calendar event time had already passed.  In the last week or so, following recent updates, I believe this is no longer happening. </p><p>Also, I believe that calendar events that have reminders set, that have not been snoozed, whose reminder time happens when the computer is shut down, are also not being shown reminders the next time the computer is started, if the reminder time happened when Thunderbird was not running.  This is also a change from the way it used to work.  For example, if an event is marked as starting at 10:00 AM, with a reminder set for 2 hours before (which would be 8 AM), and the computer is booted and Thunderbird is started at 8:30 AM, that reminder no longer happens.  That is a change from the way it used to work.  A few weeks ago, in that scenario, the reminder would have been shown the next time Thunderbird started up. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1729241;,james.newby.pc.77

He can't send or receive messages and is asked for a password which is always rejected. The provider, Plusnet, have checked out their end and say all is well and hacking is unlikely. Webmail works, we have changed the password, but still no access to Thunderbird. The same problem exists on his other devices that use the same email address but do not use the same platform. Any ideas would be really welcome. Thank you, Barbara </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1729325;,barbara1

I have a standard notification of 30 minutes before something happens and in Google I can add additional notifications like a day before or a week before. I don't see that I can do that when I create the event in Thunderbird.

Have exported several large .pst folders + sub-folders using third-party software into several corresponding .sbd folders.  Success in TB to point individually to each one of the .sbd folders with the Local Directory address, each shows the sub-folders and mail as expected in the Local Folders menu of TB.  However, the Local Directory address (Account Settings) seems to allow pointing only to a single folder with properly configured .sbd designation.  If I point to the root folder containing several individual and properly configured .sbd folders, none are recognized.  There is an Add-on called LocalFolders that would seem to solve this problem by allowing as many local folder locations as needed, but it's not compatible with current versions of TB.  I wonder if TB will embed a function allowing for more than one local folder address, or having it be smarter in recognizing compatible folders within a single directory location rather than directly pointing at an .sbd folder.  Adding new folders to Local Folders is not what is needed in this instance. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",rstern1
