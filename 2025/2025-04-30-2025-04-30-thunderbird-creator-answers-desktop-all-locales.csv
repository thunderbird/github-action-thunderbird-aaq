This makes sense. </p><p>In the same article, it's recommended to unsubscribe from the ""All Mail"" folder for Gmail accounts.  This also makes sense.  However, after doing so, performing the Archive action on an email in Thunderbird causes it to resubscribe to All Mail. </p><p>More generally, unsubscribing from the target of ""Other"" in the ""message archives"" setting for the account will cause the setting to be unspecified (i.e. point to ""Choose Folder""), after which the Archive action seems to use the last-specified target, re-subscribing to it if currently unsubscribed. </p><p>1. Is this the desired/expected behavior of the message archives settings? 2. For users who do wish to retain the habit of ""Gmail archiving"" (to keep the Inbox clean without managing specific labels/folders to move each message to), does the ""unsubscribe from 'All Mail'"" recommendation imply a recommendation to specify a new Thunderbird folder (= Gmail label) for this, e.g. the usual ' ""Archives"" Folder in:' option? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",goatfox

I am currently on release 137.0.2 (64-bit) running on a Linux Desktop.  This computer gets shut down every night, and rebooted the following morning.  When a calendar reminder has been snoozed, and the snooze time expires when the computer is not running, and Thunderbird is not running, those calendar reminders used to show up the next time Thunderbird was started after the computer was rebooted, even if the calendar event time had already passed.  In the last week or so, following recent updates, I believe this is no longer happening. </p><p>Also, I believe that calendar events that have reminders set, that have not been snoozed, whose reminder time happens when the computer is shut down, are also not being shown reminders the next time the computer is started, if the reminder time happened when Thunderbird was not running.  This is also a change from the way it used to work.  For example, if an event is marked as starting at 10:00 AM, with a reminder set for 2 hours before (which would be 8 AM), and the computer is booted and Thunderbird is started at 8:30 AM, that reminder no longer happens.  That is a change from the way it used to work.  A few weeks ago, in that scenario, the reminder would have been shown the next time Thunderbird started up. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1729241;,james.newby.pc.77
