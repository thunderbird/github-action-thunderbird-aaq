This makes sense. </p><p>In the same article, it's recommended to unsubscribe from the ""All Mail"" folder for Gmail accounts.  This also makes sense.  However, after doing so, performing the Archive action on an email in Thunderbird causes it to resubscribe to All Mail. </p><p>More generally, unsubscribing from the target of ""Other"" in the ""message archives"" setting for the account will cause the setting to be unspecified (i.e. point to ""Choose Folder""), after which the Archive action seems to use the last-specified target, re-subscribing to it if currently unsubscribed. </p><p>1. Is this the desired/expected behavior of the message archives settings? 2. For users who do wish to retain the habit of ""Gmail archiving"" (to keep the Inbox clean without managing specific labels/folders to move each message to), does the ""unsubscribe from 'All Mail'"" recommendation imply a recommendation to specify a new Thunderbird folder (= Gmail label) for this, e.g. the usual ' ""Archives"" Folder in:' option? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",goatfox
