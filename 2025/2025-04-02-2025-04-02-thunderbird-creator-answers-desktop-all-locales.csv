Hopelijk kan iemand mij een oplossing bieden om dit probleem op te lossen. Alvast bedankt </pre> <p>Reactie van ontwikkelaar: Het spijt ons dat je dit probleem hebt!

(Vertaald met DeepL) </p><p>Als extra toevoeging aan mijn vraag. Heb Thunderbird voor desktop PC en Laptop Windows 10/11 eveneens geïnstalleerd, bij deze versie kun je de gekoppelde contacten zien en de eigenschappen raadplegen, zie afbeelding CardDAV URL. Indien ik dergelijke instellingen op de android tablet van mijn vrouw zou kunnen openen of raadplegen, met de werkwijze hoe ik de CardDAV URL link kan aanpassen naar de google contacten van mijn vrouw is mogelijks het probleem opgelost. Echter, in tegenstelling tot de desktopversie Windows, heb je bij de Android-versie niet de mogelijkheid om aan de linkerkant van het scherm te kiezen tussen e-mail, contacten, agenda, taken, chat, afbeelding. </p><p>Alvast bij voorbaat bedankt voor jullie hulp en ondersteuning.
