You can sort these emails from the sender to select all relevant emails and then delete them.you can use the quickfilter <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/quick-filter-toolbar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/quick-filter-toolbar</a> to use it but I do not recommend it is from 2023 and the normal way should fix also. </p><p>If the emails are spread across the email lists you can use global search by typing the senders their name to find them and then to locate them and try to delete these emails. </p><p>To erase more emails is to select one email and hold down that shift key and go down to the list of all these emails that are going to be deleted soon and click on the last one.. All emails are selected now , press that delete button to erase them . </p><p>You can also click on the first email to erase from that sender. Holding the shift key or cmd button if you are on a Mac machine. Click on some other email to delete it separately and so you can delete some email in between of it from that unwanted email there in that received list of email. </p><p>Questions are open </p><p>Greetings googlethunderbird. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
