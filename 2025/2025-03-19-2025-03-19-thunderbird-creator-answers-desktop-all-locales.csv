I'm very happy with it, i come from BlueMail which is already great but I was not happy with the efficiency of the push notification system. I was missing a lot of emails. Anyway, i decided to try Thunderbird and it solved all my problems. </p><p>But, I have a blocking problem using Thunderbird for Android&nbsp;: When I write a new email and I write the adress mail of the recipient(s), the app doesnt propose any autocompletion/email adress based on emails i recieved/sent. The only way to have this is to have contacts in my adress book which I don't want. This is a feature BlueMail had so I uess it should be possible to have such equivalent with thunderbird&nbsp;?

I tried uninstalling the Google Provider addon and then tried to resinstall it.  However, I'm getting ""Bad Gateway"" error for the addons site.   Having read a couple of articles I then tried to add my Google calendar as a network calendar and Google accepted the request but Thunderbird reports that my ""credentials were not accepted"" - despite the fact the Google sent me an email saying that Thunderbird now had full access to my calendar.    Do I need the ""Provider"" addon?    If so, where do I get it and why did it stop working? </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1719499;,stephenatkins7215

I usually load up thunderbird once a week to backup all emails from Gmail. The problem is when I click the get new mail button it only downloads emails in batches of 14 or 20. I have to keep clicking the get new mail button to download all the weeks emails. I cannot find any setting to change this behaviour. I just want thunderbird to download all emails in one go. Is this a Gmail issue or thunderbird issue? Thanks in advance </p><p>James </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jhansonnz
