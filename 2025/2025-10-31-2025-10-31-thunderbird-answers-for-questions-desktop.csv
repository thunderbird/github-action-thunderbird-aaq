I dont want them on the server which is why i chose pop account.</em> </p><p>If you have unchecked the 'Leave messages on server', then none of the other settings apply.  </p><p>If you select 'Leave messages on server' then you can choose how long to leave on server. But you may need to compact folders to force it to work as the folder eg: Inbox still has the email in the folder but the email is marked as deleted and hidden. The compact removes all traces of deleted and moved emails. </p><p><br> As Matt says - google and outlook servers can be a pain. </p><p>Gmail - when you delete an email, it can do one of two things. Either it can be put into the gmail Trash (only if you use IMAP) and after 30 days, it will get auto deleted from the 'All Mail' folder and it's gone. If it cannot go into the gmail Trash because you use POP then gmail reads this as only remove the 'label' and therefore email is still stored on server in the 'All Mail' folder. It requires you to periodically log on to sever, access 'All Mail' and manually delete anything that does not have a label applied. Anything you send via gmail server is auto saved by gmail in the server Sent folder - which you will not see if using Pop. It's only visible via webmail. </p><p>Please note: if you do not access webmail and delete old mail then it has been known that gmail start to be a pain and only allow a download of a couple of messages until you clear emails off server. </p><p>Outlook equally does similar and also anything Sent via outlook server is also stored on server.  I think outlook used to have a 'popped off server' folder where it would store those emails for a period of time. Exchange is different again - it's not really designed for Pop.   Would not surprise me if this being a pain was designed in order to force users to periodically logon to servers and kill old mail. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Replies and forwards to messages include any inline images, as would be expected. </p><p>Not necessarilly true. If any inline image does not contain any remote content then you would see the image in the contents of email.  </p><p>However, many 'inline' images are not just images, they contain remote content. Thunderbird by default will not display any image which contains remote content for obvious security reasons. </p><p>IF for some reason you have altered the default and selected to allow remote content, then you will see those inline images. </p><p>So it is entirely possible you have allowed remote content in one version of Thunderbird but not in the other. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The thunderbird profile is data, independent from Windows or Linux. Thunderbird keeps all settings within the profile, not relying on Windows registry. This ensures easy transporting between computers and operating systems. So, moving profile back and forth is no problem. What would be important to avoid problems would be to keep the Windows and Linux partitions using the same release of Thunderbird. POP and IMAP have no bearing on this. Although I am no Linux guru, I do have dual-boot and, since the Linux partition 'see's the Windows partition, it was easy for me to copy the windows profile to the linux partition and run thunderbird on linux immediately with no changes. And, my personal opinion on Windows 10 is that it will be good for several more years. Many users still use Windows 7. Good luck.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
