I dont want them on the server which is why i chose pop account.</em> </p><p>If you have unchecked the 'Leave messages on server', then none of the other settings apply.  </p><p>If you select 'Leave messages on server' then you can choose how long to leave on server. But you may need to compact folders to force it to work as the folder eg: Inbox still has the email in the folder but the email is marked as deleted and hidden. The compact removes all traces of deleted and moved emails. </p><p><br> As Matt says - google and outlook servers can be a pain. </p><p>Gmail - when you delete an email, it can do one of two things. Either it can be put into the gmail Trash (only if you use IMAP) and after 30 days, it will get auto deleted from the 'All Mail' folder and it's gone. If it cannot go into the gmail Trash because you use POP then gmail reads this as only remove the 'label' and therefore email is still stored on server in the 'All Mail' folder. It requires you to periodically log on to sever, access 'All Mail' and manually delete anything that does not have a label applied. Anything you send via gmail server is auto saved by gmail in the server Sent folder - which you will not see if using Pop. It's only visible via webmail. </p><p>Please note: if you do not access webmail and delete old mail then it has been known that gmail start to be a pain and only allow a download of a couple of messages until you clear emails off server. </p><p>Outlook equally does similar and also anything Sent via outlook server is also stored on server.  I think outlook used to have a 'popped off server' folder where it would store those emails for a period of time. Exchange is different again - it's not really designed for Pop.   Would not surprise me if this being a pain was designed in order to force users to periodically logon to servers and kill old mail. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The thunderbird profile is data, independent from Windows or Linux. Thunderbird keeps all settings within the profile, not relying on Windows registry. This ensures easy transporting between computers and operating systems. So, moving profile back and forth is no problem. What would be important to avoid problems would be to keep the Windows and Linux partitions using the same release of Thunderbird. POP and IMAP have no bearing on this. Although I am no Linux guru, I do have dual-boot and, since the Linux partition 'see's the Windows partition, it was easy for me to copy the windows profile to the linux partition and run thunderbird on linux immediately with no changes. And, my personal opinion on Windows 10 is that it will be good for several more years. Many users still use Windows 7. Good luck.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I get quite a bit of spam, but also many newsletters and the like that take up megabytes of space in my mail folders if I don't compact them regularly. I usually compact several times in the morning, for example, with 6-8 MB saved each time.   I also back up the mail files regularly, and I like to keep those backups as small as possible.  That includes a direct email backup using MailStore Home, which searches the folders directly so will recover deleted emails if the files have not been compacted.  For so long it was so easy to just run xPunge.  Now it takes much more effort, but I still compact my folders after an account has received a number of emails that have been deleted. </p>",marklang,false,0,0

As to Xpunge, it has not worked with any version of Thunderbird since 140 forward.  That is what I have used for years, and wish I could still use since I have four IMAP accounts that I manage with TB.  There is some bug in the TB code that causes Xpunge to fail which has not been fixed.  The author of Xpunge  filed a detailed bug report some time ago.  There is a workaround one can use to get Xpunge to load by modifying the xpi file, but it still has the bug.   The second option, File &gt; Compact folders, is what I was addressing in this thread.  It also seems to fail intermittently.  Perhaps it is caused by the same bug as the one that impacts Xpunge.  I just know that, from time to time, the compact folders takes no action when there are folders that need compacting.  I have not found any way to distinguish when the failure will occur except to run the Compact Folders and see in the messages that no folders were actually compacted when I know I have deleted messages in the folders.  I suppose the option to compact when it will save x space works for many users.  In my case, I prefer to take action manually so I always know where I stand.  I am not sure what would happen if I exited TB when something like compacting folders was in progress. </p><p>The backup option for the profile in the Roaming folder is a great one that I do use regularly.  I use it mostly to restore to a working profile when there are problems or corruptions.   MailStore Home is a great free program that archives individual emails and lets you search for and access individual emails when you need to.  I like to have that as an additional option.  Unfortunately, it takes emails directly from the mbox file, but it does not recognize the X-Mozilla-Status: parameter you mention.  So, it will archive any email that has been deleted when the folder has not been compacted.  MailStore Home does provide an option to archive directly from the IMAP server instead.  However, it is limited to a couple of accounts (not 4 like I have).   </p><p>Thanks again.  I am still a big fan of Thunderbird and the support provided by the community. </p>",marklang,false,0,0

This is with POP mail account where the original messages are left on the server.  Norton is a standout is in a field full of over achievers.  BTW in this instance the antivirus crashes when it encounters a malformed email and takes the entire connection with it.  Later Thunderbird tries again on it's timed fetch and again the antivirus will crash everything at exactly the same point.  Until you either remove the malformed mail from the server (usually emptying the spam folder server side does the job)  or you turn of the antivirus mail scanner until the malformed email is successfully downloaded (and guess what you are not infected with anything). </p><p>I am particularly odd, in that I specifically do not believe in email scanning incoming or outgoing.  I do suggest care when opening and saving attachments to email but I think the actually scanning is more trouble than it is worth.  Note also that with POP mail account the record of what has been downloaded is stored in your profile in a file called popstate.dat and if you have an antivirus program scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder whi9le it is running contention can see the file data corrupted or invalidated so you get everything you have left on the server over again.  Other cause the issue by placing the profile folder in their documents folder or otherwise cause the file system to be unstable with streaming backups,  profiles on NAS devices or cloud backup of the profile contents in some form of home made synchronization between computers. </p><p>Now as for getting lost when accessing the address book.  Why would you leave the compose window to find an address? You basically lost me at that point.  Press F9 to have the address books listed in the compose window if the automatic search when you type into the address field is inadequate.  You are not using a phone and modern wide screen monitors are far to wide to fill with text anyway,  so having your contacts in a pane on the right makes sense.
