If any inline image does not contain any remote content then you would see the image in the contents of email.  </p><p>However, many 'inline' images are not just images, they contain remote content. Thunderbird by default will not display any image which contains remote content for obvious security reasons. </p><p>IF for some reason you have altered the default and selected to allow remote content, then you will see those inline images. </p><p>So it is entirely possible you have allowed remote content in one version of Thunderbird but not in the other. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
