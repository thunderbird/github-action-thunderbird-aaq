Find the buttons to compact the inbox , select the inbox folder and go to file&gt;Compact folders and use in the menu compact folders to click on it. Select the inbox folder and then use &nbsp;: File -&gt; Compact Folders to compact it. </p><p>Recent e-mail s can quickly be moved to other places before the compacting starts so you can quickly reach out to them in a safe new folder on the desktop in a new present submap. Try to configure Thunderbird to automaticly compact folders to prevent situations like this. Keep a weekly or daily routine to control if these new settings work fine and well. </p><p>If these settings above does work fine but the issue is still there then you can go and see if some configurations settings are there in the filter settings that you had configured if there are to much filters that you have installed recent you  have to delete some of them or all filters to see if the problem is vanished now. Filter deleting and configuration is one of the possible solving subjects here. </p>",Googlethunderbird,false,0,0

We increased the display time of notices in the status bar (at the bottom) so users could actually read them.</blockquote> <p>These notices are kind of generic, and inconsequential anyway, since anything of significance would  generate a popup.  So the move to make them slower seems very poorly thought out.  Plus they are so slow that it seems like something else is going on with server communication. Seems like they've actually created a bug. </p><p>Thanks for your reply. </p>",ggg3,false,0,0

I know , Some certifications are not up to date or missing or the certification library is infected. Or the certification had been damaged or suddenly has been corrupted on their way to the program. Or there is no certification at all on that system for the Thunderbird software now. They are designed to protect you from treath s in the program. </p><p>The SSL/Tls certification is missing or damaged. You can choose in a pop up message to confirm to that missing certificatie message and restart the software and you can go in? But the message is coming over and over again.

Let Thunderbird recreate the situation by deleting the primair certification.(cert8.db) The certificate is in the Thunderbird profile and is called cert8.db by deleting that certificate and restart Thunderbird again it creates the same certificate but freshly now. If that problem keep on occuring the same way it might be that the server connection is not good. Or trusted certifications are not added as trusted to the list. An infected certification store or Library are rare to find. </p>,Googlethunderbird,false,0,0
