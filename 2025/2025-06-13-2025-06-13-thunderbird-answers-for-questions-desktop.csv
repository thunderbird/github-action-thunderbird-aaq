So the move to make them slower seems very poorly thought out.  Plus they are so slow that it seems like something else is going on with server communication. Seems like they've actually created a bug. </p><p>Thanks for your reply. </p>",ggg3,false,0,0

The Thunderbird program must be set up as an allowed program. Please confirm you have this set up. </p><p><strong>Anti-Virus:</strong> This might be set up to auto scan any file that gets opened etc, so could be causing an interference when Thunderbird is starting up or even when attempting to download. I would advise that you set up an exemption to not scan your <strong>Thunderbird</strong> folder that contains all info on profile(s). If you downloaded Thunderbird from the official website&nbsp;: <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> Then the profile will by default be here: C:/Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </p><p>Another way to check if AV is an issue: Restart computer in 'Safe mode with Networking' mode - please note you will need to use an ethernet cable to connect computer to router as it will not work using wireless connection. </p><p><strong>VPN</strong> Please check your computer to see if you have enabled a VPN. Many Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and some auto enable it.  I use Norton365 and after an update discovered it has auto enabled a VPN which basically caused all kinds of issues. Most servers do not like VPN because it hides the expected IP address, so server blocks access because it thinks you are a hacker. Switch off the VPN or you can create a split tunnelling and set up Thunderbird to use it. </p><p>I also use BT. I have both Pop and Imap account connections to the BT server. I am not experiencing any issues with download at this moment. All accounts are ok.  I'm testing this in both 128.11.1esr  and a beta 140.0b2 </p><p>Are you able to logon to BT webmail account via a browser&nbsp;? I ask this because last week it did go down.

Let Thunderbird recreate the situation by deleting the primair certification.(cert8.db) The certificate is in the Thunderbird profile and is called cert8.db by deleting that certificate and restart Thunderbird again it creates the same certificate but freshly now.
