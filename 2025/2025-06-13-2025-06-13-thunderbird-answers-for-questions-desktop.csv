To see the count of all messages in a folder, select the folder and look above the message list. In your screenshot, you can see the count of messages in your draft folder. </p><p>Your original problem was that all incoming messages were going directly to trash. Why did/do you believe that all incoming messages were/are going to trash? What is the evidence of that? Your screenshot shows an unread message in your in-box. Is that a recent message, which would indicate that messages are indeed going to your in-box? If you send a message to yourself, in which folder does the received message appear? </p><p>Why do you believe that you are not able to send messages? </p><p>Your draft folder has an unusually high number of messages in it (5,320). Do you know why? </p><p>Are you aware that you are displaying your messages in cards view? Many people prefer table view.

I shouldn't be speculating that this is a disk space management problem, but it is a bug in the software.  ""Empty trash"" and ""Compact folders"" suggestions in order to keep the software functioning should not be required.  In fact for years (before the ""new generation"" of Thunderbird software) I intentionally chose to ignore Thunderbird compact folder suggestions and had no problems.  It's only with the most recent releases that I was forced to compact messages in order to keep the software functioning.   This problem needs to be fixed.   Finally I'll say that compacting IS a credible suggestion for the software to make, but only to save disk space for users where disk space might be an issue, not as a requirement for keep the software functioning.  Oh,  and I don't like using the the ""forced delete"" mechanism you suggest because I occasionally refer back to a message in trash I shouldn't have deleted, which leads me to another product improvement suggestion.  Thunderbird does a good job of managing the Junk folder, automatically deleting old messages in the Junk folder.  There should be an option in Settings to allow users to do that with the Trash folder.  If that were available, I would set it at 3 (or 6) months (ask the software to delete Trash messages older than 3 (or 6) months). </p>",newdayrj,false,0,0

When I use the phrase ""software not functioning properly"" I mean that as I delete messages the software eventually gets to the point where I cannot delete any more messages without emptying trash and/or compacting a folder (*).  Emptying trash and/or compacting folders should not be a requirement for the ability to delete messages.  I would think that emptying trash and/or compacting folders should only be a suggestion for SAVING disk space.  Not sure about this part: I would think the operating system itself would warn me when I am RUNNING OUT of disk space.  I wouldn't think that notification should be Thunderbird's responsibility.   </p><p>(*) When this happens (having to empty trash and compact a folder) seems to be random.  Sometimes I can (cumulatively) delete over 200 messages (using multiple deletes) without having to empty trash and compact a folder.  Other times, I can only delete 25 (one page of) messages and I get the error message (and have to empty trash and compact a folder).  I try to watch (and make mental note of) the space saved while compacting a folder during this process.  It ranges from sometimes as small as kilobytes to up to 30MB (very variable).  Sometimes exiting and re-starting the application seems to help.  Just wanted to give more insight into what's happening. </p>",newdayrj,false,0,0

I'm forcing myself to go through 1,400 e-mails per day (deciding which e-mails I want to save on my hard disk before I delete them and which e-mails I just want to delete).  I'm moving to a new computer and have vowed NOT to take these old e-mails with me and I WILL get this done by 6/22.  Yes, I believe my Thunderbird profile is on one disk drive (I only have one disk (C) drive).  The size of the drive is 1TB and I have 617GB free.  1) Starting Windows in Safe Mode will be delayed unless I get ahead on my e-mail goals. 2) I don't think the Compact Automatically setting is a factor (at least not for me).  I had it set (before I turned it off) at ""Compact all folders when it will save over 500MB.""   It's asking me to compact (box checked or not) well below 500MB.  3) I think the number of messages/e-mails out there is a factor.  I just finished the Inbox for today (deleting 718 messages).  When I started (on 6/8) I had 11,593 e-mails in my Inbox.  After today I will have 4,100 (approximately).  As I reduce (delete) the number of e-mails, Thunderbird's tolerance (for allowing me to delete e-mails without requiring me to empty trash or compact a folder) seems to grow.  When I finished today I had 443 e-mails in Trash to empty (a record since I started) and the compacting saved 164MB (also a record). </p>",newdayrj,false,0,1

It is unfortunately, kind of absurd that they don't allow excluding folders, because they clearly are capable of providing it as they have done so in the past.  You might try setting an exclusion on the Thunderbird executuable. </p><p>I have personally dealt with vendors in the past (in an non-coder capacity) on very technical issues on their interaction with Thunderbird - for example McAfee, twice.  It is extremely time consuming, takes weeks and months sometimes for a resolution. In each case I spent 10-20 hours helping them connect to customers having problems, to help them solve their product's problem.   </p><p>Also we can tell that vendors have special code or hooks to work properly, because (at least in the distant past) we'd get more user complaints when new version of Thunderbird came out, even though there was no change to the Thunderbird file IO code.  So customer complaints to the vendor tend to have a bigger impact, which is why we encourage users to file tickets with the AV company.  </p><p>Good news though, development of a new message database is well underway and expected to be available later this year. </p>",wsmwk,false,0,0

A couple of behaviors I thought would be worth sharing (pertaining to the empty trash/compact folders problem): </p><p>1) I thought that as the number of e-mails declined in my Inbox and Sent folders, the problem would either go away or allow me to select and delete more e-mails with a single delete.  I was wrong.  The problem persisted all the way to the bitter end, even when I had less than 500 e-mails (total) in my Inbox and Sent folders. </p><p>2) As a temporary workaround (to continue deleting e-mails after the error message appeared without emptying trash or compacting folders) I could reduce the number of e-mails selected for deletion.  For example, let’s say I selected 50 e-mails, clicked on delete, and got the error message asking me to empty trash and compact folders.  I could reduce the number of e-mails selected for deletion (5 or 10 at a time) and continue without having to empty trash or compact folders.  Maybe I could select (and delete) ONE E-MAIL AT A TIME and continue forever?  I really don’t know.  Deleting 19,000 e-mails one at a time is something I would never want to contemplate. </p><p>3) If I see the problem occurring on the new desktop, I will let you know. </p><p>4) If there’s anything additional you need to know about my old desktop, let me know within the next two weeks (by 07/07/25).  After that, I’ll be re-formatting (or destroying) the hard disk on the old desktop and re-cycling what’s left. </p>",newdayrj,false,0,0
