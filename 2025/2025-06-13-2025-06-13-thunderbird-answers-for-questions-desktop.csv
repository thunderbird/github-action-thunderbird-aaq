Find the buttons to compact the inbox , select the inbox folder and go to file&gt;Compact folders and use in the menu compact folders to click on it. Select the inbox folder and then use &nbsp;: File -&gt; Compact Folders to compact it. </p><p>Recent e-mail s can quickly be moved to other places before the compacting starts so you can quickly reach out to them in a safe new folder on the desktop in a new present submap. Try to configure Thunderbird to automaticly compact folders to prevent situations like this. Keep a weekly or daily routine to control if these new settings work fine and well. </p><p>If these settings above does work fine but the issue is still there then you can go and see if some configurations settings are there in the filter settings that you had configured if there are to much filters that you have installed recent you  have to delete some of them or all filters to see if the problem is vanished now. Filter deleting and configuration is one of the possible solving subjects here. </p>",Googlethunderbird,false,0,0
