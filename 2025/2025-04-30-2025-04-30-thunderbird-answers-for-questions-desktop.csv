Additionally, I already have two archived TB folders called DATA1.sbd and DATA2.sbd that I want to have available within the local folder C:\TBOFFLINE so that both are accessible from the Local Folders menu in TB.   These are not new folders directly created *within* TB, they already exist as separate files. </p><p>Option 1:  First link the new and empty local directory C:\TBOFFLINE in TB, and restart.  TB automatically places Trash.msf and Unsent Messages.msf files in C:\TBOFFLINE.  If I now copy DATA1.sbd and DATA2.sbd folders to C:\TBOFFLINE, and restart TB, neither DATA1 nor DATA2 folders show up in Local Folders.  However, if I change the local directory to C\TBOFFLINE\DATA1.sbd (pointing directly at one of the TB offline folders) and restart, then the DATA1 folder+subfolders+ emails are present in Local Folders.  Same for DATA2 on its own, they are both valid containers of TB folders and emails.  But how to get both? </p><p>Option 2.  Before linking the local directory C:\TBOFFLINE in TB, copy both DATA1.sbd and DATA2.sbd to C:\TBOFFLINE.  Restart.   Now a new folder, DATA1.sbd.sbd plus DATA1.sbd.msf is created within C:\TBOFFLINE, the Local Folders directory in TB shows a folder DATA1.sbd and it has associated sub-folders that are accurately named, but the sub-folders themselves are empty.  This option ignores the second data file, and failed to display contents.  Complete failure here. </p><p>Option 1 was therefore partially successful, but I’ve yet to find a way to have the system map the contents of more than one externally-supplied .SBD folder.  With Outlook, one simply points to external files (PST) with their individual local drive locations (not necessarily one folder) that are immediately available in the application. </p>",rstern1,false,0,0
