I'd completely forgotten about it until I was adding another reminder for the same day.  I've now changed the setting, so hopefully my reminders will work correctly again.  I've also gone through my future events for the next couple of months and found some others which had early reminders which were snoozed and never reappeared.  I hope I have fixed all of them now!  I set up ""events"" to add important reminders so I can remember to take care of them.  Some of these items are very important!

This has not been a real problem for me because I often set reminders for several days before something needs to be taken care of, and I keep snoozing them until I get it done.  I normally power off my Macbook laptop every night; when I was using a Windows PC I often left it running but I closed all windows, including Thunderbird.  So when the reminder popped up when I reopened Thunderbird the next day it wasn't a big deal because I probably wasn't going to take care of it the night before, anyway.  I just use the 2-hour snooze because it's available in the drop-down and is easier to just click instead of resetting it for the next day.  (FYI, I put the reminders on my calendar instead of using the ""Tasks"" function.). But it is a bug; the reminders should continue to pop up after being snoozed without having to restart Thunderbird. </p>",ajp1228,false,0,0

Additionally, I already have two archived TB folders called DATA1.sbd and DATA2.sbd that I want to have available within the local folder C:\TBOFFLINE so that both are accessible from the Local Folders menu in TB.   These are not new folders directly created *within* TB, they already exist as separate files. </p><p>Option 1:  First link the new and empty local directory C:\TBOFFLINE in TB, and restart.  TB automatically places Trash.msf and Unsent Messages.msf files in C:\TBOFFLINE.  If I now copy DATA1.sbd and DATA2.sbd folders to C:\TBOFFLINE, and restart TB, neither DATA1 nor DATA2 folders show up in Local Folders.  However, if I change the local directory to C\TBOFFLINE\DATA1.sbd (pointing directly at one of the TB offline folders) and restart, then the DATA1 folder+subfolders+ emails are present in Local Folders.  Same for DATA2 on its own, they are both valid containers of TB folders and emails.  But how to get both? </p><p>Option 2.  Before linking the local directory C:\TBOFFLINE in TB, copy both DATA1.sbd and DATA2.sbd to C:\TBOFFLINE.  Restart.   Now a new folder, DATA1.sbd.sbd plus DATA1.sbd.msf is created within C:\TBOFFLINE, the Local Folders directory in TB shows a folder DATA1.sbd and it has associated sub-folders that are accurately named, but the sub-folders themselves are empty.  This option ignores the second data file, and failed to display contents.  Complete failure here. </p><p>Option 1 was therefore partially successful, but I’ve yet to find a way to have the system map the contents of more than one externally-supplied .SBD folder.  With Outlook, one simply points to external files (PST) with their individual local drive locations (not necessarily one folder) that are immediately available in the application. </p>",rstern1,false,0,0

See attached before and after screenshots.  </p><p>I started with sub-folders that did not have an sbd extension. That was an oversight. I meant to reproduce Richard's situation with the sbd folders. Thunderbird created sub-folders with the sbd extension, but did not move the mbox files into them. Inside Thunderbird were empty folders. When I moved the mbox files myself into the sub-folders that Thunderbird had created in the file system, folders in Thunderbird remained empty. </p><p>Richard, since Thunderbird is not dealing properly with the file system, the only way I see to accomplish your objective is to put all your mbox files, maybe one sub-folder at a time, in a flat structure (without sub-folders) into C:\TBOFFLINE, then put them into sub-folders within Thunderbird. Thunderbird will then create the structure in the file system that it needs. </p><p>How many mbox files do you have in your two sub-folders? I'm guessing that it is more than a few, in which case this process may be onerous, but maybe not very onerous because you should be able to select and move many files at once. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
