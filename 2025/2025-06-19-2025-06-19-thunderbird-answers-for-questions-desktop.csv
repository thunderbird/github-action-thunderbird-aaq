So I think that the prefs.js file in your profile is gone corrupt. This file contains all account settings and when it is damaged TB renames it in prefs-x.js and creates a new virgin prefs.js file which doesn't contain any account setting. Since TB on startup doesn't find any of your accounts you see this invitation to setup your existing email address.  </p><p>Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting information &gt; Profile folder &gt; Open folder, then quit TB. In the profile folder search for a <strong>prefs-1.js</strong> (or invalidprefs.js) file with the actual date. If the new prefs.js file has a size of 6 to 7 kB (much less than a prefs-1.js size of 30 to 50 kB) my diagnostic of a corrupt prefs.js file is confirmed. If you have a recent backup copy of your Thunderbird profile the solution is simple: copy the prefs.js file from the backup and - Thunderbird closed - paste it in the actual profile folder, thus replacing the present prefs.js file. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
