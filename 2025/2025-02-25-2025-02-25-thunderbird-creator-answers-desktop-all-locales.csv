I have 2 email accounts with Yahoo and am using Thunderbird to access them. It used to work properly, but now I can receive emails on both accounts, but can only send emails on one of them. The other account gives me the error message: ""Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending email. The mail server responded: Request failed; Mailbox unavailable. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again."" When I then look at the SMTP user name, it shows the name for the other account. When I change that user name to the correct name, I can then send emails on that account, but the process also changes the user name in the second account, such that it no longer allows sending emails. In other words, when I go to 'account settings' and set the SMTP user name for account 1, then go to account 2 settings, I find that the account 1 user name shows up. If I then change the account 2 user name and go back to look at the settings for account 1, I find that the SMTP user name in account 1 has changed to the same as I just changed in account 2.  Additional info: Prior to this problem, I had gone into my emails on the Yahoo website and changed the password on both accounts. When I then opened Thunderbird it asked me for the new passwords for each account, as it normally does, and everything looked fine until I tried to send using the one account.
