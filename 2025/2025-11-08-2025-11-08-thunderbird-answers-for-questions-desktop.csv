My understanding is that IMAP works, so are you downloading messages so you can switch to another email provider? Please explain and we can go from there. Nice to see you again.&nbsp;:)  david </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

This is still true for actual Thunderbird versions and my Mail.app version 16.0 running on macOS Monterey. </p><p>But there is a workaround:  In Mail.app select a folder, e.g. an Inbox folder, R-click and choose ""Export Mailbox"". This will open a Finder window in which you'll choose the destination folder, e.g the Desktop.. The result of an Inbox export will be a folder INBOX.mbox (or Sent.mbox for a Sent export) on your Desktop. If you open INBOX.mbox with a double-click you'll see two files (see image): a file named <strong>mbox</strong> which is a text file containing the Inbox messages (similar to Thunderbird mbox files), and a table_of_contents file which is somewhat similar to an index file.  </p><p>You can import those mbox files in Thunderbird with the add-on ImportExportTools NG or manually. I prefer the manual method:  open the Thunderbird profile folder and quit TB, go to .../Mail/Local Folders/ and drag &amp; drop the mbox file from your Desktop in Local Folders. When you restart TB you'll see a folder ""mbox"" in your Local Folders which you can rename as you like. To do this in a more efficient manner: you export several (or even all) of your mailboxes from Mail.app one after the other and rename the mbox files at once as you like, for instance Inbox-1, Inbox-2, ... Sent-1, Sent-2, Drafts-1,&nbsp;:.... etc. Then you open the profile folder via Users/username/ Library/Profiles/xxxxxxxx.default-relase/Mail/Local Folders/, drag &amp; drop all those exported and renamed mbox files in Local Folders and restart TB where you can reorganise your imported Mail.app mailboxes </p><p>Accessing the Hidden User Library (macOS) <a href=""https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020012418-Accessing-the-Hidden-User-Library-macOS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020012418-Accessing-the-Hidden-User-Library-macOS</a> </p><p>Export Mail.app mailboxes  <a href=""https://support.apple.com/bg-bg/guide/mail/mlhlp1030/mac"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/bg-bg/guide/mail/mlhlp1030/mac</a> </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

Have you tried deleting from the primary folder for the messages? That would be my approach, as using the Allmail folder is generally not recommended.
