This is still true for actual Thunderbird versions and my Mail.app version 16.0 running on macOS Monterey. </p><p>But there is a workaround:  In Mail.app select a folder, e.g. an Inbox folder, R-click and choose ""Export Mailbox"". This will open a Finder window in which you'll choose the destination folder, e.g the Desktop.. The result of an Inbox export will be a folder INBOX.mbox (or Sent.mbox for a Sent export) on your Desktop. If you open INBOX.mbox with a double-click you'll see two files (see image): a file named <strong>mbox</strong> which is a text file containing the Inbox messages (similar to Thunderbird mbox files), and a table_of_contents file which is somewhat similar to an index file.  </p><p>You can import those mbox files in Thunderbird with the add-on ImportExportTools NG or manually. I prefer the manual method:  open the Thunderbird profile folder and quit TB, go to .../Mail/Local Folders/ and drag &amp; drop the mbox file from your Desktop in Local Folders. When you restart TB you'll see a folder ""mbox"" in your Local Folders which you can rename as you like. To do this in a more efficient manner: you export several (or even all) of your mailboxes from Mail.app one after the other and rename the mbox files at once as you like, for instance Inbox-1, Inbox-2, ... Sent-1, Sent-2, Drafts-1,&nbsp;:.... etc. Then you open the profile folder via Users/username/ Library/Profiles/xxxxxxxx.default-relase/Mail/Local Folders/, drag &amp; drop all those exported and renamed mbox files in Local Folders and restart TB where you can reorganise your imported Mail.app mailboxes </p><p>Accessing the Hidden User Library (macOS) <a href=""https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020012418-Accessing-the-Hidden-User-Library-macOS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020012418-Accessing-the-Hidden-User-Library-macOS</a> </p><p>Export Mail.app mailboxes  <a href=""https://support.apple.com/bg-bg/guide/mail/mlhlp1030/mac"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/bg-bg/guide/mail/mlhlp1030/mac</a> </p>",Mapenzi,false,1,0

Many issues with apparent corruption are caused by the file contention that their scanning invokes.  The contention issue come as a function of how slow the antivirus scanning is,  the size of the files on disk and the frequency they are opened. </p><p>In the case of say three consecutive emails being filtered to the same folder, Thunderbird may open and close the underlying file three times,  not once as it did in years past.  Each email action is now a discrete function because there used to be loads of IMAP timeouts happening because again of scanning delaying the IMAP sync.  Now the issue has moved to the local folders because there does not appear to be any end to the number of times antivirus products will scan the same thing, let alone in a few second windows.  ince on the wire downloading it, again on the wire sending the seen or read flag back to the serve, in memory once it arrives and again when Thunderbird commits the mail to disk.  And that is for a normal text email add another delay while it decodes any attachments from the text based MIME and forms them back into their original binary format and scans those separately.  If I sound like I am down on antivirus products you would be right. </p><p>Could it be those problem folders be your three largest frequently used folders? </p><p>The only ones greater than 1Gb in size for instance.

That way someone might be able to figure out what is happening in your instance.  Thunderbird saves mail to the accounts designated sent folder by default.  I have seen the odd instance where that goes wrong where the Thunderbird software and the server software are using different languages.  But it is not a general issue. Who is the mail provider? Is the mail account IMAP, POP or EWS? </p><p>Is your account configured to actually save sent email in account settings &gt; Copies and folder? </p><p>See below for some of the settings options. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-11-08-21-39-27-88cc4e.png""> </p><p>Just a point of interest, I see you flag this topic as having something to do with Android, despite posting in the desktop forum.  Is it Android?  That is a completely different product that happens to share a name.  The source code is not even on the same servers. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
