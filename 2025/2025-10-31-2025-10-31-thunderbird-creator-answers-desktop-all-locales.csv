I dont want them on the server which is why i chose pop account. yet when i open web account,  the emails already downloaded using the pop account are still there even thoug they were downloaded days ago. Why is this and how do stop this?  is there a 'leave copy on server' box to uncheck that I am missing?  i want to use pop to remove from server and just use locally but its not doing what i thought it would, which is remove from setver. Also it keeps repeating downloading from years ago so I was hoping that when the server synced it would stop downloading the ones it has already (mulitple times)  I made an imap account to try to sort emails that way but it also shows old emails still on server. Should i delet this imap account as I already have a pop account running? Very confused.

My question is about the migration process and in particular testing/checking the migration is OK, but being able to go back to Windows if needed. </p><p>If I start by installing Linux as dual-boot with Windows&nbsp;: </p><p>1. Can I leave the TB mailbase on the Windows partition and point the Linux version at the same location (using Settings/Server Settings/Local directory), then use TB on Linux and have the mailbase grow, on the original Windows partition? 2. If so and I need to revert, will the Windows version of TB accept the changes to the mailbase made by Linux? 3. As an issue with Linux is often that you just can't get a program you need in a Linux or browser version, could I e.g. use Linux for most of the time, then boot into Windows to use said Win-only program and at the same time use the Windows' TB until such time as I boot back into Linux? 4. Would the answers to the above differ between IMAP and POP - we generally use POP on PC with IMAP on our phones/fondleslabs, but also have an IMAP account on the PC for if needed.  I can imagine that IMAP would facilitate this dual-access better than POP (or would each program have to re-subscribe to IMAP folders when you switch OS), but I'd really like to continue with POP for a fair number of reasons. </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1776148;1776149;,cjg.aptl

I wish there was a better way, but unfortunately not at this time.   When I select to Empty Trash, I get messages showing quite an extensive dialog.  It logs in, syncs, and even checks the folder capability of the server.  When I select to Compact Files, I first get a simple message in the lower left corner ""Compacting Files.""  Then I get messages showing each folder being compacted, and how much space was saved.  It even shows reloading the last message at the end, even though the message is already there.    </p><p>Since I now see this detailed dialog, I have noticed that, from time to time, the compacting fails.  I get the first message, ""Compacting Folders.""  But then nothing else.  I also don't see the email message list go blank for a second when it is compacting the folder I am viewing.  If I repeat the compacting folder command, it does the same thing.  It appears that TB thinks the folders are already compacted, and takes no action.  The only way I have found to get the compacting to work is to wait for more messages to come, delete the ones I don't want, and it will probably work on the next try.  It seems to fail perhaps every 10th time or so. </p><p>Perhaps this is the same TB base code issue that is affecting xPunge?  I do not get any errors, at least that I can recognize.  I looked at the console, but I could not discern anything there that might be applicable - but that could be because I don't understand most of the messages there.

AOL requires a third party app password. It recently failed to connect, then worked for a day and again failed to connect. I've had a long, friendly, but unsuccessful session with AOL tech support. They suggested that I ask Mozilla for support. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",algotruneman.ar

After deleting most of themI was dismayed to have the double and triple downloading continue.  I now the email on my angroid phone far more than Thunderbird because of this, sometimes when drafting emails the message screen goes god knows where when I go to find add address from my address book,  There is yet a straight forward to rasily increase and decrease the font size in received emails.  As my eyesight fails thay's an important omission to have to work around,  Firefox has an app that adds buttons to increase and decrease font size,  simple.   Never understood why Thunderbird didn't have somwthing similar,  Much more convenient than have to stop and search for my glasses, </p><p>I think a back to basics approach to Thunderbird rather then adding bells and whistles that may ne nice buy seldom used,  I just learned gmail allows you to retract emails.
