I dont want them on the server which is why i chose pop account. yet when i open web account,  the emails already downloaded using the pop account are still there even thoug they were downloaded days ago. Why is this and how do stop this?  is there a 'leave copy on server' box to uncheck that I am missing?  i want to use pop to remove from server and just use locally but its not doing what i thought it would, which is remove from setver. Also it keeps repeating downloading from years ago so I was hoping that when the server synced it would stop downloading the ones it has already (mulitple times)  Help figuring out what to do appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",brew
