Any fix?  Today the <strong>Sent </strong>- my email address taskbar button shows 98 In Thunderbird I have only  2 new sent messages from 4-18 and none for 4-19. I have 9550 overall. </p><p>My <strong>Inbox </strong>on various days show 75 or 14 or 8 BTW I never get more then a few messages at a time so seeing 75 or 14 or 8 would never be correct. </p><p>I go to download and none show up. I have the number of Total message count already downloaded displayed and the number does not change. Any new message would also be in Bold. </p><p>I disabled the showing on the Taskbar and as an example when I go to check messages and it says 1 of 1 yet none show up. </p><p>I have even moved all my Inbox email to a subfolder and no new email will show up in the Inbox when the program says I will have lots. I checked my domain cPanel email and no new email either. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",davidhelp

Po aktualizaci Thunderbird na verzi 136.x,x a novější mi přestal fungovat tisk PDF dokumentů z emailů. Dokument v okně náhledu v Thunderbird vidím, ale vytiskne se vždy prázdná stránka. Ve verzi 128.x.x bylo funkční. Také mám problém se zobrazením obsahů emailů v některých podsložkách v POP3 účtech. Seznam emailů v aplikaci vidím, ale pokud chci email otevřít, tak nevidím žádný obsah. Datový soubor se zdá OK, protože když ho otevřu třeba v MBOX Viewer, tak obsah i včetně příloh vidím. Zkusil jsem přeinstalovat, vymazat cache soubory, ale stále nefunkční. Děkuji za případnou radu. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,cs,1726960;1726976;,m.cuhel

Most of these have been doing fine but one suddenly (and silently) stopped getting anything about a month ago. I have checked the settings, not that I have changed anything, and that all appears fine. I can bring up the emails via my network provider and they appear there alright. I also have a Fire tablet and I can see them there alright. So what's going on? What else can I check?

The others display their content with no problem. And it's not always the same senders that exhibit the problem. It is totally random. I want to fix the problem since I cannot read all my emails.

It receives 5 email channels and was working fine up until a few weeks back. I can still use it to send on that channel just not receive. Since it is Imap I can access it ok on the network providers web site (Talktalk) I can also receive it ok on an Amazon Fire tablet. I have tried turning off aspects of my antivirus (Bitdefender) but it doesn't seem to help. At the bottom edge of the Thunderbird screen I can see various sets of words which seem to indicate it is accessing the Imap channel just that nothing appears. In case it helps the email address is of the form xxxxx.xxxxx@lineone.net. Someone helpfully provided a list of suggested problem areas but they either don't apply or they seem to be ok.
