Any fix?  Today the <strong>Sent </strong>- my email address taskbar button shows 98 In Thunderbird I have only  2 new sent messages from 4-18 and none for 4-19. I have 9550 overall. </p><p>My <strong>Inbox </strong>on various days show 75 or 14 or 8 BTW I never get more then a few messages at a time so seeing 75 or 14 or 8 would never be correct. </p><p>I go to download and none show up. I have the number of Total message count already downloaded displayed and the number does not change. Any new message would also be in Bold. </p><p>I disabled the showing on the Taskbar and as an example when I go to check messages and it says 1 of 1 yet none show up. </p><p>I have even moved all my Inbox email to a subfolder and no new email will show up in the Inbox when the program says I will have lots. I checked my domain cPanel email and no new email either. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",davidhelp
