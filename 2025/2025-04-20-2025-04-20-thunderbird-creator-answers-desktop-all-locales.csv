I have 9550 overall. </p><p>My <strong>Inbox </strong>on various days show 75 or 14 or 8 BTW I never get more then a few messages at a time so seeing 75 or 14 or 8 would never be correct. </p><p>I go to download and none show up.

Po aktualizaci Thunderbird na verzi 136.x,x a novější mi přestal fungovat tisk PDF dokumentů z emailů. Dokument v okně náhledu v Thunderbird vidím, ale vytiskne se vždy prázdná stránka. Ve verzi 128.x.x bylo funkční. Také mám problém se zobrazením obsahů emailů v některých podsložkách v POP3 účtech. Seznam emailů v aplikaci vidím, ale pokud chci email otevřít, tak nevidím žádný obsah. Datový soubor se zdá OK, protože když ho otevřu třeba v MBOX Viewer, tak obsah i včetně příloh vidím. Zkusil jsem přeinstalovat, vymazat cache soubory, ale stále nefunkční.

It receives 5 email channels and was working fine up until a few weeks back. I can still use it to send on that channel just not receive. Since it is Imap I can access it ok on the network providers web site (Talktalk) I can also receive it ok on an Amazon Fire tablet. I have tried turning off aspects of my antivirus (Bitdefender) but it doesn't seem to help. At the bottom edge of the Thunderbird screen I can see various sets of words which seem to indicate it is accessing the Imap channel just that nothing appears. In case it helps the email address is of the form xxxxx.xxxxx@lineone.net. Someone helpfully provided a list of suggested problem areas but they either don't apply or they seem to be ok.

My AV is Norton and seemed to 'upgrade' to 'Norton for Gamers' 2 days ago.  Since then attempts to read messages get a pop-up window titled 'Add Security Exception' with text 'You are about to override how Thunderbird identifies this site. Legitimate banks, stores will not ask you to do this. '  It gives location as '<a href=""http://imap.ionos.co"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.ionos.co</a>,uk;993' then a line says 'This site attempts to identifiy itself with invalid information'. Clicking button marked View shows details that include 'Organisation: Norton Web/Mail Shield' hence my suspicion. I've had a lengthy call with Ionos support, very patient and helpful, checking things at their end, concluding nothing of theirs has changed and all is working correctly.  I tried one of the addresses using their webmail, which worked perfectly. About the same time that this happened, I started getting pop-up messages from Norton when I started software programs that I wrote myself some years ago.  That's never happened before!
