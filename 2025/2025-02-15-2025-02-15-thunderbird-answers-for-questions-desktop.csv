[…] Do I really have to have a password on account setup?</blockquote> <p>If you're trying to set up a mail account in Thunderbird, of course you'll have to provide the password for that account. That's what the password is for, so nobody can access your mail without knowing the password. If you didn't have to use your password for that, then anyone would be able to get access to your mail by merely knowing your email address and setting up <i>your</i> mail account on <i>his/her</i> computer… The indication of which password is required is the very fact that you're trying to get access to your mail account. What other indication would you need? </p><p>You appear to not be correctly configuring the account with the right <i>settings</i>, though. Maybe you're trying to configure automatically an account that you have to <b>Configure manually</b> because Thunderbird doesn't know what the settings for that account should be, and that's why the set up process may fail even if you're using the right password, but you'll have to give more details about which is your email provider and the settings you're trying to use for anyone here to be able to assist. A screenshot (without showing any passwords) would help… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
