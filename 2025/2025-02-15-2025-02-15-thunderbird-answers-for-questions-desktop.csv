I very much appreciate the capability provided by Thunderbird.  </p><p>Somewhat suddenly on February 13th, I could not use Thunderbird to collect (receive) or send messages to/from my @Gmail.com account. The problem was also preventing Thunderbird from sending/receiving Email messages via my personal URL (@LArents.biz) on InMotionHosting. The attached image was recorded using the version of Thunderbird is hosted on a Win7 machine with Norton 360.  I encountered essentially the same problems on another similarly configured but  rarely  used Win7 machine as well as a Win10 machine, so I deduced the problem was not machine specific.  </p><p>Thunderbird was also unable to save sent messages in my sent folder.
