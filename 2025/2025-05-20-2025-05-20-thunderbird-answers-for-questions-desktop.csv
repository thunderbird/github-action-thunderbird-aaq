This is the view that shows columns, such as subject, from, date - click the icon on right of the top line in message list pane to add 'tags' column in the display - tag the desired message - click view&gt;sort by and set to tags  - now, click the tags column entry on bar at top of message list pane and the tagged item will appear at top.  </p><p>My suggestion was to use tags, but you can view the menu at view&gt;sort by and you may prefer another option, such as star or priority. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Try this: - click account settings&gt;synchronizaion&amp;storage for each account and set sync to just recent 30 days.  - next, exit thunderbird - in profile, in the imap\&lt;accountname&gt; folder for each account, DELETE the message folders and their msf entries.  - restart thunderbird, which will repopulate the folders with the new sync setting  - then, periodically compact the folders. That is what is causing space on PC to be bigger than space on server.  </p><p>The phone is a separate entity and has the same issues, but is not a cause of the space usage. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
