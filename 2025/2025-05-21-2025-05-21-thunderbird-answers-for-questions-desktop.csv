LocalFolders è realizzata da uno sviluppatore indipendente, per cui il suo aggiornamento non dipende da Mozilla. Tra l'altro l'aggiornamento di Thunderbird in un ambiente di produzione non era affatto necessario dato che la versione 128 ESR è ancora supportata.

Although close to the border, the text will stay there.&nbsp;:) The options are to insert some unauthorized customization that someone may offer, or to create a custom HTML template that you would need to use. A simple 'fix' would be to just click the 'indent right' icon on the composition toolbar prior to beginning your message and that creates an indentation for you. I still recommend doing nothing. Welcome to Thunderbird.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
