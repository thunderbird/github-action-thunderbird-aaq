All thunderbird does is store the latest successful password you give it, normally done when responding to a prompt for password. If you need to reset the account to receive a new password, you can  - click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security - click savedpassword and then showpassword - then, highlight affected rows and delete them </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The DESCENDING view does this, which I feel is confusing:</em> <em>a) Single messages and thread topics in the selected folder are sorted descending. For threads, it weirdly uses the timestamp of the FIRST message in the thread instead of the most recent message.</em> <em>b) Messages within a thread are sorted ascending instead of descending.</em> </p><p>That is because the 'Sort by' only applies to top level emails, so if you use 'unthreaded' then all emails are single top level emails and all emails will get the 'Sort by' option applied. If you use 'Threaded', then the 'Sort by' gets applied to the initial email and not it's sub threads/replies. Those emails are treated as a conversation, so each email is appended to the initial email meaning the newest will always get appended to the bottom.

So newest will always be at the bottom. But there are also occasions when more people are included and it's possible someone replys to the original messages and someone else replies to one of comments in the thread. The appended comments will be indented when it's a straight forward reply to the one above and dates will always be in ascending order, but then you might find another is outdented as it is a reply to an earlier comment. In which case it may also have an earlier date. So, a reply email is always appended to the relevant email it was in reply to and always in date ascending so newest is always last in that part of conversation. These 'threads' are based on people specifically 'Replying'. A new email with a new subject would not be part of conersation- although you can never account for someone messing things up by Replying and altering the Subject just because they were too lazy to enter an email address, when in reality they should of started a new email and not a reply. </p><p>Example: Person 'A' - Initial email to several people. date: 01/01/2025 - Sort by Date Descending is on this Email |&gt; Reply by 'B' to original date: 01/01/2025 &gt; |&gt; Reply by A to above reply by B date: 02/01/2025 &gt; |&gt; Reply by C to above reply by B date: 03/01/2025 &gt; &gt; |&gt; Reply by B to above reply by C date: 05/01/2025 |&gt; Reply by C to original date: 02/01/2025 |&gt; Reply by D to original date: 04/01/2025 Person 'A' - Initial email to several people. date: 25/12/2024 - Sort by Date Descending is on this Email </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
