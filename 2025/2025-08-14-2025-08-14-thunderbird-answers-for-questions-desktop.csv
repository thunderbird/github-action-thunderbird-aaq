Mail stored on yahoo servers typically will want app generated passwords. Such as Rogers or AOL. </p><p>Any password you recreate/modify or any app generated password you create will then need to be updated in Thunderbird.  If you need to locate the current stored password then david has already offered info - if you need a bit more help then please tell us. Explain where you get to and where you get stuck. Are you attempting to access the stored passwords in Thunderbird but get stuck because it asks for a password just to see the stored passwords? If yes: Do you get a small window appear which says 'Windows Security' at the top and it wants a password? If yes: When you start up computer and it asks you to logon to computer user account - that is the password it is looking for. </p><p><br> When you click on 'Get Messages' are you getting an error message&nbsp;?
