The IMAP account shows all messages that are on the server, whereas the POP account normally downloads new messages and then deletes from server. Those two accounts will never be in sync.  - the POP account for franklin is named 'generic' but you can overtype the name to say whatever you want.  - those server specifications are part of what distinguishes POP from IMAP. don't change them  So, decide what you want the end result to be and we can proceed from there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What is a ""server notification""?  My best guess is that it is the website telling my computer that the website has new messages, and thus inviting my computer to institute a download.  Is that accurate?  And if so, what use is the ""Check for new messages every ____ minutes"" entry? </p><p>I see that the POP Server Settings has entries for ""Leave messages on server"" with followup entries for how long; whereas the IMAP Server Settings does not.   I also see that under Message Storage, the ""Local Directory""s for POP and IMAC are different.

IMAP is a good setup, but you need to always remember that, even if you see messages on your PC, they are subordinate to the server. Delete and it's gone. That is, your 'backup' is the server. If you want to save messages locally, you need to provide extra steps. This isn't a problem, as that hasn't been an issue for you to-date.   </p><p>- switching to IMAP can be as simple as deleting the POP account. But before doing that, evaluate if there are messages in the POP account that are NOT on the IMAP account (typically old messages that are no longer online) and what you want to do with them. My suggestion is to create a folder in Local Folders and name it something such as OLPfranklinmail and COPY the messages there prior to deleting the POP account. Think this through so that you don't lose important old messages forever. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
