I have a Dell Precision 7720 laptop running Thunderbird under Windows 11 64 bit Pro.  So far I have been unable to export the Outlook.pst file from the M6700 and import it into the 7720.  I have tried to find a free version of a pst to eml converter, but the free (or trial) versions only seem to convert a few files in each folder.  So assuming pst to eml conversion is the first step, I need recommendations for reliable but reasonably priced conversion utilities so that I can export the files from Outlook 2007. </p><p>I have tried to import converted eml files into Thunderbird, but the Thunderbird import software seems to be looking mainly for a profile which I don't know where to find.  And besides, it appears that Thunderbird is designed to do the export/import operations on the same computer, not two computers as in my case.  Anyway, I get an error no matter what I try.  If someone has insight into these various steps, I would greatly appreciate some help.  Thanks! </p><p>Regards, Dave </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",dw01
