I have a Dell Precision 7720 laptop running Thunderbird under Windows 11 64 bit Pro.  So far I have been unable to export the Outlook.pst file from the M6700 and import it into the 7720.  I have tried to find a free version of a pst to eml converter, but the free (or trial) versions only seem to convert a few files in each folder.  So assuming pst to eml conversion is the first step, I need recommendations for reliable but reasonably priced conversion utilities so that I can export the files from Outlook 2007. </p><p>I have tried to import converted eml files into Thunderbird, but the Thunderbird import software seems to be looking mainly for a profile which I don't know where to find.  And besides, it appears that Thunderbird is designed to do the export/import operations on the same computer, not two computers as in my case.  Anyway, I get an error no matter what I try.  If someone has insight into these various steps, I would greatly appreciate some help.  Thanks! </p><p>Regards, Dave </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",dw01

I have been unable to solve the problem of needing to sign in to Thunderbird using Google. I have gotten myself into some trouble, and almost got scammed by trying to get help from on line providers to accomplish this.  Some Dell technicians have the suspicion that my version of Thunderbird may be corrupted.  I  am going to take my Dell desktop to a computer shop tomorrow.  I am hoping they will install a new form of Thunderbird onto an external computer, and then let me try to log in to Thunderbird on that version.  If that works, then it will be an indication that the version I have been using on my Dell desktop is corrupted.  The plan in that case would be to have the technician transfer all my Thunderbird data to the new version of T-bird on the external computer. Then he could install a new, fresh version of T-bird on my computer.  Finally, he could attempt to return all my Thunderbird data from the external computer back onto the new version of T-bird on my computer.  I am afraid that my Local Folders and their contents will not be transferred back to Thunderbird on my computer.  I'm afraid that all my local folders will be lost.  I'm not sure whether the technician will have to make a Thunderbird-Profile_back up before he removes the Thunderbird data from my computer.  We'll see. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1779414;,cyanicka46

This is quite a complicated procedure .. one should be able to save attachments directly from Thunderbird, without opening it. </p><p>What is the reason for this problem?
