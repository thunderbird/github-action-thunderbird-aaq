I have tried to find a free version of a pst to eml converter, but the free (or trial) versions only seem to convert a few files in each folder.

And besides, it appears that Thunderbird is designed to do the export/import operations on the same computer, not two computers as in my case.  Anyway, I get an error no matter what I try.

I am hoping they will install a new form of Thunderbird onto an external computer, and then let me try to log in to Thunderbird on that version.  If that works, then it will be an indication that the version I have been using on my Dell desktop is corrupted.  The plan in that case would be to have the technician transfer all my Thunderbird data to the new version of T-bird on the external computer. Then he could install a new, fresh version of T-bird on my computer.  Finally, he could attempt to return all my Thunderbird data from the external computer back onto the new version of T-bird on my computer.  I am afraid that my Local Folders and their contents will not be transferred back to Thunderbird on my computer.  I'm afraid that all my local folders will be lost.
