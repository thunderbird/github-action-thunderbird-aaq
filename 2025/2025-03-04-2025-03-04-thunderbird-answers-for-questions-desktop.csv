This is because gmail simply applied the 'Inbox' label to the email which auto had the 'Sent' label applied. This means same email is visible in 2 locations. Be aware - if you delete either and it gets put into the 'Trash' then both get deleted. So if you want to delete one then use the 'Shift+Del' keys and gmail will only remove the appropriate label. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
