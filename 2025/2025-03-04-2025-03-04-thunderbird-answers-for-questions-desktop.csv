This is because gmail simply applied the 'Inbox' label to the email which auto had the 'Sent' label applied. This means same email is visible in 2 locations. Be aware - if you delete either and it gets put into the 'Trash' then both get deleted.

La soluzione proposta funziona ma non risolve completamente perchè casualmente si ripresenta lo stesso problema di ricezione/invio. Ci si accorge del problema magari dopo ore solo perchè non arrivano più le mail. Inoltre sulle ultime versioni di thunderbird la finestra di acquisizione del certificato non è più in popup ma compare per qualche secondo una finestrella di avviso nell'angolo in basso a destra che poi sparisce. Se vengono disattivate le notifiche di windows questa finestra non compare nemmeno. </p>,pettorusso,false,0,0

Thunderbird is just your agent. In an attempt to clear the setup, do this:  - check that your password works properly when logging on via website. That's just a sanity check.  - in thunderbird, click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security - click saved passwords and then show passwords - now, highlight the rows for the account (normally two) and delete them. This removes whatever passwords were stored.  - close and restart thunderbird and try again with the right password.  - if that does not work, it may be that your email provider requires an 'app' password instead of the normal password when using a PC email client. Gmail is an example of this. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
