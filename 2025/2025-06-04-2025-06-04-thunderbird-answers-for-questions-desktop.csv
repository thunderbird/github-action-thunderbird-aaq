I have executed the first part of your instructions, copying my Thunderbird archive to my data drive, and to my backup drive as well, but I ran into trouble when I restarted Thunderbird and clicked account settings and copies&amp;folders as you instructed. I was not given the option to change the location for the archive to my  new location. Under ""Message Archives"" my choices are ""Archives"" Folde on:"" and ""Other"". On ""Archives"" Folder it's a choice between SBC (which is no longer an active account), Local Folders, or Blogs and News Feeds. I don't seem to be able to specify my D drive.  The ""Other"" alternative is 'Archives on Local Folders"", which has a dropdown menu including ""SBC"", ""Local Folders"" and ""Blogs &amp; News"".  Below this dropdown menu I see ""Archive options"" but that's just choices about how the folders should be organized. </p><p>I'm wondering if I have a different version of Thunderbird than the one you were referring to. I hope I have given you enough information - I feel like I'm very, very close to solving a major problem. Hoping you can help!  Thanks so much! </p>",gailpvenable,false,0,0

I do apologize for the oversight. If still a desirable strategy, copy all Local Folders (again, with windows file explorer and thunderbird not running), and then click account settings, click to Local Folders, and then change location pointer to the external drive. thunderbird will restart, and at that time you can select to store archives in Local Folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Some like masses of colour all over the place and others do not.  Adding colour is not as simple as it seems because we all like something different. But the biggest problem is that many people suffer from colour blindness or poor eyesight and that also takes various forms. So the developers have to come up with a design that is user inclusive.   </p><p>In 'Add-ons and Themes',  Select 'Themes' The defaults are a 'Light' version, a 'Dark version and a 'System theme' version. </p><p>The 'System theme' will use some elements from whatever you have set up on computer. for example - In 'Windows OS' in computer 'Settings' &gt; 'Personalisation' &gt; 'Colours' under 'Choose your colour' and select 'Custom' This allows you to choose a 'Light' or 'Dark' default app mode. </p><p>you can also eg: 'Choose your accent colour' - I have selected 'Seafoam teal' I have also selected the checkbox 'Titlebars and window borders'. So in Thunderbird using 'system theme', the title bar, windows borders, text box borders, icon highlights, blue buttons, and a few other options now use the 'Seafoam teal' colour. Image below as example. </p><p>If you need to use 'High contrast settings' or set up your own colourisation for the computer desktop then this can also effect what you see in Thunderbird. I've just quickly done a 'sandy' high contrast theme - see image below -  it's not perfect as it's a fast knock up but it shows what sort of colourisation can be done just using computer settings. </p><p>This means some alterations can be fully controlled by your customising choices, so allowing you to add a little colour to some elements. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If there is an issue with any theme, it is not for Thunderbird to fix and you would need to inform the author about the problem. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

David has told you before: </p><p><em>Please also  consider that copied content retains any style settings it had and those are imparted into the email. To ensure that the formatting is done by Thunderbird, first paste into a text editor, such as Notepad, and then copy from there to Thunderbird.</em> </p><p>And Matt has explained: </p><p><em>Fundamentally you have to look at the source of your text before you even think about complaining.  Microsoft Word and other application software generally classed as ""Word processors"" are designed to place marks on paper. They are mostly very good with old fashioned typography.  Not so much with modern copy and paste as the capability of the destination is unknown. </em> </p><p><em>A good example of that is when you paste from Microsoft Word.  I was playing with the process for another support topic just a couple of days ago. Pasting from word a small sentence ""Some  silly text"" from word to Thunderbird with a hyperlink under silly.  In plain text terms 16 characters was placed on the system clipboard by word for me to paste.  However Thunderbird if it has a choice will paste formatted HTML text.  Sure enough word had placed the information on the clipboard also as HTML.   A block of code 39,633 character long was what was offered.  Including extensive cascading style sheets that were not even used.  So just because there is an issue in Thunderbird the source might not be Thunderbird.</em> </p><p><em>Just to be sort of complete,  word also placed rich text formatted text, plain text,  an enhanced meta file image of the text and a binary object that could be used for object linking and embedding among others.  Pressing copy is an apparently  simple function,  but what happens under the hood is complex and can involve a lot of moving parts.</em> </p><p>Matt and David know what they are talking about. </p><p>No, this forum is not an e-mail environment. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

I check the error logs and found the gmail account settings complained that it could not find the smtp configuration for the server. 3. I went into config editor and found the smtp server id was linked to another smtp configuration. I changed it back to the right account id number (after i could not get it to do it via the normal account settings manager, must be a bug there too) 4. I had to restart thunderbird several times before settings were retained properly. 6. It then failed with auth, and found the server had reset to normal password sending, changed that back to Oauth2 and restarted TB. 5. I went back into the draft and now re-opened every message for that server and it then sent out the mail successfully. </p>",joyinhealth1,false,0,0
