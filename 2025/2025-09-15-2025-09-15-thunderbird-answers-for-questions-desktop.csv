In general I think Thunderbird is one of the better email clients for Gmail when used with a new account or for current emails only. However, it is not suited for the off-line Gmail back up / archive use case. Besides two features above (Move To: and Archive) that don't work with Gmail, I also tried a more laborsome multi-step process of first Copy To: (local folders), Delete from on-line folders within Thunderbird UI, and then empty Trash. This was only partially successful until two actions. First I inadvertently rushed and hit Delete before doing Copy on a bunch of emails and had to fish for them in the Trash and put them back. Secondly after a small number of messages Thunderbird refused to copy more emails from on-line Sent folder to the local folder equivalent. There was no error. It simply wouldn't create selected messages in local folder. I realized it too late after deleting a bunch of Sent mail thinking it was already copied. I am not sure why this happened - maybe there's something special about Sent emails that makes them different from received emails and screws up Thunderbird by copying them into a local folder. Or maybe it is the sheer size of my bloated on-line gmail that Thunderbird 140.2 on Ubuntu is not calibrated to retrieve efficiently. Either way I ended up with a messed up on-line gmail after trial and error with the local Thunderbird client, including duplicated messages from trying to undo relocation of messages that were moved from folders but not deleted and then messages deleted while not actually copied locally, and see no point of trying to continue with Thunderbird. I have previously downloaded my Google data, including gmail, using Google Takeout, so in theory I have my gmail backed up before the Thunderbird experiment. My conclusion is that I will be deleting Thunderbird locally and just keeping my Google Takeout copy. I will then be deleting just enough of the oldest messages in live on-line Gmail directly from All Mail folder to make enough room to keep the account workable. Then at some point in the future I will do another Takeout and this is how I will have my gmail ""sort of"" backed up on on-going basis. I have not achieved my goal to be able to bring organized gmails by folder/label for convenient browsing off-line. So I am just left with the ""blob"" of Takeout data that I can theoretically use, if I really really really need to find something in the old messages. This is not ideal, but I haven't found any better way that is reliable and not very time consuming, alas. </p>",gupetrov,false,0,0

You Unsubscribe from all folders, you turn off  ""Keep messages in all folders for this account on this computer"" in the Sync Settings, and change the Syncing age of messages to say 1 day, it still will download ALL headers, Thousands. I just had 80,000 headers (email headers) downloaded, luckily it was only about 200MB of space.  </p><p>2: You can stop the full emails from download by doing what I show in the screenshot attached.

So in effect you end up with a complete duplicate of everything. However, you can choose to only download headers for the 'All Mail' folder which would save a load of space on computer.

Any folder not selected will only download headers. </p><p>If you select 'Synchronise the most recent eg: 60 days' This means for any folder under 'Advanced' which you selected to download full copies, you can control which emails get fully downloaded or only headers downloaded.  Any folder in 'Advanced' which is not selected to download full copies will only download headers, so this synchronise option does not apply. </p><p>The result is you will see all emails listed in the 'Message List' as the index file only needs headers to do this. However, the most recent  eg: 60 days of emails will have emails fully downloaded and stored in mbox files. This is particulary helpful for those who have more limited space.  </p><p>Important: - To help maintain this, you will need to manually compact that folder on a regular basis so it can do basic housekeeping to remove the stored data older than 60 days, but not headers of emails older than 60 days. How frequently you compact the folder depends upon how many emails you download, but you may want to do it at least once a week to remove the excess and clean up files. </p><p>This means any email in list that only has headers downloaded can still be selected and the email will get downloaded to a temp folder to faciliate viewing. </p> <hr> <p>If by any chance you have a folder (not the 'All Mail' folder)  which contains thousands of emails, but you only want to download the last years worth. </p><p>You can do one of these options. Option 1: Either you can choose to Only remove the 'label' which removes emails from folder eg: Inbox, but does not remove it from  'All Mail'. How to only remove a label: Either: use the keyboard keys 'Shift'+'Del'  = Delete message bypassing trash (no Undo!) to remove the label only. This maybe a prefered option as it means you still have the main 'delete' option set up to move to Trash which gmail will auto empty and also comlpetely delete email off server. OR  alter the Account Settings &gt; Server Settings to 'Just mark it as deleted' this puts a strikethrough the email in list and I've discovered gmail auto removes the 'label', so this removes email from list upon synchronising with server, but leaves email in 'All Mail'. </p><p><br> Option 2: Lets pretend you want to get loads of emails currently in 'Inbox' into another folder which you do not want to see, but would like easy access if required. Create a folder - let's call it' Old Inbox' Move loads of emails from 'Inbox' into 'Old Inbox' folder Then unsubscribe from seeing 'Old Inbox' folder Compact the Inbox folder. </p><p>You could if required Logon to gmail webmail and make sure the 'Old Inbox'  label/folder has the 'Show in Imap' unchecked. </p> <hr> <p>Regarding seeing unsubscribed folders in Folder PAne.

So that's probably why it's downloading all headers ever, from the inbox folder. </strong> </p><p>Correct, this is an imap mail account.  Each imap folder will synchronise with gmail label/folder with same name on server.  It will display whatever is that folder. Imap accounts can only display whatever is on the server. It is in effect a mirror copy of what you see on server. If you delete or move an email in an imap account folder, when it synchronsies with server the server is updated and also vis versa. If you logon to webmail account and delete or move emails, then when you look in Thunderbird, it will auto update to show what is currently on server.  If you have a phone that uses imap to sync with server and it deletes an email, the server gets updates and then Thunderbird on computer gets updated, so everything is all the same no matter what method you use to see emails. </p><p>I did have someone who logged onto webmail and deleted a load of emails to increase the available server quota and then they were shocked to discover all those emails were suddenly deleted from their imap folders.  You should not consider anything in an imap account folder as truelly independent of server because everything synchronises. If you need to keep copies of emails, but also need to create space on server, then you should get 'Copies' of emails in imap folder and put them into a suitable folder located in 'Local Folders'. I say COPY because if something goes wrong you can redo and nothing is lost. Once you have good copies you can delete off server. please note - you do need to have download full copies in the first place otherwise you are just copying headers.

See screenshot attached </blockquote> <p>That means- for that particular gmail email address/account, only your Drafts folder downloads full copies. All other folders will only download headers.  Is this correct? - It depends upon what you want to achieve. </p><p>Do you want to download full copies of all emails in all folders or only some or none? Do you have very limited available space on C: drive and need to solve that problem? Do you need to be able to still read emails if you lose internet connectivity? Do you want to create a backup of all your profile data including emails that is totally independent of the server? Do you want to create copies of very important emails into your 'Local Folders' account? </p><p>Download full copies means if you go offline or lose internet temporarilly, you can still continue to read emails you have already downloaded. Download only headers means without connection to server (if no internet) you will not be able to download on demand so will not be able to see any email content. </p><p>You could choose to download full copies for certain folder but not others eg: Download full copies for 'Inbox', but only headers for 'Spam' </p><p>Download full copies of all emails means you can create a backup of profile and that will backup all profiles, all accounts, all emails, all address books, calendar etc etc.  If you do not download full copies of emails, then backing up profile will only backup headers which is not much good if you cannot see any email content.  </p><p>If space is problem on C:Drive then one course of action is to restrict what is downloaded. If you only download headers then as nothing is being stored locally other than headers, it means it uses less space on computer.  If you select folders to download full copies then you can use the option 'synchronise the most recent' eg: 30 days.  That will download full copies of only the most recent 30 days of emails  and download only headers of anything older.  Please note that would only apply to any folder you selected to download full copies. But you will need to compact those folders on a regular basis to maintain that storage restriction and keep files tidy. </p><p>You have quite a choice of options in an imap account, but you would need to consider what you want to achieve and what you expect from Thunderbird in order to make those choices. I can offer more tailored advise if I know what it is you need from Thunderbird. </p> <blockquote> 4) <strong>Options are to remove the label so it's only stored in 'All Mail' or put into another folder which you then unsubscribe from seeing.

Or you can select emails and use 'Shift+Del keys on keyboard to delete by-passing the Trash. Gmail sees this as 'remove the label' and store in 'All Mail'. Or you can create another folder - move aload of emails into it then unsubscribe from seeing that folder'</strong>     If I unsubscribed from all the folders, except the Archive one,  then would I not get new emails?  </blockquote> <p>Correct - but imap accounts are not designed to work that way. Imap accounts are designed to show you a mirror copy of whatever is on server. When you create an email there is a synchronisation required with server, so you need to have folders subscribed.  You would also find in order to function you would need to see a minimum of the default folders. The default folders being 'Inbox', 'Drafts', 'Sent', 'Spam' and 'Trash' (some people see 'Bin' instead of 'Trash) In addition, I would also add the archives folder whatever you call it - I called mine 'OldStore' </p> <blockquote> I was just trying to figure out a way to not download thousands of headers or emails and still get new emails. Not wishing to archive anything nor really understand archiving thing. For instance, I have another email client called FairEmail, it uses imap also. And only shows 7 days (rolling) of emails. Never downloads everything, not even headers. Seems to just be a TB behavior </blockquote> <p>If you do not want to download any headers for a set of emails that are old: Create a new imap folder Move a load of emails into that folder. Then unsubscribe from seeing that folder Logon to gmail and locate the folder you created - uncheck 'Show in imap'. Then emails are stored on server should you really need them, but as they no longer exist in the folders you are subscribed to see, they will not get downloaded at all. Please remember to compact folders after you have moved a load of emails out of them. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
