Email providers keep pushing for more security, and that makes the setup sometimes problematic. Even so, I'll wade in and try to assist.&nbsp;:)  I understand you have gone to settings&gt;Privacy&amp;security and deleted the rows for the account. If not, then do so now.  Also, please post screenshots of incoming and outgoing server settings so persons here can see the details.  Please also post the complete text of error message. Thanks. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

BUT, I experiment and survive.&nbsp;:) The important addressbooks are abook.sqlite and history.sqlite. From my experience, you can delete all the others (when thunderbird is not running) and the appropriate ones will be recreated when you restart thunderbird. That's been my experience and I just did it prior to writing this response. Also, if you still have abook.mab or history.mab, they are old and can be deleted </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I was thinking along the same lines, just didn't want to risk corrupting Thunderbird by blindly going ahead, just in case. I do have daily backups, but it's a lot less stressful if you can be fairly certain what you are doing is not going to cause problems. Appreciate the helpful reply. </p>",TonyPayneUK,false,0,0

I have variable width set, but I also have Segoe set as font and that is what I see in compose window.  </p><p><br>   Okay, this may sound strange, but here is the real way to set fonts on Thunderbird. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <ol><li>  in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  </li><li>  then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  </li><li>  select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  </li><li>  select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. </li><li> if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) </li><li> In settings&gt;composition, set Sending Format to 'automatic' (just my preference, not required) </li></ol> <p>NOTE: if font size is still too small, try a larger number, such as 20. the numbers in thunderbird are pixels, not points. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
