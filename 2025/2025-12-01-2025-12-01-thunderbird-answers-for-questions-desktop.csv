When you opt to cover our payment transaction costs, you're covering both our payment processing and donation platform fees. The costs associated with our robust online donation system allows us to continue scaling sustainably as our supporter-base grows. Our donation platform and payment processor partners reduce internal costs associated with maintaining our own system from scratch. Our partners ensure we can accept a wide range of currencies/payment methods and remain PCI compliant in all of the countries that we accept gifts from. The transaction costs you may choose to cover are based on an estimate of our overall costs. Due to many factors actual costs may fluctuate.</blockquote> <blockquote>Are there additional fees added to my donation?  We do not collect any additional fees or taxes. When you donate in your local currency you are not charged a conversion fee by your credit card. You can choose to also cover the payment processing transaction costs. This is completely voluntary and you may opt in or out using the checkbox on our donation form. Our organization is based in the United States. We encourage donors to research any additional external taxes or fees that may be applied by regulators such as your bank or tax authority.</blockquote>",James,false,0,0

BUT, I experiment and survive.&nbsp;:) The important addressbooks are abook.sqlite and history.sqlite. From my experience, you can delete all the others (when thunderbird is not running) and the appropriate ones will be recreated when you restart thunderbird. That's been my experience and I just did it prior to writing this response. Also, if you still have abook.mab or history.mab, they are old and can be deleted </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I was thinking along the same lines, just didn't want to risk corrupting Thunderbird by blindly going ahead, just in case. I do have daily backups, but it's a lot less stressful if you can be fairly certain what you are doing is not going to cause problems. Appreciate the helpful reply. </p>",TonyPayneUK,false,0,0
