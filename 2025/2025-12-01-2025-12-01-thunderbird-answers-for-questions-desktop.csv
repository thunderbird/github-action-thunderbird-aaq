I was thinking along the same lines, just didn't want to risk corrupting Thunderbird by blindly going ahead, just in case.

Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  </li><li>  select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  </li><li>  select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. </li><li> if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) </li><li> In settings&gt;composition, set Sending Format to 'automatic' (just my preference, not required) </li></ol> <p>NOTE: if font size is still too small, try a larger number, such as 20. the numbers in thunderbird are pixels, not points. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You must establish an account with a new e-mail service provider and set up that account in Thunderbird. Yes, you will have to change your address because you will be using a new service provider. </p><p>My suggestion: </p> <ol><li> Set up all your Comcast accounts in Thunderbird. </li><li> Right click on each account name in the folder pane, then select ""Subscribe"", and make sure that Thunderbird is subscribing to all your folders in all accounts. </li><li> Retrieve all your messages in all your accounts. </li><li> Create local folders in Thunderbird for storing your Comcast mail. </li><li> Copy (don't move) messages from the Comcast folders to your local folders. </li><li> Back up your Thunderbird profile. </li></ol> <p>Then all your Comcast mail will be saved in two locations, and you can leave Comcast any time you want. </p><p>I believe that you can do all these things in Outlook and not even switch to Thunderbird. I am not certain because I do not use Outlook. </p><p>One thing that could go wrong: If you have zillions of messages in any one folder, the process may fail (according to users' reports). It will certainly take some time. </p><p>Another approach, more appropriate if you have zillions of messages, is to export messages from Comcast and import them into an e-mail client such as Outlook or Thunderbird. If you use this approach, export your messages in mbox format. This information is on the Web: </p><p>1. Set up your new email account: Before you start the transfer process, make sure you have created a new email account with the provider of your choice. Ensure that you have the login credentials ready. </p><p>2. Export your Comcast emails: Log in to your Comcast email account and navigate to the settings or options menu. Look for the “Export” or “Backup” feature. Click on it to start the export process. Choose the option to export your emails in a standard format such as PST or MBOX. </p><p>3. Save the exported file: After the export process is complete, you will be prompted to choose a location to save the exported file. Select a location on your computer or an external storage device where you can easily locate it later. </p><p>4. Import the emails to your new account: Once the export is done, log in to your new email account. Look for the option to import or upload emails. Click on it and select the exported file from your computer or external storage. Follow the instructions provided by the email client or service to complete the import process. </p><p>5. Verify the transfer: After importing the emails, thoroughly check your new account to ensure that all your Comcast emails have been successfully transferred. Pay special attention to any folders or labels previously created in your Comcast account to ensure they have been properly replicated. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
