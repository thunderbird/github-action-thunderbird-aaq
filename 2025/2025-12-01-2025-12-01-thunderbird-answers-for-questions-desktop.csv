Therefore I don't think size is the problem here. I'm going to ask Syscurve Support if they can explain why their conversion does not work on Thunderbird (v145).

You must establish an account with a new e-mail service provider and set up that account in Thunderbird.

I am not certain because I do not use Outlook. </p><p>One thing that could go wrong: If you have zillions of messages in any one folder, the process may fail (according to users' reports). It will certainly take some time. </p><p>Another approach, more appropriate if you have zillions of messages, is to export messages from Comcast and import them into an e-mail client such as Outlook or Thunderbird. If you use this approach, export your messages in mbox format. This information is on the Web: </p><p>1. Set up your new email account: Before you start the transfer process, make sure you have created a new email account with the provider of your choice. Ensure that you have the login credentials ready. </p><p>2. Export your Comcast emails: Log in to your Comcast email account and navigate to the settings or options menu. Look for the “Export” or “Backup” feature. Click on it to start the export process. Choose the option to export your emails in a standard format such as PST or MBOX. </p><p>3. Save the exported file: After the export process is complete, you will be prompted to choose a location to save the exported file. Select a location on your computer or an external storage device where you can easily locate it later. </p><p>4. Import the emails to your new account: Once the export is done, log in to your new email account. Look for the option to import or upload emails. Click on it and select the exported file from your computer or external storage. Follow the instructions provided by the email client or service to complete the import process. </p><p>5. Verify the transfer: After importing the emails, thoroughly check your new account to ensure that all your Comcast emails have been successfully transferred. Pay special attention to any folders or labels previously created in your Comcast account to ensure they have been properly replicated. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

There are no files with the extension <strong>mbox</strong> in the profile.  When using Thunderbird's standard mail store format ""File per folder (mbox)"" it doesn't mean that all those message files would have an extension .mbox. It's the contrary, all those mbox message files have <strong>no</strong> extension,  they are just <strong>text files</strong> containing the messages of a folder in Thunderbird and having the same name as the folder. An <strong>Inbox</strong> folder with all its messages is represented in the profile by an <strong>Inbox</strong> text file, the Sent folder with its messages will be a Sent file in the profile. If you have a folder ""Travel"" in Thunderbird, there should be a file ""Travel"" in the profile. ""Marketing Analytics"" (without extension) also seems to be a mbox file. These are all called mbox files and mbox also is the term for this type of mail store format. </p><p><em>(b) how to do things via 'one procedure' so that all folders that have this issue of not at all or partially showing sub-folders are fixed simultaneously (and not just 'Helsinki' folder).</em> Since all or most of your mbox files have disappeared you would have recreate all of them with a text editor, one after the other, maybe hundreds of them.

I have seen this several times in another forum when entire folder hierarchies were destroyed because a cleaning tool had removed all 0 kB files. Yet zero kB mbox files in combination with the .sbd folders of the same name are essential for Thunderbird to ""ciment"" folder hierarchies and display the contents of folders with subfolders. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

THANKS&nbsp;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </blockquote> <p>This is an error warning concerning copying (?) a .wdseml file of 0 kB size. All I know is that the Windows search, if activated in Thunderbird, creates a .mozmsgs folder for each indexed folder, and those .mozmsgs folders contain .wdseml files - one file for each indexed message. It is interesting that this warning concerns a file with a 0 kB size (!!) even if in this case it is not an empty mbox file.

Let me try with more time to digest it better tomorrow - yet just on the last point: so, I just tried again (yesterday) to re-do what I did three weeks back, which was to copy the entire profiles folder from the cloud (onedrive) to an empty folder on C, and yes there is an error (""This is an error warning concerning copying (?) a .wdseml file of 0 kB size."") that would continue presumably hundreds of times if I would not tell the system 'do the same for all similar'; and so I did actually say yes, just do the same ... and that's why I presume that all empty mbox files could be a 'victim' of this copying process ... yet I simply don't know what else to do&nbsp;;-) THANKS. </p>",bostein67,false,0,0

(very few folk do because Thunderbird offers three different approaches to searching mail) If you do not, disable the setting to allow windows search for search your mail.  Is is a very space wasting option that simply complicates backup needlessly.  Everything in those Mozmsg folders, including the folders themselves, exists solely to support that option to allow windows search.  Around a decade ago I disabled the search option and manually deleted the 100,000 odd files that Thunderbird maintained to support the option (it does not clean it's own nest when you disable the option), so Thunderbird now updates three files when I get a new mail, not update three and create one.  Something with a rather high overhead for those with antivirus products monitoring and usually slowing all of those actions. </p><p>Next you are already having errors regarding wdseml files.  Like the mozmsgs folders that contain them, they serve no purpose at all except to support the windows search option.  The are completely unnecessary in the migration of your email from one machine to another. </p><p>I have struggled for a long time trying to explain Thunderbird offline storage,  it is both simple and complex in turns.  The following image using the archive folder on local folders is the closest I have come to making it clear.  At least I think it is clear.  Please let me know if it is clear as mud. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-12-06-15-48-18-1e621d.png""> </p><p>I just looked through all of the images you have posted and I saw not a single image containing the files necessary to populate a Thunderbird folder with emails.  I think you are equating file system folders with Thunderbird folders.   As I tried to explain earlier there is only a slight similarity and mozeml files and mozmsg folders are totally irrelevant.  Thunderbird creates them for the sole purpose of supporting windows search and in the case of the mozeml file they are truncated to 40kb....  anything after that in the text layout of the transmitted email is not there, and that could cut off in the middle of the first image if the message is just a collection of images and no real text. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Can you look up whether in your Local Folders on OneDrive the zero kB files without extension are visible or not? I have stored my Local Folders in Apple's iCloud and there the empty (zero kB) mbox files are visible (see image). And when I copy the Local Folders folder from iCloud to my desktop, those empty mbox files are getting copied, too. </p><p>IMHO, unless you find an intact profile backup copy somewhere,  the only way to restore your Local Folders hierarchy in order to display again all folders, sub-folders and messages in Thunderbird would be to manually recreate all those missing mbox files in a text editor such as Notepad. It would be a monster task and I don't know a way to automatise it. </p><p>I can create at least two of those empty files per minute in my text editor, or about 100 per hour. You wouldn't need to type each new file name: i.e. copy <em>negotiations</em> from your the <strong>negotiations</strong>.sbd folder, paste it as the name of your text file, save it, delete the suffix .txt and move the newly created mbox file in the HELSINKI.sbd folder </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
