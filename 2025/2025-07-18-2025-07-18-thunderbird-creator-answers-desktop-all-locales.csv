Multiple email accounts on various servers, all POP3. </p><p>For the last several months (not sure when it started, but I first took a screenshot in October 2024, so perhaps that was the first time), after each time I reboot my PC, the first time I send an email using one particular account will trigger a complaint about a bad certificate, which is probably caused by Avast getting in the middle of the process. Clicking ""View..."" opens a tab with certificate information. I'm attaching screenshots. </p><p>I assume my other accounts also had a similar complaint when they were first used, but it has been a long time since I added a new account and they are all quiet now. But on this account, I get it the first time I send mail (normally a reply to someone else - this is not my default account for new messages) after each reboot. When I click ""Confirm Security Exception"" with the ""Permanently store this exception"" checkbox checked, the next thing I get is ""Send Message Error"" (see the third screenshot), then I click OK, and then I can hit ""Send"" again and the message is sent with no complaints. Then I can also send future messages with no complaints until the next time I reboot. (I don't reboot often - normally just when Windows needs to do an update.) This is the only account on Dreamhost (others are InMotion or Google), but other than that, there is nothing special about it, as far as I know. Why is it forgetting my ""permanent"" exception? Is there a setting somewhere that I should look for? </p><p>I just now tried following the instructions on this page: <a href=""https://support.avast.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-invalid-antivirus-email-certificate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.avast.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-invalid-antivirus-email-certificate</a> But it says, ""This certificate is already installed as a certificate authority."" Perhaps that is because I have already gone through the process for this reboot cycle, but if TB needs a new Avast certificate or exception each time I reboot (due to something changing in Avast, perhaps), I'd think the first email I send through any server would ask for the exception, but it's never any other account - just this one Dreamhost one. Fortunately it's just an inconvenience, not a showstopping problem, but it would be nice to solve it eventually. </p>",thunderbird;security;,thunderbird,security,en-US,1750010;1750151;1750189;,osakawebbie

On July 18th, I downloaded the release version of Thunderbird and installed that (140.0.1 - no esr).  This did not resolve the problem.  Troubleshooting info now shows 140.0.1 - no esr as the current version, but the update history does not show that upgrade/downgrade in the list, so I'm not sure it happened. </p><p>Things I have tried: Windows safe mode Thunderbird safe mode Clear caches Removed several mail accounts from Thunderbird </p><p>Below is system info from Thunderbird troubleshooting page. </p><p><br> </p><pre> Application Basics </pre> <pre>   Name: Thunderbird    Version: 140.0.1    Build ID: 20250709044702    Distribution ID: </pre> <pre>   Update Channel: release    User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:140.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/140.0.1    OS: Windows_NT 10.0 26100    OS Theme: </pre> <pre>   Launcher Process: Enabled    Multiprocess Windows: 0/0    Fission Windows: 0/0              Enabled by default    Remote Processes: 3    Enterprise Policies: Inactive    Google Location Service Key: Missing    Google Safebrowsing Key: Missing    Mozilla Location Service Key: Missing    Safe Mode: false    Memory Size (RAM): 31.7 GB    Disk Space Available: 1,044 GB </pre> <pre> Mail and News Accounts    account1:      INCOMING: account1, , (none) Local Folders, plain, passwordCleartext </pre> <pre>   account5:      INCOMING: account5, , (rss) Feeds, plain, passwordCleartext </pre> <pre>   account20:      INCOMING: account20, , (imap) <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com:993</a>, 3, OAuth2      OUTGOING: , <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com:465</a>, 3, OAuth2, true </pre> <pre>   account21:      INCOMING: account21, , (imap) <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com:993</a>, 3, OAuth2      OUTGOING: , <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com:465</a>, 3, OAuth2, true </pre> <pre>   account22:      INCOMING: account22, , (imap) <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net:993</a>, 3, passwordCleartext      OUTGOING: , <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net:465</a>, 3, passwordCleartext, true </pre> <pre>   account23:      INCOMING: account23, , (imap) <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com:993</a>, 3, OAuth2      OUTGOING: , <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com:465</a>, 3, passwordCleartext, true </pre> <pre>   account28:      INCOMING: account28, , (imap) <a href=""http://imap.aol.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.aol.com:993</a>, 3, OAuth2      OUTGOING: , <a href=""http://smtp.aol.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.aol.com:465</a>, 3, OAuth2, true </pre> <pre>   account29:      INCOMING: account29, , (owl) <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com:443"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com:443</a>, 3, OAuth2      OUTGOING: , <a href=""http://smtp.aol.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.aol.com:465</a>, 3, OAuth2, true </pre> <pre>   account30:      INCOMING: account30, , (rss) Feeds-2, plain, passwordCleartext </pre> <pre> Libraries </pre> <pre>     Library      Status      Expected minimum version      Version in use      Path </pre> <pre>       RNP (OpenPGP)        OK        0.17.1        0.17.1.MZLA.140.0.1.botan        C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\rnp.dll </pre> <pre>       OTR        Failed to load.

The idea is that when I send a reply, the server could read that header and rewrite the From address accordingly, keeping the alias intact and hiding my real address. </p><p>Unfortunately, I found that Thunderbird strips out custom headers like X-Alias when sending emails, which breaks this solution. </p><p>So I have two main questions: </p><p>1. Is there any way to configure Thunderbird so it preserves specific custom headers (like X-Alias) when sending messages? </p><p>2. Alternatively, is there a better approach to replying from the alias address automatically, without exposing my real one, and without having to manually create identities for each alias? </p><p>I'd really appreciate any tips, suggestions, or insights.
