Multiple email accounts on various servers, all POP3. </p><p>For the last several months (not sure when it started, but I first took a screenshot in October 2024, so perhaps that was the first time), after each time I reboot my PC, the first time I send an email using one particular account will trigger a complaint about a bad certificate, which is probably caused by Avast getting in the middle of the process. Clicking ""View..."" opens a tab with certificate information. I'm attaching screenshots. </p><p>I assume my other accounts also had a similar complaint when they were first used, but it has been a long time since I added a new account and they are all quiet now. But on this account, I get it the first time I send mail (normally a reply to someone else - this is not my default account for new messages) after each reboot. When I click ""Confirm Security Exception"" with the ""Permanently store this exception"" checkbox checked, the next thing I get is ""Send Message Error"" (see the third screenshot), then I click OK, and then I can hit ""Send"" again and the message is sent with no complaints. Then I can also send future messages with no complaints until the next time I reboot. (I don't reboot often - normally just when Windows needs to do an update.) This is the only account on Dreamhost (others are InMotion or Google), but other than that, there is nothing special about it, as far as I know. Why is it forgetting my ""permanent"" exception? Is there a setting somewhere that I should look for? </p><p>I just now tried following the instructions on this page: <a href=""https://support.avast.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-invalid-antivirus-email-certificate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.avast.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-invalid-antivirus-email-certificate</a> But it says, ""This certificate is already installed as a certificate authority."" Perhaps that is because I have already gone through the process for this reboot cycle, but if TB needs a new Avast certificate or exception each time I reboot (due to something changing in Avast, perhaps), I'd think the first email I send through any server would ask for the exception, but it's never any other account - just this one Dreamhost one. Fortunately it's just an inconvenience, not a showstopping problem, but it would be nice to solve it eventually. </p>",thunderbird;security;,thunderbird,security,en-US,1750010;,osakawebbie
