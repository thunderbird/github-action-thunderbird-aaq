The folders are on the server and with my old laptop, I could drag emails from any account to any folder, regardless of which account it was created under. I started trying to do that with a new laptop and it won't let me drag the email. I have to go through the move &gt; search for folder &gt; select folder process. It's a pain in the butt, especially if I have a lot of emails I want to move. Since I could do it on my old laptop, I'm thinking it's some kind of setting that I have on one that I don't have on the other. I just can't figure out what I did differently on the new laptop that it won't let me drag and drop the emails where I want them. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",navoff

Everything seemed fine...until I realized that suddenly TB has NO emails later than 2022! I went in to Gmail to see if I could recover them...but they're all missing there as well. In my business account--also through Gmail, but managed through my domain name--not just my Inbox, but EVERYTHING is gone. It's as if I never existed. </p><p>This is extremely upsetting: I teach and have my own business, and losing all my emails is catastrophic.  </p><p>Can someone please help? </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",joanm48
