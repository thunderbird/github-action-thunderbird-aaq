But, this year it did me in. </p><p>My email, john@jtbcpa.com, was hosted by some no name outfit that was poor.  It took forever for emails to send, and I could not update away messages.. </p><p>I asked my internet guy to move my email from the old profile to gmail.  I was hoping to keep my same profile and email on Thunderbird, without having to change to either Outlook or some other software to run email.     </p><p>So, my internet guy moved the john@jtbcpa.com to Gmail.  However, once he moved the email Gmail, Thunderbird, gave me several problems - as follows. </p><p>1.  No matter how many times we tried to add the new email address to Thunderbird, it could not find the server.   We tried multiple gmail settings.  No go. </p><p>2.   I am not the experienced in updating computers, but I had updated email on Thunderbird many times before.  For both new accounts, and new computers.   It took time, but I made it work.  I could always find the files in the profile folder that I needed to copy and move.  </p><p>However, the new Thunderbird would not allow me to go in and manually alter settings when it was looking for the john@jtbcpa.com account on Gmail.  Thunderbird kept telling me it could not find the account on the server.   And, manual setup was not available on the updated Thunderbird software.  Why???? </p><p>3.   The email works fine when you go to the GMail web site. </p><p>4.   Since I needed a better platform than the GMail website, we were able to load the john@jtbcpa.com email on Outlook.   However, I did not have all my email addresses.   (after 20 years I have about 2000 email address.) </p><p>5.  I thought I could export the email address from Thunderbird to a CSV file and maybe load them into outlook.    However, when I went to export, there was only one option to export and that was to export everything.   Which included thousands of old emails and addresses from various email accounts.   That was not going to help.    What happened to the export tool which would download or export your email addresses only? </p><p>So, I have to look at the old emails in Thunderbird to get the email addresses. </p><p>I am not sure why the update to Thunderbird is so limited.   I have loved the program for many years.  It was easy to use.  </p><p>And,  I was always able to get all previous email addresses to work.   </p><p>In conclusion, I am not sure why Thunderbird cannot recognize my john@jtbcpa.com account.   It can see my other two gmail accounts, brozowski99@gmail.com and john@johncpa.com.   Maybe the person who upgraded the account put some sort of block on it through gmail.   I don't know. </p><p>I have spent hours on this transition, which should not have taken more than an hour.  And, I even offered to pay someone to call me to help me with the platform.   This is where internet online services and AI are useless.   I need a tech savvy Thunderbird expert to call me, go on my computer, and make it work.   But, all the responses I got was - ""We will not do that."" </p><p>So, I am forced to move to Outlook.   I am not happy, and all the old emails will remain on Thunderbird.   </p><p>I know the software was free.   And, I was happy to pay someone to get it to work.  Or, maybe look at my gmail settings to see if there is a blocker preventing Thunderbird from seeing the account.    </p><p>No need to respond - I just needed to vent.    </p><p>John Brozowski </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1764258;,brozowski99

However, the though of signing into one place and checking in any one of them or all of them sounds intriguing. Does Thunderbird allow more than one Gmail account or would I have to set them up as separate Thunderbird accounts?  Which if so, that would defeat the purpose it appears to me.  I can do that already in Gmail - just open 3 tabs but have to be in a browser and online.
