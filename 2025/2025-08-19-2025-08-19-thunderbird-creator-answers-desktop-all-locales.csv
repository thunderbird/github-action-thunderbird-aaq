I've tried different ways of copying folders, copying in the unique ini address, using the ""%AppData%"" approach and several other ways I've found on internet searches.  None of these are working.  Could several people tell me how they recommend I do this so I can find if there's another way I haven't tried yet.  Very frustrated with this and wish I hadn't bothered donating to Thunderbird ever since this problem has cost me at least 15 hrs of my life at this point.  Transferring filed emails that took years to fill should not be so cumbersome and should be a much easier task.  Shameful.
