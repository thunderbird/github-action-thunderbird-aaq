In other words, if, for example, I create a subfolder on my computer, I cannot see it on my phone, and vice versa.  Is it possible to synchronise the account on all devices?  Thank you very much. I look forward to your reply.  Kind regards, Hernan Fonda </blockquote> <p>If the accounts are set up as POP, synchronization is not possible - they must be IMAP on all devices. </p><p><a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Convert_a_POP_account_to_a_IMAP_account"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Convert_a_POP_account_to_a_IMAP_account</a> </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

There is a compatibility.ini file in the profile you could delete after each update and then let Thunderbird do it, but that isn't really better. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
