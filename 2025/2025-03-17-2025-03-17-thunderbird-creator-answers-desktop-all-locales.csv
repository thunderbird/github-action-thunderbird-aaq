I have question.,"<p>For the longest time I used Eudora until the developers dropped it. </p><p>I did play with GMAIL for a while but I'm not too fond of having oligarchs know my every thought. </p><p>I even gave Outlook a trial for a couple of years but I grew tired of the damned add-on developers gouging me. </p><p>I tried Thunderbird and liked it a great deal. So much so that I happily make a monthly payment to show appreciation. </p><p>Okay, so, I switched to Windows Pro 11 and installed Thunderbird. I don't like it at all. Few controls match what I knew and I have better things to do with my days than go digging around to try to figure out what was perfectly comprehensible six months ago. </p><p>So, my questions are - </p><p>Is there any chance that you will ever add a nice simple button that says ""Revert to Earlier Interface"" </p><p>If that doesn't have a chance in hell of ever coming into being, can you suggest a decent email program that isn't from Big Coder and that can replace Thunderbird?  </p><p>I'm not stupid or lazy - I worked in IT for 35 years - but I'm long past the point where trying to figure out what the other guy did to a favorite application was enjoyable. Stable and functional is good. New and mystifying is not. </p><p>Suggestions appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",lee118
