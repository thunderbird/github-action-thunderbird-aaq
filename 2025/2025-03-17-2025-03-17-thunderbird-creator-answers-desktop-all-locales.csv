So much so that I happily make a monthly payment to show appreciation. </p><p>Okay, so, I switched to Windows Pro 11 and installed Thunderbird. I don't like it at all. Few controls match what I knew and I have better things to do with my days than go digging around to try to figure out what was perfectly comprehensible six months ago. </p><p>So, my questions are - </p><p>Is there any chance that you will ever add a nice simple button that says ""Revert to Earlier Interface"" </p><p>If that doesn't have a chance in hell of ever coming into being, can you suggest a decent email program that isn't from Big Coder and that can replace Thunderbird?  </p><p>I'm not stupid or lazy - I worked in IT for 35 years - but I'm long past the point where trying to figure out what the other guy did to a favorite application was enjoyable.

Maybe I posted it under the wrong thread, so am redoing it here. Apologies for repetition. </p><p>In the past week or so I have noticed that some emails disappear from one inbox on my Windows 10 PC.  I have three Thunderbird accounts (call them A, B, and C), and the emails only disappear from box A.  It seems completely random, and furthermore they only disappear on my own PC.  My husband has an identical set-up on his Windows 10 PC, which also includes the boxes A, B, and C, and the messages do NOT disappear there.  I can also see them on my iPhone and two iPads, and they do not disappear from those.  I have tried forwarding them to myself from my phone, and while most of them did show up in the A inbox on my PC, I have noticed that some of them have now disappeared again. </p><p>This is incredibly frustrating, because I do most of my work at my PC.  I thought I needed an update, but TB says I am up to date (128.8.0esr (32-bit)). It can't be anything to do with the server, because it is so specific: one inbox on one PC only.  There doesn't seem to be any special pattern--some have attachments, some don't. </p><p>Many thanks for any suggestions! </p><p>I also posted two updates under the original question (which had a title something like 'Random emails keep disappearing'), and the problem is still ongoing, making my life a bit difficult, as I am at the moment in contact with doctors, lawyers, and insurers, and I keep losing their emails on my main PC, which holds documents that I sometimes need to attach to replies. </p><p>I am very surprised no one has replied (apart from my own updates), as usually there is someone out there with good ideas. </p><p>I'd really be grateful if someone could suggest something.
