I have question.,"<p>For the longest time I used Eudora until the developers dropped it. </p><p>I did play with GMAIL for a while but I'm not too fond of having oligarchs know my every thought. </p><p>I even gave Outlook a trial for a couple of years but I grew tired of the damned add-on developers gouging me. </p><p>I tried Thunderbird and liked it a great deal. So much so that I happily make a monthly payment to show appreciation. </p><p>Okay, so, I switched to Windows Pro 11 and installed Thunderbird. I don't like it at all. Few controls match what I knew and I have better things to do with my days than go digging around to try to figure out what was perfectly comprehensible six months ago. </p><p>So, my questions are - </p><p>Is there any chance that you will ever add a nice simple button that says ""Revert to Earlier Interface"" </p><p>If that doesn't have a chance in hell of ever coming into being, can you suggest a decent email program that isn't from Big Coder and that can replace Thunderbird?  </p><p>I'm not stupid or lazy - I worked in IT for 35 years - but I'm long past the point where trying to figure out what the other guy did to a favorite application was enjoyable.

No difficulties here. </p><p>However, I am only able to send emails on the ‘GoDaddy outlook.office365’ email account.

After all this I was finally told to “contact Thunderbird to resolve this issue.”  </p><p>I want to point out, that when I login to the GoDaddy email website via Firefox, I have not issues receiving / sending emails. I also have no issues using the ‘Outlook’ app on my android phone. </p><p>In an attempt to possible get a better ‘view point’ on the issue. I closed Thunderbird. Opened up a fresh download of Thunderbird AppImage and opened it in a ‘sandbox’ and ‘setup’ the GoDaddy email account. I still could only send and email.
