I am receiving emails on that account but only 1 of the 9 folders came over.  I have tried manually adding the folders but I get error messages from TB indicating that the outlook server cannot find the folders.  There are old emails in those folders that I will eventually need migrated over.  What am I missing? </p><p>Also, I am required to enter my password each time I open emails from the SmarterASP email server.  That is going to get old.  How can I stop this? </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",t.black
