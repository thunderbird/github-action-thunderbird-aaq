1541906,2025-10-18 03:25:55 -0700,2025-10-18 08:59:40 -0700,One folder brings TB to a halt,"<p>This has been consistent for over a week now.  One folder brings TB to a halt if I try to open any message in it.  I have many folders and many I rarely open so I can't be sure it's just this folder but certainly all other folders seem fine and fast.  This particular folder did have many messages in it but I deleted them all, accepting that I didn't really need them.  I then repaired the folder but was a bit shocked to find the problem continues.  The folder says it is 20.9Mb and that it contains three messages each of 7Mb. That's plausible as it just gets one Email per day from my server with some information.  The size can vary quite a lot.  I could just delete the folder and recreate one with  the same filter rules, or I could delete the filter rules before doing that, or ... what?!   Technical is that it is TB 140.3.1esr running on a fairly powerful Kubutu machine with 64Gb and really nowhere near any resource limits.  It's pulling messages from the one IMAP server and, as I say, everything else seems fine.   Any thoughts welcome, TIA, Chris </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,1773053;1773110;,ce_mozilla
