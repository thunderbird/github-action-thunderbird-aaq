If it was an IMAP account, they could have disappeared as a result of your husband having accessed the same account from his computer with POP, but you say it is the other way round and it's you who has the account configured as POP.

None of mine.  And yes, you are entirely correct that the real question is what happened in the first place.  I went back to look at POP v IMAP again and I did have that wrong:  my account is IMAP; my husband's is POP.  But he does not see my emails on his iPad, while I can see his on the MacBook Air.  I don't think I'll ever know just what happened. </p><p>Mapenzi - you suggested something if the inbox folder hadn't been compacted; unfortunately, I recall seeing something flash at the bottom of the window when I returned to email to find all the messages disappeared - I think it said something about compacting...too fast for me to comprehend in the shock of not seeing any emails.

Now, this makes sense and we could be getting closer to figure what happened… </p><p>If you're using IMAP, your messages may have been deleted from Thunderbird as a result of them being deleted from the server <i>by someone else</i> and then Thunderbird synchronising with the server, rather than by you clicking a link in some message, which frankly, I have a hard time believing could have anything to do with this, must have been coincidence. </p><p>Here is a possible scenario that would explain what happened, just to give you an idea of things to consider that you may not have thought of. If your husband accessed your mail account with POP, he may have inadvertently configured the account to remove messages from the server after downloading them (""Leave messages on server"" part of the account ""Server Settings""), and that would have caused the problem. He should have a local copy of the messages he downloaded from the server if he did that, though… unless he did something like deleting the account afterwards… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

I agree, I don't think it was clicking on the link that was the problem (and I checked with the sender - no one else had problems after clicking on that link).

He was out walking the dog at the time the emails disappeared and given how much effort it was for him to try to help (how do we get into Gandi, can we get to webmail, passwords?!, POP or IMAP, huh?, etc), I don't think he would have been able to do access my email using POP.

Poi, per cercare di rimediare, le ho spostate prima da ""Tutte le mail"" di Gmail a ""Posta in arrivo"" sempre di gmail, sperando che le riscaricasse, ma non apparivano nell'elenco. Poi ho fatto il contrario, ossia da posta in arrivo a tutte le mail, sempre senza che apparissero. Non so in quale momento di questi spostamenti sia nato il problema, sta di fatto che ora nè le vedo, nè posso cercarle in Thunderbird. Le ho solo su Gmail. Come posso fare in modo che Thunderbird mi riscarichi quella lista di messaggi (saranno circa 500-600)? grazie </p>",stefano.vass,false,0,0

But, those folders will only be the server default folders (eg: Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Spam, Trash) if you are using a  Pop account in Thunderbird and a Pop account can only access the server 'Inbox'. </p><p>Pop accounts - if you have created folders in Pop account in Thunderbird, then those folders you created will never display on server/webmail. Perhaps that is what you mean. </p><p>It is also possible Thunderbird lost track of the pop account and created another but it's not containing emails. </p><p>Please post the following: I need to know what account folder that pop account is currently using. In Account Settings Select 'Server Settings'  for the account. Top right - 'Server TYpe' - what does it say - Pop or Imap&nbsp;? Bottom right - 'Local directory:.....' Make sure the window is wide enough so you can see all the content in the 'Local directory:...'

I need to know this just in case something is going on that could be causing a problem. </p><p>Finally. Select the 'Mail' folder to see contents Post an image showing everything you see in the 'Mail' folder.

However I've just found that I've had a couple of emails go into junk folder, including a couple from people who are in my address book. This has only just started happening Any suggestions? Thanks </blockquote> <p>You  said you have an issue - <em>you mark as junk but keep getting emails from same senders.</em> You will constantly get emails from whomever sends them because the server accepts any emails sent to you and Thunderbird auto downloads them. You have not set up any Junk Settings for the account, so you have not enabled the Junk filter - that means you are not training Thunderbird to know what is or what is not junk/spam. But any  manual junk marking by you would only mark things as junk, you would need to have the 'Spam' column header visible in order to know whether it was marked as junk or not, otherwise you would not know the difference.  </p><p>I would advise that you Set up the Junk Settings as instructed in previous comment.  Setting the address books as whitelists means emails from contacts in a whitelist address book should be regarded as good but you need to enable the filter to learn this. When you click on Junk it gets auto moved to the Junk folder, so cleaning up what is otherwise a cluttered view. It also means you can empty the Junk in one go if desired. </p><p>You aslo mention - some emails went to junk - this could have some auto settings doing this&nbsp;: Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security scroll to Junk. But ideally you want that set up as following: </p> <ul><li> Select 'When messages are marked as junk: </li><li> Select 'Move them to accounts Junk folder' </li><li> Select 'Enable adaptive junk filter logging' </li></ul> <p><br> If you choose not to set up Junk Settings in account, then marking anything as junk becomes irrelevant because it does not move anything, but it should mark as junk and you would need to enable the 'Spam' column header in order to see what is and what is not junk. Anything manually selected should display with a red/orange flame. </p><p>If this is an Imap account then the server can put emails in the server 'Spam' folder which means you would auto see emails in that folder.  Thunderbird has no control over what the server puts in the Spam folder. </p><p>In addition - please remember to compact folders to remove all old traces of deleted or moved emails. Compact is not the same as compress, so do not be confused. Create folders to store and organise emails because it reduces the risks. If you keep  everything in eg: Inbox then that means you have all your emails stored in a single text file. Each email written one after the other in a single document. This is very risky. Do not allow any Anti-Virus to scan and auto fix anything because if they detect one bad email and try to fix - they have no idea the file contains more than one email, so you could end up losing the lot. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

I use Thunderbird and volunteer some time to help other users when I see fit.  I get no bonus for putting up with attitude or smoothing ruffled feathers.  Nor do I get anything out of regurgitating what is already written in the user support articles see the support document you apparently missed here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-change-thunderbird-layout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-change-thunderbird-layout</a> </p><p>Nothing in the Thunderbird view layout has changed substantially since version 2.  A couple of releases ago there was a card view introduced,  I find it less than useful, so I continue to use the same list/table view I have used since V2.  Likewise I despise the layout you are seeking and have always used the wide view.  Even with modern widescreen monitors I see no reason to try and shoehorn the message into yet another column across the screen.  Microsoft came up with the idea in outlook,  but I still prefer to devote the full width of the monitor to the email I am reading.  In a similar vein I still have the menu bar enabled because none of the new ""intuitive"" ways of doing things is anything like as discoverable as using a menu that lists everything. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,1
