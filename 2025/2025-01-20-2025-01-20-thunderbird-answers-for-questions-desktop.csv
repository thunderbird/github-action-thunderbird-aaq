If it was an IMAP account, they could have disappeared as a result of your husband having accessed the same account from his computer with POP, but you say it is the other way round and it's you who has the account configured as POP.

None of mine.  And yes, you are entirely correct that the real question is what happened in the first place.  I went back to look at POP v IMAP again and I did have that wrong:  my account is IMAP; my husband's is POP.  But he does not see my emails on his iPad, while I can see his on the MacBook Air.  I don't think I'll ever know just what happened. </p><p>Mapenzi - you suggested something if the inbox folder hadn't been compacted; unfortunately, I recall seeing something flash at the bottom of the window when I returned to email to find all the messages disappeared - I think it said something about compacting...too fast for me to comprehend in the shock of not seeing any emails.

Now, this makes sense and we could be getting closer to figure what happened… </p><p>If you're using IMAP, your messages may have been deleted from Thunderbird as a result of them being deleted from the server <i>by someone else</i> and then Thunderbird synchronising with the server, rather than by you clicking a link in some message, which frankly, I have a hard time believing could have anything to do with this, must have been coincidence. </p><p>Here is a possible scenario that would explain what happened, just to give you an idea of things to consider that you may not have thought of. If your husband accessed your mail account with POP, he may have inadvertently configured the account to remove messages from the server after downloading them (""Leave messages on server"" part of the account ""Server Settings""), and that would have caused the problem. He should have a local copy of the messages he downloaded from the server if he did that, though… unless he did something like deleting the account afterwards… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

He was out walking the dog at the time the emails disappeared and given how much effort it was for him to try to help (how do we get into Gandi, can we get to webmail, passwords?!, POP or IMAP, huh?, etc), I don't think he would have been able to do access my email using POP.

A couple of releases ago there was a card view introduced,  I find it less than useful, so I continue to use the same list/table view I have used since V2.  Likewise I despise the layout you are seeking and have always used the wide view.  Even with modern widescreen monitors I see no reason to try and shoehorn the message into yet another column across the screen.  Microsoft came up with the idea in outlook,  but I still prefer to devote the full width of the monitor to the email I am reading.  In a similar vein I still have the menu bar enabled because none of the new ""intuitive"" ways of doing things is anything like as discoverable as using a menu that lists everything. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
