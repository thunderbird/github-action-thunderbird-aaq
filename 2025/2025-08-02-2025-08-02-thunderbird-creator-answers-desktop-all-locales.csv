I do not want this behavior. I did not change any settings. Thunderbird started doing this automatically, several days ago. I want everything that is unread to remain unread, ESPECIALLY Spam. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",Scott2373

For example, de-selecting start page so I see no start does not work. I get the new dark page upon restart. Also, in appearance I de-select hide system bar and that does not hold, as well as select table view but upon restart I get card view. Any tips or tricks would be helpful. Thank you for your time and effort. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",wwaters96
