I just recently had to install it again.  If you use the actual Outlook Hotmail inbox to remove unwanted email you are forced to delete everything in your inbox.   Or delete them one at a time.   I now have over 10,000 emails that go back to 2018 because is there no way to get rid of the ones I don't want except to delete them individually which will take forever.  In the past I remember Thunderbird had a way of deleting them quicker.  Like there was a delete button at the top of the Thunderbird window and you could select it each time for each email.  That is why my Hotmail inbox is such a mess now. </p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions at all? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1753546;1753553;1753569;,Saturn9
