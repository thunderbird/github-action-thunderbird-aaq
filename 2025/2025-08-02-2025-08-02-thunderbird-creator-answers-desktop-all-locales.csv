I do not want this behavior. I did not change any settings. Thunderbird started doing this automatically, several days ago. I want everything that is unread to remain unread, ESPECIALLY Spam. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",Scott2373

For example, de-selecting start page so I see no start does not work. I get the new dark page upon restart. Also, in appearance I de-select hide system bar and that does not hold, as well as select table view but upon restart I get card view. Any tips or tricks would be helpful.

Mail's first days in 1997. and the one I have since gmail's first days in 2004. </p><p>Everything seems to be working correctly but there is one thing I can't figure out <strong>why</strong> it is happening. </p><p>I have the same signature containing an 18x18 pixel .gif configured in both Eudora and Thunderbird and they both display correctly on the recipient's side and on gmail's webmail. </p><p>The problem is - every such an email sent by Thunderbird is at gmail's webmail recognized as ""containing attachment"" and is marked with a peperclip icon which is <strong>not</strong> the case when email is sent with Eudora. </p><p>The consequence is - it now looks on the gmail's webmail as <strong>every</strong> single email that I ever send has an attachment which prevents noticing the messages that really do have an attachment. </p><p>I don't see any way of inserting code tags here on the forum to post the HTML code of the signatures sent by Eudora and by Thunderbird once the email arrives into gmail's Sent folder so I am sending the screenshot. </p><p>The upper HTML is how signature looks like in online gmail's Sent mailbox &gt; <strong>Show Original</strong> when sent by Eudora and below there is how it looks like when sent by Thunderbird. </p><p>And here is the pastebin of the same HTML code: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/4YHnNctC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/4YHnNctC</a> </p><p>HTML files attached as a signature to Eudora and Thunderbird: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/17NuE1SY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/17NuE1SY</a> </p><p>I do NOT want to use an image from online URL with <em>moz-do-not-send=""true""</em> tag. I want to use the .gif file from my hard disk sent in such a way it wouldn't be (by gmail's webmail) marked as an attachment and in a such way the image used for signature would be part of the message body - exactly what works well when using Eudora. </p><p>When the message is downloaded for offline reading the image used in the signature should NOT be ""remote content"", it should be part of the message. </p>",thunderbird;attachments;,thunderbird,attachments,en-US,"",Chupo_cro
