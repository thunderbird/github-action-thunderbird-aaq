When I created my account, I was given the name ""541225629"" and the password ""0600806936"". This account is functional and I can open a Webmail box in it. When installing the email application ""Mozilla thunderbird"", an account zmrzlys@iol.cz was created with the password ""up5Date"" entered. I will not open a Webmail box for this password. I have been using this account for years without any problems. Recently (probably after an update), however, when starting thunderbird, a password for ""zmrzly pop3. <a href=""http://Iol.cz"" rel=""nofollow"">Iol.cz</a>"" is requested. None of the passwords saved for ""iol"" are accepted. POP3 responds with [AUTH] Authentication failed. After ignoring this request (X), the mail works. When trying to find a valid password on the website, I received the following answers:  ""Zmrzly account error - sending the password for the user ""zmrzly"" was not successful.
