I use Thunderbird and have several different Gmail addresses assigned to it. A few days ago, one of the mailboxes stopped working properly, i.e., messages download very slowly, it's impossible to mark a message as read (and if it happens after a few minutes, the message is still unread on the <a href=""http://mail.google.com/mail"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com/mail</a> page). I suspect a synchronization problem with Thunderbird, because everything arrives instantly directly on the Gmail page. I've been using this mailbox for over two years and never had any problems. The mailbox was used normally, i.e., dozens of incoming messages a day and a few outgoing messages, without large attachments. The settings weren't changed either -&gt; <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> / 993&nbsp;; SSL/TLS OAuth2&nbsp;; <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> / 465&nbsp;; SSL/TLS OAuth2. I tried adding the mailbox again, but the same thing is happening today. I tried different settings in Thunderbird and in Google settings, but nothing helped. Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening? I have to use the web version of Gmail, because nothing can be done on Thunderbird. to do it efficiently - read or reply to a message. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",emp3trzy

I am asking because I <strong>mostly use Thunderbird</strong>, but it is not limited to it. Please patiently read to understand the problem ... </p><p>I regularly use 4 Wifi networks, 3 of them, I will name A, B &amp; C connected to 3 different local universities and one the home network. There is no problem sending mail in 100% of cases, at home &amp; networks A &amp; B. I noted though at network C, where I am mostly on Sunday's, when I send mail, basically with Thunderbird from one of my Gmail accounts to <strong>a particular friend's Yahoo email</strong>, that the email bounced with some errors I did not bother to read. Since it'd happen repeatedly for months, I just sent them later from any of the other 3 networks. I thought may be it has something to do with that particular university's network security settings. The emails are just text messages, now &amp; then with photos. </p><p>Then last Saturday, after emails while in <strong>network C</strong> were repeatedly rejected, I remembered, whenever I log in to my webhost's website to work on my site, that it does not connect with some error. Also a Filezilla FTP client does not work, but in both cases, when I use a VPN client, both work. I tried VPN, and sent an email to this friend &amp; it was also rejected. Same when I tried using a browser.  Sending emails to other people, I have never noticed any problem,, just this particular Yahoo email. I need to say during the several trials, 1 managed to slip through, though I had forgotten to paste some text &amp; so tried sending again. Same issues, when I used a different Gmail address. </p><p>That evening, I also tried send the message from the home network &amp; to my horror, it was rejected. That had never happened before outside university network C. </p><p>The following day, I decided, while using Network C to try sending that same message from <strong>an Outlook email </strong>address to that Yahoo email &amp; CCed emails of mine, Gmail &amp; AOL &amp; Yahoo. None arrived. As said, the problem seems to involve this Yahoo email of a friend, because all other emails go with no issue. <strong>Up to last weekend</strong> the issue was only when I was at network C, but now at home + university network A. Not been at B of late. </p><p><strong>This is part of the error message:</strong> </p><p><em>Message blocked: </em> Your message to friendsmail@yahoo.com has been blocked. See technical details below for more information.<em> </em> </p><p><em>The response from the remote server was: </em> 554 Message not allowed - [PH01] Email not accepted for policy reasons. Please visit <a href=""https://senders.yahooinc.com/error-codes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://senders.yahooinc.com/error-codes</a>  <em> </em> I read somewhere 554 error messages are permanently blocked or something like that. </p><p>The question is what is causing this and how can it be solved? I tried giving a detailed explanation in the NEW Microsoft forum website ""learn.microsoft ..."", but I discovered later the post was deleted for supposedly violating community guidelines. I posted on the former ""answers.microsoft. ..."" for over 10 years and there was never an issue, so that was annoying, especially not knowing what in my explanation broke their rules. Also search results for possible answers mostly involved issues with the MS Mail client, which is NOT my problem as you can see. </p><p>Since I mostly use Thunderbird, I though someone could help me find the cause and solution. <strong>I need to add, that friend with the Yahoo email address, has no similar issues and only hears about blocked messages from ME, previous, ONLY when sent from Network C.</strong> It is not that his email is blacklisted by Yahoo or he'd be getting no traffic at all from all other sources. I get dozens of emails a week and have NO known issues, of any blacklisted by anyone. </p><p>Before posting this, I decided to <strong>copy the exact message I sent to the friend, with an attached photo</strong> to these accounts of mine from a Gmail account on Thunderbird: Yahoo, a different Gmail, Outlook &amp; AOL.

Why? </p><p><strong>The original problem:</strong> When typing in German on a non-German keyboard, one types ""oe"" instead of ""ö"" and ""Ae"" instead of ""Ä"" or ""ss"" instead of ""ß"".
