Microsoft v posledních letech přestal podporovat klasické „heslo k účtu“ přes protokoly POP/IMAP/SMTP a vyžaduje moderní autentizaci (OAuth2) nebo tzv.

Vymažte staré uložené heslo </p><p>Menu → Možnosti → Soukromí a zabezpečení → Uložená hesla </p><p>Najděte záznamy k outlook/hotmail a smažte je. </p><p>Po restartu Thunderbirdu vás to vyzve k přihlášení – tentokrát se otevře přihlašovací okno Microsoftu (webová stránka), kde zadáte e-mail a heslo. </p><p>3.

Search could be to the right of the menu bar, or it could be in the empty region at the very bottom of the main window. Alternatively, the search field could be hidden until shown with ctrl-K. Customising the mail view does allow the search box to be removed, but I couldn't find a way to get rid of the burger, so there's still dead space above the menu if search is removed.
