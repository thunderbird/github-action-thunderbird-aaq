I have no idea what an amazon fire is.  I am guessing some sort of cheap and cheerful entry level laptop.  But I have no real idea about that.   I certainly would not buy a computer from them here in Australia.  The postage would break me. </p><p>Nope, I looked on google and it is a cheap android tablet.   So Thunderbird desktop (the forum you are posting in) simply will not run on it.  Did you install the android version from the android store?  If so I will have to redirect you posting to the android support forum.  I know essentially nothing about the android version of Thunderbird,  never having even seen it running, let alone used it. </p><p>What I do know a little about is spectrum because they appear to be one of the takeover kings of the US ISP market so they have a load of legacy email domains. Anecdotally, contacting they by phone either yields  exceedingly poor customer service and folk end up here trying to understand spectrum complex system of determining what setting they need to use. </p><p>So can we back up to the start instead of somewhere in the middle where you are having issues setting up a new computer.   </p><p>Let us start with your old computer.  What is the issue with the registry.  When do you see this message?  It would be far more productive to get your old information from that device,  it has a functional hard disk in it with all your setup for Thunderbird on it is my guess.  Transferring that data to your new device might however prove difficult as you are moving to Android in the process. </p><p>Then let's move to this if we can't get you old data.  Thunderbird is most unlikely to be able to automatically set up your email is is is one of the legacy domains.

Customising the mail view does allow the search box to be removed, but I couldn't find a way to get rid of the burger, so there's still dead space above the menu if search is removed.

Here are common reasons and troubleshooting steps:    <strong>  Server or Application Not Running:</strong>         Verify that the local server (e.g., Apache, Node.js server, database server) or the application you are trying to access is actually running.         If using a web server like Apache or Nginx, check its status and restart it if necessary.         For applications, ensure the process is active and listening on the expected port.      Incorrect Port or Configuration:         Confirm that the application or server is configured to listen on the port you are trying to connect to (e.g., localhost:80, localhost:3000).         Check for port conflicts, where another application might be using the same port. You may need to change the port for your server or application.  <strong>    Firewall or Antivirus Interference:</strong>         Firewall or antivirus software can block connections to localhost.         Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus to test if it resolves the issue.         If it does, add an exception for your server or application in your security software settings.   <strong>   Browser Issues:</strong>         Clear your browser's cache and cookies, as cached data can sometimes interfere with connections.         Try accessing localhost in an incognito or private browsing window to rule out browser extensions or settings.         In some cases, specific browser settings related to domain security policies might need to be reset.      DNS or Host File Issues:         Ensure that localhost correctly resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can test this by trying to connect to 127.0.0.1 directly instead of localhost.         Check your hosts file (located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows or /etc/hosts on Linux/macOS) to ensure the localhost entry is correct.  <strong>    Application-Specific Problems:</strong>         If you are developing an application, there might be errors within the application code preventing it from starting or listening on the port. Check application logs for error messages.         Ensure all necessary dependencies for your application are installed and configured correctly.   </blockquote> <p>Note that in this instance Thunderbird is the browser.  I suggest you devote time to applications you have installed especially developer tools, web site products like Apache and antivirus and it's attendant firewall as they are the most common issues.   </p><p>Have a look at this article.
