I have updated successfully to Thunderbird 128 OK and that hasn't solved the problem. The email provider is Fastmail (I've been in touch with them, they have given advice, so far, no luck), SMTP settings are on the attached image. The ISP is NBN (National Broadband Network).

If there is a better place to post this, please let me know. </p><p>Thunderbird very cleverly adjusts the time of ICS events to the local timezone. That seems like an obvious best practice. The problem is that without actually displaying the timezone, that leaves the user guessing what timezone is being referenced. This can occur when traveling, when you may or may not have adjusted your timezone settings correctly, and further confusion is possible if calendar is not set to use the system timezone setting. Simply adding the timezone to the time display would provide an easy feedback to allow the user to recognize any local misconfiguration and otherwise remove any uncertainty about what time the sender actually intended. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728326;1728362;1728383;1728386;,ntallen
