1508171,2025-04-25 19:57:43 -0700,2025-04-26 02:01:42 -0700,Sending emails in Thunderbird,"<p>Hello, I have Thunderbird 115 on a Win10 HP laptop. Until today, I could both send and receive emails OK; today, I can only receive emails, for some unknown reason I have an error message with sending only, reading: ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because connecting to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.fastmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.fastmail.com</a> failed. The server may be unavailable or is refusing SMTP connections. Please verify that your Outgoing server (SMTP) settings are correct and try again."" The SMTP settings match what is on Fastmail's website for POP3. I haven't done anything I can think of since last using Thunderbird that would trigger this. I have updated successfully to Thunderbird 128 OK and that hasn't solved the problem. The email provider is Fastmail (I've been in touch with them, they have given advice, so far, no luck), SMTP settings are on the attached image. The ISP is NBN (National Broadband Network). Antivirus software is McAfee Premium - Individual. It is really frustrating. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728285;,john1180
