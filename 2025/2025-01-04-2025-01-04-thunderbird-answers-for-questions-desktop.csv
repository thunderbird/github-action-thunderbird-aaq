So if nothing on server in the Inbox then nothing will display in an imap Inbox. </p><p>That explains why you see no emails in imap Inbox. It does not explain why they are not in the Inbox. </p><p>The most likely reason is you have unknowlingly set up a filter which is causing it to occur. </p><p>Have you created any 'Message Filters' in Thunderbird&nbsp;? 'Tools' &gt; 'Message Filters' If yes: All filters only work on new emails being downloaded into Inbox. All Filters work in the order listed. Do you have ANY filters which  have this: 'Perform these actions: 'Delete Message' If yes -  Then something is wrong with the filter settings because the conditions are valid for every email you download to Inbox. Disable that filter now and post an image showing the Filter itself so we can advise on how to fix it. </p><p>For a gmail account, if you set 'Delete Message', there is no specific instruction to 'Move message to' &gt; 'Trash'.   So, Thunderbird deletes the email BUT as it does not go to server Trash, gmail reads that instruction as 'Delete the label', so 'Inbox' label is removed from the email.   Now, gmail stores all emails in the 'All Mail' folder and when you logon to webmail acount, everything you see in the various 'folders/labels' is actually like a virtual view. The 'Inbox' label allows a view of the email stored in 'All Mail' folder to be seen in 'Inbox'.   As there is no instruction to put email in Trash, gmail will Archive that email. So, all your emails should be visible if you logon to the gmail webmail account and look in the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>That means it should be a simple process to reinstate the 'Inbox' label and all emails with 'Inbox' label will reappear in server Inbox and when Thunderbird synchs with server, all emails will reappear in imap Inbox. I've added a couple of gmail webmail account images below which should help as a guide. </p><p><br> Additional helpful info: In Message Filters window.... Have you enabled the 'Filter Log'&nbsp;?
