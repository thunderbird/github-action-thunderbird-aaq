So as time goes by they gradually delete messages from the Trash folder. This habit makes the Trash folder size increase until TB prompts for folder compacting. </p><p>A Trash folder in Local Folders exists by default but is rarely used unless you use Local Folders for storing messages (e.g. Global Inbox). I don't know which is your case and prefer that you give precise info whether your Thunderbird is actually blocked or not.
