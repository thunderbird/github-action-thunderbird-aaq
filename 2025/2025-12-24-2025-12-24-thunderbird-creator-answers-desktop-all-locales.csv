After I ""investigated"" the listed messages, I wished to delete the ""Search"" folder. I was suspicious so compared the list in the Search folder with the Original. Found that the messages in the Search folder were now missing from the Original folder. So went back to Search folder and copied each message to the Original folder. As a check, I then recorded the details of six messages in the Original folder and deleted them from the Search folder. I found they were also deleted from the Original folder. Bummer! Edit\Undo Delete. Didn't work. Have apparently now lost the record of those six messages. Two questions: 1    Can those six messages be recovered? 2    Can the Search folder and the copies of the messages in it be deleted without loosing them from the Original folder? Thank you Graham </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1788678;1788708;,grahamgarden

Compressing the inbox and other folders should have no effect on the flags showing a message has not yet been read. That only makes sense. The not read flags getting reset started happening several versions before 145. </p>",thunderbird;tags;,thunderbird,tags,en-US,"",rbhall52
