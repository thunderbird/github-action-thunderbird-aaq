After I ""investigated"" the listed messages, I wished to delete the ""Search"" folder. I was suspicious so compared the list in the Search folder with the Original. Found that the messages in the Search folder were now missing from the Original folder. So went back to Search folder and copied each message to the Original folder. As a check, I then recorded the details of six messages in the Original folder and deleted them from the Search folder. I found they were also deleted from the Original folder. Bummer! Edit\Undo Delete. Didn't work. Have apparently now lost the record of those six messages. Two questions: 1    Can those six messages be recovered? 2    Can the Search folder and the copies of the messages in it be deleted without loosing them from the Original folder? Thank you Graham </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1788678;1788708;1789264;,grahamgarden

Compressing the inbox and other folders should have no effect on the flags showing a message has not yet been read. That only makes sense.

According to my log history there was 1 in July, 3 in Aug, 2 in Sep, 2 in Oct, and 6 in Nov.  I never really paid attention since the reboot was quick.  But now in December I am losing work and it is a major problem.  I've had 30 crashes in Dec and 21 in the past week.  I have only 3 add ons and they have not changed, and a Copernic connector.  I disable the Copernic connector and it didn't help.  I have the same 140.6 on my Surface Go with the same add ons, except for  Copernic and it runs fine.  On both PCs I use Malewarebytes and WinDef.  I have put exclusions for them in their setups.  Even with MBAM completely disabled I've still had crashes. </p><p>I cleared the Cache and no help.

I've tried: troubleshoot mode with add-ons off; compacting folders; removing and renewing msf files; emptying junk and trash. Is there anything else, or is this just a failure or incompatibility of the app? I can't see that there's any antivirus app that might be interfering.  Can something go wrong when you export the files from one TB into another? I would be grateful for any suggestions.
