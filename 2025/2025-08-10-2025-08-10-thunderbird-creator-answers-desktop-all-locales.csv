But the conversations keep dragging on and on, as if it's a chat bot trying to learn language and interaction. To the point now where we have had to create copy and paste blocks of messages as well as have a strict policy of closing the sale as soon as possible and it's wasting valuable time. We even try to get them on the phone as soon as possible, some even zoom calls (which I refuse to take) and my business partner says they are real people, but I am convinced even that is possible to fake these days. </p><p>Are there people out there now creating these Ai agents and unleashing them into the world to go and waste people's time so they can learn language with real interactions?!?
