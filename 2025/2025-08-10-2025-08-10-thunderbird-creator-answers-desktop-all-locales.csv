I run a email-driven micro business and my imap inboxes grow in size very very rapidly. I have a super large storage with my email provider so storage is not an issue. I wonder if imap sub-folders can have less issues compared to a single imap inbox. Any advice will be appreciated. </p>,thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",nospam17

All based online, they send us their job and we get it made.  I keep getting enquiries from @gmail or @yahoo and they all look the same and sound the same. All are what look like genuine enquiries, and most have ugly Ai generated images as their 'artwork designs'. I can spot these from a mile away now. But the conversations keep dragging on and on, as if it's a chat bot trying to learn language and interaction. To the point now where we have had to create copy and paste blocks of messages as well as have a strict policy of closing the sale as soon as possible and it's wasting valuable time. We even try to get them on the phone as soon as possible, some even zoom calls (which I refuse to take) and my business partner says they are real people, but I am convinced even that is possible to fake these days. </p><p>Are there people out there now creating these Ai agents and unleashing them into the world to go and waste people's time so they can learn language with real interactions?!? I do not have time for this! Anyone else experiencing this?? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",hamster540
