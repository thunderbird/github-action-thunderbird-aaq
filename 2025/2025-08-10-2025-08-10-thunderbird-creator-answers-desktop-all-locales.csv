I run a email-driven micro business and my imap inboxes grow in size very very rapidly. I have a super large storage with my email provider so storage is not an issue. I wonder if imap sub-folders can have less issues compared to a single imap inbox. Any advice will be appreciated. </p>,thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",nospam17
