The Thunderbird email client does not make use of Mozilla Accounts as this kb article shows what Mozilla Accounts are used for <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/access-mozilla-services-firefox-account"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/access-mozilla-services-firefox-account</a> . It used to be called Firefox Accounts (as to why mention of Firefox Account in link) until the name changed to Mozilla Accounts in early 2023 to reflect the number of Mozilla services it is used with now and not just Firefox Sync as was originally.  </p><p>This <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a> site does use Mozilla Accounts to login. You do not need a Mozilla account to use the Firefox web browsers however there may be few Mozilla services you use a Mozilla account with Firefox like the Firefox Sync feature for example. </p>",James,false,0,0

You shouldn't be getting that and you shouldn't have to add any security exceptionsâ€¦ </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
