The Thunderbird email client does not make use of Mozilla Accounts as this kb article shows what Mozilla Accounts are used for <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/access-mozilla-services-firefox-account"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/access-mozilla-services-firefox-account</a> . It used to be called Firefox Accounts (as to why mention of Firefox Account in link) until the name changed to Mozilla Accounts in early 2023 to reflect the number of Mozilla services it is used with now and not just Firefox Sync as was originally.  </p><p>This <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a> site does use Mozilla Accounts to login. You do not need a Mozilla account to use the Firefox web browsers however there may be few Mozilla services you use a Mozilla account with Firefox like the Firefox Sync feature for example. </p>",James,false,0,0

You cannot make a Microsoft email account have a Gmail address. If it's a Gmail email address, then it's a Gmail account. What do you mean ""I made my Microsoft account mario64@GMAIL.com""? How did you make that? </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

The message is merely marked as deleted and remains there until the folder is compacted. What you delete when you empty the <i>Bin/Trash</i> is a <i>copy</i> of the message that Thunderbird placed there when you told it to delete the original message, but the original message remains where it was, just marked as deleted. </p><p>Even if it remains there, repairing the folder shouldn't make a deleted message reappear, though. If it was marked as deleted, it should remain hidden, and the fact that some deleted messages reappear would seem to indicate there is a problem with the file where the folder contents are stored on disk. </p><p>Do you keep a lot of mail stored in <i>Inbox</i>? What type of mail account is this (POP, IMAP)? </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
