EXAMPLE:  L/H side was the normal in/out/drafts/trash local folders and such. The second column was In-coming mail. ('Most Important to me')was the center column (Correspondents) which showed from whom &amp; address (Helping to determine Spam, Personal or Important Mail) also ability to alphabetize for reviewing correspondence(s). The R/H column was important for tracking dates of correspondence latest to oldest &amp; vice-versa.   I will review the page again and look for settings, with luck, I will be able to get back into the older format that was useful for my daily usage. </p><p>Final question; because of my crash, the data was recovered &amp; saved on external drive with success. Unfortunately the HD was mostly unrecoverable which required a reformatting and new (Windows 10) installation along with any old programs that were deleted in the process.  Question is, in the L/H column I had several folders created with quite some data stored. This data obviously was important to me. Unfortunately it is no longer available. Is it possible to recover that data from your server? V/R Robert </p>",belt-steinwenden,false,0,0

It is on an external drive. Then the solution to all your problems is: </p> <ol><li> Copy your old Thunderbird profile from the external drive to ther right location on your internal drive. Although I don't use Windows, I believe that you should copy the profile folder to C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles\. Look in that location on your external drive for your profile folder. The name is probably a combination of random letters and numbers, a period, and a date (unless you re-named it before). That's the folder that you want back on your internal drive. </li><li> Tell Thunderbird that you want to use that profile. ""Help"" menu - ""Troubleshooting Information"" - ""about:profiles"" will let you select the profile to use. </li><li> Re-start Thunderbird to open with that profile. (I think that this step is needed. Not sure.) </li></ol> <p>That process will restore your local folders, your layout settings, and everything else. </p><p>For future reference, you control the ""format"" things that you mentioned.

View &gt; Folders &gt; Unified </p><p>Then you will see the same list of all default folders, but this time each will be a 'Unified folder' and each would contain subfolders of the various account. So a 'Unified Inbox' would have subfolders for each accounts Inbox. Below all the various Unified default folders will then appear the various mail accounts which contain all the folders you created in alphabetical order. </p><p>Regardless, the order of the mail account folder name will be determined by the order you have set up in the 'Account settings'. So in Account Settings, left pane, if you put eg: a gmail account at the top then you will see the gmail account at the top in the Folder Pane.
