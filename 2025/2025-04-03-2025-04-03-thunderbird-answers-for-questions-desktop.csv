EXAMPLE:  L/H side was the normal in/out/drafts/trash local folders and such. The second column was In-coming mail. ('Most Important to me')was the center column (Correspondents) which showed from whom &amp; address (Helping to determine Spam, Personal or Important Mail) also ability to alphabetize for reviewing correspondence(s). The R/H column was important for tracking dates of correspondence latest to oldest &amp; vice-versa.   I will review the page again and look for settings, with luck, I will be able to get back into the older format that was useful for my daily usage. </p><p>Final question; because of my crash, the data was recovered &amp; saved on external drive with success. Unfortunately the HD was mostly unrecoverable which required a reformatting and new (Windows 10) installation along with any old programs that were deleted in the process.  Question is, in the L/H column I had several folders created with quite some data stored. This data obviously was important to me. Unfortunately it is no longer available.

Although I don't use Windows, I believe that you should copy the profile folder to C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles\. Look in that location on your external drive for your profile folder. The name is probably a combination of random letters and numbers, a period, and a date (unless you re-named it before). That's the folder that you want back on your internal drive. </li><li> Tell Thunderbird that you want to use that profile. ""Help"" menu - ""Troubleshooting Information"" - ""about:profiles"" will let you select the profile to use. </li><li> Re-start Thunderbird to open with that profile. (I think that this step is needed. Not sure.) </li></ol> <p>That process will restore your local folders, your layout settings, and everything else. </p><p>For future reference, you control the ""format"" things that you mentioned.

This forum tends to have at most a dozen folk that actually answer questions here, most have been using Thunderbird for more than 10 years and I doubt any will have a similar recollection to yours.  I certainly don't. </p><p>Now lets talk about email settings for on the server.  If the account is IMAP then all mail is ""on the server"" by implication any action to delete the mail will delete the mail on the server.   </p><p>POP mail can be left on the server,  but there is no real connection between the local copy and the server copy.  There is a setting in account setting to delete messages for the server when they are downloaded, or to leave them on the server until you delete them from Thunderbird.  There is also a filter action to delete the message from the mail server.  This action relies on the information stored in popstate.dat file of the account for that message.  It is cumbersome and not the most reliable process.  Corruption of the popstate.dat file can see thousands of mails left on the server downgraded again for no apparent reason.  So leaving mail on the server is not a good choice, expecially if the space on the server is limited by the provider, but it is a popular one. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-09-21-34-1ce18c.png""> </p><p>This image you posted is the filter menu of an IMAP mail account,  which has by definition, no use at all of a delete from server, it is implied in the act of deleting.  </p><p>When you create a filter the first thing you have to set, before you can create a filter is the account it applies to.  Once that is set you get another dialog with the actual filter you are creating  and the contents of the menu are context sensitive,  you get the menu for the type of account the filters will be acting on.  The following are the two distinct menu types for filter action.  The first being the standard IMAP menu and the second that for a POP mail account with it's two additional menu entries ""Delete from POP server"" and ""Fetch from POP server"" </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-19-43-51-a44ed0.png""> <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-19-44-01-baf928.png""> </p><p>The reality is, regardless of your settings many servers ignore or reinterpret delete requests based on the commercial decisions of the provider.  Outlook reinterprets deletion requests for POP to be a request to move the message to a folder called POP under the deleted items folder,   but the message never actually goes away.  Google relies on your choices on their web site for setting as to what to do when mail is downloaded in addition to what happens when the delete from the client is issued. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-19-50-56-743d0f.png""> </p><p>Email is not  simplistic, despite a general idea in the community that it is ""just email"" and everyone knows how it works,  the reality from where I am sitting is that email is quite a complex thing and basically no one knows how it works but assume, mostly incorrect things, and act outraged that it does not work how they assume it does. </p><p>I see from your post that you appear to have taken on the task of trying to manage spam with manual filters.  I wish you luck with that as the reality is it is a self defeating task.  Those sending spam are making millions from doing so,  their highly paid experts will trump your efforts every time.  I just rely on Thunderbird Bayesian junk filter and it serves me well.  But my legal jurisdiction prohibits unsolicited commercial email with huge fines for business entities that breach those laws or fail to provide simple functional unsubscribe links. </p><p>I do however wish to offer one piece critical advice regarding manual spam filtering.  If you are using a test based on the from address,  do not mark the message as spam. Ever!  The long term result will be you will probably make the self learning filter worse by poisoning the scoring database. Filtering takes no notice of the from address in its analysis of the message characteristics.  You will instruct Thunderbird, via the filter to consider the text of the message as an indicator of spam and it is probably not the case.  This is particularly contentious if you say use this filter as a form of <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender"" rel=""nofollow"">blocklist</a>.  Messages from the blocked party wishing you happy birthday will become part of the learning database as an indicator of spam.  Later all messages wishing you happy birthday may be blocked unless the sender is whitelisted because the phrase ""happy birthday"" is associated with spam. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Up to this point I have never missed anything important though I've doing doing it this way for years, but I understand the import of what you're saying. Sounds somewhat like the warning I give my clients about marking a spam message sent through their website as spam...they will never get mail from their website again! I just read <a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/09/thunderbird-and-spam/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/09/thunderbird-and-spam/</a> and, between your comments and the information on the page, it appears that whether I use my filter rules or TBird's adaptive junk filter, it's going to train itself on the content of the messages. However, I've found that specific things like someone randomly asking if I want to sell my business continue to come through though I've added numerous email addresses sent to me for the same reason. Maybe I had the adaptive filter turned off in the old instance of TBird I had in my computer. So while I haven't experienced the difficulty you cautioned me about and I do benefit hugely from having those email addresses automically filtered whenever TBird checks for new emails, I do take your caution seriously. Just not 100% sure how to avoid it now, unless I turn off the adaptive Bayesian filter. Thoughts? </p>",Hanasazi,false,0,0

Each .wdseml file is a partial copy (up to 49KB) of a message in the mail folder, stored in a .mozmsgs subdirectory. It is used by Windows Search Integration and does not contain full copies of downloaded emails. </p><p>Basically ignore those mozmsgs folders. </p><p>It looks like comcast has got you using IMAP.  IMAP does not work like POP. IMAP means all your emails are now stored on the server and the imap folders synchronise with server to display whatever is on the server.  You just need to remember that anything you delete via webmail will automatically be deleted in an imap account. So if you use a phone that uses imap and you delte an email, it gets deleted off server and then deleted in Thunderbird imap folder.  Never consider emails downloaded into an imap account as an independent copy because it can only display whatever is on server, but you can use it to get  backup just in case of loss off the server.  Please remember to ensure you have copies of fully downloaded emails so it's possible to create a backup. </p><p>It's not possible to put anything into an imap account folder because when you start Thunderbird, an imap account checks what is on server. As any copied in mbox file is not on the server, it will auto get removed so you see nothing. </p><p>In the backup of <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> folder, you need to get copies of all the mbox files and folders with .sbd extension and put them into your 'Local Folders' mail account. </p><p>Get access to your backup - select the 'Mail' folder and then select the '<a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a>' folder to see all the mbox (no extension) files.

Either leave all the pop emails in 'Local Folders' because A) you have access to them B) they are independent copies from server just like the old pop folders and only stored on your computer C) it keeps your server quota down to current level.  OR you can gradually get copies of small batches of emails and COPY them into an imap account folder. This means the emails then get uploaded back onto the server. This can take a while to do and most servers do have a limit on how many emails you upload via imap. It will also use up more of your server email quota which may be important to you.  Personally, I would advise you do not bother to upload them back onto the server unless you use imap because you have more than one computer which needs to access those emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

View &gt; Folders &gt; Unified </p><p>Then you will see the same list of all default folders, but this time each will be a 'Unified folder' and each would contain subfolders of the various account.

Below all the various Unified default folders will then appear the various mail accounts which contain all the folders you created in alphabetical order. </p><p>Regardless, the order of the mail account folder name will be determined by the order you have set up in the 'Account settings'.
