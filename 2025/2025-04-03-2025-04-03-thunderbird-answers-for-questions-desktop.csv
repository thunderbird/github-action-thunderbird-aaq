EXAMPLE:  L/H side was the normal in/out/drafts/trash local folders and such. The second column was In-coming mail. ('Most Important to me')was the center column (Correspondents) which showed from whom &amp; address (Helping to determine Spam, Personal or Important Mail) also ability to alphabetize for reviewing correspondence(s). The R/H column was important for tracking dates of correspondence latest to oldest &amp; vice-versa.   I will review the page again and look for settings, with luck, I will be able to get back into the older format that was useful for my daily usage. </p><p>Final question; because of my crash, the data was recovered &amp; saved on external drive with success. Unfortunately the HD was mostly unrecoverable which required a reformatting and new (Windows 10) installation along with any old programs that were deleted in the process.  Question is, in the L/H column I had several folders created with quite some data stored. This data obviously was important to me. Unfortunately it is no longer available.

This forum tends to have at most a dozen folk that actually answer questions here, most have been using Thunderbird for more than 10 years and I doubt any will have a similar recollection to yours.  I certainly don't. </p><p>Now lets talk about email settings for on the server.  If the account is IMAP then all mail is ""on the server"" by implication any action to delete the mail will delete the mail on the server.   </p><p>POP mail can be left on the server,  but there is no real connection between the local copy and the server copy.  There is a setting in account setting to delete messages for the server when they are downloaded, or to leave them on the server until you delete them from Thunderbird.  There is also a filter action to delete the message from the mail server.  This action relies on the information stored in popstate.dat file of the account for that message.  It is cumbersome and not the most reliable process.  Corruption of the popstate.dat file can see thousands of mails left on the server downgraded again for no apparent reason.  So leaving mail on the server is not a good choice, expecially if the space on the server is limited by the provider, but it is a popular one. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-09-21-34-1ce18c.png""> </p><p>This image you posted is the filter menu of an IMAP mail account,  which has by definition, no use at all of a delete from server, it is implied in the act of deleting.  </p><p>When you create a filter the first thing you have to set, before you can create a filter is the account it applies to.  Once that is set you get another dialog with the actual filter you are creating  and the contents of the menu are context sensitive,  you get the menu for the type of account the filters will be acting on.  The following are the two distinct menu types for filter action.  The first being the standard IMAP menu and the second that for a POP mail account with it's two additional menu entries ""Delete from POP server"" and ""Fetch from POP server"" </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-19-43-51-a44ed0.png""> <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-19-44-01-baf928.png""> </p><p>The reality is, regardless of your settings many servers ignore or reinterpret delete requests based on the commercial decisions of the provider.  Outlook reinterprets deletion requests for POP to be a request to move the message to a folder called POP under the deleted items folder,   but the message never actually goes away.  Google relies on your choices on their web site for setting as to what to do when mail is downloaded in addition to what happens when the delete from the client is issued. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-04-03-19-50-56-743d0f.png""> </p><p>Email is not  simplistic, despite a general idea in the community that it is ""just email"" and everyone knows how it works,  the reality from where I am sitting is that email is quite a complex thing and basically no one knows how it works but assume, mostly incorrect things, and act outraged that it does not work how they assume it does. </p><p>I see from your post that you appear to have taken on the task of trying to manage spam with manual filters.  I wish you luck with that as the reality is it is a self defeating task.  Those sending spam are making millions from doing so,  their highly paid experts will trump your efforts every time.  I just rely on Thunderbird Bayesian junk filter and it serves me well.  But my legal jurisdiction prohibits unsolicited commercial email with huge fines for business entities that breach those laws or fail to provide simple functional unsubscribe links. </p><p>I do however wish to offer one piece critical advice regarding manual spam filtering.  If you are using a test based on the from address,  do not mark the message as spam. Ever!  The long term result will be you will probably make the self learning filter worse by poisoning the scoring database. Filtering takes no notice of the from address in its analysis of the message characteristics.  You will instruct Thunderbird, via the filter to consider the text of the message as an indicator of spam and it is probably not the case.  This is particularly contentious if you say use this filter as a form of <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender"" rel=""nofollow"">blocklist</a>.  Messages from the blocked party wishing you happy birthday will become part of the learning database as an indicator of spam.  Later all messages wishing you happy birthday may be blocked unless the sender is whitelisted because the phrase ""happy birthday"" is associated with spam. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I would have thought that the order having been considerably changed, i.e. Archives which were originally the last 5 of 35 folders are now 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th in order just below my Inbox was easy to understand without a picture&nbsp;! But thank you  for at least thinking about it&nbsp;;-)&nbsp;! </p><p>Bill </p>",BillBal,false,0,0

'Trash' as it depends upon whether using pop or imap and what names get applied by server. Followed by folders I created which will be in alphabetical order Example: &gt; mail account name folder &gt; &gt; Inbox &gt; &gt; Drafts &gt; &gt;Templates &gt; &gt; Sent &gt; &gt; Archives &gt; &gt; Junk &gt; &gt; Deleted &gt; &gt; Bills &gt; &gt; Family &gt; &gt; Friends &gt; &gt; Thunderbird </p><p>Another alternative that some people use is 'Unified Folders'  - this may be useful for people who have several mail accounts and want to see all incoming mail from all accounts being displayed in a single unified Inbox and same for all other default folders. View &gt; Folders &gt; Unified </p><p>Then you will see the same list of all default folders, but this time each will be a 'Unified folder' and each would contain subfolders of the various account. So a 'Unified Inbox' would have subfolders for each accounts Inbox. Below all the various Unified default folders will then appear the various mail accounts which contain all the folders you created in alphabetical order. </p><p>Regardless, the order of the mail account folder name will be determined by the order you have set up in the 'Account settings'. So in Account Settings, left pane, if you put eg: a gmail account at the top then you will see the gmail account at the top in the Folder Pane. You can use drag and drop of account name to  move up or down to position. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
