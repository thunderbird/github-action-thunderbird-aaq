Double clicking caused a reply-to default, not an open in a new window default.  All sub-folders seem to have this problem even new ones.  Right clicking shows a menu where New Message From template is the default.  No other accounts have this problem, but Local Folders is my main email area.  Flags show the Inbox as an Inbox, not a Template.  Opening a new subfolder under Local Folders indicates that Local Folders is renamed somehow as Templates somewhere in the underside of Thunderbird. I see threads about recent All Mail issues, but this seems different.  I have also tried JustAnswers but am unsure that the issue will be fixed with just redoing the Inbox folder. I have also tried the Conifg Editor to change the default right click menus as recommended in various help forums but to no avail.  It looks like some part of Thunderbird is handling Local Folders as before, but other parts are assuming it is a Templates folder with Templates characteristics, which it is not.  Is there something else I should try? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",edhaser

Key issues that have made this different from a typical install: -Profile &amp; Local folders are stored in his old OS drive (that is now D:) D:/~/user/appdata/roaming/Thunderbird/~ -files are more than 2GB, so I'm unable to export as .zip -His folders are alphabetical, and every time stops at a particularly larger folder that starts with a D (which had considerably more folders than many others) </p><p>The only solution I have come up with is copying/uploading the local folders to his IMAP email, but not all emails are being uploaded either. However, has been more successful than the other migration method, but this has to be done a single folder at a time and not all contents of folder are transferred... </p><p>Is there some type of script or other way to migrate these local folders? </p><p>Any input is appreciated. </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1786828;1786843;1787000;,devontempelmeyer
