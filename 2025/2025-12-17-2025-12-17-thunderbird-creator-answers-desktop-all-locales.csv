If I don't notice that, and deselect it, that email gets deleted with the next batch. I've lost several emails this way. So, how do I get Thunderbird to stop selecting the next email after it deletes the ones that I selected. <em><strong>Nothing should be selected after an email is deleted.</strong></em> I don't see anything in the settings menu to do this. If this is a default feature, it's pretty dangerous and should be changed. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",woody8297
