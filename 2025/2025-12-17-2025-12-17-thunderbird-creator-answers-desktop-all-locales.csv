If I don't notice that, and deselect it, that email gets deleted with the next batch. I've lost several emails this way. So, how do I get Thunderbird to stop selecting the next email after it deletes the ones that I selected. <em><strong>Nothing should be selected after an email is deleted.</strong></em> I don't see anything in the settings menu to do this. If this is a default feature, it's pretty dangerous and should be changed. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1786523;1786524;1786532;1786539;,woody8297

Double clicking caused a reply-to default, not an open in a new window default.  All sub-folders seem to have this problem even new ones.  Right clicking shows a menu where New Message From template is the default.  No other accounts have this problem, but Local Folders is my main email area.  Flags show the Inbox as an Inbox, not a Template.  Opening a new subfolder under Local Folders indicates that Local Folders is renamed somehow as Templates somewhere in the underside of Thunderbird. I see threads about recent All Mail issues, but this seems different.  I have also tried JustAnswers but am unsure that the issue will be fixed with just redoing the Inbox folder. I have also tried the Conifg Editor to change the default right click menus as recommended in various help forums but to no avail.  It looks like some part of Thunderbird is handling Local Folders as before, but other parts are assuming it is a Templates folder with Templates characteristics, which it is not.  Is there something else I should try? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",edhaser

Hundreds of emails - among them quite a few very important ones - were simply gone! What do I do??? What has happened and how do I retrieve the missing messages? The funny thing is that it's only the inbox that has been emptied. The emails that my filters have sent to my alias-boxes are still there. I need my emails.

Have used Thunderbird for quite a while.  Recently, however, I have WAY too many mystery problems: server connections timing out or unavailable, disappearing emails, correspondents NOT getting my emails, me not getting their emails.  I've had to reinstall and setup the program several times in the last few months.  Each time, new problems. Really HATE to abandon independent developers/organizations in favor of commercial programs, but I need a app I can rely on. Gonna see how I do for another couple of weeks.  Is there an app that can scan settings and flag problems? Program's getting fairly complicated.

L'archivio invece di farmi visualizzare tutti i messaggi di posta mi permette di vedere le mail in arrivo solamente dei precedenti 15gg. Questo è un problema che ho solo io dal mio pc, i colleghi non hanno questo problema dai loro computer. Ho controllato le impostazioni sembrano tutte corrette anche perchè tale problema non sussiste dalla casella personale di thunderbird e le impostazioni sono le stesse.  Come posso risolvere?
