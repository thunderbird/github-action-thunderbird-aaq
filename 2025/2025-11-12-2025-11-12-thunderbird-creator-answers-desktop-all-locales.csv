I have not added any new add-ons.  I don't even have any add-ons.  I tried one suggestion of repairing and compacting folders and that did not help.  I also tried the accessibility.force_disabled change from 0 to 1.  It is still happening.  I have to use Task Manager to shut it down because if I right-click and close it tells me that TB is already running but not responding when I try to restart it.  It takes 4-5 tries to get it to the point where I can have a few minutes to do anything in the program.  If I leave and come back, the mail window is frozen.  Help, please!  I have been using TB for years and never had this problem! </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,"",kim47
