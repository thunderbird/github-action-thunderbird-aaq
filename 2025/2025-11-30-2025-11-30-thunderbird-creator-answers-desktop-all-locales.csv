Someone has been trying to hack into it. Twice in two weeks. I talked to a paypal tech and was told that they are accessing my emails. And she advised changing my email password. I have use Tbird for several years and don't remember having a password. But if I do, where is it, and how do I change it?  </li><li>2 - For awhile now I have been getting an error message when trying to send an email. (I can recieve, but not send). it says: ""Enter your password for ***********@suddenlink.net on <a href=""http://smtpsuddenlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtpsuddenlink.net</a>"" Where would I find such a password and where is <a href=""http://smtpsuddenlink.net?"" rel=""nofollow"">smtpsuddenlink.net?</a> Also could the above problem be related to this one? They started about the same time. </li></ol>",Sharbo;Googlethunderbird.;mozilla98;davidsk;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/142.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/protect-your-thunderbird-passwords-primary-password"", ""/en-US/kb/primary-password-replacing-master-password-thunderbird""]",21,0,1,,,
