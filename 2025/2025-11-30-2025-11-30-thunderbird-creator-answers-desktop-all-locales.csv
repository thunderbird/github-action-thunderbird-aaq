Everything seemed to work flawlessly. Until several hours later when checking my Gmail on my phone, I realized that I had not received any messages, which is odd. Then when I got home, I see on my laptop that Thunderbird had been receiving my gmails just fine. How do I get both Gmail and Thunderbird to receive new messages as I am often away from my laptop and need to check my Gmail on my phone. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>greenda4 </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",greenda4

La configuration, l’identifiant ou le mot de passe sont probablement incorrects.","<p>Hello, After replacing my PC (Windows 11), I reinstalled Thunderbird. I have 4 GMail accounts. For 3 of them, no problem. But for one, I have the error 'Authentication error. Connection to server is impossible. Configuration, identifier or password look incorrects'. I used default settings. This account is not particular. Issue remains after deleting this account, restarting Windows, and re-creating this account. I've created a new Windows user, then add this GMail account, and no problem. So what do you think of this? The only workaround for me is to switch between 2 Windows user. It's not useful. And I don't understand why this account, which is similar to others, has this issue. Thanks a lot for your answers. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",etessier44

No manual change seems possible...","<p>I am using Thunderbird with IMAP accounts and the Swedish language pack.  My Inbox is correctly displayed as ""Inkorgen"", but other system folders  like ""Drafts"" still show their English names instead of the Swedish ones  (e.g. ""Utkast"").  </p><p>In the folder properties dialog, it looks like there is a field for the  display name separate from the server path, but I cannot edit it for  system folders. For custom folders I can rename them, but not for Drafts,  Sent, or Trash.  </p><p>Is there a way to change only the display name of these system folders  without altering the IMAP path? Or is this a limitation in Thunderbird's  localization/mapping? </p>",thunderbird;languages;,thunderbird,languages,en-US,1782952;,jan278

I use it to access GMAIL via POP and use the settings ""After the email gets downloaded to my computer, delete the GMAIL copy"" (Settings attached).  </p><p>My usage pattern which changed recently: Earlier, I will always download emails using Thunderbird every day and it was working perfectly. Recently I have to travel for few days and during those days I will access my GMAIL via my android mobile primarily and I download all the emails after my return.  </p><p>Current Issue: Now after I return, all the mails gets downloaded, but it does not get deleted at GMail side (online). From the time I started using Thunderbird after my return, the newer emails from that time are getting downloaded and deleted but the old emails stay in GMail. Current inconvenience is it takes time to validate if all the important emails are downloaded and I cleanup the GMAIL manually and then we are all in sync. This continues until my next travel. I tried resetting the GMAIL POP settings and there is no improvement. </p><p>Any pointers or suggestions to resolve will be gladly appreciated. Thanks in advance! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",pethiraj
