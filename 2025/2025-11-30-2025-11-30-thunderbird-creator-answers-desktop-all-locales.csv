Everything seemed to work flawlessly. Until several hours later when checking my Gmail on my phone, I realized that I had not received any messages, which is odd. Then when I got home, I see on my laptop that Thunderbird had been receiving my gmails just fine. How do I get both Gmail and Thunderbird to receive new messages as I am often away from my laptop and need to check my Gmail on my phone. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>greenda4 </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",greenda4

My laptop crashed recently and I've had to have a new hard drive installed. I reinstalled Thunderbird successfully but for some reason my emails (from <a href=""http://btinternet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">btinternet.com</a>) only go back one month. How do I retrieve older emails? I normally keep at least twelve months to hand.

Ez egy hiba. </p><p>A szerver nem tudja feldolgozni a kérelmet, mert helytelenül formázott. Ne próbálja újra.
