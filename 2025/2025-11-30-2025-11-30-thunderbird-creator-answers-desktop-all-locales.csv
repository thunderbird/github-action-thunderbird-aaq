Everything seemed to work flawlessly. Until several hours later when checking my Gmail on my phone, I realized that I had not received any messages, which is odd. Then when I got home, I see on my laptop that Thunderbird had been receiving my gmails just fine. How do I get both Gmail and Thunderbird to receive new messages as I am often away from my laptop and need to check my Gmail on my phone. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>greenda4 </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",greenda4
