I successfully exported all 9,000 emails to a Mbox file. I added the new Gmail account I want to move the emails to and the exported file to Thunderbird and it shows over 20,000 emails in Thunderbox (even though there should only be around 9,000). I have tried moving the email file to the new email account within Thunderbird twice now. Both times it shows like it is moving the 20,000 emails but when it finishes it only moves around 1,200 emails. How do I get it to import all 9,000 of the emails that are in the exported file? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",northpointent

My first attempt failed. I need to understand what went wrong and how to correct it. </p><p>I installed Thunderbird on the new computer and used Profile Manager to create a profile in the location where I want to keep it (in the Documents folder, to simplify backup). Then I found the place where the mailboxes were kept and copied my old mailboxes there from the backup. </p><p>Then I started Thunderbird. Instead of displaying my old Inbox and a list of mailboxes, it displayed a screen that prompted me to define my email account. OK, that's fair; if the account information wasn't in the files I copied, Thunderbird would have to do that. After I defined the accounts (there are three), I quit and restarted Thunderbird, and it displayed my Inbox and mailboxes. </p><p>But not quite as I expected. I expected to see the mail that was on the old computer when I last backed it up. Then I planned to download mail to get everything that came in after that. Instead I found that Thunderbird had erased everything I copied over, then downloaded the new mail without me asking it to.  </p><p>Now what? The new mail is still on the server, so I can repeat the whole process if I have to. First, though, I need to understand what went wrong. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1714785;,jsachs.sac

I've saved many of the crash reports in case they might help someone know how to fix this.  An Apple tech person diagnosed my memory was broken, so I just got a new logic board and reinstalled all my data from my Time Machine backup. Then a message popped up that Thunderbird was damaged and should be put in the trash. Around the same time i replied to an email from someone at Thunderbird donor who was responding to a question i had about a small donation i tried to make - i explained i was having trouble with Thunderbird. At that time, i could see the Thunderbird icon in my task bar. When talking with someone from Apple support this evening who was helping me answer a couple of questions, including about a new ""mail"" icon that showed up in my task bar, I mentioned that i'd like to learn how to back up or archive my emails in Thunderbird. That's when i saw that the Thunderbird icon - had disappeared. The Apple support person and i searched all over my computer for the Thunderbird app, but couldn't find it.  I'm really nervous. I have over 300,000 emails I've been wanting to learn how to archive - or something. I don't want to delete most of them. I hope someone can help me find everything.
