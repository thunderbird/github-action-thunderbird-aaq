It is not ""scanned document""  Brother,  the maker of my printer offer a number of choices. See <a href=""https://support.brother.com/g/b/faqend.aspx?c=us_ot&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfc8952dw_us&amp;faqid=faq00000046_004"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.brother.com/g/b/faqend.aspx?c=us_ot&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfc8952dw_us&amp;faqid=faq00000046_004</a> </p><p>Once you have identified the type of file you can move on to what application opens that type of file.  Noting here that the file extension has application to file types only in Windows, not in other operating systems and not in internet documents of which email is one, web pages are another.  Hence my comments about some cheap printers below. </p><p>Note that many cheap printers have no idea how to attached a document to an email correctly and attach them as text or some for of format flowed binary.  Thunderbird will not be able to open them successfully because they are not correctly described.  But lets first work out what file format they think they are using. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Attach a PDF and it also opens. In a new tab in Thunderbird.  That would indicate there either the formatting of the email you have is wrong (that hallucination) or you have never opened a JPG in Thunderbird.  A PDF comes predefined, hence my suggestion that your search  on that below </p><p>What is showing in settings for helper applications.
