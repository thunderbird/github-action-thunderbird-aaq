Confirm: Thunderbird is set up as allowed program in Firewall. </p><p><strong>VPN</strong> Please check your computer for any VPN. Some OS now include a VPN and many Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN.  I have come across people who discovered they had a VPN that was enabled which they did not realise. So please double check computer - if you have a VPN enabled then switch it off because srevers do not like VPN as it hides your IP address so they think a hacker is trying to to access your account and so they block access. If you insist on using a VPN then you must set up a split tunneling and set up Thunderbird to use it. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
