I use the Bing Translator and your post was too big to be properly translated. Thank you. </blockquote> <p>English version </p><p>Hello. I need help with Problem.  In my organization we have 13 boxes that installed on the 50 users' computers with POP3 protocol </p><p>Due to the fact that the local e-mail provider suddenly initiated a changing passwords of our email boxes in my organization, when he suddenly did it, after I have these two problems: </p><p>1. Immediately all Thunderbird clients lose access to the server, trying to contact with old credentials and it accompanied with appearing every 10-60 seconds (it seems to me that 10-30 seconds) new window - an error that is the subject of the issue ""Error entry into the server &lt;server&gt; named user &lt;user name&gt;"". That is, at that time, whean I (the system administrator) will come to the user where client is installed and enter a new password on his screen, i see that appears many of thtis error windows and accumulate if I go for hours to him (tens of hundreds of windows while the computer is turned on), and this can stuck old computers btw, and I have to first kill the process 'thinderbird.exe' in the tasks manager for just reenter New password!. That strange behavior is not normal I think that every 30 sec appear error window! - This is the main message. In my opinion, only One window would be enough that authorization is impossible.  </p><p>2. The problem is very serious. It follows from clause 1, namely, because of hundreds of requests for the server with an attempt to authorize with incorrect old passwords, until I have yet managed to enter their users, The provider blocks our IP address of the entire organization and adds it to the black list (from his words), thay sad me that server have “rule of blocking: 10 unsuccessful authorize attempts - send us to the black list on server”. With this error of authorization, it manifests itself with renewed vigor. After dialog with the provider, they sad me that  thay put our IP-address in their exception list from black list, and its blocking will not be possible. But in fact, nothing has changed even after I entered new passwords data on all 50 computers of the organization where TB clients installed (for POP3/SMTP protocols in the password storage). The problem is that an error now appears randomly in everyone PC: Usually from 1 to 10 windows during a day. It all Seems as if clients are also trying to log in with incorrect old passwords, and we again get into a black list - blocking - error.  </p><p>I think that not only provider can be to blame, but my clients too (this is the latest version of ESR). How my clients was installed as follows: a) Installation and complete setting once on my computer with the settings that I want for everyone Installation of a client (user) of a pure ESR from an official site (a year ago was not the same)  b) Editing Prefs.js in eplacing all inclusions from my email adress to desired address, mail server, replaced of mail.identity.id1.fullname, and such others. That is, a Painfully designed file for each individual PC. c) deleted the logins.json file , because I knows that this contains an old password 100%. </p><p>This is all that I did to change the old credentials for new in boxes of each PC, and thus is pre -designed in advance and deployed according by this instruction - worked everywhere for several years until then, Until the provider decided to replace the passwords for us.  </p><p>Today I understand that in the user profile remain in Roaming\Thunderbird there are still many files/folders that need to be deleted/replaced/changed before unfolding them on users PC. Thus, my assumption and question: where I could cancel and forget to do that? In which files an “old” accounting data can be stored? (due to which we have an random error I think). If you tell me, I delete/change all files that need it and, for example, re-authorize manually on each PC and thereby leave only new details in the storage. I assume that the following files may have meaning:  Foldercache.json foldertree.json Session.json parent.lock pkcs11.txt cert9.db key4.db logins.json times.json Maybe there are other files, databases from where the old authorization can come? because of which we gets an error with wrong credentials and come to the blacklist of the provider. </p><p>If I wrong, and with TB all right, then there are no questions for support, and I will only write to the provider.  The photo shows 1- many superimposed windows on each other that appears on all TB clients after they changed password;  2- random eroor after entering the correct password into the box (appears on all cleints 1-10 times during a day) </p>",alexei.bat,false,0,0
