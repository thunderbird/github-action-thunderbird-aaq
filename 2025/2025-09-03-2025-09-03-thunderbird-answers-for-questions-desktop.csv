Following Google's instruction, after enabling Linux environment, went to Play Store where TB was downloaded and installed (V. 128 - I have V. 142 in my downloads folder but don't know how to install it in Linux.) It's my understanding that TB will update itself to the current stable release, so my inability to install V. 142 may be a moot issue. In desecration, I uninstalled TB and tried reinstalling in ""terminal""; the installation was successful, but it still reverted to V. 128, and I get the same result in setup....TB infinitely ""checking password"", and unable to connect. So that's where I am now. Cookies are accepted in TB and there is no VPN on the Chromebook. I'll keep working at it but at the moment I'm fresh out of options. Coming from a long history with Outlook, I chose TB for Windows years ago because of similarity, and features that help with my diminished vision.

I've seen reports of a similar Settings message but that was ""Your browser is being managed by your organisation"". So that would be in Firefox browser not Thunderbird. It's not something I've seen in Thunderbird - but there's always a first time&nbsp;:)  I would start by checking to see if you have updater software which is controlling when updates are forced on Thunderbird.  That updater software may be a program you installed OR is something being offered and controlled by your Anti-Virus software.   for example&nbsp;: I have noticed that AV Norton can check for updates for programs.  I would advise that you do not allow updater software programs to control when updates occur in Thunderbird. Only let Thunderbird look for updates as it will only offer the correct ones. </blockquote> <p>I'm not part of an organisation, so don't have a system administrator.

As I do not see that message, I've been checking my beta version using the developer toolbox and located the part of code which would show the 'Thunderbird is being managed by your organisation' info. </p><p>I can see that the message is underlined in your image and the info in the code tells me that text is a link to the 'about:policies' info. </p><p>I found this info on a Thunderbird beta news webpage: <em>Thunderbird also now correctly displays enterprise policy use in the preferences panel, including a direct link to the “about:policies” page. That change will help users and admins see whether Thunderbird is being controlled through IT-defined settings, and it brings Thunderbird’s policy awareness more in line with that of Firefox.</em> </p><p>So clearly this is a new thing they have added to Thunderbird. Sounds like they are offering additional information, but the wording is not exactly helpful to the general user.  I think when they say 'organisation' it might mean yourself as you are the admin of computer. It could be a group policy setting or something you have allowed such as scanning thunderbird profile or emails by AV  etc. </p><p>I've just discovered I have a similar message in my Firefox Settings window. clicking on the link to see the about:polices, I notice I have something 'active'. It says Policy name&nbsp;:certificates,  policy value: ImportEnterpriseRoots  set to true. </p><p>What could this mean? <em>Basically, that policy instructs Firefox to ""trust"" SSL certificates stored by Windows instead of using exclusively its own list. That sometimes is injected by security software companies to make it more transparent that their software is scanning all of the pages you browse. </em> </p><p>In my case that would be Norton Anti-Virus because I do have that AV and I'm using Norton Safe Web /Search on browser.   </p><p>Did you click on that <em>Thunderbird is being managed by your organisation' link text to see what information it offered&nbsp;? </em> What info does it offer&nbsp;? Maybe you have Windows Security Anti-Virus or another AV you  installed which is allowed to scan files or scan downloaded emails&nbsp;? If you disable AV from access to Thunderbird profile - maybe set up an exception to block scanningetc then restart Thunderbird do you still see that message? Or you could restart computer in 'safe mode with networking' (you would need to connect to router using an ethernet cable to do this) - or start in 'Safe Mode' but internet may not be available - does not matter - does that message disappear from Settings window&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I use the Bing Translator and your post was too big to be properly translated. Thank you. </blockquote> <p>English version </p><p>Hello. I need help with Problem.  In my organization we have 13 boxes that installed on the 50 users' computers with POP3 protocol </p><p>Due to the fact that the local e-mail provider suddenly initiated a changing passwords of our email boxes in my organization, when he suddenly did it, after I have these two problems: </p><p>1. Immediately all Thunderbird clients lose access to the server, trying to contact with old credentials and it accompanied with appearing every 10-60 seconds (it seems to me that 10-30 seconds) new window - an error that is the subject of the issue ""Error entry into the server &lt;server&gt; named user &lt;user name&gt;"". That is, at that time, whean I (the system administrator) will come to the user where client is installed and enter a new password on his screen, i see that appears many of thtis error windows and accumulate if I go for hours to him (tens of hundreds of windows while the computer is turned on), and this can stuck old computers btw, and I have to first kill the process 'thinderbird.exe' in the tasks manager for just reenter New password!. That strange behavior is not normal I think that every 30 sec appear error window! - This is the main message. In my opinion, only One window would be enough that authorization is impossible.  </p><p>2. The problem is very serious. It follows from clause 1, namely, because of hundreds of requests for the server with an attempt to authorize with incorrect old passwords, until I have yet managed to enter their users, The provider blocks our IP address of the entire organization and adds it to the black list (from his words), thay sad me that server have “rule of blocking: 10 unsuccessful authorize attempts - send us to the black list on server”. With this error of authorization, it manifests itself with renewed vigor. After dialog with the provider, they sad me that  thay put our IP-address in their exception list from black list, and its blocking will not be possible. But in fact, nothing has changed even after I entered new passwords data on all 50 computers of the organization where TB clients installed (for POP3/SMTP protocols in the password storage). The problem is that an error now appears randomly in everyone PC: Usually from 1 to 10 windows during a day. It all Seems as if clients are also trying to log in with incorrect old passwords, and we again get into a black list - blocking - error.  </p><p>I think that not only provider can be to blame, but my clients too (this is the latest version of ESR). How my clients was installed as follows: a) Installation and complete setting once on my computer with the settings that I want for everyone Installation of a client (user) of a pure ESR from an official site (a year ago was not the same)  b) Editing Prefs.js in eplacing all inclusions from my email adress to desired address, mail server, replaced of mail.identity.id1.fullname, and such others. That is, a Painfully designed file for each individual PC. c) deleted the logins.json file , because I knows that this contains an old password 100%. </p><p>This is all that I did to change the old credentials for new in boxes of each PC, and thus is pre -designed in advance and deployed according by this instruction - worked everywhere for several years until then, Until the provider decided to replace the passwords for us.  </p><p>Today I understand that in the user profile remain in Roaming\Thunderbird there are still many files/folders that need to be deleted/replaced/changed before unfolding them on users PC. Thus, my assumption and question: where I could cancel and forget to do that? In which files an “old” accounting data can be stored? (due to which we have an random error I think). If you tell me, I delete/change all files that need it and, for example, re-authorize manually on each PC and thereby leave only new details in the storage. I assume that the following files may have meaning:  Foldercache.json foldertree.json Session.json parent.lock pkcs11.txt cert9.db key4.db logins.json times.json Maybe there are other files, databases from where the old authorization can come? because of which we gets an error with wrong credentials and come to the blacklist of the provider. </p><p>If I wrong, and with TB all right, then there are no questions for support, and I will only write to the provider.  The photo shows 1- many superimposed windows on each other that appears on all TB clients after they changed password;  2- random eroor after entering the correct password into the box (appears on all cleints 1-10 times during a day) </p>",alexei.bat,false,0,0
