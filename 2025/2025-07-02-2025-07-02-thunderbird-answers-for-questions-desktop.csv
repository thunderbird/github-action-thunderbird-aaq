First, when I reloaded the yahoo webmail page on my laptop, suddenly all inbox mail before May 18, 2017 has disappeared. On my phone I still have a tab open that shows 107k emails, whereas the reloaded page on laptop says 85k emails. 32k emails prior to 2017 sounds about right. That date has some significance, in that I had an Invidia problem on the laptop, and had to hard reset Win 11. So I restored Tbird from a 2020 backup (I thought I had a backup from last fall, but the thumb drive was corrupted). When I first did so, it started to d/l at May 18 2017. </p><p>I didn't want to go that far back, and I had an idea. I booted up a very slow, ancient laptop (the actual origin of the 2020 backup when I migrated to a laptop that died in the fall) and let it download 5 years of emails, then copied the profile over to my new laptop. Everything worked swimmingly for almost a month, until June 26, when the error described started. So, there is a database problem over at Yahoo that you Mozilla guys can't solve. </p><p>While pursuing another line of thought I encountered a solution from 2017 (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/ko/questions/1326264"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/ko/questions/1326264</a>). I've been struggling with this for a week, and only now does this come up when I was looking for something else??? I had even done the search with ""-mozilla -thunderbird"" to look for other email clients that may have encountered similar problems. Sometimes search tries too hard and doesn't actually give you what you want. </p><p>I will now attempt the solution presented in 2017, and let you know how it goes. </p><p>1 Create a new local folder 'Yahoo mail backup' 2 Move all emails in the Thunderbird inbox to the new local folder 3 Close Thunderbird and delete the inbox and inbox.msf files in the profile folder 4 Make a backup copy of the popstate.dat file 5 Edit the original popstate.dat file to remove all records. Don't delete the header lines. 6 Restart Thunderbird which will then recreate the inbox and inbox.msf files and download all records from the yahoo mail inbox to the Thunderbird inbox. This took several hours to complete 7 Older emails that were no longer in the yahoo mail inbox are still accessible in Thunderbird in the backup local folder. </p>",fuzzface427,false,0,0

That is, I sometimes see users copying the thunderbird folder to the thunderbird folder, resulting in a copy that is ignored by Thunderbird. After the copy, your profile should appear in the ...appdata/roaming\thunderbird/profiles folder.  That check is just to ensure the copy went properly.  Next, you can force the profile by editing the profiles.ini in the roaming/thunderbird folder with the name of the desired profile. (OR, you can achieve that by clicking tools&gt;import&gt;import from a thunderbird installlation,  OR, you can click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles', click 'about:profiles', click the 'create profile button, click next, enter a short name (such as MYPROFILE), click the choose button to select your profile and then click finish and launch.  </p><p>And if none of that works, I can assist in copying elements from the profile to the active one.

Much appreciated  I have been trying to implement the suggestions received but so far I'm not having a lot of success.  While I've been using computers pretty much ever since the early 80s, I'm definitely not very tech savvy, so please bear with me while I try deal with and explain things the best that I can.  And the current Thunderbird I'm using was downloaded from the Thunderbird site, not Windows. </p><p>In the process of working on what's happening, I realized something that might be contributing to the problem.  The old computer that I'm trying to migrate from is not the first computer that I've used Thunderbird on.  Eight years ago I migrated the Thunderbird info from yet an older computer, and I can't begin to remember what all was involved from that far back.  It worked and that was the goal. </p><p>Now this time, the profile folder that I copied from the old computer to the flash drive was named ""Thunderbird Data"".  I tried using that once to no success, so then I renamed it to ""Thunderbird"" (none of this actually contained the quotation marks) in order to match the destination folder, but that hasn't worked either.  My copied source folder is 4.5 GB and as I stated, I have seen many of the Thunderbird file names during the transfer so I'm pretty sure that everything needed is in there but the new program just isn't connecting with it. </p><p>I just now copied the ""Thunderbird Data"" file to the new computer and tried the new profile approach using that folder to connect to it.  No luck.  I'm at a sticking point again. </p><p>I don't know if that sheds any light on the issue, but it's worth a shot. </p>",mike79,false,0,0

I can't say how many specifically because there are many duplicates, and with now 526 of 997 messages in the destination folder showing the 1970 date, I'd have to look at each and every one to find out whether they were from the initial failure I reported (which was probably about 300 messages now that I think about it) and this new attempt.  </p><p>All that said, the only enabled extension I have are: </p><p>G-Hub-Pro, an external extension that eases integrating google mail, calendar, etc into tbird as separate tabs.
