First, when I reloaded the yahoo webmail page on my laptop, suddenly all inbox mail before May 18, 2017 has disappeared. On my phone I still have a tab open that shows 107k emails, whereas the reloaded page on laptop says 85k emails. 32k emails prior to 2017 sounds about right. That date has some significance, in that I had an Invidia problem on the laptop, and had to hard reset Win 11. So I restored Tbird from a 2020 backup (I thought I had a backup from last fall, but the thumb drive was corrupted). When I first did so, it started to d/l at May 18 2017. </p><p>I didn't want to go that far back, and I had an idea. I booted up a very slow, ancient laptop (the actual origin of the 2020 backup when I migrated to a laptop that died in the fall) and let it download 5 years of emails, then copied the profile over to my new laptop. Everything worked swimmingly for almost a month, until June 26, when the error described started. So, there is a database problem over at Yahoo that you Mozilla guys can't solve. </p><p>While pursuing another line of thought I encountered a solution from 2017 (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/ko/questions/1326264"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/ko/questions/1326264</a>). I've been struggling with this for a week, and only now does this come up when I was looking for something else??? I had even done the search with ""-mozilla -thunderbird"" to look for other email clients that may have encountered similar problems. Sometimes search tries too hard and doesn't actually give you what you want. </p><p>I will now attempt the solution presented in 2017, and let you know how it goes. </p><p>1 Create a new local folder 'Yahoo mail backup' 2 Move all emails in the Thunderbird inbox to the new local folder 3 Close Thunderbird and delete the inbox and inbox.msf files in the profile folder 4 Make a backup copy of the popstate.dat file 5 Edit the original popstate.dat file to remove all records. Don't delete the header lines. 6 Restart Thunderbird which will then recreate the inbox and inbox.msf files and download all records from the yahoo mail inbox to the Thunderbird inbox. This took several hours to complete 7 Older emails that were no longer in the yahoo mail inbox are still accessible in Thunderbird in the backup local folder. </p>",fuzzface427,false,0,0

Now it puts all of my new emails in the Junk folder at startup and through the day. I have to repeatedly run the Whitelist filter to get whitelisted email into the Inbox, and i also have to keep adding filters to the Whitelist because all of my email goes into the Junk folder. I have to drag emails that I prefer to have in the Trash folder into the Trash folder.
