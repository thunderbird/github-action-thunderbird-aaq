First, when I reloaded the yahoo webmail page on my laptop, suddenly all inbox mail before May 18, 2017 has disappeared. On my phone I still have a tab open that shows 107k emails, whereas the reloaded page on laptop says 85k emails. 32k emails prior to 2017 sounds about right. That date has some significance, in that I had an Invidia problem on the laptop, and had to hard reset Win 11. So I restored Tbird from a 2020 backup (I thought I had a backup from last fall, but the thumb drive was corrupted). When I first did so, it started to d/l at May 18 2017. </p><p>I didn't want to go that far back, and I had an idea. I booted up a very slow, ancient laptop (the actual origin of the 2020 backup when I migrated to a laptop that died in the fall) and let it download 5 years of emails, then copied the profile over to my new laptop. Everything worked swimmingly for almost a month, until June 26, when the error described started. So, there is a database problem over at Yahoo that you Mozilla guys can't solve. </p><p>While pursuing another line of thought I encountered a solution from 2017 (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/ko/questions/1326264"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/ko/questions/1326264</a>). I've been struggling with this for a week, and only now does this come up when I was looking for something else??? I had even done the search with ""-mozilla -thunderbird"" to look for other email clients that may have encountered similar problems. Sometimes search tries too hard and doesn't actually give you what you want. </p><p>I will now attempt the solution presented in 2017, and let you know how it goes. </p><p>1 Create a new local folder 'Yahoo mail backup' 2 Move all emails in the Thunderbird inbox to the new local folder 3 Close Thunderbird and delete the inbox and inbox.msf files in the profile folder 4 Make a backup copy of the popstate.dat file 5 Edit the original popstate.dat file to remove all records. Don't delete the header lines. 6 Restart Thunderbird which will then recreate the inbox and inbox.msf files and download all records from the yahoo mail inbox to the Thunderbird inbox. This took several hours to complete 7 Older emails that were no longer in the yahoo mail inbox are still accessible in Thunderbird in the backup local folder. </p>",fuzzface427,false,0,0

Next, you can force the profile by editing the profiles.ini in the roaming/thunderbird folder with the name of the desired profile. (OR, you can achieve that by clicking tools&gt;import&gt;import from a thunderbird installlation,  OR, you can click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles', click 'about:profiles', click the 'create profile button, click next, enter a short name (such as MYPROFILE), click the choose button to select your profile and then click finish and launch.  </p><p>And if none of that works, I can assist in copying elements from the profile to the active one.

Much appreciated  I have been trying to implement the suggestions received but so far I'm not having a lot of success.  While I've been using computers pretty much ever since the early 80s, I'm definitely not very tech savvy, so please bear with me while I try deal with and explain things the best that I can.  And the current Thunderbird I'm using was downloaded from the Thunderbird site, not Windows. </p><p>In the process of working on what's happening, I realized something that might be contributing to the problem.  The old computer that I'm trying to migrate from is not the first computer that I've used Thunderbird on.  Eight years ago I migrated the Thunderbird info from yet an older computer, and I can't begin to remember what all was involved from that far back.  It worked and that was the goal. </p><p>Now this time, the profile folder that I copied from the old computer to the flash drive was named ""Thunderbird Data"".  I tried using that once to no success, so then I renamed it to ""Thunderbird"" (none of this actually contained the quotation marks) in order to match the destination folder, but that hasn't worked either.  My copied source folder is 4.5 GB and as I stated, I have seen many of the Thunderbird file names during the transfer so I'm pretty sure that everything needed is in there but the new program just isn't connecting with it. </p><p>I just now copied the ""Thunderbird Data"" file to the new computer and tried the new profile approach using that folder to connect to it.  No luck.  I'm at a sticking point again. </p><p>I don't know if that sheds any light on the issue, but it's worth a shot. </p>",mike79,false,0,0

Looking at the original default folders, I saw that they were all referred in the profile settings to a folder with a name such as ys1804yj.default.  I hadn't done it to that depth before.  So I created yet another new profile and connected it to that folder, and everything I had hoped for happened - it's all there just like on the old computer! </p><p>This support group is exactly what I needed, it never would have been possible for me otherwise.  Now I can go to sleep at night with something else as my last waking thoughts other than worrying if I'm ever going to get my emails to work right. </p><p>Thanks folks, you genuinely rock!

That may easily be seen as a simple confirmation of the delete, but it is really a confirmation on whether to delete remaining messages. My guess is you inadvertently clicked ok. And that would explain why there are no saved messages; they've been deleted. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

That is, the messages were moved to the destination folder without remaining also in the source folder (part of the failure mode I overlooked in the initial report). However, some proportion of the moved messages now display the January 20, 1970 date in the list of messages. I can't say how many specifically because there are many duplicates, and with now 526 of 997 messages in the destination folder showing the 1970 date, I'd have to look at each and every one to find out whether they were from the initial failure I reported (which was probably about 300 messages now that I think about it) and this new attempt.  </p><p>All that said, the only enabled extension I have are: </p><p>G-Hub-Pro, an external extension that eases integrating google mail, calendar, etc into tbird as separate tabs. Have used it forever, and it doesn't touch the 'base' message store for tbird. Remove Duplicate Messages, an old extension but one that has proven helpful on occasion (it's how I found the new dupes in the destination folder) Compact Headers, which allows toggling some of the header lines in both preview and full message view. </p><p>The compatibility checker reports the latter two extensions as a-okay, and question marks for G-Hub-Pro, which I assume is because it's not from the tbird addon's repository. But since it still happened to some degree even in troubleshoot mode, that should rule out the extensions. </p><p>Using the 'Remove Duplicate Messages' extension, it shows duplicates even of the January 20, 1970 displayed messages, but frequently with one copy showing a time of 10:30:41 PM PST and the duplicate showing 10:31.41. The sizes (Header &amp; Body) and number of lines are identical however. I haven't pulled the trigger on removing the dupes though as I don't trust the results. </p><p>I dunno. I doubt there's any way to fix this, and I can't think of any mechanism that could correct the displayed 1970 date, as the message headers nowhere show that date. </p>",anastrophe,false,0,0
