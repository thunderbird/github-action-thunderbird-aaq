Now it puts all of my new emails in the Junk folder at startup and through the day. I have to repeatedly run the Whitelist filter to get whitelisted email into the Inbox, and i also have to keep adding filters to the Whitelist because all of my email goes into the Junk folder. I have to drag emails that I prefer to have in the Trash folder into the Trash folder. (I use the Trash folder as an intermediate location for emails that I don't always read but wish to keep an eye on--it makes it a lot easier for me to scan them.) </p><p>All of my individual filters (720 of them, I think, most of them against spam) and the Whitelist filters (about 30 so far) are set to run manually and when getting new mail. </p><p>I have the impression that Thunderbird's ability to learn and remember is getting to be as bad as mise is. </p>",AlphaCat,false,0,0
