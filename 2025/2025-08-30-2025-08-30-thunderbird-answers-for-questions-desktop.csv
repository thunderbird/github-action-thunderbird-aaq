I now want to be very -- diplomatic and polite -- to ask that we all try to be more -- diplomatic and polite -- (less contentious) by respecting the ""preferences"" others have that likely differ from our own (likely with different ""costs vs benefits).  </p><p>My ""preference"" here  for ""importing"" EML files to TB 115.10 --  is in the subject line of my second request for help to ""import"" EML files -- ""using no extension"" Maybe I have a reason for that preference (I do! perhaps to be discussed). I first disclose I'm aware of a popular Extension / ""Add on"" (is there a difference?) and name it in the message -- but am only asking -- How can I do this (that I once did) using only native tools in TB 115.10 (or maybe also Win 10 tools?) </p><p>If no one can counsel me on how to do that -- sure, you bet, I'll take another closer look ImportExportTools NG -- with it's permission (access to everything). Unless costs v bennies dictate -- for me – I avoid any ""unnecessary permission” and it’s potential for any un-deliberated risk. Is there a community discussion parsing out “permissions”?  </p><p>That's leads to ""finding"" discussions -- here on ""importing EMLs"" -- that you cite  -- which I couldn't find -- try as I did (hard). Looked in ALL Mozilla / TB only / community forum / support database. Nada (for my question). Couldn’t even find my first request (still can’t) – so never even saw some of the answers you cite (that don’t answer my request -- some saying it doesn't work).  </p><p>And that leads me to quote you on your kind response -- to my quest to find a ""hard string"" search in TB. ""Thunderbird tokenizer will make that extremely difficult, if not impossible, on a global search."" Tokenizer, suggests to me maybe some ""AI"" -- that might be perfect for this support “use case"". Though I still seek a “hard string” – basic compare – here the global search seems perfect to find ALL (filtered) EML discussion. </p><p>So, in summary (finally) please don't mark my (using no extension) query as done  solved -- and hopefully there is someone, somewhere who knows my non-extension answer. Thanks. </p>",druw,false,0,0
