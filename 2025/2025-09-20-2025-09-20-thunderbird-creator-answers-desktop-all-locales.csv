Si consideri che questo problema mi accompagna da almeno tre anni, considerando che durante tale periodo ho cambiato e aggiornato diverse distro (principalmente Mint e Ubuntu) e ho anche cambiato PC. Ho anche provato a reinstallare TB, costantemente aggiornato, ho provato tanto a importare profili precedenti quanto a riconfigurare gli account da capo e riscaricare tutte le email da capo.
