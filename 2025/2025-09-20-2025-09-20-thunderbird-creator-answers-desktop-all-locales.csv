It helps with the headers and lists. But it doesn't affect message contents, even in plain text mode, or settings. </p><p>Okay, so why don't I just use the built-in font settings? Because: </p><p>1. There are different settings for different parts of the interface, and it can be hard to predict how they'll interact. </p><p>2. I need to increase the size of most text, not all. I don't want or need to increase the sizes of some larger text. I don't have enough screen space for it either. </p><p>3. I need to increase the *weight* of most text. There's a fad for thin ""elegant"" fonts, and I just can't read these. I currently use css to make headers bold, and make unread headers red for contrast. </p><p>4. I often need to change the fonts, too. Thunderbird seems to use the ""Other Writing Systems"" for message contents, which is a pain, because I need to use that for another writing system, too. </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",MarjaE
