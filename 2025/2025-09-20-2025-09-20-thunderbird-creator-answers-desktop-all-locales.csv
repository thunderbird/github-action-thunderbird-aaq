The same was true if I managed my inbox on my Thunderbird inbox on my Mac laptop -- the inbox on my iPhone reflected the changes. </p><p>I recently noticed that this no longer happens. If I manage either of my accounts inboxes on my laptop, i.e., reading/deleting/moving emails, the action is mirrored on my iPhone. However, the opposite is not working. If I manage my inbox on my iPhone the messages I delete or move all remain in my inbox on my laptop. Very annoying as I then end up having to manage the inbox twice, moving or deleting the same messages twice. </p><p>Platforms:  Macbook Pro M3 running Tahoe 26.0 and Thunderbird 140.3.0esr (aarch64).  iPhone running iOS 18.7 with native Apple Mail application </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",59qhtz9cty
