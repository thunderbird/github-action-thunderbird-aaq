I just had to switch to a different computer and am trying to get everything set up again. I have three emails accounts through Spectrum. I am able to receive emails but am unable to send them. All of the settings are correct. The problem seems to be that it keeps randomly changing the email addresses under Manage Identities. I have changed them back many, many times but they don't save. It keeps rotating among the three so when I try to send an email, I get this error message:  An error occurred while sending email. The mail server responded: sender rejected. The email address you are sending out must match the email address you used to auth. Please check your SMTP settings. AUP#Out-1500. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. Because they randomly rotate around I can send an email occasionally when it just so happens to rotate back to the correct email address but the next time it has changed again to one of the others and I get the message above. Please help. Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1705529;1705533;1705541;1705556;1705559;1705560;1705561;1705562;1705563;1705564;1705565;,cgreen82

We have two PCs with Ubuntu installed, one with the last and one with the current LTS: </p><p>On older, less powerful device where Thunderbird runs significantly better. A new PC with better hardware, more RAM more CPU cores etc where Thunderbird is extremely slow. </p><p>Both PCs are configured with the same email accounts. We did fully copy profile frm old to new to not lose any mails. However, on the new device, Thunderbird causes full CPU utilization after startup and becomes unresponsive for a considerable amount of time, every time we start. Working with it is almost impossible and painful. </p><p>Here’s what we’ve tried so far on the new PC: </p><p>Running Thunderbird in Safe Mode. Reinstalling Thunderbird without using Docker. (apk and bash commands) Unfortunately, neither of these steps resolved the issue. We suspect the problem might be related to the current Ubuntu LTS version. As already told the old computer outperformes the new one abt thunderbird. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced a similar problem or found a solution?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. What or how to test next? </p><p>Any more detail needed? I might get the hardware specs and mailbox sizes but as said newer computer is  slower and mailboxes are the same. </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>Michael </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",vogovogt
