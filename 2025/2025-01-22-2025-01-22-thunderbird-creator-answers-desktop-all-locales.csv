I just had to switch to a different computer and am trying to get everything set up again. I have three emails accounts through Spectrum. I am able to receive emails but am unable to send them. All of the settings are correct. The problem seems to be that it keeps randomly changing the email addresses under Manage Identities. I have changed them back many, many times but they don't save. It keeps rotating among the three so when I try to send an email, I get this error message:  An error occurred while sending email. The mail server responded: sender rejected. The email address you are sending out must match the email address you used to auth. Please check your SMTP settings. AUP#Out-1500. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. Because they randomly rotate around I can send an email occasionally when it just so happens to rotate back to the correct email address but the next time it has changed again to one of the others and I get the message above. Please help. Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1705529;1705533;1705541;1705556;1705559;1705560;1705561;1705562;1705563;1705564;,cgreen82

If I search for a word such as ""availability"" it returns results for ""available"" with or without double quotes.  It's a bit unhelpful that there isn't a way to force search only for what I am looking for, so I end up getting search results for the wrong thing.   </p><p>Would be nice to have a wildcard search such as ""availab*"" which would be more intuitive.   </p><p>How do I ensure it searches exactly for what I want, and not interpret my search keywords? </p><p>Cheers, Tom </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tom479
