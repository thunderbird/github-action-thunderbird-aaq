1487648,2025-01-21 16:37:27 -0800,2025-01-21 20:34:04 -0800,Email problem,"<p>I have used Thunderbird for awhile without any issues. I just had to switch to a different computer and am trying to get everything set up again. I have three emails accounts through Spectrum. I am able to receive emails but am unable to send them. All of the settings are correct. The problem seems to be that it keeps randomly changing the email addresses under Manage Identities. I have changed them back many, many times but they don't save. It keeps rotating among the three so when I try to send an email, I get this error message:  An error occurred while sending email. The mail server responded: sender rejected. The email address you are sending out must match the email address you used to auth. Please check your SMTP settings. AUP#Out-1500. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. Because they randomly rotate around I can send an email occasionally when it just so happens to rotate back to the correct email address but the next time it has changed again to one of the others and I get the message above. Please help. Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1705529;1705533;1705541;1705556;1705559;1705560;1705561;1705562;1705563;1705564;1705565;,cgreen82

If I search for a word such as ""availability"" it returns results for ""available"" with or without double quotes.

(He's very old, and getting him to change is hopeless). Thunderbird usually lets his emails into my Inbox, but also frequently forwards them to a ""Bulk"" mail folder. (I never set up such a folder, or any rule to send mails there). No amount of telling Thunderbird that none of his emails are not ""junk"" prevents this from recurring, though it does move individual emails so noted to my Inbox. How do I stop Thunderbird from diverting mails from this sender to the Bulk folder? Rules? Filters? I don't see any self-help topics that look like they address such a problem.
