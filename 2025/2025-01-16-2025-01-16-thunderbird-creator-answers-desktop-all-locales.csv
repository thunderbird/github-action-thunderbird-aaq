When I go to compose an email it allows me to type email as usual but there is no send button or option to send when I right click the screen. I got someone to send me an email as a test but I did not receive the email. My email address is ianwil@interlog.com.  </p><p>Please let me know. </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ianwil62
