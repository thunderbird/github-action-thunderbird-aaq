Started from Ubuntu 20 or so it periodically stops receiving mails from pop yahoo account. Nothing described in community threads helps. It can be for month, two or three, then at some moment it starts receiving emails(nothing changed, even server not restarted, thunderbird keeps hanging not receiving emaiils) and receives for some period(can be couple of days or few weeks). after that it can stop receiving again and it hangs for long.  This situation is for few years for now. last time it stopped receiving emails in mid of December. before this it was working fine for couple of months.   As nothing changes on my side I assume issue is on yahoo? </pre> <p>current release: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS 128.6.0esr (64-bit) </p><pre> When not receiving emails I can see following in error log: </pre> <p>op3.server2.1: NetworkTimeoutError: a Network error occurred Pop3Client.sys.mjs:380:18 </p><pre>   _onError resource:///modules/Pop3Client.sys.mjs:380 </pre> <p>pop3.server2.1: SecurityError info: Pop3Client.sys.mjs:422:20 </p><pre>   _onError resource:///modules/Pop3Client.sys.mjs:422 </pre> <p>​ </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Filmoscope
