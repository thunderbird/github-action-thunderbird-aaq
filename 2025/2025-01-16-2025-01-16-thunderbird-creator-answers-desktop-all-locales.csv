Her previous computer had a linux OS. The problem was that we just discovered recently that she did not have all of the email addresses in her address book.  So, I endeavored to correct that.  I found instructions on the web that told me to copy the abook.map file from her old computer and paste it into the profile folder of her new computer and then start up Thunderbird on the new Mac computer and import an address book, that is the one I just pasted into the profile folder.  I did this and the emails addresses in the new address book were there and good.  Meanwhile, I was running Thunderbird on the old linux computer at the same time and I noticed at the bottom of the window some small numbers that looked like they were reporting on the number of messages being downloaded.  I was puzzled about this.  The old computer's Thunderbird did not show any new emails in the normal window.  When I went back to the new iMac computer and opened Thunderbird there were no emails in the inbox!  Surprise!  What happened to our emails?

I used multiple methods to ""move"" a 3GB Profile folder from the latest version of Thunderbird on Win10 to the same version of TB on Linux Mint. </p><p>I have 1 active (used daily) account and 2 inactive accounts with emails and other account data downloaded for offline viewing. All emails and child folders for ALL 3 accounts are visible and accessible in TB on Win10. </p><p>After moving the profile folder (i tried C&amp;P, Import/Export add-on tool, and Profile Manager, etc.) all methods work fine. I can see all child folders under each of the 3 accounts until... I close TB on Linux Mint 22. </p><p>When I close and reopen it, the 2 inactive accounts only show the Inbox folder with NO emails inside, but everything is fine with the 3rd active account. All emails and child folders are the same as in TB on Win10. I have no idea WHY and worst of all, how can I solve this problem? Thanks in advance for any suggestions that will help solve this problem. W </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",siekierkawojtek20
