It also won^t let me create any new Outbox subfolder. So I currently cannot see any of my recently send emails, while all older emails send out, that were archived in the local folder, are still visible/accessible. When searching in the Troubleshoot Information menu I cannot find the “Open Folder” feature - so I don’t know how to fix the problem through trouble shooting. Please advise and what to do.

How can I avoid TB to show me again and again that it's not able to connect that account? I just want to keep the already received/sent emails there in TB but it goes on and on showing that message even if I don't work on that account via TB anymore. </p><p>I've tried to unflag the option to check new messages from the Server options, but it didn't work. I've also tried to move all the emails/folder on local folders via TB interface, but this was made just partially possible because TB tried to login possibly due to some still-not-downloaded old messages which where made impossible to move. Moving all to a local folder will let me delete the account from TB and set me free from that annoying message which is also causing TB to be resource consuming, I don't know why, so that the laptop fan goes crazy (in such case, quitting TB causes the laptop fan to be back in peace in seconds). </p><p>Thanks.
