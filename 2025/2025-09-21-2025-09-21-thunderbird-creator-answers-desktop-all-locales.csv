I promise I used community search! I just didn't find anything that looked fitting. </p><p>In short: I'm using Thunderbird on my Windows PC. It can happen that I don't turn on my PC for weeks in a row and will get my emails done in TB for Android. Thunderbird on my PC is configured to download and then delete mails from my provider, so that the mailbox doesn't hit storage limits over time. </p><p>So, when I turn on my PC and run Thunderbird, there are usually a few hundred emails that it has to fetch, and I have a number of filtering rules to sort the more important messages into subfolders. When that's done, though, Thunderbird gives me OS-native notifications for every subfolder that has ""received"" new emails. I'm not sure if that's really true, but I think the issue began after support OS-native notifications was introduced. Alternatively: Maybe that behavior was the same before, but it didn't get on my nerves as much 🤔. </p><p>What I'd prefer: One notification per inbox. ""me@home.com has 99+ new mails"" instead of ""me@home.com: 13 new messages in 'Personal'"", ""me@home.com: 7 new emails in 'My Bank'"", ""me@home.com: 97 new emails in 'Princes offering me money'"". These individual notifications are especially frustrating because Windows give me more than enough time to read them, and there's a little cooldown period before the next notification comes. It can literally take a minute until Windows is done giving me all the notifications. I can accellerate that by manually dismissing each one, but those 1-2 seconds of cooldown before the next notification appears don't make that an enjoyable experience. This cooldown period gives you, if only for a split second, the illusion of ""oh, maybe that was the last one"" - but then: ""Syke! Here's the next one"". </p><p>Is it possible to configure this to give me less fine-grained notifications? I only found the option to turn them off entirely. I would use that as a last resort, but it would be nice if this is maybe already known, if there's a way for me to change my settings accordingly, or if there's a plan/commitment to fix this. </p><p>Thanks!
