I have had a look through TB settings etc., but can't locate anything that indicates that that 'tab' is selectable. Regarding your comment that you experienced this problem from Friday (21st), it got me thinking about TB updates.   I then found that I had an update on 21st November, to version 140.5.0esr at 4:41;37 (Mozilla Time). Coincidence or not??? I have been trying for over an hour to find a way to go back to my previous version (140.4.0esr), to see if that solves the problem.   I cannot find a way to either revert back or install that 'older' version.   All of the searches I've done point to being able to uninstall TB and then re-install selecting the required version.   I have not found that option anywhere, and have finished up back on version 140.5.0 (which seems to be shown as 145.0.0. on TB. Short of starting another question, to ask if there could be a problem with the update, I don't know what to do. (I am even considering going back to the dark side and installing MS Outlook).

One reason why it might work is that Thunderbird may be multi-threading to check four accounts at the same time and, since your network connection seems fast, it doesn't have much time to display the status messages for each. I have only one account. On the rare occasions when I want to read the status bar, the messages appear long enough to be read. </p><p>It may also be that Thunderbird is programmed to display each message for only a set period of time, and this approach will have no effect. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
