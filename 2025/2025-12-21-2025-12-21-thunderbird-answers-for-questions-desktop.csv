I stopped using their email decades ago (perhaps only one) just as I stopped using their hopelessly incompetent support line.  Neither actually worked as advertised and to make matters worse the support folk were in total ignorance of anything that was not in the script they read from and having matter elevated to level two support where folk that actually knew what email was worked generally took a complaint to the ombudsman. </p><p>Zero real support from the telstra support line.
