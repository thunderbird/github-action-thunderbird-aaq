The server is considered canonical in that process so if there is nothing on the server any update to local profiles from a backup to put the mails back will immediately see them deleted to match the server. </p><p>If you have a copy of the files (the inbox etc files from the Thunderbird profile,  copy them to a USN drive. </p><p>Install the importexport tools add-on in Thunderbird and import from those files to local folders. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>You can later try and copy the individual email from local folders to the gmail account,  but it will be slow anf gmail will fight you all the way.  batches not exceeding 500 email is probably the most you can copy at a time and remember there is a daily bandwidth limit on gmail so if you previously had a large store you may find many days of using the daily limit are required to move things back to where they used to be, </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I stopped using their email decades ago (perhaps only one) just as I stopped using their hopelessly incompetent support line.  Neither actually worked as advertised and to make matters worse the support folk were in total ignorance of anything that was not in the script they read from and having matter elevated to level two support where folk that actually knew what email was worked generally took a complaint to the ombudsman. </p><p>Zero real support from the telstra support line.  I used to just end up fighting with them as the fumbled and transferred me yet again to someone else in the hope of loosing the call and generally made me aware that I was not in control and they had not idea who actually was and cared even less. </p><p>I think I recall a recent change to their service where they changed all of their server settings for old bigpond accounts to use telstra branded servers.  So let's start with you advising what settings you have in account settings for incoming and outgoing server (SMTP) and we can compare them to those published by telstra here <a href=""https://www.telstra.com.au/support/email/imap-pop-smtp-mail-server-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.telstra.com.au/support/email/imap-pop-smtp-mail-server-settings</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
