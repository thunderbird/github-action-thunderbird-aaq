As I understand the steps, - you receive a jpg from a gmail account and store the jpg on your computer. do you then open the jpg from hard drive to validate?  - next, you compose a message and attach the jpg to the message and send - then, the recipients don't receive the attachment.  </p><p>Is the attachment in your sent folder? have you tried sending message with that attachment to yourself?

(see attached photo).

Once I am logged on it does not appear again.  Don't forget about the second item I reported. For some reason, the ""recent destinations"" list is no longer shown in alphabetical order and it had been alphabetical all the time prior. </p>",romcinsam,false,0,0

Go to the notification center (windowskey+N) and determine what the text of the message is.  This is exactly the same sort of thing my wife iphone does when she gets message,  it shows who the message is from and replaces the message with the word private. I guess windows is also doing exactly the same thing. It is probably some message about how many new email you got.  but you need to start using the notifications center as if is at the core of windows notifications.  The days of popups in applications telling you when things happen are numbered and most of Thunderbird's notification have already been converted to the new standard. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I found the source of the issue but have to ask why did it start doing this&nbsp;? This was not the case for many years that I have used Thunderbird. And the notification refers to ESR which makes no sense since my version is on the release channel and ESR is typically something businesses use (based on some research I did). I can turn it off and will do that but something triggered it so this may be a bug because if I have it others probably will too and you may hear from them as well. </p><p>As far as the ""recent destinations"" sort issue, I have to tell you that I am disappointed with the explanation. I have worked in IT for a short while and have always marveled at how many times something is changed in a system that makes it worse and not better: i.e. used to be one click and now it's multiple clicks. Perhaps it was a ""bug"" for someone, but realistically it now takes longer to search and find a recent destination for me since it is no longer alphabetical. The difference is only notable for those of us that move messages to folders daily like me. I don't expect to have this changed back and will have to adjust but maybe it could be a best practice to look at bugs more closely to review their impact before resolving them. Sorry for bending your ear with my rant. I meant no disrespect to what you do. I hope you have a Merry Christmas.  I'll make another donation to the cause the next time you're fund raising to show my gratitude. </p>",romcinsam,false,0,0
