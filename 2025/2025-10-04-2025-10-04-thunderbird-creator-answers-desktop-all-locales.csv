In the past month (or two, I'm not sure) Thunderbird just stopped receiving new e-mails on 3 different occasions. No error messages or anything, I always notice only when the sender calls/texts me, asking me about an e-mail I didn't get which is very annoying. When this happens, Thunderbird seems to work normally (I can browse all the mailboxes, move e-mails between folders etc.) but it just never downloads new messages from any of the mailboxes (not even when I hit F5 or the ""Get messages"" button - which normally displays a brief ""Host contacted, sending login information..."" message in the status bar but does absolutely nothing when this problem occurs). When I spot this problem and kill Thunderbird via task manager (closing normally doesn't help because it will still run in the background) and run it again, it immediately downloads the missing e-mails on startup and resumes working normally. But I'm getting really nervous about possibly missing important message(s) because Thunderbird is my primary (and for 99 % of time, the only) way of accessing my mailboxes (I only login to the web UI when I suspect Gmail or other web hosts to false flag an e-mail from legit sender as spam - but I typically only do this couple times a year). </p><p>My Thunderbird is (always) up to date (v 140.3.1esr). </p><p>Do you have any idea how to fix this, please?

My current PC is running Windows 10. I am thoroughly frustrated to the point where I might just switch to Outlook! </p><p>First some basic parameters. </p><p>On a ""techie"" skill level I am about a 3 on a scale of 10.  I have been a Thurderbird user for a long time, 15+ years. The Thunderbird version on the Windows 10 PC is 140.3.1esr(32-bit) The Thurderbird version on the Windows 11 PC is 143.0.0(64-bit) I managed to stumble through a Thunderbird migration change 6 years ago when I purchased my current Windows 10 PC. </p><p>Here are the issues I am having. </p><p>1. I do not know how to locate and transfer to the new PC all of my contacts. 2. I do not know how to locate and transfer the sent mail history. 3. The Windows 11 PC version is not synchronizing with the mail server (<a href=""http://Comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Comcast.net</a>). When I read, delete, or move an email it is still showing as unread on my other devices. (The Windows 10 PC, iPad, iPhone) Conversely, if I read an email on one of the other devices, it still shows as unread on the Window 11 PC. 4. The is no Junk mail showing in the Junk folder on the Windows 11 PC, but junk mail will show in the Junk folder on the Windows 10 PC. I clean the Junk folder regularly. However, the junk mail is being filter out on the Windows 11 PC because it is not showing in the Inbox. 5. (Somewhat minor) On the Windows 11 machine the preview panel is on the right. On the Windows 10 machine the preview panel on the bottom. I prefer the bottom. I don't see in settings were to change this. </p><p>What I have done so far: 1. I compared setting for setting from the old PC to the new PC. I noticed in the new Windows 11 version there is no settings called ""Message Synchronizing"". 2. I was able to locate the file that contained all of my local files. I copied it to the new PC and directed Thurderbird to use this file. Works fine. 3. I have read the Help instructions for ""How do I find my profile"", ""Moving a profile"", Backing up a profile"", Restoring a profile backup"", Method using a transfer device"", and ""An alternative method for manual transfer between Windows 10 and Windows 11 computers"". </p><p>As state above, my skill level is about a 3. When I start dealing with hidden files I am getting beyond my skill level. </p><p>My questions are: 1. Since Thunderbird seems to be setup and running, although not how I like, is it necessary to do the transfers described in the Help articles. Would I be over writing the manual setup I have completed when I compared the setup pages from the old and new PCs? 2. Can the files name for where the contacts are store be provided so I can manually copy over? I would think this would not be a hidden file. 3. How do I get the Windows 11 version to synchronize with the Comcast mail server? If the synchronizing occurs, will I get all of the ""Sent"" history or is this in a file that needs to be copied. FYI, the emails I sent from the Windows 11 PC has synchronized to the Windows 10 PC. 4. What are the settings for the Junk mail. The settings on the Windows 10 PC and the Windows 11 PC are the same. 5. Last but not least, how do I get the preview pane on the bottom.&nbsp;:-) </p><p>Thanks, and HELP! </p><p>Mike Jacks </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,1769680;,mleeja

I have three accounts set up: two comcast and one gmail.   The gmail and one comcast account appear to be all right. When I try to access the comcast one I call main, I receive the window shown in the uploaded image.  It seems as if TB has somehow forgotten the way it accesses ""main"" accounts.  I have verified that the ""main"" account is fine on the comcast server by logging into it.  The question is if I remove the TB ""main"" account and recreate it, will I lose any messages?  Is this likely to correct the issue? </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",norisezp
