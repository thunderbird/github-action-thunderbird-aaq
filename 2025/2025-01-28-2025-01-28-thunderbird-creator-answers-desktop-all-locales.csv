This used to be INSTANT and now it takes an extremely long period of time when you consider how many new emails a person gets overnight. The cursor actually beachballs literally every time. </p><p>Thunderbird does not do this on version 128.5.2esr - that version is quick and snappy no matter what I do. </p>",performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",isleofgreg

I am using the option ""INDEX=MEMORY"" which is meant to allow for this.  </p><p>The issue does not occur with Thunderbird on Android, only my Desktop client on Linux. </p><p>Anyone have any suggestions? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Adam </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1707114;,adam-firefoxsync

We've been using version 58 and lately updated to 115 and faced some authentication problems. Usually TB used the kerberos authentication method so when user started the app it automatically logged them into their mail account using domain credentials. After the update, the app started to request credentials after every app restart/computer reboot (it doesn't forget password but the login, too). This applies only to personal accounts, if there were some common mails like department@orgname.com, they still remain </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",killpretty071
