This used to be INSTANT and now it takes an extremely long period of time when you consider how many new emails a person gets overnight. The cursor actually beachballs literally every time. </p><p>Thunderbird does not do this on version 128.5.2esr - that version is quick and snappy no matter what I do. </p>",performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",isleofgreg

I am using the option ""INDEX=MEMORY"" which is meant to allow for this.  </p><p>The issue does not occur with Thunderbird on Android, only my Desktop client on Linux. </p><p>Anyone have any suggestions? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Adam </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",adam-firefoxsync
