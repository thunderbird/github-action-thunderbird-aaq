This used to be INSTANT and now it takes an extremely long period of time when you consider how many new emails a person gets overnight. The cursor actually beachballs literally every time. </p><p>Thunderbird does not do this on version 128.5.2esr - that version is quick and snappy no matter what I do. </p>",performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",isleofgreg

1489034,2025-01-28 00:55:38 -0800,2025-01-28 00:55:38 -0800,Integrated translation,"<p>Hello. I want to have integrated translation with Google Translate. I added the extension WebTranslate 5.8. I selected on that extension to use Google Translate. I realize that Mozilla does not make or support Google Translate or WebTranslate, but I think I can solve this problem with some fancy footwork on the Thunderbird side. First, I have two email accounts - both run by Google (University Accounts subcontracted to Google). My primary email account on Thunderbird (the first one I added, the one appearing on top) has only limited Google services available - 8 of them - which do not include translate. My secondary email account on Thunderbird (the one I added second, appearing on bottom) would have access to the full suite of Google services. The extension does offer me an option of switching my Google accounts, but when I select the second account, the window goes blank and does not offer me a chance to input a password. If there is a way to tell Thunderbird that my second email account should be my primary one, and my primary one second, this would solve the issue I think, and I really don't care which one is first. Ideally this can be accomplished without erasing everything and starting over. OR, if there are other extensions that can accomplish this, I assume they might not get hung up when I try to switch Google accounts and that could also work. I appreciate anyone who can offer a solution. Thank you </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",adam.rose

This isn't all the time, just occasionally, but it is often enough to be irritating. I never had this problem before. My pc uses Windows 7 - has an update to Thunderbird been produced that doen't like the old OS? Should I go back to an older version of Thunderbird? I have a similar problem (not working with Win 7) with other programs (eg Garmin), and I have to ignore notification of updates on them to keep them working. The older version of Garmin works fine with Win 7. </p><p>Please note I use Mailwasher before I start Thunderbird. Mailwasher allows me to see if there are any emails waiting for me on (I assume) my ISP's server. I can then delete those I dont want or are suspicious of, before they get on my pc. Having deleted those, I can then start Thunderbird, and I tell Thunderbird to download the remaining emails, not Thunderbird downloading automatically.
