This used to be INSTANT and now it takes an extremely long period of time when you consider how many new emails a person gets overnight. The cursor actually beachballs literally every time. </p><p>Thunderbird does not do this on version 128.5.2esr - that version is quick and snappy no matter what I do. </p>",performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",isleofgreg

I am using the option ""INDEX=MEMORY"" which is meant to allow for this.  </p><p>The issue does not occur with Thunderbird on Android, only my Desktop client on Linux. </p><p>Anyone have any suggestions? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Adam </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",adam-firefoxsync

How do I do configure the email to input the secure mail key?  Do I need to create a new secure mail key for this machine?  If I do, how do I get Thunderbird to recognize it? </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1707101;,dvd764dksf
