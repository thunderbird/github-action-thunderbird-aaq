This used to be INSTANT and now it takes an extremely long period of time when you consider how many new emails a person gets overnight. The cursor actually beachballs literally every time. </p><p>Thunderbird does not do this on version 128.5.2esr - that version is quick and snappy no matter what I do. </p>",performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",isleofgreg

We've been using version 58 and lately updated to 115 and faced some authentication problems. Usually TB used the kerberos authentication method so when user started the app it automatically logged them into their mail account using domain credentials. After the update, the app started to request credentials after every app restart/computer reboot (it doesn't forget password but the login, too). This applies only to personal accounts, if there were some common mails like department@orgname.com, they still remain </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",killpretty071

1489034,2025-01-28 00:55:38 -0800,2025-01-28 00:55:38 -0800,Integrated translation,"<p>Hello. I want to have integrated translation with Google Translate. I added the extension WebTranslate 5.8. I selected on that extension to use Google Translate. I realize that Mozilla does not make or support Google Translate or WebTranslate, but I think I can solve this problem with some fancy footwork on the Thunderbird side. First, I have two email accounts - both run by Google (University Accounts subcontracted to Google). My primary email account on Thunderbird (the first one I added, the one appearing on top) has only limited Google services available - 8 of them - which do not include translate. My secondary email account on Thunderbird (the one I added second, appearing on bottom) would have access to the full suite of Google services. The extension does offer me an option of switching my Google accounts, but when I select the second account, the window goes blank and does not offer me a chance to input a password. If there is a way to tell Thunderbird that my second email account should be my primary one, and my primary one second, this would solve the issue I think, and I really don't care which one is first. Ideally this can be accomplished without erasing everything and starting over. OR, if there are other extensions that can accomplish this, I assume they might not get hung up when I try to switch Google accounts and that could also work. I appreciate anyone who can offer a solution. Thank you </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",adam.rose
