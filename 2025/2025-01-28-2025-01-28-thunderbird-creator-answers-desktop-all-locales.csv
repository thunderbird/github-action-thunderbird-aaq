I want to have integrated translation with Google Translate. I added the extension WebTranslate 5.8. I selected on that extension to use Google Translate. I realize that Mozilla does not make or support Google Translate or WebTranslate, but I think I can solve this problem with some fancy footwork on the Thunderbird side. First, I have two email accounts - both run by Google (University Accounts subcontracted to Google). My primary email account on Thunderbird (the first one I added, the one appearing on top) has only limited Google services available - 8 of them - which do not include translate. My secondary email account on Thunderbird (the one I added second, appearing on bottom) would have access to the full suite of Google services. The extension does offer me an option of switching my Google accounts, but when I select the second account, the window goes blank and does not offer me a chance to input a password. If there is a way to tell Thunderbird that my second email account should be my primary one, and my primary one second, this would solve the issue I think, and I really don't care which one is first. Ideally this can be accomplished without erasing everything and starting over. OR, if there are other extensions that can accomplish this, I assume they might not get hung up when I try to switch Google accounts and that could also work. I appreciate anyone who can offer a solution. Thank you </p>",adam.rose;sfhowes;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:134.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/134.0,1,0,0,,,
