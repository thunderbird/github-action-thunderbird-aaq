This used to be INSTANT and now it takes an extremely long period of time when you consider how many new emails a person gets overnight.

1489034,2025-01-28 00:55:38 -0800,2025-01-28 10:52:36 -0800,Integrated translation,"<p>Hello. I want to have integrated translation with Google Translate. I added the extension WebTranslate 5.8. I selected on that extension to use Google Translate. I realize that Mozilla does not make or support Google Translate or WebTranslate, but I think I can solve this problem with some fancy footwork on the Thunderbird side. First, I have two email accounts - both run by Google (University Accounts subcontracted to Google). My primary email account on Thunderbird (the first one I added, the one appearing on top) has only limited Google services available - 8 of them - which do not include translate. My secondary email account on Thunderbird (the one I added second, appearing on bottom) would have access to the full suite of Google services. The extension does offer me an option of switching my Google accounts, but when I select the second account, the window goes blank and does not offer me a chance to input a password. If there is a way to tell Thunderbird that my second email account should be my primary one, and my primary one second, this would solve the issue I think, and I really don't care which one is first. Ideally this can be accomplished without erasing everything and starting over. OR, if there are other extensions that can accomplish this, I assume they might not get hung up when I try to switch Google accounts and that could also work. I appreciate anyone who can offer a solution. Thank you </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1707276;,adam.rose

The older version of Garmin works fine with Win 7. </p><p>Please note I use Mailwasher before I start Thunderbird. Mailwasher allows me to see if there are any emails waiting for me on (I assume) my ISP's server. I can then delete those I dont want or are suspicious of, before they get on my pc.

A couple of days ago I selected download 500 new messages.  Instead of downloading new messages it downloaded a bunch of old messages from last year.  Many of these old messages would not open to read, I would just get an error message when I clicked on them.   This morning I sorted all of the messages by date then began to delete all messages from 2024.  When I loaded up the newsgroup the folder was empty except for one message thread from yesterday, but the message count said there were several hundred unread messages in the group.  I tried various trouble shooting solutions like clearing the cache and starting in trouble shooting mode.  Nothing worked, but when I restarted Thunderbird it was now completely empty with no messages.  I have tried to download new messages several times, but nothing new will download. </p><p>How can I restore Thunderbird and get it to download messages again? </p><p>If I have to reinstall, is there a way to do that keeps my history?
