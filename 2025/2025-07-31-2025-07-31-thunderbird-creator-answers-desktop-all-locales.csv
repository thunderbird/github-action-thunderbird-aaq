There is no ""Collapse All"" option on a right-click of a folder which has been suggested. Deleting folderTree.json and session.json only opens with the configuration that it most recently closed with. I just started using Betterbird, version 128.13.0esr-bb31. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1752949;,jimmyleg66

This means that I may have 3 or 4 of those subfolders open in tabs at any given time.  It also means that the folder list display shows every folder AND SUBFOLDER, including those I am not working with.   </p><p>However, I can't just close the parent folder to hide the subfolder list because that closes the subfolder I am working with and changes the tab to the parent folder's label, which of course contains no messages.  To continue working with that subfolder, I have to go back to the parent folder and expand it again, which in turn expands the list to show all the subfolders in the folder list.   </p><p>This creates a lot of clutter in that list.  It would be much easier to work with that list if I could collapse the parent folder to hide the subfolders without interfering with the subfolder tabs I have open. </p><p>To test: Create a folder Friends Add subfolders Friend A, Friend B, Friend C Add emails to each folder. Expand the parent Friends folder in the folder list.  This shows the 3 subfolders. Open the Friend A and Friend B subfolders in tabs. Close the parent Friends folder in the folder list.  This will cause whichever tab you last worked with (Friend A or Friend B) to revert to displaying the parent Friends folder label, which of course will have no messages under it.  To keep working with those messages, you have to open the subfolder again, which requires expanding the parent Friends folder in the folder list. <strong>Collapsing the Parent Folder in the folder list should have no impact on whichever subfolders are open in tabs. </strong>  </p><p>I am usually working with 3 or 4 folders that each have 20 or more subfolders.  With all of them displayed in the folder list this creates a lot of unnecessary clutter in the list if I am working with only a couple of subfolders from each folder open in tabs </p><p>I switched from Eudora to Tbird a decade ago.  Eudora always behaved correctly in that closing a folder in the folder list did not close whatever subfolders were open in tabs.  I've never understood why Tbird didn't behave the same way. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",sllo1
