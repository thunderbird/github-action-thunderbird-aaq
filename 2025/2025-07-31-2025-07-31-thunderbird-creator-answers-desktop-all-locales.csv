This means that I may have 3 or 4 of those subfolders open in tabs at any given time.  It also means that the folder list display shows every folder AND SUBFOLDER, including those I am not working with.   </p><p>However, I can't just close the parent folder to hide the subfolder list because that closes the subfolder I am working with and changes the tab to the parent folder's label, which of course contains no messages.  To continue working with that subfolder, I have to go back to the parent folder and expand it again, which in turn expands the list to show all the subfolders in the folder list.   </p><p>This creates a lot of clutter in that list.  It would be much easier to work with that list if I could collapse the parent folder to hide the subfolders without interfering with the subfolder tabs I have open. </p><p>To test: Create a folder Friends Add subfolders Friend A, Friend B, Friend C Add emails to each folder. Expand the parent Friends folder in the folder list.  This shows the 3 subfolders. Open the Friend A and Friend B subfolders in tabs. Close the parent Friends folder in the folder list.  This will cause whichever tab you last worked with (Friend A or Friend B) to revert to displaying the parent Friends folder label, which of course will have no messages under it.  To keep working with those messages, you have to open the subfolder again, which requires expanding the parent Friends folder in the folder list. <strong>Collapsing the Parent Folder in the folder list should have no impact on whichever subfolders are open in tabs. </strong>  </p><p>I am usually working with 3 or 4 folders that each have 20 or more subfolders.  With all of them displayed in the folder list this creates a lot of unnecessary clutter in the list if I am working with only a couple of subfolders from each folder open in tabs </p><p>I switched from Eudora to Tbird a decade ago.  Eudora always behaved correctly in that closing a folder in the folder list did not close whatever subfolders were open in tabs.  I've never understood why Tbird didn't behave the same way. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1753079;,sllo1

The server for my Internet Service Provider (ISP) was POP3. Consequently, I set up a POP3 account and created Message Filters to move inbox emails directly into my Local Folders and Sub Folders. My ISP has now changed their server to IMAP. After consultations with them I created a new account named [my current email address (IMAP)] and used their Incoming Mail settings and Out Going SMTP settings.Their additional advice was to delete ONLY my POP3 account BUT NOT Local Folders. On the positive side, all emails are arriving in [my current email address (IMAP)]. On the negative side, nothing is split into the Local Folders. Because I have not found a suitable answer in the Community Forums' pages, I will ask; Q1. Is it possible to move the Message Filters onto the ISP's IMAP server so they put messages into the folders before incoming to the desktop PC?  If yes, then how? Q2. Is it possible to change some settings in Thunderbird so the incoming emails follow the Message Filters details to distribute into the Local Folders? If yes, then how? Q3. At the moment, I am leaving incoming messages in my inbox. However, I am able to drag and drop from the inbox into their respective Local Folders and Sub Folders. Is this the only way to sort them? If not, then how to set up an alternative simple system? Regards, Colin (Yorky) </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1753082;,colin.broadbent

I'm using Windows 10 and Thunderbird 140.1.0esr. </p><p>I'm self-employed and desperately need access to Thunderbird.  This has happened many times over the years, where it randomly stops working, then mysteriously fixes it on it's own.
