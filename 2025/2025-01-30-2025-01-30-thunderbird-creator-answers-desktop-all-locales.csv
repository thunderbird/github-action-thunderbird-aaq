I was able to connect to my ISP email server but it ended up showing no new emails even though I know that I have emails as I am able to see them on my iPhone. So thinking that something changed, I removed my account details from Thunderbird and try to reconnect.  The first stage, the detection of my ISP email server passed with no problems. </p><p>See the first attachment. </p><p>So after seeing this, I click on the Done button and then the problem arises. </p><p>See the second attachment. </p><p>Now to cover some other important information. I talked with my ISP and we checked the configuration manually that is shown in both attachments and they were completely correct to their files.  No deviation in any manner.  We trip POP3 and also IMAP settings and still got the same error as the second attachment. I and the tech support person from my ISP also checked the typing of my password, the original one and even the new password 10x.  I also typed each character of my password slowly, just in case I typed it wrong having it visible to me and invisible to me and still got the same error as the second attachment. Also the images are from today January 29, 2025 approximately from the last 20 minutes.  So this is fresh for an attempt to connect to my ISP email server, not just from some previous attempt. </p><p>Hopefully I can get a work around from the forum.  Oh, one more thing I have the latest Mozilla Thunderbird that is available and that is Version 128.6.1esr (64-bit) as I had updated it before I attempted to connect to the ISP email server.  I have done no uninstalls. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1707668;,pintaric

First problem here: It has the mail account, which I added to Thunderbird most recently, prefilled instead of my primary mail account or the account connected to the calendar where I add the event to. I couldn't find a place to change this. But then, when I change it to a mail address connected to my calendars, I'd expect it to populate my timeline with the events in these calendars. But it stays empty. Also, when I add other people, it stays completely empty. I wasn't able to have anything appear in this timeline at any point. Where am I going wrong? How do I add my available and unavailable times for this timeline and share them with people, who might be interest to schedule me around them?

Trabalho em uma empresa onde todos os emails institucionais são instalados no thunderbird, alguns dias atras foi trocado o provedor do site e precisei fazer algumas instalações em algumas maquinas, porém por desatenção minha não verifiquei se a maquina estava com a configuração pop ou imap e acabei excluindo o email e instalando novamente  e ao perceber que os emails não retornaram analisei que a maquina estava na configuração pop. Minha dúvida é eu consigo recuperar esses email que estão na maquina? Pois eu tentei reinstalar em pop e mesmo assim os emails não retornam e ao analisar a pasta do perfil, percebi que o tamanho da pasta não mudou mas os emails não retornam para o thunderbird. </p><p>Desde já agradeço a atenção de todos! </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,pt-BR,"",neloboladao

AGAIN.,"<p>For the 3rd time in the past 10 months, I cannot receive or send emails through Thunderbird on my laptop. Again, a pop-up states IP address is temporarily blacklisted and another states cannot login to imap.comcast. This always happens after a Thunderbird automatic update. (Last auto-update was Jan. 22, 2025. Haven't been able to access Thunderbird email since then. Have checked settings and all are set as required. Have reset modem and router. Have deleted all junk emails. Know it's not a Comcast issue as I am getting my Comcast emails on my cell phone via my BlueMail email app. (But cannot work on emailed documents on my cell phone.) The other 2 times this happened, email began loading after 10 days of no activity. No rhyme or reason. Have checked the box for a status update but reports come through via email... which is currently not accessible via Thunderbird. Why does this continue to happen? Please help! </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",mjbolin
