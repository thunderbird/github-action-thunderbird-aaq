I was able to connect to my ISP email server but it ended up showing no new emails even though I know that I have emails as I am able to see them on my iPhone. So thinking that something changed, I removed my account details from Thunderbird and try to reconnect.  The first stage, the detection of my ISP email server passed with no problems. </p><p>See the first attachment. </p><p>So after seeing this, I click on the Done button and then the problem arises. </p><p>See the second attachment. </p><p>Now to cover some other important information. I talked with my ISP and we checked the configuration manually that is shown in both attachments and they were completely correct to their files.  No deviation in any manner.  We trip POP3 and also IMAP settings and still got the same error as the second attachment. I and the tech support person from my ISP also checked the typing of my password, the original one and even the new password 10x.  I also typed each character of my password slowly, just in case I typed it wrong having it visible to me and invisible to me and still got the same error as the second attachment. Also the images are from today January 29, 2025 approximately from the last 20 minutes.  So this is fresh for an attempt to connect to my ISP email server, not just from some previous attempt. </p><p>Hopefully I can get a work around from the forum.  Oh, one more thing I have the latest Mozilla Thunderbird that is available and that is Version 128.6.1esr (64-bit) as I had updated it before I attempted to connect to the ISP email server.  I have done no uninstalls. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1707668;,pintaric

Let's say, we are a group of 5 people, all using Thunderbird as their Mail driver and managing our calendars in Thunderbird. When I create an event in my calendar and hit 'Invite Attendees', it opens a Window with a timeline and a list of mail addresses.  First problem here: It has the mail account, which I added to Thunderbird most recently, prefilled instead of my primary mail account or the account connected to the calendar where I add the event to. I couldn't find a place to change this. But then, when I change it to a mail address connected to my calendars, I'd expect it to populate my timeline with the events in these calendars. But it stays empty. Also, when I add other people, it stays completely empty. I wasn't able to have anything appear in this timeline at any point. Where am I going wrong?

Right now I am using Firefox.  About three years ago I gave my State's Court system access to my Comcast email address, which syncs with Thunderbird.  About two days ago I found, before I saved previously one of the attached documents, that the PDF Court initiated attachments no longer opened.  I have not dismissed some kind of administrative mischief at their end on the part of some IT professional they employ.  Instead of opening the document, they instead open a tab showing the message thread to which they attached the original PDF.  Since these are Court documents, and their is personal injury involved, of course they are important to me.  So, I am interested in recovering these documents.  Does my Thunderbird, which I constantly check for updates as I do Firefox and this whole Mac Monterey system, need some kind of repair?  Unfortunately, since I have a Windows 10 with Thunderbird (Microsoft no longer supporting its original Mail program), these messages do not appear in that installment of Thunderbird.  These messages go back to 2022; and on the Windows 10, the oldest messages only go back to 2023.  Again, I hope somebody knows a simple fix.

However, this makes it less worthwhile to have a default email account - and considering that I also have Windows 10, which no longer supports its Mail app, careful research substantiated that TB was the best replacement.

It seems completely arbitrary as to which existing email accounts can be drag and dropped and which cannot.  The online ""HELP"" instructions for this function are completely outdated, written for an earlier version of the software, and are no help at all. The whole process of creating a mailing group that has several (30-40 or more) existing email addresses in it is a giant task if one cannot drag and drop those into the group. It is as if whoever designed the mail group function did not expect anyone to set up anything but small groups. Please fix this function!!
