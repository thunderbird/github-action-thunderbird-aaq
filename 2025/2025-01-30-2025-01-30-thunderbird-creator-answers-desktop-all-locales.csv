I still receive incoming emails as normal, and all other functions seem to work. But I cannot send. When I switch to Trouble-shooting mode, I can send emails, but when I switch back to regular mode, I can't send. I can save the email, but when I click ""send"" the send button and all the other buttons at the top of the window fade, and nothing happens. I have not changed any settings in Thunderbird or my email provider (Kolabnow). I have checked and the settings are exactly as Kolab requires: <a href=""http://smtp.kolabnow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.kolabnow.com</a> .... Port 465 ... SSL/TLS.  Thunderbird updates automatically, so I'm running the latest version. I'm on Mac OS 13.5.2 (Ventura). How do I fix this? Are others reporting the same problem?  (I have tested and can still send emails from Kolab's web site, just not from Thunderbird.) </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1707674;,pigeonsontheroof

I was able to connect to my ISP email server but it ended up showing no new emails even though I know that I have emails as I am able to see them on my iPhone. So thinking that something changed, I removed my account details from Thunderbird and try to reconnect.  The first stage, the detection of my ISP email server passed with no problems. </p><p>See the first attachment. </p><p>So after seeing this, I click on the Done button and then the problem arises. </p><p>See the second attachment. </p><p>Now to cover some other important information. I talked with my ISP and we checked the configuration manually that is shown in both attachments and they were completely correct to their files.  No deviation in any manner.  We trip POP3 and also IMAP settings and still got the same error as the second attachment. I and the tech support person from my ISP also checked the typing of my password, the original one and even the new password 10x.  I also typed each character of my password slowly, just in case I typed it wrong having it visible to me and invisible to me and still got the same error as the second attachment. Also the images are from today January 29, 2025 approximately from the last 20 minutes.  So this is fresh for an attempt to connect to my ISP email server, not just from some previous attempt. </p><p>Hopefully I can get a work around from the forum.  Oh, one more thing I have the latest Mozilla Thunderbird that is available and that is Version 128.6.1esr (64-bit) as I had updated it before I attempted to connect to the ISP email server.  I have done no uninstalls. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1707668;,pintaric
