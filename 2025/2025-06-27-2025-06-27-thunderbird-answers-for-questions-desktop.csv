So any  answers  you have please tell me   i know for a fact it will happen again.  just not sure when or how </p>,mdm54,false,0,0

The yellow line appears if you are responding by rightclicking and editing as a new message. I suggest when replying to just click the Reply button. I also suggest that you do periodic backups to prevent the need to recreate addressbooks and accounts. The steps for that are below:  </p><p>here is the info in brief steps:  </p><p><strong>BACKUP</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is not running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol> <p><strong>RESTORE</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is installed and NOT running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there. This may prompt to overwrite an existing folder of same name. allow it </li><li> start thunderbird and all should be there  </li></ol> <p>If the computer ever needs a tech to work on it, be sure to do the BACKUP steps above, copying to an external media to eliminate the need to recreate from scratch.   </p><p>I also suggest verifying that you have thunderbird set to NOT do automatic upgrades. Then, whenever you do decide to upgrade, do the BACKUP process above FIRST. That ensures that you lose no data during the process.  In general, Thunderbird works best when we set it and forget it.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

AM  I SCREWED THEN?

With that attitude, it is difficult to assist you. Have you considered that you may have fewer problems if you just abandoned Thunderbird and used the Comcast web interface instead? That would eliminate your problems on losing address book and your needing to reinstall frequently. Email clients, whether Thunderbird or others, require a degree, although slight, of technical knowledge. Your resistance to do backups is causing problems for you, something that would not exist if you just used the Comcast web interface. Many prefer that approach for its simplicity and reliability. Your post here is about many problems, some of which may be specific to your use of Thunderbird. I hope you get this all worked out. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It sounds like you get the message that password is not ok or similar. As you have access to the internet, then the first thing to try is logging on to your webmail account via a browser.  If you can logon then you know the email address and password are correct. </p><p>If you cannot logon to webmail account then clearly the password is not being accepted - maybe it's wrong, maybe it's a typo, passwords are case sensitive, maybe you put a comma instead of a full stop period in the email address. If you cannot access the webmail account because it's not accepting what you type, then there is no way Thunderbird is going to get access using the same data.  Basically, that tells me it's not a Thunderbird problem.   </p><p>Usually, when you use a browser to get access to webmail account, they provide a 'forgotten password' type of link. Maybe you are trying to use that option and at some point in the process it's saying to use the home phone to confirm it's you. Maybe you set up that option as a recovery method. Maybe you cannot get access because a VPN is enabled - switch it off, servers do not like VPN as it hides IP. </p><p>But until you can access your own webmail account via a browser and are able to confirm a correct password then you cannot expect Thunderbird whether it's a desktop app or a Thunderbird Andriod app to access server using a password which you know fails. No email client can use a password that is not accepted by the webmail account. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

About the only reason I can think of manually setting cache would be to limit the space used on a small disk.  If you have 140Gn doing nothing clearly that is not the case so why try and over ride the automatic process? </p><p>Your coworkers clearly know more than I do perhaps they can give you the bug number for this rather bad bug I need to be aware of something like this.  Or perhaps they really do not know so pull out the ""bug"" response.  I see it here all the time.  Anything that works by design in a manner other than that which the unread assume it will is a bug. </p><p>I would be more inclined to think your mail is on an IMAP server and it automatically takes action to delete or archive mail in the inbox on a timed basis after it is received/downloaded/ read.  Folks think that they can click a few setting on a local app and force the server to do things their way.  The exact opposite is true.  An IMAP server is the canonical source of information about what mail is in what folders in a mail account.  Nothing you do in Thunderbird or any other mail application will override setting on the server unless the server admin allows it. </p><p>Is you mail on a corporate server?  What is the mail retention policies of your organisation?  Have you asked the mail administrator? </p><p>If you mail is held on one of the large public providers you might mention which it is.  I am aware of a number of peculiarities with the various big providers,  but it is smaller corporate mail policies which appear to trip folks up.  They tend to think email in Outlook is the same as gmail is the same as Yahoo is the same as the company they work for.  It is a bit like a motor car in reality.  They all share certain features,  but no two brands are the same. </p><p>I really have no idea what is happening because I really have insufficient information about your setup to make specific claims.

I am going to date myself by admitting that it has been decades since programming Windows in ASM86 and C, Windows message loop programming, <a href=""http://et.al"" rel=""nofollow"">et.al</a>.  But I do remember a bunch of that stuff …. 1.	 I looked a the corrupted no-extension file (using Notepad, which is not a good tool for this), and while I saw some date inversions, they were likely e-mail forwards or replies.  Not that I thought Thunderbrid had some way of prepending new e-mails to that file (that is not a thing that Windows’ Kernel32.dll supports). 2.	But that fact that the missing e-mails would have be the first to have been written to that file suggests that it is Thunderbird that is messing up during some compaction process (I cannot imagine an “operator error” that would delete messages without updating the .msf file and the .msf file still referenced the missing e-mails - let alone several hundred e-mails).  I certainly did not run any other piece of software that should have opened the file.   3.	I would also note that 2-6 months ago (on whatever version of Thunderbird I thought current at that time – I do update regularly) I was seeing some bad behavior.  Specifically,   a.	Thunderbird would silently fail to complete an operation b.	Task Manager would report small CPU utilization (and other applications would be completely responsive, so I think the Task Manager data was accurate) c.	Clicking on the red “x” at the top-right corner would get the “application not responding” message, which I believe Windows issues after some time interval of no interrogation of an application’s Windows event queue. The only way I know of to get into this condition is for Thunderbird to be looping over a call to “WaitSingleObject” system call.  I imagine that Thunderbird has all sorts of functionality running in separate threads, and I further speculate that this can get “messed up”. </p>",JonathanWexler,false,0,0

But I do have partial recent message in the past few months, likely related to some message filtering.  I do see that we do have a new pending for properly gating folder updates, so may that will help in some areas. </p><p>There def are many threads but mostly from imap. A simplified description is pretty much everything Thunderbird-specific runs on main thread (including pop, IO, UI etc),  iirc import runs it's single thread. imap spins up multiple threads. </p><p>In the case of Thunderbird, waitsingleobject is often IO, sound, or some other SW, including AV. </p><p>Also, I should have included ""but can affect Thunderbird performance and stability."" to my earlier statement ""In the case of #1, the AV can't affect your mail files."" </p>",wsmwk,false,0,0
