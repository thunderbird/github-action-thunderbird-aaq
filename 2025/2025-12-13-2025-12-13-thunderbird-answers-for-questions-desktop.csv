I use Table View, which gives me headers at the top of each column - I can click on the column header to sort it in any way I want. You can get to most of the message list display and sort options by clicking on the icon I show in the attached image, or from the menu option View | Sort By. </p>",rednoise,false,1,0

I had cleared the inbox so that new messages would be apparent, so I shall have to wait until several new messages arrive to see if they are located in sequence.

Lin tells you haw to change to the table display and this I fully support as it makes threading intuitive something that does not happen in the ""card view"" which is the default. </p><p>If you go to setting and change your setting for threading to unthreaded you will probably revert to the decades old appearance of lists that you apparently are expecting. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-12-14-00-00-48-46c5a9.png""> </p><p>Make sure to apply the change to existing folders.

You'd need to important the exported .ics file into your Thunderbird installation on the new computer.
