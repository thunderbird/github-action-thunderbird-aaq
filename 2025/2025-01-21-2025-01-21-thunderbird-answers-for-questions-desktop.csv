Report to whom? </p><p>Unwanted mail cannot be dealt with the same way as unwanted phone calls (if that's what you mean). Some mail service providers like Gmail may let you report spam to help them identify spam at the server for that particular service, but that has no effect on the same message being received through some other mail service provider –– and again it's not even clear whether that's what you mean by ""report"". </p><p>What generic mail clients like Thunderbird do is provide their own local junk filtering capabilities on top of the filtering done at the server, which you may then train by marking as junk messages they didn't initially recognise as such. </p><p>And you may also set up filters to tell Thunderbird to do bad things to incoming messages that meet some criteria if you wish, so you never get to see them, but be careful with that or you may end up inadvertently missing messages you want to keep if you do it wrong. </p><p>You may learn about those Thunderbird features and capabilities here: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a> </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

That functionality must be added to Thunderbird by installing an add-on such as ImportExportTools. </p><p>The way that Thunderbird stores and manages mail in mbox files within the profile folder, however, makes it possible to import mail stored in an mbox file by merely moving it (with no filename extension) to the desired place within the mail hierarchy in the profile folder, while Thunderbird isn't running. The next time it is launched, Thunderbird will automatically recognise the mbox file, create the associated .msf index file, and show it as a folder at the corresponding place within the mail hierarchy in the folder pane, with all the messages in it. This is what sfhowes suggested. </p><p>The manual file moving approach has a caveat, though, namely that there is not a single mbox format, but rather a set of file formats collectively known as mbox, which in some cases may make it preferable to use an import tool to ensure the resulting mbox file will be in the exact mbox format expected by Thunderbird, but if the mbox files you want to import were created by Thunderbird to begin with, that's obviously not an issue. </p>",DavidGG,false,1,0
