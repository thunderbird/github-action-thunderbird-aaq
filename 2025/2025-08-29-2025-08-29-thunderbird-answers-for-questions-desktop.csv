Many people do not subscribe to see that folder because it is a duplicate of everything thus doubling the size of your profile folder. If you delete anything from the 'All Mail' folder then it will delete that email from whatever other folder it appears in because it does not exist on server. </p><p><strong>To unsubscribe:</strong> In Folder Pane: </p> <ul><li> right click on the 'imap gmail name of account' - usually an email address - folder and select 'Subscribe' from drop down list. </li><li> Click on 'Refresh' </li><li> Select the 'All Mail' folder </li><li> click on 'Unsubscribe' </li><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p><br> Gmail understands that it's not helpful to display everything, sent and received and archived in one folder, so they invented 'labels' which acts like a tag, thus enabling the display of an email in any folder that has the same tag. In effect this means you can display the same email in more than one folder. Thunderbird has no concept of 'labels', so it downloads whatever is displayed in the various 'folders' aka 'labels' and displays them in the Imap folders of same name. </p><p>In the gmail webmail account, in settings &gt; labels, you can select options to 'Show in imap' for any folder. The 'Inbox' is selected by default, but it might be helpful to uncheck some options such as 'All Mail' folder.  I've included an image which shows how I've selected some folders to 'show in imap' and unchecked others. </p><p>Imap accounts can only display whatever is on the server, so first please logon to gmail webmail account and find out what has been put into the server Inbox. Are the new emails displaying in the webmail account Inbox? Then select the 'All Mail' folder to see what 'labels' have been applied' I've included another image which shows some contents of my gmail webmail  'All Mail' folder - I've highlighted what something with/without labels looks like. If no label, gmail has 'archived' it, so it only displays in the 'All Mail' folder. Personally, I do not find that convenient, so I created my own 'Archives' folder, so I can sort my archived stuff into a separate folder - much easier to find and I do not need to see the 'All MAil' folder.  Did you find new emails with no label or did they have another label like 'Important' etc&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

Had no idea it worked quite like that, but what really mystifies me is before yesterday everything was showing up in both Inbox and All Mail. But yesterday mail stopped going to Inbox. I changed the label page as you note, and now NEW mail gets the label ""Inbox"". I had to go and change the interim email labels to Inbox to see them in TBird. No idea how the inbox labeling changed for those 2 days. Thanks again! </p>",DallasDaveVegas,false,0,0

Somehow, a password was being passed, insecure possibly, but still being used. If you have access to the old computer, thunderbird stores passwords in setting&gt;privacy&amp;security.

It has Windows XP on it and naturally I do not use it on line any longer. But I need Windows to access the Cd's that I have purchased from the Hampshire Genealogical Society to research my Family history.   I can assure you that I do not have a Password in the memory of that machine. Nor do I have any password in the set top Box that I purchased about 2009 that I had Novatech of Porchester  build for me. This is the Box that I first managed to dual book Windows 10 and a Ubuntu on circa 2011. And  the Box that last August I tried to update to the latest long term version of 24.04.. And something went wrong with it and I lost Windows 10. So in effect this second machine was my Imap Virginmedia server device. And as I said I did not have a password for this either  And when I cared to examine it it too said that the password was insecure. But as said my emails were sent to to my machines and stopped    I have flashed up the XP box and this is what it says  (  Server Type   POP Mail Server,   Server Name  <a href=""http://POP.ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">POP.ntlworld.com</a> Port 110. User name recent cm.edwards1 Then under Security Settings it has this  Connection Security . In the box it says None. then Authentication Method in the box  it says Password transmitted insecurely.     On the outgoing server it has this. In the box it has <a href=""http://cm.edwards1-smtp.ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">cm.edwards1-smtp.ntlworld.com</a>. Under the box it has  "" not specified "" and Port 25. My user name and once more it repeats that Under Authentication Method Password transmitted insecurely, and under Password it says once more that there is none. ie Connection Security None. </p><pre>            Now for all these years I apparently have some 8000 or more emails on my pop3 account. And on my Imap account on the 2009 set top box some 5000 or more emails of which it would seem that some are also from the two different accounts. I have to confess that I myself have taken this to be true. But I can assure you that in those Boxes where you say that I should have saved passwords. There is nothing in either of them. I do not have any passwords because in my ignorance I did not fill them in at the time nor later.                   I have now flashed up the 2009 Ubuntu set top box  with 24.04.3 LTS  and it says that in Pop I have some 8491 emails and in Imap some 5696 emails. and that on the 11th of March this year I received my last email from Thunderbird  from RootsTech 2025 at 12 minutes past 2300hours.                   On this other set top box ie about 2009 in the Box that says  Saved Logins. It is empty there is nothing.. And to be honest I am fairly sure that I never filled it in at the time. Sorry but it worked despite not being filled in. Well it  did  until March this year.  Regards  Cliff Edwards. </pre>",cm.edwards1,false,0,0
