Within the last week, I had an issue with my system and it rebooted with several programs still running. When I logged back in, there were 4 email messages that showed up on my inbox, that had been deleted.  Now when I go to them and open them, the content is blank and i cannot delete them or move them to my trash folder. I am not sure where to look to see if there is a place to remove them in a profile or other area. </p><p>Looking forward to some assistance, Regards, Bob </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rwdunlop

I swear I haven't touched a thing in these settings - ever.  </p><p>Prior to last night, I had a 'sent' and 'sent mail' folder on my PC.   99% of  my sent mail was in the ""sent Mail"" folder.

All of inbox remains fine.   </p><p>On my iphone, I removed the thunderbird account added it back in to the mail app.   the account appears but no messages in the inbox or sent box.
