So, if you are using the import export addon (which is my recommendation), to salvage a folder just highlight Local Folder, rightclick and select the importexport option to import one of the mbox files. In doing that, thunderbird automatically creates the msf file for it. The eml files are embedded in the mbox, so there is no processing of eml files in this. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Neither my friend nor any member of his family wanted it - so I got it and am thrilled to have it. I wiped it clean and did a fresh install of High Sierra. With 16gb of ram and a 1TB hard drive  it more than serves its limited purpose for the occasional Zoom meeting, browsing the web, email and solitaire. I have two other newer PC's for my more demanding tasks - I just couldn't see tossing this lovely mac into the landfill. Anyway, thanks for your suggestion and your help.

This has nothing to do with Thunderbird. If Mailfence have said they blacklisted your account then you need to know how they are going to remove the listing. </p><p>Suspicious activity is a somewhat broad definition. It might be spam content in emails, but first check to see if you have been reecntly using a VPN because that will cause servers to block accounts. If you have used a VPN then server will not like it because it hides your IP address and they might think you are a hacker, so check your computer for a VPN which has been enabled. </p><p>SOPHOS antivirus does provide a VPN. Access the Antivirus and switch off the VPN or you need to use the slpit tunnelling and set it up so Thunderbird uses it.
