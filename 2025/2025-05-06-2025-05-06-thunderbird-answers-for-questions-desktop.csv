So, if you are using the import export addon (which is my recommendation), to salvage a folder just highlight Local Folder, rightclick and select the importexport option to import one of the mbox files.

Unfortunately, it wasn't till shortly after I posted this question that I then found the same solution you suggest. I went ahead and downloaded Thunderbird 115.18.0 and it installed perfectly. I now have a working email app/client on my old (but still running very well) MAC High Sierra desktop. I inherited this machine from a friend. It actually belonged to his father who passed away. Neither my friend nor any member of his family wanted it - so I got it and am thrilled to have it. I wiped it clean and did a fresh install of High Sierra. With 16gb of ram and a 1TB hard drive  it more than serves its limited purpose for the occasional Zoom meeting, browsing the web, email and solitaire. I have two other newer PC's for my more demanding tasks - I just couldn't see tossing this lovely mac into the landfill. Anyway, thanks for your suggestion and your help. This was the solution that worked. Cheers, Mark </p>",markdirollo,false,0,0

This has nothing to do with Thunderbird. If Mailfence have said they blacklisted your account then you need to know how they are going to remove the listing. </p><p>Suspicious activity is a somewhat broad definition. It might be spam content in emails, but first check to see if you have been reecntly using a VPN because that will cause servers to block accounts. If you have used a VPN then server will not like it because it hides your IP address and they might think you are a hacker, so check your computer for a VPN which has been enabled. </p><p>SOPHOS antivirus does provide a VPN. Access the Antivirus and switch off the VPN or you need to use the slpit tunnelling and set it up so Thunderbird uses it.
