That does not work and may be the source of your problems. if you changed accounts, I recommend removing the bigpond account and creating the telstra account new. You may need to share more information here to resolve this. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I wish to transfer Thunderbird to the newer PC (currently running Win 10) whereas the source PC (also running Win 10) is not upgradeable and will be retired! I guess my query is should I set up a new user on the newer PC to match that of the source? Thanks Terry </p>,t.rance,false,0,0
