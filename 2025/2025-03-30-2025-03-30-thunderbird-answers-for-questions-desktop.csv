The count of messages within the folders is also correct. It just doesn't show any old messages, but does show new ones I put in there.  The messages are still there in some form in the profile, because there are gigabytes of them. I can see some files where they might be hidden, but don't know how to reconnect them. The screen shots show where I think they might be! I am sure there is a simple solution, just need an expert to tell me what it is!! </p>",old_nic,false,0,0
