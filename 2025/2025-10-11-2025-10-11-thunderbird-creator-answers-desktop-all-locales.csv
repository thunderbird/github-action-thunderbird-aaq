My Norton Internet Security program tells me that Thunderbird is out of date, and that the latest version is 143.0.1. Maybe it is confused because of the two update channels?

I installed thunderbird and can receive via IMAP but cant send via SMTP. I have smtp setup EXACTLY how it is on my windows PC which works.   When I hit send on a message, it immediately comes back with ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) &lt;<a href=""http://maileserver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">maileserver.com</a>&gt;  timed out. Try again. This message comes back immediately, as in .000001 second.  This particular mail server I own and is on my network, and checking the logs, the request never even gets to the server, so its not a server issue. (Again, it works for all my other devices and other clients).  server info, password etc are correct.  I tried deleting the account and recreating it but no go. From a command tool, I can telnet to my mail server on port 25 and it answers and I can interact. If I use the built in mac mail client, it works fine. So this is definitely a thunderbird issue from what I can tell.  Thunderbird 143.0.1 (aarch64) on 26.0.1 (25A362) Any tips appreciated, Im ready to take a bath with a toaster.
