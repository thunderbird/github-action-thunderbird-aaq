I am on the esr update channel, 140.3.1 esr, and it says it is up to date. I just learned that there is another update channel, called ""release"". My Norton Internet Security program tells me that Thunderbird is out of date, and that the latest version is 143.0.1. Maybe it is confused because of the two update channels? Why are two different configurations maintained? Is there a reason that I should switch to the other one? Thanks in advance for any clarification. </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,1771202;1771213;,larrydaleparker

I use it for multiple email accounts from different providers. </p><p>Until recently I manually Archived email in to Local Folders on my PC.  I do this to remove email from my mail providers and to avoid storage limits. </p><p>I recently learned that if I I set the ""Message Archives"" option to a specific folder for each account under ""Local Folders"" I can either manually archive there or I can use an Extension like ""AutoarchiveReloaded"" to do this semi-automatically.  Great! </p><p>Unfortunately for my main mailbox only, despite being configured to write to a sub-folder under Local Folders, Thunderbird seems to ignore the settings.  It always tries to create an Archive folder in the mailbox itself.
