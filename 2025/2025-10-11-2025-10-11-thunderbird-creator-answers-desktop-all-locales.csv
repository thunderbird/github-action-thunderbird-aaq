I am on the esr update channel, 140.3.1 esr, and it says it is up to date. I just learned that there is another update channel, called ""release"". My Norton Internet Security program tells me that Thunderbird is out of date, and that the latest version is 143.0.1. Maybe it is confused because of the two update channels? Why are two different configurations maintained? Is there a reason that I should switch to the other one? Thanks in advance for any clarification. </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,1771202;1771213;,larrydaleparker
