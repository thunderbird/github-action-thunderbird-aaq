I really can not add anything to that. </p> <blockquote>A couple of days ago, there was an update to Thunderbird and since then, my emails have been coming in to wrong folders. None of the emails coming in to the inbox are staying there. They are instead going into a subfolder of my inbox set up to filter online orders coming in to my business. When I try to move them back to the inbox they disappear nowhere to be found.  I don't know what to do. Who is supposed to help in situations like this? My business is being affected by losing emails into cyberspace and all my message filters going wacky. </blockquote> <p>Well what emails are going into what folders.  Please be specific as we know exactly what you tell us and so far your have offered nothing specific.  Only a load of something is wrong and going somewhere else.

I tried to follow up with at least trying to find out where to get help. Details are: </p><p>I have my main account through GoDaddy. It’s a Microsoft Exchange Account that used Outlook. I personally don’t like Outlook and have used Thunderbird for years as I have multiple accounts in one place. My personal accounts are not affected by this, only the Exhange account for business.  </p><p>Basically, I have my Inbox and off of that a couple of subfolders to filter Orders, Contact Form Emails from my website, and Live Chat Messages that were missed when we are offline.  Aside from that I have a slew of subfolders for different companies we deal with to simplify it from all cluttering in the inbox. All have message filters that have been working fine for years. </p><p>Long story short, after TB’s latest update a couple of days ago, all the random emails that are supposed to go into the inbox, started moving into the Online Orders subfolder which makes no sense considering the filters that are set to only allow certain parameters to go into that folder. Then other emails that are supposed to go into other subfolders are not going where they need to either. Some do retain their proper filter status, while others don’t. Essentially my emails are a huge mess and when I try to manually move any of the emails into their correct folders or to the inbox, they disappear into thin air and can’t find them anywhere at all.  </p><p>This is really frustrating and I spent a good couple of hours with GoDaddy trying to problem solve and didn’t get anywhere. I started there since the problem was not just on TB’s side. I doubt the issue was with GoDaddy because it started right after this latest TB update and historically TB updated have messed up other things before. I just wanted to try somewhere and had tech support first but now that that didn’t help anything, I’m hoping to find some help here.  </p><p>Sorry if I sounded like I was saying a whole lot of nothing, but I’ve been going crazy for two days trying to fix this.  </p><p>Finally tonight, I used the Filter Assistant from TB to run filters on the online orders subfolder and it started to move some of the messages to their proper folders but that didn’t take care of all the messages that belong to the inbox as the inbox doesn’t have any filter since the messages there are just random from anywhere. I am afraid to move the remaining messages back to inbox because they are disappearing and i don’t want to lose important messages in cyber space. I have no idea where they are going. I also don’t know how to stop everything from filtering into the online orders subfolder. It’s like the inbox and online orders have switched places but when you check the filters, all the parameters are correct as I had made them years ago.  </p><p>If nothing works, would going back to an older version of TB help? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",chochian,false,0,0

This often happens after a PC or Thunderbird crash or after a power interruption. When it happens Thunderbird renames the damaged prefs.js file to prefs-x.js (or invalidprefs.js) and creates a new virgin prefs.js file which doesn't contain any account settings.

Then restart TB. If there is no backup of the profile folder you must re-create all your accounts. If yours are POP accounts you must link each newly created account with its original ""pop.xxx.xx"" account folder in the <strong>Mail</strong> folder of your profile. To do this go to Account settings &gt; account name &gt; Server-Settings &gt; Message Storage &gt; local folder ... click on ""Browse"" button, navigate to the original correspondent ""pop.xxx.xx"" account folder in Mail, select it and click ""Open"".

Unfortunately they are too tiny (or have a bad resolution) that even when magnifying them I can't identify most of the folders and files and/or their modification dates. Please make the same screen shots again in a better resolution and when you add them to your answer verify if they are ""readable"". And also verify whether the folder ""Profiles"" contains only one profile folder (the one you show in your screen shots) or a second or a third profile folder!

Now I can see that you have <strong>two profiles</strong>:  • the <strong>old</strong> one called ""default"" going back at least to 2015, which worked until August 5, 2025 • a new one called default-esr and created on the same day on August 5, 2025 </p><p>In the old profile folder I'm seeing a prefs-9.js file from July 9, 2025 which is one month earlier than the latest update. So my initial suspicion that your problem was caused by a corrupt prefs.js file is not confirmed. The creation of a new profile during a Thunderbird update is very rare, I have never seen this on my Mac. I don't know which TB version you used before your update and whether it was a 32bit or a 64bit version. But it is near evidence now that actually you are running a new profile.  </p><p>I understand that after the update when Thunderbird asked you to ""set up your existing email address"" you tried to do this but you did not succeed.  So actually you are at the same stage without any account and no possibility to receive and to send messages? </p><p>Which is the actual page (main window) when Thunderbird opens? Can you post one more screen shot: go to \AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\  , look for a <strong>profiles.ini </strong>file, open it in a text editor and take the shot. Maybe this file on your PC has no extension and you will only see a file ""profiles"" (not the folder ""Profiles"") </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
