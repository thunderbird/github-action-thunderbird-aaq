I agree that the error message may be true; I guess my question is how best to troubleshoot this problem? </p><p>I am not an expert on email client/server communications, but my thinking that if the message is true then this is a very specific path/access issue, because a) the emails through Comcast/Xfinity do go through (they just don't end up in the Sent folder), b) if I get on the Comcast server and send an email, it gets copied to the Sent folder there, and then it shows up in the Sent folder on my PC, and c) if I get on the server and compose an email and save it, it goes to the Drafts folder on the server and later shows up in the Drafts folder on my PC. So it seems like there is communication back and forth, except in the specific cases of a) email that's sent from my PC not being copied to the Sent folder, and b) email that's composed and saved on my PC not being saved in the Drafts folder. </p><p>But, as I say, I'm not an expert, so maybe my thinking is off-base. </p>",MikeN23,false,0,0
