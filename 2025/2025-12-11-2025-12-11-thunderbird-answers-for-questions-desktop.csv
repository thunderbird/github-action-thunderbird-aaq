Gmail realises that is not convenient - in fact it's rather useless. So they invented something called 'labels'. Labels is like a type of tag which gets applied to emails, thus allowing a type of virtual view of emails in whatever 'Label' is applied.  Thunderbird has no concept of 'Labels' because it's purely a gmail thing. So imap Inbox, Sent etc is set up as a separate folder and they synchronise with same label names on server and download a copy of whatever is on server. When you choose to 'archive' an email - gmail just removes the label meaning, it does not display inany folder with the exception of 'All Mail'. So ineffect 'All Mail' is where gmail stores archived emails. </p><p>I do not subscribe to see 'All Mail' because it's just a duplicate of everything, all incoming, outgoing etc. If you delete anything from the 'All Mail' folder then you are deleting it off the server and that means that email will not display in any gmail label. It has gone. Imap accounts can only show what is on server in the relevant label for folder. That means if email does not exist in 'All Mail' - it does not exist on server, so will not display in eg: Inbox. </p><p>If any Anti-Virus messed with it, I stand a high risk of data loss. If I accidentally deleted emails from the 'All Mail' folder, I will lose those emails out of other folders leading to data loss. It's much safer to not subscribe to see it in the first place. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:Just deleted all the files in my archive folder</em> Why&nbsp;? </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I don't want an Archive Folder.</em> But is it an 'Archive' folder in reality&nbsp;? Right click on the 'Archives' folder and select 'Properties' In 'Location:' does it says something like this: imap://your name%<a href=""http://40gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">40gmail.com</a>@imap.gmail.com/All Mail </p><p>If you do not want to see the 'All Mail' - aka 'Archives' folder, you need to unsubscribe from seeing it. You cannot delete a server folder and in the case of 'All Mail' you should never do anything with it. </p><p>To unsubscribe: In Folder Pane right click on the gmail account name folder and select 'Subscribe' Uncheck the 'All Mail' and click on'Ok' </p><p>Do you have any backups&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The path from your PC to the Comcast server, receiving the message being sent and also the copy to be saved.

I agree that the error message may be true; I guess my question is how best to troubleshoot this problem? </p><p>I am not an expert on email client/server communications, but my thinking that if the message is true then this is a very specific path/access issue, because a) the emails through Comcast/Xfinity do go through (they just don't end up in the Sent folder), b) if I get on the Comcast server and send an email, it gets copied to the Sent folder there, and then it shows up in the Sent folder on my PC, and c) if I get on the server and compose an email and save it, it goes to the Drafts folder on the server and later shows up in the Drafts folder on my PC. So it seems like there is communication back and forth, except in the specific cases of a) email that's sent from my PC not being copied to the Sent folder, and b) email that's composed and saved on my PC not being saved in the Drafts folder. </p><p>But, as I say, I'm not an expert, so maybe my thinking is off-base. </p>",MikeN23,false,0,0

A few weeks ago, I had trouble synching the photos from my iPhone to my PC (which has been working for years). A suggestion online was to disable iPv6 on my network card, which fixed that problem. Yesterday, I re-enabled it to see if that fixed Thunderbird, and it seemed to, but iPhone photo sync was broken again. So I disabled it, and photo sync was okay but Thunderbird was back to having problems. Then a few hours later, Thunderbird was working. So ... was it Comcast? Thunderbird? some weird PC setting?

After that I tried to import them back - but it did not work. I found an Zip-file that was related to the Thunderbird data. Tying to import this by using the import function of Thunderbird I got the information that this is not possible because the ZIP-file is to big and I shall unzip the file first. I tried to unzip the file with winrar but I got the information that the files are corrupted. So I have no further idea what to do.  Maybe on Monday I will call someone who is more specialized in data restoring than I am.
