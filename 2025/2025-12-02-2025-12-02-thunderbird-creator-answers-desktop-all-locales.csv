When it does, I get a “wrong site” certificate error. When I click “View certificate”, Thunderbird shows a valid certificate, but not for Apple/iCloud – it’s for <a href=""http://login.kraftcom.de"" rel=""nofollow"">login.kraftcom.de</a> (issued by DigiCert / GeoTrust TLS RSA CA G1). I did not accept the exception. </p><p>From what I can see online, <a href=""http://p123-contacts.icloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">p123-contacts.icloud.com</a> is a legitimate Apple domain, but it is also mentioned in some phishing / scareware contexts, which makes me even more unsure how to interpret this combination (Apple host + Kraftcom certificate). I’m also not sure whether this is simply a captive-portal / ISP login interception effect or something that should worry the wider community. </p><p>My questions: </p><p>Is this behavior expected in any scenario, or does it indicate a misconfiguration / MITM situation that Thunderbird should treat as a serious security issue? </p><p>Is there anything I should check or change on my side (Thunderbird config, network, ISP, certificates)? </p><p>Is there any additional diagnostic information I can provide (logs, screenshots) that would help you assess whether this is a Thunderbird issue or a network/ISP issue? </p><p>I specifically did not confirm the certificate exception and I would like to keep my setup secure, but I also want to make sure the community is aware if this is a broader problem. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any guidance </p>",thunderbird;encryption;,thunderbird,encryption,en-US,"",cs-mail

I also lost most emails that had arrived in the inboxes in the last week.  The folder pane still shows the accounts, with their own set of folders. As usual, the inbox folders are highlighted with the number of new emails downloaded from the Gmail server to each address, but I can not see them in the message pane, or find them anywhere else. I sent a test message from one of my addresses to another – It didn't show as sent in Thunderbird, but did go through the gmail server and the message count of downloaded messages on the recipient address went up by one, but I couldn't see the email. Then I tried clicking on the folder ""properties"" then 'Repair Folder' but nothing happened, although the information on that window showed the number of messages and MB that I would expect to be in that folder, rather than what was there,  which presumably means they may still be in there somewhere? I would be very grateful for help – I'm not tech savvy and feeling completely lost. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bmreplies
