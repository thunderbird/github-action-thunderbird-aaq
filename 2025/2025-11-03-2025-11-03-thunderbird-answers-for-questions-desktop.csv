You state the PC crashed before the problem, yet also state that Thunderbird was updating during the crash. A crash may have destroyed the profile. Did you have to restore Windows after the crash? Did you restore Thunderbird? Have you logged onto the account online to see if the messages are there? Is the account IMAP or POP?

I appreciate your willingness to help.   </p><p>I didn't have to restore any software after the crash.  I didn't have to restore the Thunderbird software.  What was gone were all the messages from both email profiles.  (earthlink and my university email (outlook)) </p><p>I don't know for sure whether my earthlink was set up as IMAP or POP, either is possible, and I tried both in the hopes of restoring.  When I provided my earthlink address and password, it downloaded whatever was still up in Earthlink webmail.  It also downloaded older stuff from folders in webmail (which it never did before) and it also appears to have downloaded my spamblocker content, which it never did before.   </p><p>In the past, I used to backup my Thunderbird profile on an external drive periodically, but have not done so in quite a long time (not smart - I used to be a programmer and I know better).  </p><p>It did not seem to look for or find my earthlink content on my computer.  None of my Thunderbird inbox subfolders were shown. </p><p>My inbox online does not hold mail indefinitely.  I probably delete it periodically to free up space.  It doesn't get deleted automatically when it is downloaded.  I move email to trash which deletes its contents automatically at 2 weeks.  I do have to delete mail in my spamblocker which goes to trash etc. </p><p>I hope this helps.  My laptop has crashed multiple times recently - it generally recovers quite gracefully, generally only losing my currently open web pages.  The reason I think that Thunderbird might have been in some process is because it came up looking different, as if there were new options available.  That might have been because it could no longer find me.  (It didn't find either profile). </p><p>Best Ellen </p>",anamgirl,false,0,0

I do see related posts with folks having trouble with that release and asking for assistance in getting back to the regular channel.  I have not had problems with that release on the current production host and am therefore hopeful that I will be able to go down level in order to get through the important migration and then bring the new system up back up to 144. </p>",Terry.Corbet,false,0,0

Since it is unread it is also displayed in bold and has the green ""unread"" dot.
