You state the PC crashed before the problem, yet also state that Thunderbird was updating during the crash. A crash may have destroyed the profile. Did you have to restore Windows after the crash? Did you restore Thunderbird? Have you logged onto the account online to see if the messages are there? Is the account IMAP or POP? Please share more information, and we will offer whatever assistance we can. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
