After that, new messages show up as unread headers, but when I click on them, nothing shows up in the preview pane and the status just seems to get stuck on ""Loading message"". I have done the ""Repair Mailbox"" thing a couple of times. After a restart, Thunderbird reloads the headers from the server, but I get the same result. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",firefox1865

It stopped working a few months ago.  I may have messed up my personal address book by trying to eliminate duplicates. I made a mistake and ended up with even more more duplicates. I set that project aside, but somehow the filter stopped working. Filters that don't depend on the address book continue to work.  Not sure why the address book filter doesn't work. Even if there are duplicates, the algorithm needs to check every one to be be sure the From address is not there. But nothing gets moved out. It's as though everything were somehow in the address book or the address book has nothing in it. But it does have addresses--lots of them. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",rmrubinsl

I had been using it since more than 5 years without any issue. But recently since last 5-6 months I am facing some weired issue.  Whenever some junk/spam emails received in this account are quarantined by McAfee installed on my laptop, the entire inbox gets corrupted. I can see the headers in Inbox marked as unread but it is not displayed. Simultaneously all the earlier read emails are also not displayed only headers can be seen in inbox marked as read. If I try to repair the inbox all the emails in inbox are deleted. All other local folders, sent emails folder etc are not disturbed. It is annoying to lose the earlier email and relevant data.  </p><p>This happens very frequently now a days.  </p><p>The new emails received after the quarantine are properly displayed. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",suhas3

Devo assolutamente eliminare questa impostazione perchè spesso aprando una email se ne aprono in automatico 20 che poi devo chiudere una ad una. La mia versione di Thunderbird è 115.16.2 (32bit) Attendo cortese riscontro, grazie.
