It stopped working a few months ago.  I may have messed up my personal address book by trying to eliminate duplicates. I made a mistake and ended up with even more more duplicates. I set that project aside, but somehow the filter stopped working. Filters that don't depend on the address book continue to work.  Not sure why the address book filter doesn't work. Even if there are duplicates, the algorithm needs to check every one to be be sure the From address is not there. But nothing gets moved out. It's as though everything were somehow in the address book or the address book has nothing in it.

I can see the headers in Inbox marked as unread but it is not displayed. Simultaneously all the earlier read emails are also not displayed only headers can be seen in inbox marked as read. If I try to repair the inbox all the emails in inbox are deleted. All other local folders, sent emails folder etc are not disturbed.

At present I have over 1200 messages in 'Trash' with no common denominator for why they were selected. I've never changed my preferences for when or what to delete so it came as a surprise to see this many emails sitting waiting to be manually deleted by me. I'm convinced that the issue must be something in the 'prefs.js' file.  </p><p>Running TB version: 128.11.0 esr (64-bit)   <strong>Is the issue tied to version 128.11.0 perhaps?</strong> </p><p>I have four other TB email client accounts that all work perfectly, except for this one lame duck that really is getting out of hand.  </p><p>Could probably import and edit the old 'prefs.js' file from a backup of the old email profile, but the number of changes would be significant. File size of the old 'prefs.js' is about 17 Kb's while the newly created one (four days ago) is only 13 Kb's </p><p>This client email account is / was very old and has been on the TB update schedule for years. The email address contains upwards of 11,000 emails on the server. There is no server space issue either. The email address is probably more than 10 years old. The other four client email accounts I have are much smaller and less than 4 years old.  </p><p>Thinking that something in this particular client profile must have gotten clobbered by unknown means, I finally decided to delete the account and set up a new one (losing my address book in the process of course). Fortunately I found an 'abook' in my backups that came close to being up to date.  </p><p>Now, the new profile has these quirky issues where it won't open the inbox in a window showing the header information that allows <strong>one click</strong> to open the message immediately below. </p><p>Further, the new TB client is constantly downloading and updating folders with old emails from the server each time TB launches, and of course, it adds a few more emails to the 'Trash' file each time. Started at about 700 messages before I decided to delete the client profile and rebuild and now surpasses 1200 in just the last 4 days. </p><p>Running out of patience and options. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1740048;1740089;1740257;1740287;,bpilkey
