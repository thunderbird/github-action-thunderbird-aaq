The email address contains upwards of 11,000 emails on the server. There is no server space issue either. The email address is probably more than 10 years old. The other four client email accounts I have are much smaller and less than 4 years old.  </p><p>Thinking that something in this particular client profile must have gotten clobbered by unknown means, I finally decided to delete the account and set up a new one (losing my address book in the process of course). Fortunately I found an 'abook' in my backups that came close to being up to date.  </p><p>Now, the new profile has these quirky issues where it won't open the inbox in a window showing the header information that allows <strong>one click</strong> to open the message immediately below. </p><p>Further, the new TB client is constantly downloading and updating folders with old emails from the server each time TB launches, and of course, it adds a few more emails to the 'Trash' file each time.
