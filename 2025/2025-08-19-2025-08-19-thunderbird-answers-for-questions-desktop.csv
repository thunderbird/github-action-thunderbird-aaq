The simple way is to set up an IMAP account, wait until all messages download (using File&gt;offline&gt;download can help) and then COPY (not move) to a folder in Local Folders. If you're familiar with profiles and windows file explorer, the easiest way to copy is to just locate the folders in the Imapmail\&lt;accountname&gt; folder, copy and paste into the Mail\Local Folders folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In this case, I'd like replies to go to several people in addition to myself who share duties for an organization. </p><p>RFC 5322 allows for specifying a comma-separated list of one or more ""Reply-to"" addresses.   When I tried to enter multiple addresses into the Reply-to field, I received an error message (that I was too dumb to record) when sending the message, and the message did not send.   Similarly, when I tried to type in just the addresses separated by commas, since these addresses were in my address book, they were individually replaced by their normal address block displays and generated the same error message.  This was with a TBird 128.(something)esr installation. </p><p>I just updated to 140.2.0esr and tried again.  The message went through without generating an error message and arrived with the specified Reply-tos intact.  So I don't know if 140esr does things differently, or if I just had a problem with my 128esr installation. </p>",makaiguy,false,0,0
