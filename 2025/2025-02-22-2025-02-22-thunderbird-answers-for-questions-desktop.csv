The about info shows that I can update to 115.10.1, however, I believe there are much later versions but I don't know if I can update to the latest.   My MacOS is 10.15.7 and that is the latest I can install.  I have a large amount of email stored on my MAC and not in the cloud.    I want to be able to access these emails that are on my hard drive, in addition to Thunderbird, in Apple Mail.    I have researched and it appears that the best way is to export from Thunderbird is into the mbox format.  However, there does not seem to be a way to do this in the version of Thunderbird I am using.    How do I move all of my local email in Thunderbird to my Apple Mail?

I then went to account settings and set the archive location to this Thunderbird folder.  The folder has an archive icon.
