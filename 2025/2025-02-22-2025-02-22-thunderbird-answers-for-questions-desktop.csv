Instead, it uses a <b>profiles.ini</b> file to keep track of the profiles it knows exist and where the corresponding profile folders are located. You're getting this error because Thunderbird cannot find the profile folder that <b>profiles.ini</b> is telling it to use. This could be because something bad happened to either the profile folder or to <b>profiles.ini</b>. I don't see how this could be related to what you said you did, but you may look at the contents of <b>profiles.ini</b> with a text editor in case there is something there that could shed some light on what happened. </p><p>Since you only seem to have a single profile, you may be able to fix the problem as follows: </p> <ol><li> Quit Thunderbird if it's running. </li><li> Take note of how the profile folder you have is named, because a new one will be created alongside it, and you'll need to differentiate between the two. </li><li> Either delete <b>profiles.ini</b>, or rename it to something else, e.g. <b>profiles.bak</b>, if you want to keep it so you may try to figure what happened. </li><li> Launch Thunderbird.

The about info shows that I can update to 115.10.1, however, I believe there are much later versions but I don't know if I can update to the latest.   My MacOS is 10.15.7 and that is the latest I can install.  I have a large amount of email stored on my MAC and not in the cloud.    I want to be able to access these emails that are on my hard drive, in addition to Thunderbird, in Apple Mail.    I have researched and it appears that the best way is to export from Thunderbird is into the mbox format.  However, there does not seem to be a way to do this in the version of Thunderbird I am using.    How do I move all of my local email in Thunderbird to my Apple Mail?  Thanks for any help, Richard </blockquote> <p>Thunderbird and apple mail do not share an MBOX format and have not since mac mail V1.  So you might want to reconsider your plan. </p><p>Just to be clear, MBOX is the native storage format Thunderbird uses.
