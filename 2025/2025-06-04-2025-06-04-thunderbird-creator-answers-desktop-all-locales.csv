Thunderbird takes up a huge amount of space on my nearly full C drive because of this. Is it possible for me to save the archive on my D (data) drive and just have the program on my C drive. And how can I back them up.  Thanks! </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",gailpvenable

How about some easy way to add some colours? The three themes are just plain grey. I hate Outlook but at least the colours make finding things easier. </p>,thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",tillrobert
