It's not a typical problem, because SOGo generates for me two CalDAV links to connect this: 1. Link for signed in users (with RW access). 2. Public access link (with RO access). I want to manage my own calendar, so I need first case. Then I go to ""Creating new calendar"" window in thunderbird, enter public access link just to check, and calendar is connected! But it's not all. Then I go back and paste link number 1, also providing credentials info (I have tried a lot of variants, also ""test@example.com:password"", ""test@example.com"" and so on) and after pressing ""Next"" button I get a typical connect error like ""Could not find your server, please check entered info"". </p><p>I have done a lot of tests and checks, and this is a strange details, that I caught and I think it is a Thunderbird bug (I might be not right)... On my nginx reverse proxy I see such log when Thunderbird is trying to connect by my link with RW access: ""my-ip-address - - [04/Jun/2025:23:39:51 +0300] ""<a href=""http://mail.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.example.com</a>"" ""PROPFIND /SOGo/dav/test@example.com/Calendar/personal/ HTTP/1.1"" 404 146 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:139.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/139.0.1"" ""-"""". As you can see, my server returned 404 error. </p><p>You can think, that problem is on my side and my server is wrong, but please check next nginx log: ""my-ip-address - test@example.com [04/Jun/2025:23:38:43 +0300] ""<a href=""http://mail.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.example.com</a>"" ""PROPFIND /SOGo/dav/test@example.com/Calendar/personal/ HTTP/1.1"" 207 125 ""-"" ""curl/7.88.1"" ""-"""". It is succeeded, but this is after my manual curl command like ""curl -v -X PROPFIND ""<a href=""https://mail.example.com/SOGo/dav/test@example.com/Calendar/personal/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.example.com/SOGo/dav/test@example.com/Calendar/personal/</a>"""". You can compare two strings from nginx log that I provided and you will see the only difference is second dash in first log instead string ""test@example.com"" in second log. That piece of log string contains nginx variable $remote_user, and that means that Thunderbird while trying to connect my server calendar do not provide auth credentials and send request without any user that I enter to corresponding field before connect attempt. </p><p>P.S. You can ask me why do I test connection just by PROPFIND request type, because Thunderbird tries some different ways to connect too. And I will ask that: 1) Only one succeeded request, by what Thunderbird connects to my public calendar is with type PROPFIND (as I can see in nginx reverse proxy logs); 2) Other attempting ways to connect falls with same error and also do not contain any user, as I explained before. </p><p>Please give me feedback about way how I can fix that and thank you very much for your support! </p>",thunderbird;calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1739590;,pakhmutovyaroslav
