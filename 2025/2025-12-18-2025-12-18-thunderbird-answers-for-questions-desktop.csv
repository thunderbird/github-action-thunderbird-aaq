Some Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and I have come across some peopl who did not realise one had been enabled. Switch off VPN (or create  split tunnelling and set it up for Thunderbird to use).  Gmail, Spectrum, and many other servers do not like VPN as it atempts to hide your IP address. Servers presumes you might be hacker so it auto blocks access. Confirm VPN is switched off </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

However, the server is bound to accept mail sent to you and Thunderbird has no control over the server, it just displays emails and can sort incoming mail automatically into specific folders. </p><p>The server will accept any emails sent to your email address. You may be able to set up a rule on the server (via webmail account) to choose whether a sender is a safe sender or not. Usually, the server will put those emails from the unsafe sender directly into the server 'Spam' folder. </p><p>In any email client: Pop mail accounts can only access the server Inbox and download whatever has not previously been downloaded to the Pop account Inbox. </p><p>If you do not want to see whatever the server puts in the server/webmail Spam folder then a Pop account will not display anything in server Spam folder as it cannot access it. Most servers tend to auto empty the server Spam folder periodically. But do check out that this does occur otherwise you would need to periodically loggon to webmail account and manaully empty it yourself. </p><p>In a way this is a workaround so you do not see emails in Thunderbird Pop account if server has already put them in server Spam folder. </p><p>Imap accounts subscribe to see server folders and can only display whatever is those server folders. As folders synchronise with server, they act as if one and the same. You basically are seeing a mirror image of your webmail account.  </p><p>In Thunderbird you have some options: You can set up the Account Settings &gt; Junk/Spam Settings for each account and train the Adaptive Junk/Spam controls to auto recognise what is and what is not spam. It would be important to set up your address books as whitelists and make sure the unwanted email address is not in any of those address books. </p><p>Another alternative In Thunderbird, you can create a Message Filter. </p> <ul><li> Tools &gt; Message Filters </li><li> Click on 'New' </li><li> Give filter a suitable name like 'Block senders' </li><li> Select 'Getting new mail' and 'Filter before Junk Classification' </li><li> Select 'Match ANY of the following' - that means you can set up more than one email address which you want to auto delete or send to spam. </li><li> 'From' and 'contains' and enter email address </li><li> to add another click on + icon and repeat except enter a different email address. </li></ul> <p>Perform these actions: Suggest you use any of these options </p> <ul><li> 'Set junk Status to ' and 'Junk' </li><li> 'Move message to' and 'Spam on account name' </li></ul> <p>OR </p> <ul><li> 'Delete Message' </li></ul> <p>OR </p> <ul><li> 'Move message to' and select 'Deleted on account name' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Put filter at top of list as the filter operate from the top downwards.

Thunderbird will always and has always has been slower that clicking a a web button because Thunderbird is actually doing thing the web button just implies it has.

But that is not used in the user interface beyond the calendar,  General dates are implemented via the system locale.  On Linux where nothing can be assumed and every distribution is different as if every distribution method. The locale is set generally using two methods.  One is in the GUI windowing environment and is what most Windows refugees will be relying on.  There is another in the underlying system and they do not necessarily talk to one another.  Personally I think it is just another reason the much talked of year of Linux on the desktop is still not here.  They can not standardize on anything and there has to a customization feature to break any standard that does emerge.  But I digress.  You need to examine the locale setting of your system using the command line.  Thunderbird uses system settings not windowing environment settings. </p><p>This page appears to offer a fairly comprehensive overview <a href=""https://www.tecmint.com/set-system-locales-in-linux/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tecmint.com/set-system-locales-in-linux/</a> </p><p>For a start you appear top have forgotten to mention that this is on some Linux distribution. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

We may have the wrong profile, so here's another approach to try:  - exit thunderbird if running - enter %appdata% in the windows task bar search box and press enter. that should open the appdata\roaming window. - paste the rescued appdata\roaming\thunderbird to overlay the existing appdata\roaming thunderbird. you will be prompted for overwrite.  - now restart thunderbird and let me know results. This should work if the profile is complete. (NOTE: Be sure you don't just append the thunderbird folder. sometimes users paste over appdata\roaming\thunderbird, which creates appdata\roaming\thunderbird\thunderbird. ) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Found something that had me copy an entire folder named Thunderbird to the desktop.  Was a day or two ago, and I'm old, so I don't remember the exact location of the folder on my desktop.  I think C:\Users\dalew\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird and the ""clone"" on my Desktop seems to work.  If that won't work, let me know and I'll follow what ever instructions you have. One thing I noticed about AI, mainly using Copilot, is that the answers it gives are not ""up-to-date.""  It starts by giving ""older"" data that is not pertinent to today.  You end up getting answers that apply to historical app versions.  If you keep things up-to-date, as I generally do, you end up getting several messages that don't apply to your situation.  I'm slowly adding ""as of today"" to my questions to get pertinent answers.  Usually get better results. </p>",dalewebb1,false,0,0
