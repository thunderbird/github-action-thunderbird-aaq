(or some reason copies of some sent messages from the POP account are saved here.    </p><p><br> Then there is  <strong>LOCAL FOLDERS</strong> which contains again the standard subfolders, and then more than 20 folders which are populatde by mail filters from the inbox. It seem most of the mail here comes from the inbox in the POP account.  (I often see a notice like"" 40 messages moved from inbox to inbox."" </p><p>On my phone and iPad I have my accounts set up as IMAP. </p><p><strong>HERE'S THE PROBLEM</strong> </p><p>From time to time the POP account starts downloading thousands and thousand of old emails.  Today it was over 29,000 messages. I disabled downloading of messages and ran the duplicate remover on each folder, and got rid of as many as I could, of of course as soon as I clicked ""get messages"" the 29,000 mail dumps started again. (This does not happen on my phone or iPad). </p><p>It has been suggested that I should switch to IMAP on the desktop, but I would like to filter mail into the same local folders using the old filters, which I have developed over many years.   </p><p><strong>QUESTION</strong> So, Is there a relatively simple way to do this. </p><p>Thanks, Len </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",modemjunkie
