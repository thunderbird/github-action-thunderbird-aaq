I backed up the profile folder and after deleteing the account and reinstalling it with the new server settings, I proceded copy/paste the INBOX file in the local profile folders.  I did this while Thunderbird was closed. After relaunching, only a  small amount of recent emails appeared.  I noticed that the name on the local folder change from server to server.

This is a nuisance more than anything else. However when you hover over the delete button it describes itself as ""delete this message"" not this attachment, so the behaviour is both wrong and annoying.
