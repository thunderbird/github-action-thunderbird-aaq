Under Drafts and Templates, choose Other, then select the account Inbox. You have to select the folder that has the problem here, not some other folder.    Close the account settings (not sure this is necessary).    Open Copies &amp; Folders again and change the Drafts folder setting back to what it was. This is where having selected the right folder before matters, because it's when the folder that had been chosen to store drafts stops having that role that the flag is removed.  </pre> <p>HTH… And looking forward to see more funny stories like this…&nbsp;:) </p><p><br> </p><pre>  Now, when I doubleclick an email in the inbox, it does not go to draft message, but does go right to reply to sender.

I prefer to use a more point and click method offered by the import export tools addon. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>My preference is largely because IMAP mail is transitory in that is is synchronized.  By exporting the mail from Thunderbird (exactly where David is going) the syncronised link to an account is broken.  My preference for the addon is that as a part of it's export it checks that the latest copy of each mail in in the local store that is being exported.  Thunderbird does not always have a full copy of an IMAP email stored locally or depending on account settings it may only be cached locally,  so occasionally you can get a missing message body by relying on the original download only.  The drawback is the export process using the addon is significantly slower. </p><p>THe addon offers the opportunity to export mail in a number of formats,  EML and MBOX being perhaps the most useful.  Windows likes EML and you can work with individual emails from the file manager.  Thunderbird native storage format is MBOX so the files are very easy to import back into Thunderbird after the non-account linked archive has been created. </p><p>I will but out again now. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
