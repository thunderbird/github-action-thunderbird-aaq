I installed the add-on to set the flag instead of to remove it, then did successfully remove the flag without using the add-on doing this: </p><pre>   Open the account Copies &amp; Folders settings.    Under Drafts and Templates, choose Other, then select the account Inbox. You have to select the folder that has the problem here, not some other folder.    Close the account settings (not sure this is necessary).    Open Copies &amp; Folders again and change the Drafts folder setting back to what it was. This is where having selected the right folder before matters, because it's when the folder that had been chosen to store drafts stops having that role that the flag is removed.  </pre> <p>HTH… And looking forward to see more funny stories like this…&nbsp;:) </p><p><br> </p><pre>  Now, when I doubleclick an email in the inbox, it does not go to draft message, but does go right to reply to sender.  If I rightclick the message, i can open in new tab just fine.  Is there a setting for doublecliick menu within TB?   Thanks </pre>",mudncj,false,0,0

( was told that'd be the best way to get ALL folders from clink moved over ) I am on  a desktop, get to my clink  email via webmail and the info.  at clink  is as follows: </pre> <p>POP3 Server:	<a href=""http://pop.centurylink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.centurylink.net</a> POP3 Port:	995 (SSL/TLS) </p><p>IMAP Server:	<a href=""http://mail.centurylink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.centurylink.net</a> IMAP Port:	993 (SSL/TLS) </p><p>SMTP Server:	<a href=""http://smtp.centurylink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.centurylink.net</a> SMTP Port:	587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL) </p><p>I think I may have royally screwed up but hope not.  I am totally new to this concept , sorry. If I need to delete what I've done here and start over some guidance would be greatly appreciated. Did I mess up by putting all my centurylink email info. in here at this website?  Should I go and change my pw at centurylink now and/or delete the account I set up here?
