All three domains are hosted at the same ISP - Ionos. Therefore all three have the same SMTP server for outgoing emails - <a href=""http://smtp.ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ionos.com</a>. But each has a different mailbox with different email address, so when I set up the accounts in TB I specify <a href=""http://smtp.ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ionos.com</a> as the email server along with the email address appropriate to that domain: ted@A.com, ted@B.org, and ted@C.net. The problem is that when I set the email address for one of these accounts TB changes the other two accounts to match it. So, for instance, the email address for all three accounts' SMTP server ends up being ted@A.com. Then, of course, each time I use a different account to send email I have to go back in and change the email address and reenter the PW for that account.

I'm slowly learning the ropes.  Between my wife and I we use 2 computers and two phones.  I have set up the computers to use POP3.  My logic being that I want a copy of all email activities on at least one of my computers at home.  (I noticed that only my inbox is has been imported to my Thunderbird files on my computers, no other folders have been imported.)  However, I've just discovered that when I create and send an email from Thunderbird on my home computer, a copy is not saved on my service provider's sent folder (@bell.net).  I'm assuming that is because I'm using POP3.  If I understand correctly, if I use IMAP all my folders will be synched (including my sent etc) between my service provider and my computers.  Is that correct?  If so, then I guess I should be using IMAP instead of POP3.  If that's true then is my only option to occasionally archive my Thunderbird files before cleaning up my service provider folders?
