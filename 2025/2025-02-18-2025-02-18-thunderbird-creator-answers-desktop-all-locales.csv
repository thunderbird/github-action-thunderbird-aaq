Only one of those folders seems to be working, ie when I click the trash can icon, where actually does the message go if there's no Deleted emails folder?? The Junk and Trash folders have never had any discarded messages in them, so they seem not to be working. [Gmail]Trash seems to work as it filters out recent trash... What happens to it though? What's the time frame for being in this folder?  In my limited ideas about setting things up, I'd reckon the main problems are the inactive two folders mentioned above and a missing Deleted Emails folder. But how to go about this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1712869;,fraubarduhn
1493996,2025-02-17 18:07:30 -0800,2025-02-17 20:31:29 -0800,TB keeps changing the email address for my smtp server,"<p>I have TB accounts setup for email from three different domains. Let's call them <a href=""http://A.com"" rel=""nofollow"">A.com</a>, <a href=""http://B.org"" rel=""nofollow"">B.org</a>, and <a href=""http://C.net"" rel=""nofollow"">C.net</a>. All three domains are hosted at the same ISP - Ionos. Therefore all three have the same SMTP server for outgoing emails - <a href=""http://smtp.ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ionos.com</a>. But each has a different mailbox with different email address, so when I set up the accounts in TB I specify <a href=""http://smtp.ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ionos.com</a> as the email server along with the email address appropriate to that domain: ted@A.com, ted@B.org, and ted@C.net. The problem is that when I set the email address for one of these accounts TB changes the other two accounts to match it. So, for instance, the email address for all three accounts' SMTP server ends up being ted@A.com. Then, of course, each time I use a different account to send email I have to go back in and change the email address and reenter the PW for that account. How can I stop TB from changing all three accounts and get it to keep the appropriate email address with the right account? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1712864;,tharrso

The emails that were sent did not open correctly, i.e. we see one header, but a completely different email opens, this is not the case with all emails, selectively. This also happens sometimes in previously received emails, and it also happens that the counter for new unread emails in some folders does not display until you enter this folder. The problem is only when working through the Thunderbird client, it has been going on for more than a year, the client has also been updated many times. This problem is reproduced on other PCs when we are log in this user account . There are no similar problems in the browser.
