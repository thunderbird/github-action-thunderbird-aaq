I have the correct password and can log into my mail on <a href=""http://wowway.net"" rel=""nofollow"">wowway.net</a> I did not touch anything, it just stopped working. All the POP settings are correct per wowway website. Should I uninstall it? It seems a new update was released on 11-12. When I opened it on 11-13, it didn't work.

I unchecked a box (it was called something board) and it was gone but cant find it to restore the option. I right clicked on that to get a drop down menu with a few choices. I cant remember exactly what they said. One of the icons was for manually bringing in my mail, like a refresh option as well as some other choices beside it. This was visible above my account name which is just above the inbox. Anyone have any idea where I find that again to restore it?  One click and it was gone!&nbsp;:-(  Hope I explained it good.

I don't know when this started happening, but I noticed that the notification sound for new emails was not working. You can switch between the default (D) or WAV file (U) in Settings → New mail notification → Play sound, but it will not work no matter which one you select. Also, in the field for specifying WAV files, the directory of the file specified from the previous version is entered, but I cannot delete it (see attached image). </p><p>Thank you for your support.

Come posso spostare le due voci nella posizione corretta visto che non c'è una voce diretta con ""sposta"".
