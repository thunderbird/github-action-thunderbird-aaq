I have been dealing with the problem of the requirement to sign in to Thunderbird using Google.  It does not work.  I enter my e-mail address, click next, and get a second window that says ""Error 400"".  I tried to get some help with this through a company listed on the internet as Just Answer.  That turned out to be a scam. </p><p>Someone called me this morning, offering to help me with this problem.  The person was from the company The Web Services.  While the technician from Web Services was working on my computer for a while to restore my Thunderbird files, he told he that they kept losing the internet connection to my computer.  He said they had determined that they kept losing the internet connection, because some hackers were hacking into my computer, while they were working. He showed me a lot of evidence of hacking on my computer, indicating that the 2 technicians from Just Answer who had helped me the day before through long chats were hacking into my computer the entire time they were chatting with me, going through steps they said would solve the problem with having to sign in to Thunderbird using Google.  I think the people from Just Answer had tried to create a Thunderbird back-up profile, but had not done it correctly.  As a result, all the data within Thunderbird was lost.  I cancelled my subscription with Just Answer today. </p><p>The technician from The Web Services was able to restore my Thunderbird, including the many local files I have.  Some additional formatting of the site still needs to be done, and the correct server settings need to be set up.  That is to be finished tomorrow morning.  The Web Services person also sold me an anti-hacking firewall, which is supposed to also provide network security. </p><p>I am concerned, because on the Mozilla support page, it specifically states that Thunderbird does not offer phone support.  I gave this company access to my computer today, so they could restore my Thunderbird files.  The Thunderbird files have been restored. Now I see that the issue with trying unsuccessfully to sign in to Thunderbird using Google is still there. So I am right back where I started over a week ago, trying to find someone who can solve the issues that come up when I try  to sign into Thunderbird with Google. </p><p>I am somewhat suspicious of the company The Web Services, because they called me and offered to fix the problems I am having with signing in to Thunderbird.  Please let me know whether it was unwise to let them work on my computer today.  Could this be another scam?

In that scenario I create a .mbox file of all messages I want to save from a particular year and then import that into Thunderbird into a local folder with the year as the folder name. The version of Thunderbird where I was doing that is 115.10.1   </p><p>I started testing Thunderbird version 139.0.2 as an Apple Mail replacement with only 2 of my email accounts.  </p><p>Now I want to convert entirely out of Apple Mail. First I made a backup copy of the entire Thunderbird folder located in the User/Library folder onto an external hard drive that I then disconnected from my computer.  </p><p>Then I downloaded the latest version 145.0 (aarch64) and installed it. (I still have the other 2 versions on my system) I opened it up and got into the profile manager (troubleshooting then about profiles) and discovered that I have 4 of them. I made the one that contains my archive the primary one. It does not have any connections to a live email account. I've only ever imported an .mbox file. Everything that I've archived is there. This is profile Number 1. I renamed it Archive so I could keep track of it.  </p><p>Then I opened up each of the other 3 profiles in a new browser in sequence to see what they were.  </p><p>It appears as if I have one that is empty. it opens up wanting me to set up an existing email address. I closed that one down. It's called Profile number 2.  </p><p>The next one appears to be the current one for the 2 test email accounts. It has them properly configured, showing messages in the inbox and with the messages that are supposed to be archived off in the local folders I had created as I expect. I am calling this one profile number 3. </p><p>The third one first had me add the passwords for the 2 test accounts and then it is pretty close to number  number 3 but is missing some of the local folders. This is called profile number 4.  </p><p>Want I want to end up with is 1 profile. I would prefer to start with the one that has all my archive messages in their local folders, and then add the test accounts including all their messages from profile number 3 with its local folders. Once they are safely moved and part of the Archive profile I would like to delete all three numbered profiles.  Once I am down to only one active profile and no others lurking about I plan to slowly start adding the rest of my email accounts moving them one by one out of Apple Mail and into Thunderbird.  </p><p>I've read the various articles on moving out of Apple Mail into Thunderbird So I believe I can add the Apple email accounts to my Archive profile successfully. I have the import tools so I can import the .mbox files from Apple mail into those accounts.  </p><p>Where I'm stuck is I can't seem to find an article that gives me detailed instructions on how to combine profiles within Thunderbird. All the articles imply keeping multiple profiles active and I would prefer not to do that.  </p><p>I am sure I am just not searching properly but I am at a loss as to how to proceed. I do not want to delete any profiles or start adding more accounts until the profiles are cleaned up.  </p><p>Thanks for reading this long explanation and I appreciate any help anyone can provide. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1779341;1779438;1779445;1779459;,oogiem
