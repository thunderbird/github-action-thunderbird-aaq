I unchecked a box (it was called something board) and it was gone but cant find it to restore the option. I right clicked on that to get a drop down menu with a few choices. I cant remember exactly what they said. One of the icons was for manually bringing in my mail, like a refresh option as well as some other choices beside it. This was visible above my account name which is just above the inbox. Anyone have any idea where I find that again to restore it?  One click and it was gone!&nbsp;:-(  Hope I explained it good.

I don't know when this started happening, but I noticed that the notification sound for new emails was not working. You can switch between the default (D) or WAV file (U) in Settings → New mail notification → Play sound, but it will not work no matter which one you select. Also, in the field for specifying WAV files, the directory of the file specified from the previous version is entered, but I cannot delete it (see attached image). </p><p>Thank you for your support.

I have been dealing with the problem of the requirement to sign in to Thunderbird using Google.  It does not work.  I enter my e-mail address, click next, and get a second window that says ""Error 400"".  I tried to get some help with this through a company listed on the internet as Just Answer.  That turned out to be a scam. </p><p>Someone called me this morning, offering to help me with this problem.  The person was from the company The Web Services.  While the technician from Web Services was working on my computer for a while to restore my Thunderbird files, he told he that they kept losing the internet connection to my computer.  He said they had determined that they kept losing the internet connection, because some hackers were hacking into my computer, while they were working. He showed me a lot of evidence of hacking on my computer, indicating that the 2 technicians from Just Answer who had helped me the day before through long chats were hacking into my computer the entire time they were chatting with me, going through steps they said would solve the problem with having to sign in to Thunderbird using Google.  I think the people from Just Answer had tried to create a Thunderbird back-up profile, but had not done it correctly.  As a result, all the data within Thunderbird was lost.  I cancelled my subscription with Just Answer today. </p><p>The technician from The Web Services was able to restore my Thunderbird, including the many local files I have.  Some additional formatting of the site still needs to be done, and the correct server settings need to be set up.  That is to be finished tomorrow morning.  The Web Services person also sold me an anti-hacking firewall, which is supposed to also provide network security. </p><p>I am concerned, because on the Mozilla support page, it specifically states that Thunderbird does not offer phone support.  I gave this company access to my computer today, so they could restore my Thunderbird files.  The Thunderbird files have been restored. Now I see that the issue with trying unsuccessfully to sign in to Thunderbird using Google is still there. So I am right back where I started over a week ago, trying to find someone who can solve the issues that come up when I try  to sign into Thunderbird with Google. </p><p>I am somewhat suspicious of the company The Web Services, because they called me and offered to fix the problems I am having with signing in to Thunderbird.  Please let me know whether it was unwise to let them work on my computer today.  Could this be another scam?

I have about 8 emails with two domains.  First email works okay.  The second one on the same domain has turned red on the left panel and thunderbird keeps poppoing up the certificate for <a href=""http://mail.xxx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.xxx.com</a> is not valid for the server.  The other works I added the exception when setting it up.  The mail server is another domain used from my cpanel hosting provider. So it does not match the domain of the emails.   </p><p>I can't seem to find a way around this to get it to work.  Also I under account settings it looks correct.
