I get a ""Mozilla Thunderbird not responding"" message when I try and click on anything and I can't get out of this page nor access my Inbox. I've  tried starting Thunderbird in Safe Mode which didn't work. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the latest version of Thunderbird but when it starts it goes straight back to the frozen ""Account Settings"" page. I've checked my profile and there is a new profile that was created with today's date. There is also a profile from June 2025. If the old profile contains all my emails and folders up to yesterday, that would be OK. </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,1776268;,geoffreysmith
