However, none of the folders I created in Outlook have been copied over. Only the standard built-in folders e.g inbox, junk, sent etc were setup in Thunderbolt with all the mail from the other folders in the inbox. This is not very helpful.  </p><p>How do I set up the Thunderbolt account so that the folders (and contents) are matched with the folders (and contents) in Outlook? Thanks </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1734013;1734026;,ayyaesika

This time, however, the folder appeared in italics and was grayed out and had a sub folder which contained the partial name of one of my other folders, and both were empty. In addition, a couple of folders disappeared, but their emails appeared in other folders. The emails from at least one of the disappeared folders, are missing. However, if I do a global search for the email address of any of those messages, they all appear in the results window. I just don't know where they are. I have attempted to track this down and implement a couple of different solutions but I fear digging deeper is going to get me in trouble and I will lose these emails. I know this narrative sounds somewhat disjointed, but this behavior is beyond my comprehension. Does anyone understand what is going on and how I can correct this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",kljecoc
