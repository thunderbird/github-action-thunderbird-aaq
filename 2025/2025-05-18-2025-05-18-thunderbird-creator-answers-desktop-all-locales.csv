However, none of the folders I created in Outlook have been copied over. Only the standard built-in folders e.g inbox, junk, sent etc were setup in Thunderbolt with all the mail from the other folders in the inbox. This is not very helpful.  </p><p>How do I set up the Thunderbolt account so that the folders (and contents) are matched with the folders (and contents) in Outlook? Thanks </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ayyaesika
