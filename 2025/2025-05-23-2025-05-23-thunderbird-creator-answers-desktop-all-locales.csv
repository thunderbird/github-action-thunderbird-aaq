I cannot get it to open to retrieve emails (100+ a day, mostly junk). I don't have my email passwords so I can't go online to use cpanel webmail.

Suddenly it has stopped doing so. I have checked that all my addresses are still present in the Address Book (relief!), but I note that the Contacts sidebar is completely empty (even the Address Book options are missing). I can't find a setting to correct this, and would be very grateful to know how to revert to the previous good performance.

This happened in version 128, and I have now updated it to the latest version, 138.0.2, but the problem persists. Previously, if I selected any message and right-clicked, there was a local menu option 'View as conversation' (or something similar - I use a localised version). Now, if I right-click the message, it opens with only two options: 'Open in a new pane' or 'Open in a new window'. No conversation view. The default shortcut (CTRL + SHIFT + O) does not work either. </p><p>(I did not change any settings, I only compacted folders and tried to rebuild thir index because the global search did not find existing messages.)  </p><p>Any help on how to restore this functionality would be very much appreciated!
