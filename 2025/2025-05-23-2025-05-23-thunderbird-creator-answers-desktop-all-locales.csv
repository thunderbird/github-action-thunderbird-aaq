About a week later it stopped again and nothing I try fixes it. I can't keep going to my ISP to change my password. The same thing is happening to Thunderbird on my Android phone, except every once in a while, it downloads 20 or so emails, then days of nothing. Its intensely frustrating!

I can't seem to save all three.  If I save one and then move to the next account, the old password is used.  </p><p>Can anyone confirm if this is possible? And if so can I get some suggestions about what I may be doing wrong? </p><p>I've read several of the threads that suggest that most people go wrong when they select the smtp server. I have followed the directions to select from the Outgoing Server list at the bottom of the left pane. Each copy of the smtp server has a unique description. I suspect its because the username is the same for each one. Which is required by SendGrid.
