I cannot get it to open to retrieve emails (100+ a day, mostly junk). I don't have my email passwords so I can't go online to use cpanel webmail. All my digital records are stored in Thunderbird inbox folders. Which I can't access. Any idea what is happening? Since I can't access email, please contact me via text 530 521-5296 or Facebook messenger Hildy Langewis. thank you! I'm on the road for at least a week and not being able to keep up with emails is troubling! </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",hildy5

Suddenly it has stopped doing so. I have checked that all my addresses are still present in the Address Book (relief!), but I note that the Contacts sidebar is completely empty (even the Address Book options are missing). I can't find a setting to correct this, and would be very grateful to know how to revert to the previous good performance.
