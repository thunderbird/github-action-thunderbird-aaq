Now, if I right-click the message, it opens with only two options: 'Open in a new pane' or 'Open in a new window'. No conversation view. The default shortcut (CTRL + SHIFT + O) does not work either. </p><p>(I did not change any settings, I only compacted folders and tried to rebuild thir index because the global search did not find existing messages.)  </p><p>Any help on how to restore this functionality would be very much appreciated!
