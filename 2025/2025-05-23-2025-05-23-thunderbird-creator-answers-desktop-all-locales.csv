Eventually, I want to delete my accounts with gmail and outlook. I've discovered in trying to bridge thunderbird to my network/router? (i think that's what's going on), my network/router is connected to my gmail account. I haven't figured out how to change that or if I should. But when I try to sign into thunderbird email, it asks me to sign in with my gmail account. I have an apple email account and trying to get that to be my sign in with thunderbird NOT gmail. Is it possible to sign in with apple account and if so what steps (please in very simple instructions) do I need to take to get the sign in to ask me to sign in with my apple account? Do I need to change my network/router (of which I haven't figured out how to do and if I can get around that I would love that) somehow to the apple account? help....

I have three accounts I'm trying to send mail through. SendGrid uses a username of ""apikey"" and a long key as the password. I read the instructions here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1495483"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1495483</a> which seems to suggest this is possible. I've set up accounts for each of the three and they all work as long as I don't save the password. When I save the password the smtp saved password is saved for whichever one I'm using. I can't seem to save all three.  If I save one and then move to the next account, the old password is used.  </p><p>Can anyone confirm if this is possible? And if so can I get some suggestions about what I may be doing wrong? </p><p>I've read several of the threads that suggest that most people go wrong when they select the smtp server. I have followed the directions to select from the Outgoing Server list at the bottom of the left pane. Each copy of the smtp server has a unique description. I suspect its because the username is the same for each one. Which is required by SendGrid. Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1736073;,danielso
