The events all show an ""Organizer"" of ""unknownorganizer@calendar.google.com"". I don't want to ""work around"" this by disabling reminders, as this defeats a LOT of the purpose of having the calendar in the first place, for me at least. I did find that I can delete the calendar entry if I access it via the a Web browser, so it's not like I don't have ""write rights"" to it. It's a mystery to me as to why it can't be otherwise updated. I also noted that these events have very bizarre ""reminder"" settings. They have a reminder set for 159 hours before the event starts, as well as the even more bizarre 9 hours after the event. There doesn't appear to be any related settings in Google Calendar on the Web that would have caused these wacky reminder configurations. </p><p>FYI - I'm not using any calendar extensions in Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;events;,thunderbird,events,en-US,"",salindley0
