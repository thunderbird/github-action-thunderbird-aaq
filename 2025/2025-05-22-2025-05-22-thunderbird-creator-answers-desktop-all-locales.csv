For the last few weeks intermittently Thunderbird says it has sent the message but it can't save it, and offers to only save it in local folders. Have tried recreating the accounts affected, repairing the sent folder on the accounts affected,changing the folder that sent items are saved in. Is it is intermittent. Sometimes closing Thunderbird and opening it up again solves the problem. Any help appreciated.
