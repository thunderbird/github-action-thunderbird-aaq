You'd have to use <b>Table View</b> if you want to be able to choose the information you want to be displayed in the message list: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/getting-started-thunderbird-main-window-supernova"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/getting-started-thunderbird-main-window-supernova</a> </p><p>The other issue is that you appear to not have configured that account properly to make Thunderbird use the right folder for saving sent messages, so Thunderbird is treating that folder as any other folder, not as a special <i>Sent</i> folder. Go to <b>Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders</b>, select <b>Other</b> for saving sent messages and choose the <b>Sent Mail</b> folder from the list of available options there. That will make Thunderbird change the information it displays in <b>Cards View</b> for that folder. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

In those situations, all you need is the email address and password. For lesser known, or custom, accounts, you need to have server setup information for incoming server and outgoing server. We can probably help you better if you share the information that you have. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

There I see that indexing of one Sent folder seems to got stuck. At least it does not change the counter (232) over hours. (see picture) That would explain why only (parts of the) Sent folders are indexed. Any idea how to solve this? </p>",deherrdoktor,false,0,0
