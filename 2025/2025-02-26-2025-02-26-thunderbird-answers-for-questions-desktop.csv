(I'd prefer that to losing them!) or will it just be an empty message new slate? I'm nervous of doing anything that means I'll lose stuff.... </p><p>Also, to help me with what I've got currently, can you advise if there's anything I can do to make the current POP Inbox folders show their messages? </p><p>Sorry it's complicated....what I really want is a magic wand&nbsp;:) </p>",Nears,false,0,0

But you don't have to remove from Thunderbird the POP account you already have if you don't want to, you may set it up as IMAP and keep both setups for a while if you want until you get used to IMAP. </p><p>The IMAP account will show in Thunderbird what's on the server for the folders you subscribe to. I'd recommend not subscribing to <i>All Mail</i>, but Thunderbird will definitely try to show all the mail you have in <i>Inbox</i> on the server. And if you remove a message from <i>Inbox</i> in Thunderbird using the IMAP account, it will be removed from <i>Inbox</i> on the server too. </p><p>Not sure how to fix your <i>Inbox</i> problems because I don't even understand what you say about getting a ""Couldn't load XPCOM"" error message, doesn't make sense to me, but don't create subfolders of <i>Inbox</i> to organise your mail locally on your computer. Use <b>Local Folders</b> at the bottom of the folder pane for that. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
