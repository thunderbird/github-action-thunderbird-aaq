However, the remainder of the Inbox, dating back to 2010, was not there, neither were my address books. Why didn't a clean copy of the app download so I can import my Profiles? In addition, my old laptop uses POP incoming, but the new laptop seems to be configured to IMAP. Is this a problem, and if so, which should I choose for the new laptop? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",cmfindlay
