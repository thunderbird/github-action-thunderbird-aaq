While that is a quick fix it does not address the underlying cause. A general search for the problem suggests that  it also affects other email clients.  This suggests that the problem is either a problem with IMAP or if your service provider uses the Microsoft email service platform.  This problem therefore seems to be down to Microsoft.  I am in this position myself and another I believe related problem is the slow housekeeping that occurs when creating, moving or deleting Thunderbird folders.  The fact that by closing Thunderbird and restarting usually fixes the problem suggests either Thunderbird is not reindexing its data very quickly or Microsoft is not very quick in publishing changes. I hope these observations point the way to a possible formal solution rather than head in sand let's ignore it solutions.  The  problem while not world ending it does create FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) for users. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",manager11

The problem(s) that I’m having are what’s frequently discussed with regard to Tbird “gulping” system drive storage, without frequent release. </p><p>I have been reading most of the narratives from this complaint, but the problem I’m having seems a lot different. So, I came here to explain my observation(s), in hopes I could correct this issue. </p><p>1. I am a long term Thunderbird POP3 user, since before the failures 	began related to signon security changes, before the 	Tbird corrections were employed(figuratively rewritten). 	I left Tbird during that time, and now I’m back. 2. So, like many others, my problem(s) arise from Tbird’s apparent 	failure to relinquish storage areas, when unused. 3. Right now, My W10 system drive(SSD) is setting at sitting at 122G. 4. It should be &lt;100G, and it’s been as high as 13xG. 5. But, through some magic, something seems to happen during a 	inactive period, that will magically trip this storage to 	a more reasonable value. I have seen this 122G drop 	to 102G, but not in a very long time. 6. Beyond the fact that I’m stumped, I chose to write this narrative 	because my operations/experiences are significantly  	different from others I’ve read. 7. First, this is the only problem that I’m having with Tbird. Everything 	that I perform operates flawlessly. 8. And, probably even more noteworthy, is that I never maintain ANY 	email data inside Tbird. Barring absence, as soon as I 	determine email arrival, or any email changes, I simply 	move that email to a system repository for archival. As 	soon as this archival is complete, the email is deleted 	from it’s point of arrival. So, IOW, every time I close this 	system, Tbird will be completely empty of current mail. 9. Additionally, I initially configured ALL email storage repository to 	reside on another system removable drive. 10. Prior to this note, I issued the compact request. I did see a 3.0MB, 	but I’ve never seen anything above 0 MB before. 11. Additional attempts as solving this storage release problem, has 	warranted my purchase of a software product that will 	allow me to “look” into the internal storage of Tbird and 	several competitors, to send this hidden data to other 	repositories. It’s a long story, but I needed the product 	to migrate email data, where only Print PDF was avail- 	able. 12. But, it’s been very helpful in identifying Tbird internal email data 	that remains, despite the fact that I’d cleaned Tbird of 	everthing prior to my last review. 13. And, another issue is that all the email data that external email 	tool identifies, is deeply hidden from my standard Tbird 	client. The email data may be several/many days old, 	even though the related viewable email data had been 	archived/deleted several days earlier. 14. I mentioned that I have my email data re-positioned(#8) to external 	system repository drive for archival. This specification is 	issued in the “Local Directory” definition defined within 	each email target definition. From my long past experie- 	nces with Tbird, I learned that I could enter each of these 	“Local Directory” alternate repositories, and just simply 	erase them of ALL email data. 15. And, the next time Tbird was initialized, those “Local Directory” 	repositories would be rebuilt, clean. This will remove 	all email characteristics formerly present. And, the  	remote repositories(#11) will be built clean, and no 	latent email data will remain. However, this is probably 	unavailable for the 99.99% of users that maintain email 	on/in the Tbird system. 16. Tbird does, at some time, reorganize these repositories to regain 	wasted drive space. I don’t know/understand just what 	triggers this reorganization, and it never seems to “sync” 	the complete unused storage available. Right now, my 	system drive(SSD) was up to 122GB. Some time during 	my research, I noticed a drop to 111GB. But, if all empty 	data was reorganized, it would be &lt;100GB. Of course, 	when I describe these system drive totals, I’m referencing 	the high limit of storage, including ALL installed software. 	(#5). 17. The software product that I installed, to be used to move email data 	from an email client to a stationary repository, is known as 	“YOTA Email Migrator” – A product of by YOTA Software 	Inc. <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=yota+email+migrator&amp;atb=v415-1&amp;ia=web"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=yota+email+migrator&amp;atb=v415-1&amp;ia=web</a> 18. I’m very sorry for my extensive narrative, but this is complicated, and 	complication needs words. </p><p><br> Thank you, </p><p>Gary Walker - </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",twf6714
