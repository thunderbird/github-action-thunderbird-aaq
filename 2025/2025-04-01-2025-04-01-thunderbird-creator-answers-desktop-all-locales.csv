1502956,2025-03-31 17:10:38 -0700,2025-03-31 17:10:38 -0700,Thunderbird Unread Junk problem,"<p>There is a persistent Thunderbird problem of empty junk folder showing 1 unread message <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1371351"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1371351</a> refers.  While that is a quick fix it does not address the underlying cause. A general search for the problem suggests that  it also affects other email clients.  This suggests that the problem is either a problem with IMAP or if your service provider uses the Microsoft email service platform.  This problem therefore seems to be down to Microsoft.  I am in this position myself and another I believe related problem is the slow housekeeping that occurs when creating, moving or deleting Thunderbird folders.  The fact that by closing Thunderbird and restarting usually fixes the problem suggests either Thunderbird is not reindexing its data very quickly or Microsoft is not very quick in publishing changes. I hope these observations point the way to a possible formal solution rather than head in sand let's ignore it solutions.  The  problem while not world ending it does create FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) for users. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",manager11
