I've seen a number of threads on this topic, but no definitive solution.  This used to be so simple back in Windows 7, but Microsoft seems to have made it much more difficult -- or impossible -- to properly configure this setting. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1731356;,Luminary99

Per verificare il funzionamento dell'app ho collegato per il momento solo un account yahoo, non sono riuscito a trovare un metodo che mi permette di visualizzare in quali cartelle ci sono nuovi messaggi (dovrei entrare in ognuna di queste e fare il refresh, cosa scomodissima), esiste una modalità che rinnova il contenuto di tutte le cartelle quando scarico la posta e mi evidenzia il numero di messaggi nuovi? Nel client di posta nativo c'è la possibilità di visualizzare tutti i nuovi messaggi raggruppati in una unica vista oltre al numero di messaggi nuovi sul nome di ogni cartella.

I used to be able to search for a message or messages by entering a search term in a search field, and/or using a filter like subject, sender, etc.  But a few months ago that stopped working.  Instead, there is no search field (except the general one searching for the term anywhere in the message) unless I click ""quick filter"", which then provides a more targeted search.  But it calls up a random array of messages bearing no relationship to the search item.  This is only on my MacbookAir.  My iPhone also has Thunderbird but its search function seems accurate, only displaying what the search value is, except it doesn't get many when I know there are more in my inbox.
