I've seen a number of threads on this topic, but no definitive solution.  This used to be so simple back in Windows 7, but Microsoft seems to have made it much more difficult -- or impossible -- to properly configure this setting. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Luminary99

Other folders are now in gray italics.  This just happened suddenly when I went away from my computer for a few hours and then returned.  I've tried to restart but nothing has improved.  I opened my Gmail account and everything is also rearranged and/or missing from Gmail.  This is my business, so I'm very concerned. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mara4

Per verificare il funzionamento dell'app ho collegato per il momento solo un account yahoo, non sono riuscito a trovare un metodo che mi permette di visualizzare in quali cartelle ci sono nuovi messaggi (dovrei entrare in ognuna di queste e fare il refresh, cosa scomodissima), esiste una modalità che rinnova il contenuto di tutte le cartelle quando scarico la posta e mi evidenzia il numero di messaggi nuovi? Nel client di posta nativo c'è la possibilità di visualizzare tutti i nuovi messaggi raggruppati in una unica vista oltre al numero di messaggi nuovi sul nome di ogni cartella. Grazie Buon lavoro. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,"",panetta.fernando
