I've seen a number of threads on this topic, but no definitive solution.  This used to be so simple back in Windows 7, but Microsoft seems to have made it much more difficult -- or impossible -- to properly configure this setting. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Luminary99

Other folders are now in gray italics.  This just happened suddenly when I went away from my computer for a few hours and then returned.  I've tried to restart but nothing has improved.  I opened my Gmail account and everything is also rearranged and/or missing from Gmail.  This is my business, so I'm very concerned. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mara4
