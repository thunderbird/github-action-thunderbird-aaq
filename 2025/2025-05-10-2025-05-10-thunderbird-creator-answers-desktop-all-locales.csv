I've seen a number of threads on this topic, but no definitive solution.  This used to be so simple back in Windows 7, but Microsoft seems to have made it much more difficult -- or impossible -- to properly configure this setting. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1731356;,Luminary99
