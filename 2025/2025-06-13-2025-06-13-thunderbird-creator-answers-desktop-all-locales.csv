Több fiókot használok, és ez a hiba csak egy szervernél lép fel 2-3 havonta. (Net-tech szervere).  Eddig a problémát úgy oldottam meg, hogy a korábbi mentésből visszatöltöttem a \Thunderbird mobile\Data\profile\Mail könyvtár kivételével mindent - amitől a probléma megszűnik. De azért jó lenne tudni, hogy mi állítódik el, vagy mi lehet a hiba oka. Köszi, Erik. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,hu,"",krajcserik
