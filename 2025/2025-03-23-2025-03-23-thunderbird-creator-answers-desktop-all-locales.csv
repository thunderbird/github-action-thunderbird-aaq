I have both gmail and other domain mail server accounts in T-bird. </p><p>Today, it's happening again.  I can't seem to resolve the issue even though I've been through the process of providing requested information and permissions.  I can't get T-bird to connect to servers to look for downloadable messages.  This is a problem that is keeping me from using 2-step verification with several websites that I need to contact.  I say that T-bird isn't connecting because the messages that normally appear when I request downloads do not appear at the bottom of my screen.  The problem started with the first screen below  and has now migrated to the second screen.  I tried sending test email among my accounts, both gmail and others, but I cannot.  As far as I can tell, T-bird is sending the messages to servers but not retrieving them, but I cannot be sure they were sent.  As I was typing this sentence the second screen below popped up without my doing anything with email. </p><p>I don't recall what I've done in the past to resolve the issue.  IIRC it has required different acts at different times.  Today, nothing seems to work.  If this continues, I'm going to have to find another email client after having used T-Bird for more than a decade. </p><p>Can someone please tell me how to get off this merry-go-round? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rabbithutch1
