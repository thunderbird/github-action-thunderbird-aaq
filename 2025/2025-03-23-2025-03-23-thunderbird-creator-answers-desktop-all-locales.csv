Since then whenever I open an email the window is at top left of the screen and is partially obscured. I can move it easily, but new messages always default to the top left position, unlike the Thunderbird in Mint 20.3 where new messages defaulted to the last used position. Can I change this behaviour? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",cliffcoggin
