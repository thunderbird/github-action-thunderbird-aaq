On the main mail page, across the top, there is a search bar (ctrl k). Should there be a 2nd one below it in the middle?  Trying to configure it exactly like my older one, but can't find the right selections.  Had remote help from BestBuy Geek, she only got half of it. The 2nd search bar is there, and  tried to take a snap of it but can't get it. It has the threads symbol, the attached symbol, and one other on the left, and at the end of that line is the symbol to select them.  She missed that completely.  Can anyone tell me what that part is called, and where to make the selections from?  (easier if I could show it to you, sorry) As always, Thank you!

A couple of times I've had to shut down T-bird and re-launch it to get back to this list/window.  I don't understand why such a Tab isn't available everywhere. </p><p>So I'm looking for an add-on which would allow me to add a specific Tab on the T-bird pages where it isn't there,  specifically, a Tab to get to the window which has the list of my email accounts. </p><p>If there is such a customization, I'd appreciate getting a link to get it. </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,"",KJS-LES

The weird thing was that on start-up, some were displayed, but disappear one-by-one. Another laptop which was running 120 still had the sub-folders intact. I updated that to 140, and when TB restarted, the sub-folders were displayed, then slowly disappeared, one-by-one. It is only the Ymail account that is effected, we have a couple of Outlook accounts that display their Inbox sub-folders. I have selected ""Subscribe"", all folders are selected. I've unticked the sub-folders thinking that maybe it would allow me to re-select them, but on a re-start they are still shown as selected. </p><p>Hope you have a solution. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>b0b </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",drdos7666
