I am finding that dozens of folders I have deleted reappear in the Thunderbird folder list as <em>italicized</em>, and then when trash is emptied they persist in Deleted Items <em>italicized</em> as well.   </p><p>I also use Google Workspace in Thunderbird and don't see this issue. I have set up new profiles from scratch on multiple machines on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The problem always returns. </p><p>My sense is that the italics represent old subscriptions to folders that no longer exist. The IMAP subscriptions are enumerated somewhere that is inaccurate and/or corrupt so that unsubscribing or deleting is ineffective (i.e. Thunderbird lists the folders that O 365 says are subscribed to, but O 365 can't delete folders that don't exist). </p><p>I have been in this job 29 years, which is to say I have a lot of mail, and a lot of folders, and a lot of folders that have been deleted when names of departments changed over that time or people retired. I am willing to accept that Microsoft's IMAP breaks when you have more than X folders or Y messages. </p><p>I started off asking our O 365 admins ""I don't know how to do this, but is there a JSON or XML or something that lists IMAP subscriptions that can be deleted so I can start fresh?"" They didn't know, so now we have taken up the issue with Microsoft. They insist the folders are not in the mail store, which I don't dispute. They have also suggested it's a Thunderbird issue. This makes no sense, since how Thunderbird wouldn't know when I set up a new profile, for example, that I once had a folder called Vendors with a sub-folder called  Polycom, unless O 365 listed it. </p><p>I am ready to save all the email and ask the O 365 admins to create a new account for me, assuming that I had too many folders and broke my mail store in way that nobody seems to know how to fix. Microsoft suggested I post here first. </p><p>Is anybody here familiar enough with O 365's IMAP implementation to know how to reset a mail store's IMAP subscriptions? </p>",jrodgers40;Toad-Hall;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:141.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/141.0,1,0,0,,,
