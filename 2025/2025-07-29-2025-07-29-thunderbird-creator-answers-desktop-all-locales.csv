On the main mail page, across the top, there is a search bar (ctrl k). Should there be a 2nd one below it in the middle?  Trying to configure it exactly like my older one, but can't find the right selections.  Had remote help from BestBuy Geek, she only got half of it. The 2nd search bar is there, and  tried to take a snap of it but can't get it. It has the threads symbol, the attached symbol, and one other on the left, and at the end of that line is the symbol to select them.  She missed that completely.  Can anyone tell me what that part is called, and where to make the selections from?  (easier if I could show it to you, sorry) As always, Thank you!

The weird thing was that on start-up, some were displayed, but disappear one-by-one. Another laptop which was running 120 still had the sub-folders intact. I updated that to 140, and when TB restarted, the sub-folders were displayed, then slowly disappeared, one-by-one. It is only the Ymail account that is effected, we have a couple of Outlook accounts that display their Inbox sub-folders. I have selected ""Subscribe"", all folders are selected. I've unticked the sub-folders thinking that maybe it would allow me to re-select them, but on a re-start they are still shown as selected. </p><p>Hope you have a solution. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>b0b </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",drdos7666

I love the things that extensions can do and so have a lot of them (I do worry about conflicts, but that seems to be less of a problem now).  One problem I see is that the space allotted for the toolbar is too limited.  It would be helpful if I could reduce slightly the space between the buttons.  I like the icon above description arrangement, but there are a couple with very long descriptions that are shown all on one line, making the button take up a lot of space.  Another thing that I've wondered about is the possibility of having another toolbar to contain the buttons that won't fit into the standard space. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1752459;,rogerandjennifer

The ability to color-code emails from contacts in my address book has been incredibly helpful in organizing my inbox. </p><p>However, distinguishing and color-coding emails from senders not in my address book is quite cumbersome with the current filtering system. Manually creating ""does not contain"" rules for each individual address is impractical and requires constant updates. </p><p>At this point, I'd like to submit a feature request that would significantly enhance the user experience: </p><p>A one-click button or easily accessible setting, such as ""Greyscale Unregistered Senders."" </p><p>Having this feature directly integrated into the Thunderbird interface (for instance, within Inbox settings or under the Tools menu) would save a significant amount of time and offer great visual convenience, especially for users who receive a large volume of emails. Having emails from unregistered senders appear in greyscale or a similar neutral color would help in quickly identifying important emails while separating those from unknown senders. </p><p>I believe that integrating such a feature would further strengthen Thunderbird's user-friendly design and make email management even more intuitive. </p><p>Thank you for considering my request.
