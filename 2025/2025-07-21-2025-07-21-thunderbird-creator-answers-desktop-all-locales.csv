There are several symptoms: 1) The CPU utilization of Thunderbird is typically 13-19%. 2) Thunderbird declares that it was able to send a message and to save it, but that it experienced difficulty when running filters. 3) Thunderbird is unable to compact a folder.  The message received is: </p><pre>   The folder 'Inbox on william.atwood@concordia.ca' could not be compacted because writing to folder failed.  Verify that you have enough disk space, and that you have write privileges to the file system, then try again. </pre> <p>4) Thunderbird occasionally gives the following error message: Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors.  You can retry or save the message locally  to Local Folders/Sent-william.atwood@concordia.ca. </p><p>These are the symptoms that I see today.  Over the longer term, I saw the following: </p><p>1) Thunderbird started to behave strangely several weeks ago.  It somehow lost track of what messages it had downloaded, so it started downloading all of the message headers in my inboxes (and other folders).  (I have six email accounts that I monitor.) </p><p>2) Since all of my accounts are IMAP accounts, with the messages stored on the server, I tried replacing the Thunderbird profile with a copy that I had previously backed up.  This seemed to solve the problem for a short time.  However, the symptoms soon re-appeared, including high CPU utilization, inability to compact folders, and difficulty running filters. </p><p>3) At the suggestion of my employer's help desk, I removed and re-installed Thunderbird.  This found the existing Thunderbird profile, and everything seemed to work just fine for a few days.  Then, suddenly, everything went haywire, and Thunderbird started re-loading all of the message headers for *all* of my folders (and for all of the accounts), and complaining about inability to run filters or compact folders. </p><p>Finally, Thunderbird crashed today.  I added notes to the crash report, giving some of the details above. After it restarted, it crashed again.  I finally ended up restarting my computer. </p><p>Thunderbird version 140.0.1 Windows 11 Edition	Windows 11 Enterprise Version	24H2 Installed on	‎2025-‎04-‎30 OS build	26100.4349 Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.26100.107.0 </p><p>What can I do to mitigate this problem?  It is very difficult to use Thunderbird when it acts like this. </p><p>Bill Atwood </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,1750521;,williamatwood41

I may have mistakenly made the modification which has resulted in them no longer appearing. I am still able to send emails via clicking on the mail symbol next to my email address and then clicking 'Write a new message' but prefer to avoid this step. I usually click on 'File' to empty the Deleted emails but as above, 'File' etc doesn't show. Neither do the number of emails in my Deleted file. The panel below the list of email files now shows 'Welcome to Freedom' which is new. I am an old codger eighty years old and my computer skills are fairly modest. I hope you can provide a simple fix.
