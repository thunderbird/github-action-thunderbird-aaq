It's very good at offering info on using it's own products and basic info on what server to use for email clients, but not so good at telling you what password are  now used or what it will allow via smtp.  </p><p><br> I located this from a Microsoft website: <em>Email addresses and phone numbers associated with your Microsoft account are called aliases and they use the same contacts, online storage, subscriptions, and account settings. </em> <em>You can use any of your aliases to sign in to Microsoft services or your Windows and Xbox devices, and you can select any of them for sending and receiving email. Your aliases share a single password.</em> </p><p>That's where I found out whatever is set up as password for Microsoft account now has to be used for all alias mail accounts. But it seems you can only choose to send from something other than primary if using Exchange or directly via webmail. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> Now the Microsoft Account contains email addresses/mail account which are all considered as alias accounts. So the password you use to access Microsoft Account must now be the same password used in all the <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>, <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> and any other mail address that uses the outlook server. </p><p>You can choose whatever email address you like to be the 'primary' email address, but Microsoft will now only allow you to send via smtp using that primary email address. </p><p>You must set all the above up via webmail access to Microsoft account. </p><p>In Thunderbird You will need to have cookies enabled Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security WEb Content Select 'Accept cookies from sites Accept third party cookies 'Always' </p><p>'Authentication Method' must be 'Oauth2'  for incoming and outgoing </p><p>If you have eg: two hotmail accounts, then whilst they get created separately you will need to set up all accounts to use Outgoing Server SMTP as only whatever account you set up as primary. </p><p>So if have eg: hotmail Acc1 and hotmail Acc2  AND Acc2 is set up as primary then: Smtp outgoing server for both Acc1 and Acc2 will use Acc2 email address. </p><p>In which case, in Account Settings, remember to set up Acc1 'Reply-to Address' email address as Acc1 email address  because it will be sending using Acc2 email address and you may not want replies going to wrong account. </p><p><br> So - it's important to set up a primary account which you know is ok for sending purposes. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

Files &amp; Attachments"" has a ""Content Type"" entry of ""[ ] http"" with a blank ""Action"". If I pull down the Action I can set it to ""Always ask"" or ""Use Chromium Web Browser (default)"", but then after going back to an email links still don't open (either left- or right-click). Moreover, if I close the Settings tab and reopen it the action has been reset to blank. </p><p>As per the many web pages I've looked at, including the <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/hyperlinks-in-messages-not-working"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/hyperlinks-in-messages-not-working</a> cited above, I've gone to the ""Config Editor"" / ""Advanced Preferences"", and have <strong>network.protocol-handler.external</strong>, <strong>network.protocol-handler.external-default</strong>, <strong>network.protocol-handler.external.http</strong>, and <strong>network.protocol-handler.external.https</strong> all set to ""true"". (I've tried many combinations of these, true and false, with no luck.)  </p><p>Again, in TB 102 and earlier I could always right-click a link and choose from one of several installed web browsers to open it. I've tried running in safe mode (`thunderbird --safe-mode`) (sorry, forgot to mention that this is all on Linux) which didn't help. I also think something is generically wrong with my TB's ability to connect to the net because using  ""Add-ons and Themes"" to go to the ""Add-ons Manager"" tab and clicking ""Find more add-ons"" creates a new TB tab but it's blank (I assume it should go to some Mozilla page with a list of TB add-ons). </p><p>Any suggestions welcome. I suspect I might have a conflict with some older TB version's configuration -- I have files in my profile directory dating back to 2008 (!!).  (Yes, I'm a very long-time user of Thunderbird and Firefox.) Maybe start deleting these one at a time in chronological order, oldest first?
