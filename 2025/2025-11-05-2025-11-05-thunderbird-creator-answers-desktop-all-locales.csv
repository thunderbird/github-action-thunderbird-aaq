When I tried adding my account login back to Thunderbird using “+ New Account”, it gives me an error message that my incoming server already exists. I'm trying to get my old saved login back without doing any more harm. I can still get into Thunderbird but it won't connect to the server (my login credentials now fail). I can still see and read my old emails but it won't retrieve any new emails. Is there a way to get my old login credentials back or re-enter them into Thunderbird?  If not, are there files and folders I can copy from my old saved Thunderbird Profile directory into my active Profile directory to be able to login to my account again while keeping my local folders?  I saved a lot of my email to my local folders, so I'm hesitant to overwrite my Mail folder (and even my ImapMail folder) for fear of losing my existing folders, especially my local folders. </p>",thunderbird;save-passwords;,thunderbird,save-passwords,en-US,1777115;,beach_boy_dave
