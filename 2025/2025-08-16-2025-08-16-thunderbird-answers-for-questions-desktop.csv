Sometimes, there are error messages that can assist in solving this. I suggest you investigate using one of the many free email mailing list organizations, such as Mailchip (or others), as these providers do a far better job than any email client can achieve. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

So if you save a .txt file, the next .txt will default to that folder. But if you then save a .jpg, it may jump to wherever you last saved a .jpg. </p><p>Save vs. Save All: When you use Save All Attachments, Thunderbird doesn’t look at the last folder per file type. It tends to fall back to the last-used folder from earlier in the session or, if none is “fresh,” to a folder it remembers from previous saves (sometimes higher in the path, which is why you see it jump up a level). </p><p>Session memory vs. history: Within a single Thunderbird session, it’s usually consistent. If you quit Thunderbird and come back, it sometimes resets or falls back to older remembered locations. </p><p>Because you’re mixing file types and using Save All, Thunderbird is bouncing between the “last folder used for this type” and “last folder used for bulk save.” That’s why sometimes you get exactly the folder you want, and other times it pops you into an older or higher-level folder. </p><p>What we can do to fix it: Set a default save location: In Thunderbird settings, under General → Files &amp; Attachments, you can set a default save folder. Then, instead of Thunderbird remembering per-type, it will always start in that folder unless you tell it to do otherwise </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0
