When Thunderbird synchronizes with Gmail, does it create local physical folders for each of the Gmail labels in use, or does it use the Gmail label scheme locally?  If a message in Gmail has two different labels attached to it, are there actually two copies of the message created locally in separate folders or not? </p>",thunderbird;tags;,thunderbird,tags,en-US,1785216;,wheintzelman
