The last message to come through normally was today (August 11) at 10:20 AM EST. Every other message today after that time came through as described in the subject of this post. </p><p>I am running Windows 10 Pro version 22H2 fully updated through the July 2025 updates. The Thunderbird version is 141.0 (64-bit). No new Thunderbird add-ons have been installed. </p><p>The columns for Subject and Correspondents are there, but they are blank for all my messages after 10:20 AM. The message body is like I said—it looks like I selected View|Message Source. I have both of my email accounts for Optimum and Gmail on Thunderbird. Optimum is POP and Gmail is IMAP. The Gmail message that I received a few minutes ago looks normal. The messages accessed on my Optimum webmail account look fine as well so it looks to me to be a Thunderbird issue. </p><p>I have tried the following: </p><p>1. Repaired the Inbox folder within Thunderbird. </p><p>2. Restarted Thunderbird in Safe Mode. </p><p>3. Exited Thunderbird, deleting the global-messages-db.sqlite file in my profile folder and restarting Thunderbird. </p><p>4. Exited Thunderbird, deleting the Inbox.msf file in my profile folder and restarting Thunderbird. </p><p>5. Reviewed all the Thunderbird settings—they looked OK. </p><p>6. Rebooted my computer. </p><p>7. Uninstalled Thunderbird via Control Panel|Programs and Features, then downloaded and installed the current version of Thunderbird from the official website. </p><p>I have uploaded a screenshot of what my Thunderbird screen currently looks like. </p><p>Thanks for any help. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1755733;,adlerkralle
