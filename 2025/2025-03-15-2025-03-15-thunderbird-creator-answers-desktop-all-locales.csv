I recently bought a new computer and tried to install Thunderbird on my new system. The installation went fine. The setup was one problem after another. Thunderbird required multiple attempts to connect with Outlook and sync my account. Next, I tried to import my contacts. Thunderbird failed numerous attempts to sync contacts. I finally had to manually import my contacts. Then spent an hour manually cleaning up my contacts. Thunderbird seems to have randomly assigned field names. (Names imported as numbers or dates) In addition, it imported contacts without associated data. (No email address, phone numbers etc.) After all that, Thunderbird would not allow me to use any of the contacts. The address book is there, the contacts are there, but it would not reference the address book when I tried to send an email. I had to go to the address book, copy the email and paste it into the to: field.  </p><p>Next, I tried to create events and tasks. First problem, all calendars were disabled by default and no option was offered to enable the calendars. I spent another 45 min. trying to find a setting or something to enable the calendars. When I finally got them enabled, I spent another hour trying to get Thunderbird to create events and tasks. Thunderbird will not create either. I spent far more time than is rational to create each event and task. When I completed each attempt, Thunderbird trashed them. No event or task was ever created. At this point I uninstalled Thunderbird and wrote it off as a bad idea. </p><p>Folks, I am not new to this. I have been using similar apps since their early days. I know how to install and setup these apps. I am very familiar with the problems that may be encountered. And this far worse than anything I have seen in a long time.
