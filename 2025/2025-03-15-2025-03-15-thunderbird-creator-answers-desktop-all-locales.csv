I have an IMAP account; at the beginning I've checked in ""Synchronization &amp; Storage"" the flag ""Keep messages in all folders for this account on this computer"". After a while, after I had received many emails, I've unchecked this; I was expecting the disk space occupied by the account to be released, but it didn't happen. I've also checked in the ""Advanced"" button, just below the flag ""Keep messages in all folders for this account on this computer"", that every single folder is NOT checked for offline use. </p><p>How can I recover my disk space without losing any email? </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1718332;,gplus4096
