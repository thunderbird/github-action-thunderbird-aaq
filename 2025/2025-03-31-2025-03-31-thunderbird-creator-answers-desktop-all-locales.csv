I have already imported all the necessary licenses, and all licenses are valid until 2034. I can receive and read all the encrypted messages they sent me, but every time I try to reply or send them (the same people) encrypted messages, the error pops up saying 'End-to-end encryption requires resolving certificate issues'. I already checked all the licenses but couldn't find any issues. Can you suggest some ways to resolve it?
