I sent them the scam urls and they were returned showing that they were scam urls. Since then I have been unable to send out any emails as the send button has disappeared.  I do not spam or scam people - I have been scammed and these companies are investigating the scammers and i was sending them the info they requested. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",avril3

For some months I have been experiencing a problem despite the fact I always use the latest version of TB regardless of which of my 2 wired keyboards I use and now since I've accepted an invitation to update to Version 139.0.2 (64 bit).  My problem is very inconsistent.  After I receive an email, I click on the REPLY function (towards top right of screen) and start typing my response which appears correctly above the text of the received email.  Suddenly as I continue to type, the following text starts appearing immediately below the text of the received email.  I believe it only happens after I press the lower case ""r"" key but certainly not every time I press that key.  Is this a bug and if not what action by me is causing the text to another of the email?  The letter""r"" always appears as the first letter of the transferred text. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tomtame185
