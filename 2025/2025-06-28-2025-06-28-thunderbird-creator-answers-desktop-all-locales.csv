I sent them the scam urls and they were returned showing that they were scam urls. Since then I have been unable to send out any emails as the send button has disappeared.  I do not spam or scam people - I have been scammed and these companies are investigating the scammers and i was sending them the info they requested. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1745382;,avril3

For some months I have been experiencing a problem despite the fact I always use the latest version of TB regardless of which of my 2 wired keyboards I use and now since I've accepted an invitation to update to Version 139.0.2 (64 bit).  My problem is very inconsistent.  After I receive an email, I click on the REPLY function (towards top right of screen) and start typing my response which appears correctly above the text of the received email.  Suddenly as I continue to type, the following text starts appearing immediately below the text of the received email.  I believe it only happens after I press the lower case ""r"" key but certainly not every time I press that key.  Is this a bug and if not what action by me is causing the text to another of the email?  The letter""r"" always appears as the first letter of the transferred text. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tomtame185

I have over 50 GB of email data accumulated over the years, and recently Thunderbird has started behaving erratically. </p><p>1. Thunderbird consuming unexplained disk space Thunderbird is using a significantly larger amount of disk space than my actual email data. For example: </p><pre>- Windows reports that the disk is using 65 GB, but when I check the contents of the Thunderbird folders, they only add up to 55 GB. </pre> <p>- There are no hidden or temporary files accounting for the difference. - The problem worsens when I compact or repair folders. Initially, the unaccounted disk space was about 5 GB, but after compacting, it jumped to 10 GB, then 15 GB, and eventually over 50 GB. </p><p>At that point, I backed up all Thunderbird data to an external drive and formatted the original drive. This restored full disk space (195 GB free). After copying the Thunderbird data back, everything seemed fine—until I launched Thunderbird again. Immediately, disk space began depleting rapidly with no visible cause. </p><p>I’m at a loss as to where Thunderbird is storing this data or why it's behaving this way. </p><p>2. Emails missing randomly Some emails are intermittently disappearing from folders. I have to frequently ""repair"" folders to make them reappear. This is happening every few hours now. Additionally, repairing or compacting these folders seems to correlate with the unexplained disk usage problem mentioned above. </p><p>Attached: Screenshot 1: Showing 124 GB free of 195 GB (i.e., ~71 GB used) Screenshot 2: Showing only 65 GB of disk space used based on folder contents (no hidden/temp files) </p><p>Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1745409;,raghavmalani

They were still there in my Ubuntu '.thunderbird' ImapMail directory. I have created some replacement mailboxes in 'Local Folders' and copied mbox files from the ImapMail area to the Local Folder area, removing the .msf files just created by Thunderbird. I then used the Properties-&gt;Repair Folder on each of the the new Local and filled-in-the-background mailboxes. Many worked fine and I was able to repopulate the IMAP server mailboxes using drag in Thunderbird. Some, however, were mis-parsed, producing 'From-less' and Subject-less messages containing part messages. Thunderbird seems unable to reliably parse mbox files created by itself. I note that they are not strict mbox format, having a '-' instead of an envelope address on the delimiting '^From ' line. (I am a retired Unix SysAdmin, so used to the command line) </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",david.ledger
