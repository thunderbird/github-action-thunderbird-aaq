Suddenly, Thunderbird stopped displaying some of my Local Folders.  I don't know what I did to cause it; I don't recall making any changes.  On investigating the issue, none of the other help I found in the forums or elsewhere on-line worked for me.   </p><p>While performing one of the instructions, I was trying to copy my Thunderbird profile mail folder to a different location before creating a new profile.  Copying the folder gave me an error of a file name being too long.  I moved the folder with the too-long file into a different subfolder with a shorter directory name.  Lo and behold, all of my folders, including the ones I moved, are now appearing in my Thunderbird Local Folders.  </p><p>I don't really need any help, but I wanted to post this solution since I didn't encounter it anywhere else. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",MisterKarlPrivate
