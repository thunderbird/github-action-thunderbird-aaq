There was no problem to solve there, it was working as expected, hence why no follow ups. </p><p>It isn't clear whether that's your case as well or not. Is it that Google keeps <i>repeatedly</i> asking you to authorise Thunderbird, even after you've completed the authorisation process? Or is it that you don't understand why it's doing so? Because if the latter, it could simply be that the OAuth token kept by Thunderbird to be able to connect to the server has expired and Google requires you to authorise Thunderbird again… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
