There was no problem to solve there, it was working as expected, hence why no follow ups. </p><p>It isn't clear whether that's your case as well or not. Is it that Google keeps <i>repeatedly</i> asking you to authorise Thunderbird, even after you've completed the authorisation process? Or is it that you don't understand why it's doing so? Because if the latter, it could simply be that the OAuth token kept by Thunderbird to be able to connect to the server has expired and Google requires you to authorise Thunderbird again… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Obviously anything on the server will be gone when the accounts are cancelled… </p><p>But you may avoid this problem entirely, regardless of the type of account, by creating custom folders under <b>Local Folders</b>, at the bottom of the list of accounts in the folder pane, to store and organise your mail locally on your computer there however you wish, independently of any account you may have. Mail stored there won't be affected by the accounts being cancelled or even by you removing the accounts from Thunderbird yourself. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Zmeňte si úložisko napr. na disk E:/EMAIL - Thunderbird - Nástroje - Nastavenie účtov - Úložisko správ - Lokálny priečinok a tu zmeňte priečinok napr. na E:/EMAIL hotovo a odteraz všetko z tohoto účtu sa bude ukladať na druhý disk do zvoleného priečinka (aj archívy) </p>,Ansamb,false,0,0
