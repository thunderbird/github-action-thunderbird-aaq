Both the compose window and the main TB window freeze. Only opening the Windows Task manager allows me to close them. This did not happen with earlier versions. </p><p>If I save the message every few seconds while composing I can get most of the message back and continue after restarting TB. This behavior is the same in both the normal and troubleshooting TB modes.

Email is: vk4cmr@gmail.com Mark Chad Chatfield That was about 2.5 weeks ago. Tried almost everyday to work this out, Zilch. The email address in fault, is on 3 computers. 2 are still operational, But my Main Use computer will NOT go past the required credential check. Have deleted all reference to that email address and tried reinstalling back into Thunderbird, to NO avail. It still works on the sub-computer systems. I cannot find any relevant help files on yr Knowledge Base remotely connected to this problem. Please advise TIA.
