Both the compose window and the main TB window freeze. Only opening the Windows Task manager allows me to close them. This did not happen with earlier versions. </p><p>If I save the message every few seconds while composing I can get most of the message back and continue after restarting TB. This behavior is the same in both the normal and troubleshooting TB modes.
