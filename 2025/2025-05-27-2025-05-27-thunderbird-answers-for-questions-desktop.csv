Please note we are talking about 'Thunderbird' email client not 'Firefox' browser. Firefox 'View' does not have 'Sort by' nor 'Layout'.

If you use/enabled the 'Menu Bar' toolbar then 'View' has 'Sort by' options - actually this option has been around for decades in the same location.

As a general rule we do not offer support for things to do with the google/gmail webmail account unless it is directly related to connectivity with a gmail mail account set up in Thunderbird.  But on this occasion I made an exception. Here is some info that might be useful to you. If viewing emails in the gmail webmail using a browser... At the top of list on the right side you should see something like this '251-255 of 255' - although you might see different numbers.  Hover mouse cursor over that number and you will see eg: Newest appear in a drop down menu - click on 'Newest' and it auto resets the view to show newest email on the top and the number will change to eg: '1-50 of 255' </p><p>Click on the gear icon for Settings and then select 'Show all settings' On the 'General' tab you can choose how many 'conversations' to show - I set mine to 50 as it is a convenient size for number of emails in list per page.
