As I said, maybe enough time spent. I can manage as is. Your effort is appreciated. </blockquote> <p>I notice you said ""I am on a Mac with Firefox/Google email."" Please note we are talking about 'Thunderbird' email client not 'Firefox' browser. Firefox 'View' does not have 'Sort by' nor 'Layout'.  If you are using gmail webmail account via the Firefox browser then you are not using Thunderbird, so it's not going to be of any use asking about a gmail webmail account in a Thunderbird Support Forum. </p><p>If you are talking about Thunderbird then: What version of Thunderbird are you using? This might effect where things are located. If you are using a very old version eg: 91* then 'Quick Filter' used to be on the 'Mail Toolbar'  </p><p>Current versions have the following. If you use/enabled the 'Menu Bar' toolbar then 'View' has 'Sort by' options - actually this option has been around for decades in the same location. Nothing has changed. </p><p>Recent versions now also include the 'Message List Header' If you use the 'Menu Bar' toolbar then 'View' has 'Layout' &gt; 'Message List Header'. If you use the 'Menu app icon (3 lines)' then 'View' has 'Layout' &gt; 'Message List Header'. </p><p>'Quick Filter' button is on the 'Message List header'. </p><p>You can also put 'Quick Filter' on the top 'Unified Toolbar' using 'Customise'. </p><p>Or you can use the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+Shit+K' - I believe MAC uses 'command' key instead of 'Ctrl'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
