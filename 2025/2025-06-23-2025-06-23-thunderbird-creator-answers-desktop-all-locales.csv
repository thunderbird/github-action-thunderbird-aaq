Ogni volta che devo installare Thunderbird su un nuovo PC o faccio una modifica nella rubrica, devo aggiornare ogni PC singolarmente. La domanda è&nbsp;: è possibile avere un solo profilo Thunderbird sul cloud per tutti i PC e che permetta di avere tutte le informazioni (accounts, mails, rubrica, componenti aggiuntivi, ecc.) automaticamente aggiornate su tutti i PC?

I like the way thunderbird can show its tasks on calendar view, it's great, but it would be perfect if i could sync such tasks to online calendar.
