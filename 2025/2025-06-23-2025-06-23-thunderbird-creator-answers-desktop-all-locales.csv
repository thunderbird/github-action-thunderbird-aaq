A month or so ago I switched from 128 esr to 139 release, and since then I have had constant messaging several times a day that folders could nor be compacted. I've verified everything, but the message still happens with annoying regularity. I saw on Reddit that this may be a known bug, but thought I would report it to the forum anyway.

Ogni volta che devo installare Thunderbird su un nuovo PC o faccio una modifica nella rubrica, devo aggiornare ogni PC singolarmente. La domanda è&nbsp;: è possibile avere un solo profilo Thunderbird sul cloud per tutti i PC e che permetta di avere tutte le informazioni (accounts, mails, rubrica, componenti aggiuntivi, ecc.) automaticamente aggiornate su tutti i PC?

Maybe some online one?,"<p>I wonder if there is a way to make Tasks in some online calendar to allow syncing? I like the way thunderbird can show its tasks on calendar view, it's great, but it would be perfect if i could sync such tasks to online calendar.  I know that probably there were providers for google/outlook (not updated to 139 yet), but I am a bit afraid of them because of full access permissions.  </p><p>thanks a lot in advance!
