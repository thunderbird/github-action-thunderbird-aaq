You significantly increase the risk of potential major loss etc if you keep a lot of emails in just a single text file.  </p><p>The 'Open message in conversation' applies to any email no matter what folder it's stored in. </p><p>This is a rather a good way of viewing a particular conversation as it removes all the clutter of other threads and you can leave it open in case you need to go back and refer to it. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

You are in Windows File Explorer inside the profile.  - at this point, exit thunderbird - back up one folder so that you are in the Profiles folder. One of the folders in that folder is your copied profile. Since you know the name of the copied profile, you can proceed with some simple file copies. Here are steps:  - click to the imported profile  - for local folders, open the Mail folder and then the Local Folders folder. All the foldes will appear as foldername, foldername.msf. Ignore the msf entries as those are indexes that will be automatically recreated. Copy the files to the active profile into the same location - Mail\Local Folders  - copying POP accounts are a bit more involved, so I'll wait to hear whether you have any.   </p><p>IF you did NOT find thunderbird.exe in a folder in c:\program files, then we need to start there.

Both need to be IMAP. You can do some detective work by logging on to your online account and send messages to yourself. Then, shut thunderbird off. Now, send a message to yourself and check if it's received on phone and whether it still shows online. If not, the phone appears to be POP and changing that will fix the issue. If the messages are still there, start thunderbird and see if it retrieves messages (although you can readily check that by clicking settings&gt;account settings. Anyway, doing steps like that should help you resolve the disparity in setups. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
