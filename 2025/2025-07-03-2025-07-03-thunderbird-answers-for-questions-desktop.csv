You are in Windows File Explorer inside the profile.  - at this point, exit thunderbird - back up one folder so that you are in the Profiles folder. One of the folders in that folder is your copied profile. Since you know the name of the copied profile, you can proceed with some simple file copies. Here are steps:  - click to the imported profile  - for local folders, open the Mail folder and then the Local Folders folder. All the foldes will appear as foldername, foldername.msf. Ignore the msf entries as those are indexes that will be automatically recreated. Copy the files to the active profile into the same location - Mail\Local Folders  - copying POP accounts are a bit more involved, so I'll wait to hear whether you have any.   </p><p>IF you did NOT find thunderbird.exe in a folder in c:\program files, then we need to start there.
