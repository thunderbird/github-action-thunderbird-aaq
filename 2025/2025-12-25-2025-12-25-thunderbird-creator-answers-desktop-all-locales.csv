It seems Thunderbird does not include avatars when I export the whole contacts book as a *.vcf file. Please, be so kind as to add this feature, preferably pictures larger than 96x96 px. Or maybe I missed this magic checkbox somewhere? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;contacts;,thunderbird,contacts,en-US,1788922;,Esp-nn

Context: Windows 11, TB 146.0.1. In TB, 5 mail accounts are configured, all IMAP, on 4 different providers.  </p><p>All accounts work perfectly except the first one, which is also the default account. This account and the second account are both on my father's Internet provider. The configurations of both accounts seem identical (I checked more than once), except obviously for the name and password. On the first account (which is unfortunately the one my father uses most), connexion is often refused, and TB then asks to retry or enter a new password. Retry and reentering the password fail to solve the issue. When the connection to the first account fails, the second account (for the same provider) always works. Some time later (usually at least several days later), the first account will work again, without any obvious reason.  </p><p>I tried exiting TB as well as clearing the cache, rebooting the computer, scanning for viruses, with no result. </p><p>I'd rather avoid re-creating the account in TB as this would change the order of the accounts, and my father (94 years old) might have difficulties to adapt to the change, but is someone can tell me how to recreate the account without changing the order, I am ready to try it. </p><p>I have a log of what happens when using only the ""bad"" account, and one for the good account from the same provider, but I don't know how to share them here. While creating the logs, I checked that if I set the second account as default (the first account having the issue before as well as after this), it still manages to connect. But of course, maybe the second account would have also had a connection issue later...  </p><p>Does someone have any explanation, or ideas about how to solve this issue? </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,1788937;1788947;,davito9w
