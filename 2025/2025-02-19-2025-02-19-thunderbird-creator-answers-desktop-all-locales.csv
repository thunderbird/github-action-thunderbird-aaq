I forget where it was exactly but it was no more than 3rd from the top, possibly under ""Inbox"".  Today it somehow disappeared.  So I've re-created the search folder, but now it's in alphabetical position, which puts it near the bottom.  I know I can rename it with something like ""aaa"" to move it up, but is there another way?  I tried marking it as a Favorite, but the Favorite Folder pane just appears at the bottom - so no help.  I'm using v. 128.7.1 esr 64 bit. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",henbor29
