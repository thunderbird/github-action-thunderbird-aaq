LOVE it&nbsp;!!!  I used to have 2 email accounts underneath Thunderbird: TWC mail and Gmail.  Every account worked great sending/receiving up until Feb 12.  Then my TWC mail stopped replicating.  Gmail account still works.  Called TWC and was informed that I had to update my Master Password for my Spectrum Account.  Worked with Tech Support to get me all re-established.  Went into Thunderbird and still couldn't replicate.  Found an answer dated 1/26/25 by teknikal at 10:44 on this Forum which sounded like exactly my problem.  Called Spectrum every day trying to find the Server Engineer who could help me reset my password to no avail.  Then i investigated updating my new password in the saved password of the account setting.  There was only a saved password for TWC  for SMTP which I updated and was able to successfully send and email from TWC to Gmail under Thunderbird.  But I still can not receive emails and there is NO saved password for IMAP.  So I did further reading and found my only alternative was to delete TWC from Thunderbird and re-add the account.  Which I tried to do.  But the configuration that replicated was <a href=""http://mobile.charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mobile.charter.net</a> which I manually changed to <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> but Thunderbird keeps telling me it can't find the server.  I just got off the phone with Spectrum and my config is accurate: smtp  <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>   587   starttls   normal password  chrismcm@twcny.rr.com imap  <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>  993   starttls  normal password chrismcm@twcny.rr.com Why isn't Thunderbird configuring my mail server so that I can send and receive emails&nbsp;???
