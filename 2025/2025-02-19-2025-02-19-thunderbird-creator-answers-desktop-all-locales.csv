I forget where it was exactly but it was no more than 3rd from the top, possibly under ""Inbox"".  Today it somehow disappeared.  So I've re-created the search folder, but now it's in alphabetical position, which puts it near the bottom.  I know I can rename it with something like ""aaa"" to move it up, but is there another way?  I tried marking it as a Favorite, but the Favorite Folder pane just appears at the bottom - so no help.  I'm using v. 128.7.1 esr 64 bit. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",henbor29

I used to have 2 email accounts underneath Thunderbird: TWC mail and Gmail.  Every account worked great sending/receiving up until Feb 12.  Then my TWC mail stopped replicating.  Gmail account still works.  Called TWC and was informed that I had to update my Master Password for my Spectrum Account.  Worked with Tech Support to get me all re-established.  Went into Thunderbird and still couldn't replicate.  Found an answer dated 1/26/25 by teknikal at 10:44 on this Forum which sounded like exactly my problem.  Called Spectrum every day trying to find the Server Engineer who could help me reset my password to no avail.  Then i investigated updating my new password in the saved password of the account setting.  There was only a saved password for TWC  for SMTP which I updated and was able to successfully send and email from TWC to Gmail under Thunderbird.  But I still can not receive emails and there is NO saved password for IMAP.  So I did further reading and found my only alternative was to delete TWC from Thunderbird and re-add the account.  Which I tried to do.  But the configuration that replicated was <a href=""http://mobile.charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mobile.charter.net</a> which I manually changed to <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> but Thunderbird keeps telling me it can't find the server.  I just got off the phone with Spectrum and my config is accurate: smtp  <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>   587   starttls   normal password  chrismcm@twcny.rr.com imap  <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>  993   starttls  normal password chrismcm@twcny.rr.com Why isn't Thunderbird configuring my mail server so that I can send and receive emails&nbsp;???  And now have I lost all my mail and folders since I deleted my account only to re-add it&nbsp;???  I'm ready for the looney bin because I have been at this for DAYS&nbsp;!!!  Please HELP&nbsp;!!!

I have gotten fed up with Kmail in KDE for Linux, it is basically useless since it does not allow any of the modern login protocols required by MS and Google. </p><p>One thing Kmail did do, was start in the background so it was always periodically checking for mail and indicating new messages in the icon and notification in the desktop toolbar.  So you didn't have to have it running in the foreground as a running application. </p><p>How can you do that with Thunderbird?

I’ve been using Thunderbird for years with no problems. A few weeks ago, I started getting a Not Responding notice when checking mail. I have a number of accounts to check. The Not Responding notice would disappear after a few seconds and the mail checking continued. Along with this issue, several of my folders would disappear only to reappear after Thunderbird was closed and then restarted. Today, all of the folders in one of my accounts disappeared and never reappeared. That account had 15-20 folders. I may have lost important correspondence. Does anyone know what’s going on and how to fix it? </p><p>Thanks for any assistance. </p><p>Jason </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",tigerstime
