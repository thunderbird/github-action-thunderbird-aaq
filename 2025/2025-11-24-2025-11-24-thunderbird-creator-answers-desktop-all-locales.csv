I recently had a problem with my server at Spectrum in that I could not receive emails as a POP3 account. I backed up my profile and contacted Spectrim, knowing I would have to do some tweaking on the configuration because that’s what they ask you to do.  After many calls and nearly 3 weeks, they decided that if I wanted email, I would have to switch to IMAP protocol even though I have used Thunderbird as a POP3 client for more than 5 years.  After more requested configuration tweaks, I decided to uninstall the mangled version of Thunderbird, download the latest version, install it as an IMAP protocol client.  It is now working as IMAP, but now I need to bring over my address book and messages from the POP profile, which I am now finding a bit awkward.  I don’t want to do an import from the saved profile, as there are differences in configuration and I don’t want to just bring over everything, but really all I want is the address book and my messages.  I have figured out the address book and done that, but I’m concerned about the messages.  If I import from the saved (POP) profile, can I just import the appropriate folders from the MAIL file only&nbsp;?</strong> </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",buckeyejim3

The notification at the lower right showed 300 more had 'downloaded' before I shut off the internet, went into Safe Mode, ran a virus check to find no threats found.  No SPAM was recorded in Thunderbird when I went back online.  There were, however, several files with large attachments so I don't know if this is a glitch regarding data vs. actual number emails because when I checked for updates (see attachment) I discovered that since Version 115.4.2   I HAVE NEVER BEEN NOTIFIED OF UPDATES OR *FAILURE* TO UPDATE.   AUTOMATIC UPDATES have been turned off and will remain turned off due to nearly dialup speed lack of bandwidth.  I will abandon Thunderbird for having a fatal programming defect before turning on automatic updates.  My actual email provider did not show 8205 additional emails so I am concerned about a possible malware backdoor.  Today 15 emails downloaded while the little notice at lower right said it was trying to download 113 ghost emails.  I shut off Thunderbird and came here to post the problem.  I will update Thunderbird, but need to know if there is a temporary file cache or some other hideyhole that the ghosts (or some attacker) might be storing godnosewhat so that I can either quarantine or delete them? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",artrules

The old PC is running Windows 10 and I have updated the Thunderbird version prior to attempted transfer. The new PC is running Windows 11. I have followed all the online instructions regarding moving profiles from one PC to another. He has two email addresses in Thunderbird, one being gmail. He has also created a number of folders into which he has neatly saved incoming emails. Each time I copy the existing profile (over 10gb) and transfer this to the new PC as per instructions, there are missing folders which don't appear to have been transferred successfully. All his emails appear to be there as well as his address book but there are several missing folders containing important emails. His created folders are in alphabetical order but the only ones transferred successfully are the ones beginning A to C. All the rest of his folders D onwards have not appeared. I'm finding this very frustrating and would appreciate any help and support. I'm not too tech savvy but can usually overcome issues like this. Should I try the export/import route to transfer all his emails and folders to the new PC or is there something else ""profile related"" that I could try. Thankyou very much. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",johnnief
