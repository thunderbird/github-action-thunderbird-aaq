I recently had a problem with my server at Spectrum in that I could not receive emails as a POP3 account. I backed up my profile and contacted Spectrim, knowing I would have to do some tweaking on the configuration because that’s what they ask you to do.  After many calls and nearly 3 weeks, they decided that if I wanted email, I would have to switch to IMAP protocol even though I have used Thunderbird as a POP3 client for more than 5 years.  After more requested configuration tweaks, I decided to uninstall the mangled version of Thunderbird, download the latest version, install it as an IMAP protocol client.  It is now working as IMAP, but now I need to bring over my address book and messages from the POP profile, which I am now finding a bit awkward.  I don’t want to do an import from the saved profile, as there are differences in configuration and I don’t want to just bring over everything, but really all I want is the address book and my messages.  I have figured out the address book and done that, but I’m concerned about the messages.  If I import from the saved (POP) profile, can I just import the appropriate folders from the MAIL file only&nbsp;?</strong> </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",buckeyejim3

The Thunderbird dialog then appears to make some progress, as the windows seems to ""flash"" as if it's being cleared, but the email content doesn't appear.  After about another 20-30 seconds, the encrypted email contents appear, correctly decrypted. </p><p>This long delay only occurs when I click on encrypted email messages, and it happens every time I click on an encrypted email message, and this behavior only started occurring in the past couple of days (correlated, I believe with Thunderbird updating to v145) so I think it's safe to assume the issue is with end-to-end encryption/decryption in Thunderbird v145. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",bpkasper

Normally it downloads all the messages (300-500 daily) and then deletes them from the server, as expected. However, during the last few months I have experienced 3 issues. In all, TB starts the downloading, than pauses at some point (like ""Downloading 189 of 291"") then ends the downloading process. At that point I have some of the downloaded messages in my Inbox, and ALL of the messages are at the server too. If I restart the downloading again, I end up with duplicate messages in my Inbox, and all the messages still at the server. </p><p>I, than, have to identify which messages have been downloaded, delete them from the server manually (with IMAP client) and start the downloading process on TB again, and this goes on until all messages are downloaded. </p><p>Any suggestions&nbsp;?
