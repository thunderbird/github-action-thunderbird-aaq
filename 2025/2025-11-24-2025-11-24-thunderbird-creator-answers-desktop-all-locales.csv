I recently had a problem with my server at Spectrum in that I could not receive emails as a POP3 account. I backed up my profile and contacted Spectrim, knowing I would have to do some tweaking on the configuration because that’s what they ask you to do.  After many calls and nearly 3 weeks, they decided that if I wanted email, I would have to switch to IMAP protocol even though I have used Thunderbird as a POP3 client for more than 5 years.  After more requested configuration tweaks, I decided to uninstall the mangled version of Thunderbird, download the latest version, install it as an IMAP protocol client.  It is now working as IMAP, but now I need to bring over my address book and messages from the POP profile, which I am now finding a bit awkward.  I don’t want to do an import from the saved profile, as there are differences in configuration and I don’t want to just bring over everything, but really all I want is the address book and my messages.  I have figured out the address book and done that, but I’m concerned about the messages.  If I import from the saved (POP) profile, can I just import the appropriate folders from the MAIL file only&nbsp;?</strong> </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",buckeyejim3
