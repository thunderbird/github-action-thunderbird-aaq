I recently had a problem with my server at Spectrum in that I could not receive emails as a POP3 account. I backed up my profile and contacted Spectrim, knowing I would have to do some tweaking on the configuration because that’s what they ask you to do.  After many calls and nearly 3 weeks, they decided that if I wanted email, I would have to switch to IMAP protocol even though I have used Thunderbird as a POP3 client for more than 5 years.  After more requested configuration tweaks, I decided to uninstall the mangled version of Thunderbird, download the latest version, install it as an IMAP protocol client.  It is now working as IMAP, but now I need to bring over my address book and messages from the POP profile, which I am now finding a bit awkward.  I don’t want to do an import from the saved profile, as there are differences in configuration and I don’t want to just bring over everything, but really all I want is the address book and my messages.  I have figured out the address book and done that, but I’m concerned about the messages.  If I import from the saved (POP) profile, can I just import the appropriate folders from the MAIL file only&nbsp;?</strong> </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",buckeyejim3

After about another 20-30 seconds, the encrypted email contents appear, correctly decrypted. </p><p>This long delay only occurs when I click on encrypted email messages, and it happens every time I click on an encrypted email message, and this behavior only started occurring in the past couple of days (correlated, I believe with Thunderbird updating to v145) so I think it's safe to assume the issue is with end-to-end encryption/decryption in Thunderbird v145. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",bpkasper

I have a new iMac desktop OE Tahoe version 26.1    I tried to figure out how to use my thunderbird program to be just like the one in my older iMac version Tahoe 26.1.  I found info in your forum.  When I followed the info it was as simple as never before…which kind of concerned me.  In the instructions for setting up thunderbird into the new iMac, it said to log into my acct using my email address.  That worked &amp; it asked if I wanted to open a new acct or the existing one.  I used the existing one &amp; it walked me through the pop &amp; stmp setup.  When it opened up, all the existing emails were on the new iMac.  Super easy.  But now I don’t know how to make thunderbird in the new iMac to look like the old one with large font like in thunderbird 140.4 version.  Can you help me with step by step info?   2.	In using thunderbird on the new iMac, will the emails still be accessible in the old iMac? Am I making sense or do you need something else from me?
