Probeer uw antivirus tijdelijk uit te schakelen om te zien of dit de prestaties verbetert. </li><li><strong>Verminder mapgrootte:</strong> grote mappen kunnen Thunderbird vertragen. Archiveer oude e-mailberichten en houd uw Postvak IN en andere mappen zo klein mogelijk. </li><li><strong>Bouw de globale database opnieuw op:</strong> het herbouwen van de globale database kan helpen als het probleem te maken heeft met beschadigde databasebestanden. Om dit te doen, zoek en verwijder het bestand ‘global-messages-db.sqlite’ in uw Thunderbird-profiel. </li><li><strong>Controleer achtergrondprocessen:</strong> zorg ervoor dat er geen andere zware processen op de achtergrond draaien die de prestaties van Thunderbird kunnen beïnvloeden. </li><li><strong>Optimaliseer systeemprestaties:</strong> algemeen systeemonderhoud, zoals het bijwerken van uw besturingssysteem, het vrijmaken van schijfruimte en het vergroten van het RAM-geheugen, kan ook helpen om de prestaties van Thunderbird te verbeteren. </li></ol> <p>Laat het ons weten als u verdere hulp nodig hebt! </p>",markh2,false,1,0

In your case, you say emails are downloaded and should be set to delete off server.  In Account Settings &gt; Server Settings for pop account, I'm presuming you have NOT selected this option: 'Leave messages on server' - it is unchecked. </p><p>Please log onto webmail account via a browser to see if emails really have been deleted off the server. Let me know what you discover.  </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I didn't realize that Thunderbird retained ""hidden"" deleted or moved emails...  </em> This has always been the case and it's really useful because it also means there is a way to recover emails providing you have not compacted the Inbox. That can be important if you do not have a backup or cannot force a new download off the server. However, compacting is very important. </p><p>Here's a link all about 'compacting' which is not the same as 'compressing'. </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders</a> </li></ul> <p>In pop accounts the emails are stored in mbox files. These files take the same name as the folder eg: 'Inbox' and they have no extension. Thunderbird also has an index file which has same name as folder but it has the extension .msf eg: Inbox.msf </p><p>Thunderbird uses the Index.msf file to display the basic header info in the Message List and when you select to read an email, it maps the index with the appropriate email in the mbox file to display contents. </p><p>When you repair a folder it should be just repairing the index file by checking what is in the mbox file. So, you would expect it to not be replicating emails that have been marked as deleted. But in your case, it seems to be able to reselect and replicate. Possibly due to a corrupted Inbox since you have not been compacting it. </p><p>Suggest you do this: </p> <ol><li> If you have any emails in the 'Inbox' folder that you want to keep please move them all into a suitable folder. </li><li> Then select/highlight all the remaining unwanted emails so you get the Message Pane saying X number of conversations and it offers 'Archive' and 'Delete' </li><li> Click on 'Delete' </li><li> Wait a few moments to ensure this has all occured as you have a lot of emails. </li><li> Finally, right click on 'Inbox' folder in Folder Pane and select 'Compact' </li></ol> <p>It is important not to exit Thunderbird whilst compacting is occuring and I would also advise do not use the Inbox to read emails etc. Compacting does not take very long, usually a few seconds. This should completely remove all traces of all 'moved' and 'deleted' emails from the 'Inbox' mbox file and also from the 'Inbox' index file. Leaving you with nice clean uncorrupted files. </p><p>Personally, I manually compact the folders which get the most 'moving' and 'deleteing' at the end of each day before I exit Thunderbird. Those folders are 'Inbox', 'Drafts' and 'Junk'. It can be set up to auto compact&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> 'Settings' &gt; 'General'  </li><li> Scroll down to 'Network &amp; Disk Space' </li><li> Select checkbox&nbsp;: 'compact all folders when it will save over' and set 10 MB  </li></ul> <p>You can increase it later if required, but best not to go too large. Advise you also select 'Ask every time before compacting' then it gives you the chance to a) know compacting is occuring so you can pause what you are doing or not exit by accident. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

It turned out to be as simple as having to shring my content panel to show the list.  I didn't increase it so I haven't a clue how it got to be where it only shows the top, most recent email.   </p><p>I discovered that accidently when I deleted one, and another one popped up.  Deleted that, and so on.  That's when the clue that the window pane had expanded.  </p><p>oh duh....    Hey, I'm an old broad so I guess this is to be expected some times. </p><p>But to answer your questions.  POP, not IMAP.  Four different email accounts with an average of 5-610 folders in each one.  Obviously it was affecting views for all. </p><p>But thank you for pointing out backing up the profile.   I'll have to search on how to do that.  Or is this just a matters of storaging either in the Cloud or a portable drive, like other data. </p><p>And thank you so much.  STILL embarrassed. </p>",Terrif1,false,0,0
