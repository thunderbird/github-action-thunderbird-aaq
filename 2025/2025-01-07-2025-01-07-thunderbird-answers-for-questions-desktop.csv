Als de prestaties verbeteren, kan het probleem te maken hebben met add-ons of thema’s.

Probeer uw antivirus tijdelijk uit te schakelen om te zien of dit de prestaties verbetert. </li><li><strong>Verminder mapgrootte:</strong> grote mappen kunnen Thunderbird vertragen. Archiveer oude e-mailberichten en houd uw Postvak IN en andere mappen zo klein mogelijk. </li><li><strong>Bouw de globale database opnieuw op:</strong> het herbouwen van de globale database kan helpen als het probleem te maken heeft met beschadigde databasebestanden. Om dit te doen, zoek en verwijder het bestand ‘global-messages-db.sqlite’ in uw Thunderbird-profiel. </li><li><strong>Controleer achtergrondprocessen:</strong> zorg ervoor dat er geen andere zware processen op de achtergrond draaien die de prestaties van Thunderbird kunnen beïnvloeden. </li><li><strong>Optimaliseer systeemprestaties:</strong> algemeen systeemonderhoud, zoals het bijwerken van uw besturingssysteem, het vrijmaken van schijfruimte en het vergroten van het RAM-geheugen, kan ook helpen om de prestaties van Thunderbird te verbeteren. </li></ol> <p>Laat het ons weten als u verdere hulp nodig hebt! </p>",markh2,false,1,0
