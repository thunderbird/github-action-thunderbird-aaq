Tukaj je nekaj predlogov ki jih lahko poskusite: </p><pre>1. Namestitev združljive različice Quicktexta (v6.3.5) </pre> <p>Quicktext v starejših različicah ni združljiv z Thunderbirdom 140.0, vendar je na voljo posodobljena različica 6.3.5, ki deluje s to različico. Sledite tem korakom: </p><p>- **Prenesite Quicktext v6.3.5**: </p><pre> - Obiščite stran na GitHub-u: <a href=""https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext/releases/tag/v6.3.5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext.../v6.3.5</a>(<a href=""https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext/releases/tag/v6.3.5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext/releases/tag/v6.3.5</a>).  - Kliknite na povezavo za prenos datoteke `quicktext_6_3_5.xpi`.  - Shranite datoteko na vaš računalnik. </pre> <p>- Namestitev v Thunderbird: </p><pre> - Odprite Thunderbird.  - Pojdite v Orodja &gt;Dodatki in teme (ali kliknite na ikono menija v zgornjem desnem kotu in izberite »Dodatki in teme«).  - Kliknite na ikono zobnika zgoraj desno in izberite Namesti dodatek iz datoteke.  - Poiščite preneseno datoteko `quicktext_6_3_5.xpi` in jo izberite.  - Thunderbird bo namestil dodatek. Po namestitvi ga omogočite, če je potrebno. </pre> <pre>2. Dostop do starih predlog </pre> <p>Po namestitvi Quicktext v6.3.5 se lahko zgodi, da stare predloge niso takoj vidne, saj se je spremenil način shranjevanja podatkov. Predloge so običajno shranjene v datoteki `templates.xml` v mapi profila Thunderbird, vendar novejše različice Quicktexta morda shranjujejo podatke drugje (npr. v JSON formatu ali drugem imeniku). </p><p>- Preverite lokacijo stare datoteke templates.xml: </p><pre> - Odprite mapo profila Thunderbird:    - V Thunderbirdu pojdite v Pomoč &gt; Informacije za odpravljanje težav.    - Poiščite vnos »Mapa profila« in kliknite »Odpri mapo«.    - V mapi profila poiščite podmapo `quicktext` ali datoteko `templates.xml`.  - Če najdete `templates.xml`, naredite varnostno kopijo te datoteke. </pre> <p>- Težava z novimi predlogami: </p><pre> - Kot je navedeno na forumu Mozilla Support, Quicktext v6.3.5 morda ne prebere stare datoteke templates.xml, saj shranjuje nove predloge drugje.[](<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1521896"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1521896</a>)  - Preverite, ali so nove predloge shranjene v drugi datoteki ali formatu (npr. JSON). To lahko preverite v nastavitvah Quicktexta ali v mapi profila. </pre> <p>- Rešitev za obnovitev predlog: </p><pre> -Ročno uvozite predloge: Če Quicktext ne prepozna stare datoteke `templates.xml`, boste morda morali ročno prepisati predloge v nov vmesnik Quicktexta. Odprite `templates.xml` z urejevalnikom besedil (npr. Notepad) in kopirajte vsebino predlog v novo predlogo v Quicktextu:    - V Thunderbirdu odprite nastavitve Quicktexta (v »Dodatki in teme« kliknite na Quicktext &gt; Možnosti).    - Ustvarite nove predloge in prilepite besedilo iz `templates.xml`.   - Preverite GitHub za specifične rešitve: Na strani projekta Quicktext je omenjen problem s prepoznavanjem starih predlog (glejte issue #481). Morda obstaja skripta ali navodila za pretvorbo stare datoteke v nov format. Preverite: [<a href=""https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext/issues/481"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext.../481</a>(<a href=""https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext/issues/481).[](https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1521896]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jobisoft/quicktext/issues/481).[](https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1521896]</a>) </pre> <p>Upam da vam bo uspelo rešiti težavo! </p><p>Vexi </p>",Vexi,false,1,0

If there is any corruption during the  process, that should show it.   </p><p>Another option is to use the importexporttools NG addon. With that, you could do this:  - highlight Local Folders - rightclick and select the importexport option to import mbox - then, select one of the message folders in exported profile and select OK.

You antivirus gets an update in many cased every 10 minutes from a home server.  There is a very high possibility that it has changed. </p><p>2. Your mail provider may have changed the sign in requirements for the server.  Something like they have updated the security settings to something Windows 7 does not support perhaps. </p><p>Historically I have seen POP mail account report no mail when the antivirus has dropped it's load and just gone offline.  The same could be true of IMAP accounts,  I just have not seen it. </p><p>Microsoft regularly update the requirement to connect to outlook/hotmail/msn/live accounts.

So I mentioned a couple of well known issues.  But installing a 64bit version of the software is not going to be of much help to you is my guess.  Just like reinstalling is rarely a method to do anything be waste time. Look for the real issue and in this instance I would be inclined to be looking at the antivirus.  The longer an operating system is out of support the more antivirus programs attempt to compensate for unpatched vulnerabilities.  The net result is usually a loss of connectivity and access to non browsing functions and sometimes even those. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Second, I wonder if what you're experiencing is an update. Sometimes, Thunderbird creates a new profile and that profile may be empty. That does not mean you lost your mail. For a sanity check, I suggest logging on to your online account where you should see the messages are safely there. So, if a new profile was created, you might try reactivating it. Try these steps and let me know:  </p> <ol><li> click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation </li><li> scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles'  </li><li> you should now see a list of current profiles, showing which is the active one. If there is an older one, you could try launching it. I also suggest writing down the name of the alternate profile for possible future investigation.  </li></ol> <p>If that restarts thunderbird, all is well. If not, you still aren't lost. You have the name of the prior profile.  Try this for further checking </p> <ol><li> click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation again </li><li> scroll down to 'profile' and click 'open folder'  </li><li> you are now in the profile in windows file explorer, click the back button once to get to the 'profiles' folder </li><li> now click to the alternate profile folder </li><li> you had a POP account. click the Mail folder and then the 'POP account folder' - you should see the 'lost' message folders there. Now that you've identified them, you can at least salvage them if necessary by copying the folders and pasting in a new thunderbird profile in the Mail\Local Folders folder.  </li></ol> <p>I'll stop for now so you can investigate.

Lacking that, it's pure conjecture. For example, you responded earlier about seeing some POP and IMAP info on a prior profile, but that it didn't tell you much. But often, it is such data that lets volunteers here assist users in locating their messages. Thunderbird does not lose messages, but it sometimes replaces a good profile with a fresh one, forcing the user to recapture the data from the prior profile. So, there is a possibility that your data are there. But we don't know because we have seen nothing. Also, please remember that Thunderbird is offered free and the support so readily offered here is also free. If you truly want assistance, I encourage you to actively participate. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
