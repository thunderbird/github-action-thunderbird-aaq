But when I opened this profile, I found problems with messages: they had no content. Later, when I transferred a profile from the first device with new messages that were not there, they also broke (their content also disappeared). The transfer was done manually from version 140 to 115. DeepSeek writes that this may be due to significant changes in the data storage structure, but when transferring these messages to another device with version 140, the same problem occurs.

On that:  - install thunderbird with a default profile. click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open folder'  - now exit thunderbird. you are in the profile itself  - from the unzipped profile, your addressbook is abook.sqlite and history.sqlite. Copy both of those to the root folder of the new profile - from Mail\Local Folders, copy all to Mail\Local Folders in new profile - IMAP will automatically repopulate so no worry - if POP accounts, now restart thunderbird, set to OFFLINE, and set up the POP account. do NOT retrieve messages. now exit thunderbird and copy the Mail\&lt;POP account&gt; folder to the Mail\&lt;POP account&gt; folder in new profile.
