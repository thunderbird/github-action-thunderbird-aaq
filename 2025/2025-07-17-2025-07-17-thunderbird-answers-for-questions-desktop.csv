Second, I wonder if what you're experiencing is an update. Sometimes, Thunderbird creates a new profile and that profile may be empty. That does not mean you lost your mail. For a sanity check, I suggest logging on to your online account where you should see the messages are safely there. So, if a new profile was created, you might try reactivating it. Try these steps and let me know:  </p> <ol><li> click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation </li><li> scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles'  </li><li> you should now see a list of current profiles, showing which is the active one. If there is an older one, you could try launching it. I also suggest writing down the name of the alternate profile for possible future investigation.  </li></ol> <p>If that restarts thunderbird, all is well. If not, you still aren't lost. You have the name of the prior profile.  Try this for further checking </p> <ol><li> click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation again </li><li> scroll down to 'profile' and click 'open folder'  </li><li> you are now in the profile in windows file explorer, click the back button once to get to the 'profiles' folder </li><li> now click to the alternate profile folder </li><li> you had a POP account. click the Mail folder and then the 'POP account folder' - you should see the 'lost' message folders there. Now that you've identified them, you can at least salvage them if necessary by copying the folders and pasting in a new thunderbird profile in the Mail\Local Folders folder.  </li></ol> <p>I'll stop for now so you can investigate. A TIP: do backups periodically to minimize this messy situation. Most users (or so it seems) do not.&nbsp;:) Let me know how it goes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

One is active and the other I tried to activate, but couldn't see any difference and couldn't find any mail. Found some technical setup for POP and IMAP and provider, but that didn't tell me much.
