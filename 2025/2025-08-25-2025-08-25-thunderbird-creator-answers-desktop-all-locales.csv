Al interntar enviar un mensaje dice el siguiente mensaje: ""Falló el envio del mensaje. El mensaje no se ha podido enviar porque ha caducado la conexión al servidir de salida (SMTP) <a href=""http://mail.hospiciodeloeste.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.hospiciodeloeste.com</a>.  Vuelva a intentarlo."" </p><p>Cuando verifico los ajustes del sistema de Thunderbird, dice que la aplicación está al día.  Al igual que cuando me dirijo a la plataforma del dominio: <a href=""http://hospiciodeloeste.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hospiciodeloeste.com</a>, puedo ver que todos los mensajes recibidos a dicho correo electrónico están llegando correctamente;  pero en la aplicación de Thunderbird no suben los correos.  Hoy probé instalar el correo electrónico en otra aplicación de correo electrónico y recibió los mensajes que nos enviaron durante el día. </p><p>¿Alguna sugerencia al respecto?   </p><p>Gracias. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,es,"",ptorresfacturador
