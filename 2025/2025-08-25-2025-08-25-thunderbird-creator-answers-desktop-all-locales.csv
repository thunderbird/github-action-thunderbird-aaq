Most of the text was covered over.  I was unable to remove the blockage.  When I opened the same email on both my iPhone and my Yahoo mail account, there was no problem - no blockage. It looked somewhat like a large black mask laid over the text. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,1759465;,amammini
