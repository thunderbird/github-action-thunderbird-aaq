Most of the text was covered over.  I was unable to remove the blockage.  When I opened the same email on both my iPhone and my Yahoo mail account, there was no problem - no blockage. It looked somewhat like a large black mask laid over the text. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",amammini

After years of reliable performance, my personalized incoming mail notification sound (wav format) suddenly stopped playing. The 'test' function in settings works fine, but NOTHING happens when actually downloading messages.  I've tried EVERY possible FIX, but NO LUCK. Any suggestions?
