That rebuilds the index used to access the emails in the folder.  I see a lot of issues caused by antivirus scanning where contention sees incomplete index writes. </p><p>You might also want to run a chkdsk commands across your disk as a hang like you describe can be indicative of a non sane file description on the hard disk. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It's quite a pain to do the Linux equivalent for LUKS encrypted drives which mine are but yes, I may do that.   </p><p>I should have said that when TB hangs as I try to read any message in that folder the message bar at the bottom of TB says ""Loading message..."" which seems sensible.  I can't get at the error console then as TB hangs but when I restart TB  the console shows no errors but one warning: </p><pre>          Missing resource in locale en-GB: devtools/client/toolbox.ftl </pre> <p>However, I think that's spurious, see <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1904591"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1904591</a> </p><p>Running in debug mode produces exactly the same problem so I think this is central TB not add ons. (Though I accept that it <em>could</em> be bitrot on the drive ... but I think it's unlikely. </p><p>For now I have turned off the filter that sends Emails into the folder so tomorrow I can see if they read fine sitting in the in tray.  I am sure they will but it ticks off one more possible check.  Then I may test the machine's drives but I may just delete this one TB folder and create a new one and feed the messages into that one and see if the problem recurrs.  </p><p>However, any other suggestions happily received. </p>",ce_mozilla,false,0,0

It is a yellow band across the top of the email display with options </p><p>Another possible issue is the remote links are to scripts, not images.  Thunderbird will fetch remote images but not run remote scripts.  They are a big security risk.  Traditionally it was just twitter and facebook that tended to use tracking scripts to display images but it is becoming more widespread.  If you could post the L:ink that is in the source of the mail for one of those images we might stand a chance of determining if that is the issue. </p><p>A Third option is your antivirus is blocking remote images either because of the scripts, or because of the number of hits on the same server that occur when you open the email (an attempt to block an unknown distributed denial of service attack at the source.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
