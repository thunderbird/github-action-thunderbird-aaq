That rebuilds the index used to access the emails in the folder.  I see a lot of issues caused by antivirus scanning where contention sees incomplete index writes. </p><p>You might also want to run a chkdsk commands across your disk as a hang like you describe can be indicative of a non sane file description on the hard disk. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is a yellow band across the top of the email display with options </p><p>Another possible issue is the remote links are to scripts, not images.  Thunderbird will fetch remote images but not run remote scripts.  They are a big security risk.  Traditionally it was just twitter and facebook that tended to use tracking scripts to display images but it is becoming more widespread.  If you could post the L:ink that is in the source of the mail for one of those images we might stand a chance of determining if that is the issue. </p><p>A Third option is your antivirus is blocking remote images either because of the scripts, or because of the number of hits on the same server that occur when you open the email (an attempt to block an unknown distributed denial of service attack at the source.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
