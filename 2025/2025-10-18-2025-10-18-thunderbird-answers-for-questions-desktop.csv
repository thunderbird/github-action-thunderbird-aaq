It is a yellow band across the top of the email display with options </p><p>Another possible issue is the remote links are to scripts, not images.  Thunderbird will fetch remote images but not run remote scripts.  They are a big security risk.  Traditionally it was just twitter and facebook that tended to use tracking scripts to display images but it is becoming more widespread.  If you could post the L:ink that is in the source of the mail for one of those images we might stand a chance of determining if that is the issue. </p><p>A Third option is your antivirus is blocking remote images either because of the scripts, or because of the number of hits on the same server that occur when you open the email (an attempt to block an unknown distributed denial of service attack at the source.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Do this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - click the 'Mail' folder, as that is where all POP accounts are - you will see names of the POP accounts here, to see message folders for an account, click the desired account folder. You will not see individual messages, as messages are stored in mbox format. You may see such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf. The files named inbox and sent are mbox files that contain the messages. the msf files are indexes into the respective file. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
