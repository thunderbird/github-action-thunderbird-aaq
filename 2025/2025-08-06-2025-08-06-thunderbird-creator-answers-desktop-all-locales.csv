This behavior started around six months ago. I've been using Thunderbird for a long time and regularly update it, so this issue is relatively recent and quite noticeable. </p><p>Previously, the ""Move to Inbox Again"" option was useful for retrieving legitimate emails that were wrongly marked as junk. I would open the Junk folder, highlight the non-junk emails, right-click, and select the option. Thunderbird would then move each email back to its respective account's inbox, as expected. </p><p>However, recently I've noticed that when multiple emails are selected, they are all moved to the inbox of the first accountlisted among the selected messages, rather than returning to their original inboxes. This is a clear deviation from the previous behavior and leads to confusion and misplacement of messages. </p><p>Additionally, this option appears even when an email is already in the inbox. In such cases, selecting ""Move to Inbox Again"" moves the email to the default account's inbox, which doesn’t make much sense.
