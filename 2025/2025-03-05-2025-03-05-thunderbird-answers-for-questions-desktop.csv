You have mail accounts in Thunderbird and they will use whatever server they have been set up to use.  Thunderbird facilitates the ability to see various account (email addresses) which may be on different server, so enabling reading and writing of emails.  </p><p>Check to make sure mailfence has not switched imap/pop/smtp off. </p> <ul><li> Logon to webmail account (accessed via a browser) </li><li> Go into your account Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Security: Services access. </li><li> Please make sure IMAP and SMTP etc are enabled. </li><li> You may need to generate a password when you enable them. </li></ul> <p>If you use the links to generate new password then you will need to update the stored password in Thunderbird: </p> <ul><li> In Thunderbird </li><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Scroll to Passwords section </li><li> click on 'Saved PAsswords </li><li> Click on 'Show Password' </li><li> If prompted for windows password - then it means - when you boot/start up computer you get asked for a User Account password to logon to see desktop etc - That is the required password. </li><li> Right click on imap:account....line and selct 'Edit Password' </li><li> clear all contents and enter the new password </li><li> Do the same process for the smtp://account...line to update the password. </li><li> Click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p><br> If the actual Thunderbird program crashed then you would need to post the Crash ID.

The most common reason for a 'Not Responding' error message is usually an Anti-Virus product which intervenes and prevents Thunderbird from accessing files.

Then it is highly recommended to access them using a different password from your account web access.</em> <em>This is the next logical step you should take after enabling 2FA for web access to harden your Mailfence account. You’ll extend the level of security on other/non-web services in use.</em> <em>We recommend you to generate and use service specific passwords, <strong>even if you do not enable 2FA</strong>.</em> <em>To do so, follow these steps&nbsp;:</em> <em>Go to your account Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Security: Services access (section) -&gt; click on ‘Generate a specific password for this service’.</em> </p><p><br> This forum is manned by other Thunderbird users in a voluntary unpaid capacity who give their time and knowledge to assist others. No one called 'Manu Andino' has made any Support Forum assistance to any of your questions, so I think you maybe talking about someone on a 'mailfence' forum. You have already asked a question on this only two days ago. Please do not keep repeating identical questions. Please keep all conversations in the question asked otherwise the conversation gets lost, people end up repeating themselves and it wastes time.   Only create a new question if you have not had a response for over a week or you are asking a new question on a new topic. As a heads up - do not post personal data like email addresses or telephone numbers because this is a public website. No one sends personal emails not makes phone calls. This comment posted in the Support Forum should send an email via an auto method to you (please note at the time I'm typing this there has been issues and therefore requires people to log on to their forum profile to see questions).  Volunteers could be anywhere in the world. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

With Windows, this is rarely a problem, as most users get thunderbird from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a>. linux users get from snap and flathup, and my understanding is that they each store profile in different locations. Which means that if you switch from snap to flathup, your old profile does not appear. This happens because the profiles.ini file from each distribution is pointing to a different profile. When thunderbird starts, it reads the distribution's profiles.ini for the location of the profile. It's that basic. If you use multiple profiles, it keeps track of the last used profile which, for most users, is the same one. When updating with the same distribution this is never an issue. When switching distributions, you have two choices:  copy the contents of the old profile and paste into the profile of the new installation, or edit the profiles.ini of the new distribution to point to the profile of the prior installation. If you plan to remain using the current distribution for updates, I recommend the first option. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
