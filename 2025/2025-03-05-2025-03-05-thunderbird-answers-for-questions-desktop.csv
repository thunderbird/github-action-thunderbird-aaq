With Windows, this is rarely a problem, as most users get thunderbird from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a>. linux users get from snap and flathup, and my understanding is that they each store profile in different locations. Which means that if you switch from snap to flathup, your old profile does not appear. This happens because the profiles.ini file from each distribution is pointing to a different profile. When thunderbird starts, it reads the distribution's profiles.ini for the location of the profile. It's that basic. If you use multiple profiles, it keeps track of the last used profile which, for most users, is the same one. When updating with the same distribution this is never an issue. When switching distributions, you have two choices:  copy the contents of the old profile and paste into the profile of the new installation, or edit the profiles.ini of the new distribution to point to the profile of the prior installation. If you plan to remain using the current distribution for updates, I recommend the first option. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
