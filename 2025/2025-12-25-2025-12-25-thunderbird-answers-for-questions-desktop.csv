It uses your account information to access your account with the various providers,  but it does not share any information about your various accounts with anyone except the mail provider that they need to be used with to communicate with to get and send your mail. </p><p>Having said that if you place your Thunderbird profile on a location on the local machine that Microsoft backup to their online drive product then I guess they can ostensibly have access to everything in your backup.  It sort of depends on how much you backup,  how much you trust Microsoft what they say they are unable to access your encrypted information without you signing in. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
