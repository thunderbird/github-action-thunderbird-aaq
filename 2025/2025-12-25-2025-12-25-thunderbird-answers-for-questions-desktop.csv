It uses your account information to access your account with the various providers,  but it does not share any information about your various accounts with anyone except the mail provider that they need to be used with to communicate with to get and send your mail. </p><p>Having said that if you place your Thunderbird profile on a location on the local machine that Microsoft backup to their online drive product then I guess they can ostensibly have access to everything in your backup.  It sort of depends on how much you backup,  how much you trust Microsoft what they say they are unable to access your encrypted information without you signing in. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Retry just adds another connection attempt and the issue gets worse, not better. </p><p>Personally I have something like that happening with <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>,  on startup when every account hits the server to authenticate I get issues with outlook refusing connections but if I ignore the initial failures everything settles within about 15 minutes all of the account get their mail. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The interval is currently set to 10 minutes.  </p><p>I thought of an interval issue. Indeed, it seems significant that the problem occurs on the provider with 2 accounts. </p><p>But:  </p> <ol><li> I would expect this to trigger issues rather on the second account. Well, assuming TB calls the providers in same order as the accounts, but maybe TB does not use this order.  </li><li> This should resolve itself in a few minutes, just like you. Days seems too long. But maybe the issue does not last for days, maybe it just re-triggers itself. </li><li> When I generated a log for the wrong account, I disabled the other accounts in order to get a cleaner log. The issue stayed. Then I disabled all accounts except the second account from the same provider, in order to get a clean log of a successful connection to this provider, and the connection was successful as usual. </li></ol> <p>Anyhow, I just set the interval to 16 minutes and I unchecked ""Check for new messages at startup"" for the second account. If this does not work, I will try 2 things separately: </p> <ol><li> Swap the 2 first accounts </li><li> Disable the ""bad"" account and recreate it </li></ol> <p>BTW, I have those logs, I see where they start differing, but I am unable to go any further. </p>",davito9w,false,0,0
