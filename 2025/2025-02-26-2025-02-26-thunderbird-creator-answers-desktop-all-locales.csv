Under Security Devices, there is no Security Device that provides this functionality so in Security Devices I click Load and Browse... and select /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/libosclientcerts.dylib to add the appropriate security device. However, when I click okay, I get ""Alert"" ""Unable to add module"" . What am I doing wrong? </p><p>I also use libosclientcerts.dylib in Firefox just fine.

The profile is there in .thunderbird, with all the account information and local folders, but for some reason thunderbird can't find it. I tried deleting the cache, pointing the import wizard at a copy of the original profile -- all without any success. I can see the folders there with their data, and the account information. Why is thunderbird 128.6.0esr ignoring its data? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1714581;,mwc2
