With 200 million PCs becoming obsolete in a few months, I would think Mozilla would have noted that many of us are going to migrate to Linux but moving Thunderbird has been a nightmare (still unsuccessful nightmare). I've followed all the directives and none seem to work... I've been using TBird since it started and have a LOT of emails I'd prefer not to lose so if I could just get my Windows profile to work on Linux it would be great... I know you're busy, but we are facing an Armageddon of sorts out here... Help! Thanks a million  cheers pj </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",doktorg

But when on my first email draft I tried to use search and replace (Ctrl + h), I was not getting any highlighted letter on pressing 'Find Next'. When I press on 'Replace' still 'Find Next' button is highlighted and also nothing seems to be replaced. It is only when I close the Find and Replace window I see my changes. I am attaching picture for your reference. If this is not standard feature then please provide support to fix this issue. </p>",thunderbird;search-tag-and-share;,thunderbird,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",sourav.ken
