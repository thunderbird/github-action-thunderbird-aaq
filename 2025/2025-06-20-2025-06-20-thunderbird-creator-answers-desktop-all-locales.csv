With 200 million PCs becoming obsolete in a few months, I would think Mozilla would have noted that many of us are going to migrate to Linux but moving Thunderbird has been a nightmare (still unsuccessful nightmare). I've followed all the directives and none seem to work... I've been using TBird since it started and have a LOT of emails I'd prefer not to lose so if I could just get my Windows profile to work on Linux it would be great... I know you're busy, but we are facing an Armageddon of sorts out here... Help! Thanks a million  cheers pj </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",doktorg
