In the email list, click on the ""Date"" column header to sort the emails by the most recent.        Clicking once will sort emails from newest to oldest.        Clicking again will sort them from oldest to newest.

Restart Thunderbird </p><p>Sometimes, a simple restart can fix many issues. </p><pre>   Close Thunderbird completely and reopen it to see if the problem resolves. </pre> <p>2. Check for Corrupted Profile </p><p>Your Thunderbird profile (where settings and emails are stored) may have become corrupted, causing issues with composing messages. </p><pre>   Create a New Profile:        Close Thunderbird.        Press Windows + R, type thunderbird.exe -P, and press Enter.        In the profile manager, create a new profile and set it as default.        Open Thunderbird with the new profile and see if the problem persists. </pre> <p>3. Disable Add-ons or Extensions </p><p>Sometimes, Thunderbird extensions or add-ons can cause issues with text input. </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Add-ons and Themes &gt; Extensions.    Disable any extensions that might be causing the problem, especially those that interact with composing emails.    Restart Thunderbird and check if you can type in the message body now. </pre> <p>4. Check for Updates </p><p>Ensure that Thunderbird is up-to-date, as newer versions may fix bugs related to this issue. </p><pre>   Go to Help &gt; About Thunderbird.    If an update is available, it will be downloaded automatically. </pre> <p>5. Disable Hardware Acceleration </p><p>Hardware acceleration can sometimes cause graphical issues in Thunderbird, including problems with the text box. </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Options (or Preferences on macOS) &gt; General.    Scroll down and click Config Editor.    In the search box, type gfx.direct2d.disabled and set it to true.    Restart Thunderbird and see if the issue is fixed. </pre> <p>6. Reset Thunderbird Preferences (Config Editor) </p><p>There might be a specific setting causing the issue. Resetting Thunderbird preferences can help: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Options (or Preferences on macOS).    Scroll down to the bottom and click on Config Editor.    In the search bar, enter mail.compose.default_html.    If the value is false, set it to true (this enables HTML composing by default, which may fix the cursor issue in some cases). </pre> <p>7. Check for System-Level Input Issues </p><p>Ensure that your keyboard is functioning correctly and that there are no system-level input issues that might prevent typing. </p><pre>   Try typing in other applications (like Notepad or Word) to see if the issue is specific to Thunderbird or affects all text input. </pre> <p>8. Create a New Message with a Different Template </p><p>If a specific email template is causing the issue, try composing a new email without using a template: </p><pre>   Click on Write (or press Ctrl + N) to create a new message.    Make sure that no templates are being applied when you try composing the message. </pre> <p>9. Reinstall Thunderbird </p><p>If none of the above solutions work, you might want to try reinstalling Thunderbird: </p><pre>   Uninstall Thunderbird from your computer.    Go to the Thunderbird website and download the latest version.    Install it and check if the problem persists. </pre> <p>Try these solutions step by step, and one of them should likely resolve the issue you're encountering with typing in the message body.

You've already tried several good troubleshooting steps, but there are still some additional things to check and try. Possible Causes and Solutions 1. Ensure Correct SMTP Settings (Office 365) </p><p>Double-check that the SMTP settings for Office 365 (Outlook) are correct. These are the typical SMTP settings for Office 365: </p><pre>   SMTP Server: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>    Port: 587    Encryption: STARTTLS (or TLS depending on the version of Thunderbird)    Authentication Method: OAuth2 (which you've correctly set)    Username: Your full Outlook email address (e.g., yourname@outlook.com) </pre> <p>Since you mentioned that you are using OAuth2, make sure OAuth2 is selected for the authentication method in Thunderbird for the Outgoing Server (SMTP) settings. </p><p>Steps to verify the SMTP settings: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings.    In the left sidebar, under Outgoing Server (SMTP), select the SMTP server used by your Outlook account (usually <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>).    Click Edit, and check that the settings are exactly as above.    Ensure that OAuth2 is selected as the Authentication method, and that the username is your full Outlook email address. </pre> <p>2. Remove and Reconfigure OAuth2 Authentication </p><p>If the authentication with OAuth2 is still failing, it could be an issue with the cached credentials. You may need to reset your OAuth2 settings: </p><p>Steps to remove OAuth2 credentials: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Options (or Preferences on macOS).    Click on Privacy &amp; Security.    Scroll down to Saved Logins and click View Saved Logins.    Delete any saved logins related to your Outlook account.    Reconfigure OAuth2: Go back to Account Settings and make sure the SMTP server is set to use OAuth2 for authentication. If needed, re-enter your Outlook email password and let Thunderbird prompt you for OAuth2 login again. </pre> <p>3. Check Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) </p><p>If your Outlook account has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, make sure that Thunderbird is properly handling the OAuth2 flow. Sometimes, 2FA can interfere with Thunderbird's ability to authenticate properly, requiring you to log in through the OAuth2 dialog every time you try to send an email. </p><p>Steps to check if 2FA is affecting the login: </p><pre>   Log into your Outlook account in a browser.    Check if you have any unusual activity or security settings in your Microsoft account.    If possible, generate an App Password for Outlook to see if it resolves the issue (especially if you're trying to use basic authentication or OAuth2 issues). </pre> <p>4. Test Basic Authentication (as a temporary test) </p><p>You mentioned trying basic authentication for SMTP, but it seems like the issue persists. Let's test it again with the correct settings, just to rule out OAuth2 being the cause. </p><p>Steps to switch to Basic Authentication: </p><pre>   Go to Account Settings &gt; Outgoing Server (SMTP).    Select your SMTP server (<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>).    Change the Authentication method to Normal password instead of OAuth2.    Enter your full Outlook email address as the username and the App password (if 2FA is enabled) or your regular password for your Outlook account.    Test sending an email again. If this works, the issue is likely with the OAuth2 configuration. </pre> <p>5. Check for Firewall or Antivirus Interference </p><p>Your firewall or antivirus software could be blocking the connection to the SMTP server. Try disabling your antivirus or firewall temporarily and see if that resolves the issue. If it works, make sure to add Thunderbird as an exception in your firewall/antivirus settings. 6. Check for Thunderbird Updates </p><p>If you are using an outdated version of Thunderbird, it could be causing compatibility issues with OAuth2 or Office 365. Ensure you're running the latest version of Thunderbird. </p><p>Steps to check for updates: </p><pre>   Go to Help &gt; About Thunderbird.    If there is an update available, it will be downloaded and installed automatically. </pre> <p>7. Review OAuth2 Errors </p><p>Sometimes, Thunderbird can give you more details about the error when it tries to authenticate with the SMTP server. </p><pre>   Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.    Look for any OAuth2 related errors or logs in the Logins section or the Errors section. </pre> <p>This could give you more specific information about what’s going wrong with the authentication. Summary of Key Steps to Try: </p><pre>   Verify SMTP Settings: Double-check server, port, and authentication methods.    Clear OAuth2 Credentials: Remove saved logins and reconfigure OAuth2.    Check Two-Factor Authentication: If enabled, ensure Thunderbird can handle OAuth2 properly.    Try Basic Authentication Temporarily: Use an app password or Outlook password for SMTP.    Check Firewall/Antivirus: Ensure no software is blocking the connection.    Update Thunderbird: Make sure you're using the latest version of Thunderbird.    Look for OAuth2 errors in Troubleshooting Information. </pre> <p>Hopefully, these steps will help resolve your issue. Let me know if you continue to experience problems, and I can assist further! </p>",Sakura,false,0,0
