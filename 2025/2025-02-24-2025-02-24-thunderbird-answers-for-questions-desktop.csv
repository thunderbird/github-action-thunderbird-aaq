Давайте разберемся и шаг за шагом попробуем устранить эту проблему. Шаг 1: Проверьте настройки сервера </p><p>Поскольку вы уже проверяли настройки, напомню вам, чтобы убедиться, что они правильные: </p><pre>   IMAP сервер (входящая почта):        Сервер: <a href=""http://imap.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.example.com</a> (замените на сервер вашего провайдера, например, <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> для Gmail)        Порт: 993        Шифрование: SSL/TLS        Аутентификация: Обычный пароль (если вы не используете OAuth2) </pre> <pre>   SMTP сервер (исходящая почта):        Сервер: <a href=""http://smtp.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.example.com</a> (замените на сервер вашего провайдера, например, <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> для Gmail)        Порт: 587 (с STARTTLS)        Аутентификация: Обычный пароль или OAuth2 (в зависимости от провайдера) </pre> <p>Убедитесь, что имя пользователя — это ваш полный адрес электронной почты для обоих серверов (входящего и исходящего). Шаг 2: Проверьте консоль ошибок Thunderbird </p><p>Thunderbird имеет Консоль ошибок, которая может предоставить более подробную информацию о том, что не так. </p><pre>   Откройте Thunderbird.    Перейдите в Инструменты &gt; Инструменты разработчика &gt; Консоль ошибок.    Ищите любые сообщения об ошибках, связанных с отправкой или получением почты. Это может дать вам больше информации о причине проблемы (например, ошибки аутентификации, тайм-ауты соединения и другие проблемы). </pre> <p>Шаг 3: Проверьте подключение к серверу </p><p>Иногда проблема может быть связана с подключением. Вы можете протестировать соединение с серверами вашего почтового провайдера: </p><pre>   Используйте встроенную проверку Thunderbird:        Перейдите в Настройки учетной записи.        В разделе Настройки сервера нажмите Проверить почту (чтобы посмотреть, может ли Thunderbird получить почту).        Если возникает ошибка, она отобразится здесь.    Проверьте с помощью Telnet (для опытных пользователей): Если вам удобно, вы можете протестировать серверное соединение с помощью Telnet:        Откройте командную строку (Windows) или терминал (Mac).        Введите следующее для проверки соединения с IMAP (замените на сервер вашего почтового провайдера): </pre> <p>telnet <a href=""http://imap.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.example.com</a> 993 </p><p>Для SMTP используйте: </p><pre>       telnet <a href=""http://smtp.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.example.com</a> 587 </pre> <pre>       Если соединение установлено, вы увидите ответ от сервера. Если нет — это может означать проблему с сетью или блокировкой соединения. </pre> <p>Шаг 4: Проверьте настройки брандмауэра/антивируса </p><p>Несмотря на то, что вы отключили антивирус, иногда брандмауэры или настройки сети могут блокировать соединение Thunderbird с почтовыми серверами. Попробуйте следующее: </p><pre>   Отключите брандмауэр:        Если вы используете сторонний брандмауэр, временно отключите его и проверьте, работает ли Thunderbird. </pre> <pre>   Попробуйте подключиться через другую сеть:        Если возможно, попробуйте подключиться к интернету через другую сеть (например, мобильный hotspot), чтобы исключить проблемы с сетью. </pre> <pre>   Проверьте настройки маршрутизатора:        Некоторые маршрутизаторы могут блокировать порты IMAP (993) или SMTP (587). Убедитесь, что ваш маршрутизатор не блокирует эти порты. </pre> <p>Шаг 5: Создайте новый профиль Thunderbird </p><p>Иногда профиль может быть поврежден, что вызывает проблемы с получением/отправкой почты. </p><pre>   Создайте новый профиль:        Закройте Thunderbird.        Откройте Выполнить (Windows + R), введите thunderbird.exe -P и нажмите Enter.        Создайте новый профиль и заново настройте вашу учетную запись. </pre> <pre>   Это поможет выяснить, связано ли это с повреждением профиля. </pre> <p>Шаг 6: Запустите Thunderbird в безопасном режиме </p><p>Thunderbird может работать в Безопасном режиме, который отключает дополнения и настройки, которые могут мешать нормальной работе. </p><pre>   Закройте Thunderbird.    Зажмите клавишу Shift при открытии Thunderbird, чтобы запустить его в безопасном режиме.    Проверьте, работает ли почта в безопасном режиме. </pre> <p>Если работает, можно исключить влияние дополнений, отключив их по одному. Шаг 7: Проверьте доступ к почте через веб-интерфейс </p><p>Убедитесь, что проблема не на стороне сервера. Зайдите в веб-интерфейс вашей почты (например, Gmail, Outlook) и проверьте, можете ли вы отправлять и получать письма там. </p><pre>   Если через веб-интерфейс почта работает, это подтверждает, что проблема в Thunderbird, а не у вашего почтового провайдера. </pre> <p>Шаг 8: Проверьте наличие обновлений для Thunderbird </p><p>Убедитесь, что у вас установлена последняя версия Thunderbird, так как обновления часто содержат исправления для известных проблем. </p><pre>   Перейдите в Справка &gt; О Thunderbird, чтобы проверить наличие обновлений. </pre> <p>Шаг 9: Переустановите Thunderbird </p><p>В крайнем случае, можно полностью удалить Thunderbird, удалить данные профиля и снова установить его. Иногда это может помочь решить проблемы, связанные с конфигурацией. </p><pre>   Создайте резервную копию профиля (почта, настройки и т.д.):        Перейдите по пути: %APPDATA%\Thunderbird в проводнике и сделайте резервную копию папки Profiles.    Удалите Thunderbird через панель управления или настройки.    Переустановите Thunderbird с официального сайта и заново настройте свою учетную запись. </pre> <p>Резюме действий: </p><pre>   Проверьте настройки IMAP и SMTP в Thunderbird.    Посмотрите на ошибки в Консоли ошибок.    Проверьте подключение к серверу через Telnet или с помощью функции Проверить почту.    Отключите брандмауэр/антивирус и попробуйте снова.    Попробуйте новый профиль Thunderbird.    Запустите Thunderbird в безопасном режиме для проверки влияния дополнений.    Проверьте доступ к почте через веб-интерфейс.    Обновите Thunderbird до последней версии.    Если не помогает, переустановите Thunderbird. </pre> <p>Надеюсь, один из этих шагов поможет вам устранить проблему. Если проблема сохраняется или возникли дополнительные вопросы, сообщите, я постараюсь помочь! 😊 </p>",Sakura,false,0,0

You've already tried several good troubleshooting steps, but there are still some additional things to check and try. Possible Causes and Solutions 1. Ensure Correct SMTP Settings (Office 365) </p><p>Double-check that the SMTP settings for Office 365 (Outlook) are correct. These are the typical SMTP settings for Office 365: </p><pre>   SMTP Server: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>    Port: 587    Encryption: STARTTLS (or TLS depending on the version of Thunderbird)    Authentication Method: OAuth2 (which you've correctly set)    Username: Your full Outlook email address (e.g., yourname@outlook.com) </pre> <p>Since you mentioned that you are using OAuth2, make sure OAuth2 is selected for the authentication method in Thunderbird for the Outgoing Server (SMTP) settings. </p><p>Steps to verify the SMTP settings: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings.    In the left sidebar, under Outgoing Server (SMTP), select the SMTP server used by your Outlook account (usually <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>).    Click Edit, and check that the settings are exactly as above.    Ensure that OAuth2 is selected as the Authentication method, and that the username is your full Outlook email address. </pre> <p>2. Remove and Reconfigure OAuth2 Authentication </p><p>If the authentication with OAuth2 is still failing, it could be an issue with the cached credentials. You may need to reset your OAuth2 settings: </p><p>Steps to remove OAuth2 credentials: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Options (or Preferences on macOS).    Click on Privacy &amp; Security.    Scroll down to Saved Logins and click View Saved Logins.    Delete any saved logins related to your Outlook account.    Reconfigure OAuth2: Go back to Account Settings and make sure the SMTP server is set to use OAuth2 for authentication. If needed, re-enter your Outlook email password and let Thunderbird prompt you for OAuth2 login again. </pre> <p>3. Check Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) </p><p>If your Outlook account has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, make sure that Thunderbird is properly handling the OAuth2 flow. Sometimes, 2FA can interfere with Thunderbird's ability to authenticate properly, requiring you to log in through the OAuth2 dialog every time you try to send an email. </p><p>Steps to check if 2FA is affecting the login: </p><pre>   Log into your Outlook account in a browser.    Check if you have any unusual activity or security settings in your Microsoft account.    If possible, generate an App Password for Outlook to see if it resolves the issue (especially if you're trying to use basic authentication or OAuth2 issues). </pre> <p>4. Test Basic Authentication (as a temporary test) </p><p>You mentioned trying basic authentication for SMTP, but it seems like the issue persists. Let's test it again with the correct settings, just to rule out OAuth2 being the cause. </p><p>Steps to switch to Basic Authentication: </p><pre>   Go to Account Settings &gt; Outgoing Server (SMTP).    Select your SMTP server (<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>).    Change the Authentication method to Normal password instead of OAuth2.    Enter your full Outlook email address as the username and the App password (if 2FA is enabled) or your regular password for your Outlook account.    Test sending an email again. If this works, the issue is likely with the OAuth2 configuration. </pre> <p>5. Check for Firewall or Antivirus Interference </p><p>Your firewall or antivirus software could be blocking the connection to the SMTP server. Try disabling your antivirus or firewall temporarily and see if that resolves the issue. If it works, make sure to add Thunderbird as an exception in your firewall/antivirus settings. 6. Check for Thunderbird Updates </p><p>If you are using an outdated version of Thunderbird, it could be causing compatibility issues with OAuth2 or Office 365. Ensure you're running the latest version of Thunderbird. </p><p>Steps to check for updates: </p><pre>   Go to Help &gt; About Thunderbird.    If there is an update available, it will be downloaded and installed automatically. </pre> <p>7. Review OAuth2 Errors </p><p>Sometimes, Thunderbird can give you more details about the error when it tries to authenticate with the SMTP server. </p><pre>   Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.    Look for any OAuth2 related errors or logs in the Logins section or the Errors section. </pre> <p>This could give you more specific information about what’s going wrong with the authentication. Summary of Key Steps to Try: </p><pre>   Verify SMTP Settings: Double-check server, port, and authentication methods.    Clear OAuth2 Credentials: Remove saved logins and reconfigure OAuth2.    Check Two-Factor Authentication: If enabled, ensure Thunderbird can handle OAuth2 properly.    Try Basic Authentication Temporarily: Use an app password or Outlook password for SMTP.    Check Firewall/Antivirus: Ensure no software is blocking the connection.    Update Thunderbird: Make sure you're using the latest version of Thunderbird.    Look for OAuth2 errors in Troubleshooting Information. </pre> <p>Hopefully, these steps will help resolve your issue.

The problem you're experiencing seems to be related to how Thunderbird is handling the folder indexes (and possibly email headers) for your inbox. Let's go through a few possible solutions and settings adjustments that might help automate or resolve this problem so you don’t have to manually repair the folder each time. Possible Solutions </p><pre>   Check Thunderbird for Updates: Ensure your Thunderbird is running the latest version, as bug fixes and performance improvements could help with issues like this. Updates often resolve underlying problems with the email display.        Go to Help &gt; About Thunderbird and make sure you’re running the latest stable version. </pre> <pre>   Increase the Frequency of Folder Repair: While you can't fully automate this process (i.e., having it auto-repair every time the issue happens), you could set Thunderbird to automatically perform a folder repair in the background more frequently.        Open Account Settings by clicking on Menu &gt; Account Settings.        Select your Account and click on Synchronization &amp; Storage.        Under Message Synchronizing, ensure you have Keep messages for this account on the server selected and choose the Download messages for offline use option as well (if applicable to your setup). This ensures your local data is frequently synchronized with the server. </pre> <pre>   Compact Folders Regularly: The issue might also be related to Thunderbird needing to compact the folders to prevent corruption in the index files. You can enable Thunderbird to compact folders automatically:        Go to Tools &gt; Options (or Preferences on macOS) &gt; General.        Scroll down and click on Config Editor.        In the search bar, type mail.compact and look for the setting mail.imap.autosync. Set this to true.        This will allow Thunderbird to auto-compact folders when it’s not in active use, which can help prevent indexing issues. </pre> <pre>   Check your Email Headers: The issue could be related to a problem with how Ziggo’s mail server is sending email headers. Sometimes, mail servers can send malformed headers that Thunderbird has trouble parsing, causing the missing sender name or subject. </pre> <pre>   If this continues, it’s worth rechecking with your provider to see if they can ensure proper header formatting. If they can’t fix it on their end, consider using another mail server or an email forwarding service temporarily to see if that resolves the issue. </pre> <pre>   Use the ""Global Inbox"" (for IMAP accounts): If you're using IMAP, you might want to switch to using Thunderbird’s Global Inbox. This is essentially a unified inbox for multiple accounts, and it can sometimes solve problems with mail synchronization and index issues. </pre> <pre>   To switch:        Go to Account Settings &gt; Server Settings.        Under Local Folders, select Global Inbox for each account. This helps Thunderbird handle mail indexing more smoothly. </pre> <pre>   Try Using a Clean Profile: If Thunderbird's profile is starting to become corrupted, it can cause persistent issues with email rendering and behavior. You can create a new Thunderbird profile and move your existing emails to it:        Close Thunderbird.        Run Thunderbird’s Profile Manager by pressing Win + R, typing thunderbird.exe -P, and pressing Enter.        Create a new profile and test whether the issue persists in the new profile. </pre> <pre>   If the new profile doesn’t have the same issue, you can transfer your emails to the new profile. </pre> <pre>   Use a Dedicated Email Client Repair Tool: Some third-party utilities are designed to scan and repair Thunderbird's profile and settings. If you’re comfortable with trying third-party tools, you can search for Thunderbird profile repair utilities that might automate or fix the problem permanently. </pre> <p>Consider Submitting Feedback to Mozilla: </p><p>If the problem persists, you may want to consider reporting it directly to Mozilla. Sometimes ongoing issues like this may require developer attention to get properly addressed. </p><p>To submit feedback or report bugs: </p><pre>   Go to Bugzilla: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/</a> and file a bug report about your issue.While there isn't an out-of-the-box solution to fully automate the folder repair process in Thunderbird, the steps above should help reduce the frequency of the issue and make it easier to manage. If the problem is indeed caused by a server-side issue, working with Ziggo (or a different mail provider) could potentially address the underlying issue. </pre> <p>Let me know how these steps go, or if you need any more details on any specific step!with regards Sakura. </p>",Sakura,false,0,0

Let's go through some steps to try to resolve this issue: 1. Restart Thunderbird in Safe Mode </p><p>First, let's rule out any potential extensions or customizations that could be causing the issue. You can launch Thunderbird in Safe Mode, which disables add-ons and custom settings: </p><pre>   Close Thunderbird completely.    Open Thunderbird in Safe Mode:        Hold down the Shift key while launching Thunderbird.    Once in Safe Mode, check if the issue still persists. If the account only shows up once in Safe Mode, it might be caused by a conflicting add-on or theme. </pre> <p>2. Check Account Settings: </p><p>It’s possible that the account might have been duplicated in Thunderbird’s settings. Here's how to check and remove any duplicate entries: </p><pre>   Open Thunderbird.    Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings (or click on Menu &gt; Account Settings).    Look through the account list on the left side and see if you notice any duplicate entries. If you find a duplicate, select it and click Remove Account.    If both entries look similar but seem to represent the same account, try to delete the duplicate and restart Thunderbird. </pre> <p>3. Check for Duplicate Folders (Local Folders and Server Folders): </p><p>Sometimes, duplicate folders (like Inbox, Sent, etc.) appear because Thunderbird might have recreated them during an update. Here's how you can handle it: </p><pre>   Right-click the Inbox or another folder where you see duplication.    Click on Properties.    Look at the Server Settings for each folder. Ensure that the folder location is correct and there aren’t any extra local folders or server folders causing duplication. </pre> <p>4. Remove and Re-Add the Account: </p><p>If the above steps don’t resolve the issue, you can try removing and then re-adding the problematic account: </p><pre>   Backup your account settings and emails (just in case).    Go to Account Settings as described earlier and select the account that’s duplicating.    Click Remove Account (be sure to select ""Keep messages on the server"" if you want to keep them accessible).    Re-add the account by going to Menu &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Actions &gt; Add Mail Account and follow the prompts to set it up again. </pre> <p>5. Check the Profile Folder: </p><p>Sometimes profile issues can cause accounts to display incorrectly. To address this: </p><pre>   Open Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.    Under Profile Folder, click Open Folder.    Look inside the folder for any files that might have been corrupted during the update.    Consider backing up your profile (copying it to another location) and then rebuilding your profile if necessary. </pre> <p>6. Disable and Re-enable the Account: </p><p>You can try disabling and then re-enabling the problematic account: </p><pre>   Open Account Settings.    Click on the Account Settings for the account that is showing up twice.    Uncheck Enable this account and click OK.    Close and restart Thunderbird.    Go back into Account Settings, check Enable this account again, and see if the issue resolves. </pre> <p>7. Check the Mail Directory Settings: </p><p>Sometimes, the mail directory settings might be causing the duplication. Check the following: </p><pre>   In Account Settings, look for Local Folders and Server Settings for your accounts.

The fact that emails disappear completely and aren’t even found in Trash is concerning, but we can troubleshoot it. </p><p>Here are some steps that may help resolve the issue: 1. Check Thunderbird Version &amp; Update: </p><pre>   You mentioned you're using version 128.7.1esr. Although ESR (Extended Support Release) versions are generally stable, it's still worth checking if there’s an update, as bugs can sometimes affect even these stable releases.    Go to Help &gt; About Thunderbird to see if there is a newer version of 128.x.x ESR. If so, updating might resolve the issue. </pre> <p>2. Try Safe Mode: </p><p>Thunderbird has a Safe Mode that disables custom settings, themes, and extensions. This is useful to test if the problem lies with any of those. </p><pre>   Close Thunderbird.    Open Thunderbird in Safe Mode by holding the Shift key while launching Thunderbird.    In Safe Mode, try the drag-and-drop functionality again. If it works correctly, then the issue could be caused by settings, themes, or extensions. </pre> <p>If the issue doesn't occur in Safe Mode, you'll need to check your custom settings, themes, or extensions. 3. Check Profile Folder and Repair Folders: </p><p>Sometimes Thunderbird’s profile folder can get corrupted. You can try repairing your folders: </p><pre>   Repair Folders:        Right-click on the folder where you’re trying to drag-and-drop emails.        Select Properties &gt; Repair Folder.        This can help if the folder structure is corrupted and can’t handle the drag-and-drop properly.    Check Profile Folder:        Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Open Folder (this opens your profile folder).        Check if there are any issues with your profile (such as missing or corrupted files). </pre> <p>4. Rebuild Index Files: </p><p>The issue of disappearing emails could be due to corrupted index files, and Thunderbird often doesn’t display emails properly if the index file is damaged. You can try rebuilding the index files for your folders: </p><pre>   Right-click the affected folder (e.g., Inbox).    Select Properties &gt; Repair Folder.    This will rebuild the index for that folder, which may help restore your emails. </pre> <p>5. Check for Permission Issues: </p><p>Given that you’ve tried running as administrator, it’s worth ensuring that there are no file or folder permission issues: </p><pre>   Check Folder Permissions: Make sure the folder where Thunderbird is storing your messages has proper read/write permissions. This is important, especially if you’ve stored your email locally (on your computer).    Right-click the folder where your email is stored, go to Properties, then check the Security tab for any restrictions. </pre> <p>6. Try Creating a New Profile (Backup First): </p><p>If the issue persists, the profile might be corrupted. You can create a new Thunderbird profile to see if the issue still happens. This step is safe as long as you back up your emails before proceeding: </p><pre>   First, back up your current Thunderbird profile:        Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Profile Folder &gt; Open Folder.        Copy the entire folder to a backup location.    Then, create a new profile:        Close Thunderbird.        Open the Profile Manager by running Thunderbird with the -P parameter (e.g., Win + R, type thunderbird.exe -P).        Click on Create New Profile and follow the prompts.        Set up the same email accounts, and test if the issue persists with a fresh profile. </pre> <p>7. Revert to a Previous Version: </p><p>If the issue started after updating to version 128.7.1esr, you might want to try downgrading to a previous version temporarily. </p><p>To do this safely: </p><pre>   Back up your profile (as mentioned above).    Download a previous version of Thunderbird from here.    Install the version you want to revert to.    After installation, restore your profile and check if the issue resolves. </pre> <p>Important: Be sure to back up your emails first, since downgrading could potentially cause compatibility issues with newer versions of Thunderbird. 8. Check for Conflicting Software: </p><p>If you're running any security software (like antivirus or firewall), it might interfere with Thunderbird's ability to move emails. Some security software can prevent Thunderbird from working with files properly, especially with drag-and-drop operations. </p><pre>   Temporarily disable any antivirus or firewall software to see if that resolves the issue. </pre> <p>9. Review Thunderbird Logs: </p><p>You can also enable logging to check for any errors during the drag-and-drop operation: </p><pre>   Open the Error Console by going to Tools &gt; Developer Tools &gt; Error Console.    Check for any errors related to the drag-and-drop operation. </pre> <p>If none of these methods work, or if the issue continues after performing these steps, you may need to consider reaching out to the  Bugzilla (Thunderbird's bug tracker) to report the issue for a deeper investigation. </p><p>Let me know if you need further clarification or help! </p>",Sakura,false,0,0

Enable the Calendar Pane: </p><p>If the calendar isn't showing up in your Thunderbird window, it could just be hidden. Here’s how you can enable it again: </p><pre>   Open Thunderbird.    Go to View in the top menu.    Select Calendar (if it's unchecked, it should be checked to show the calendar).    If you still don't see it, go to View &gt; Toolbars and make sure that Calendar is selected. </pre> <p>2. Ensure Lightning is Installed: </p><p>The calendar functionality in Thunderbird is powered by the Lightning extension. If Lightning is no longer installed or has been disabled, you’ll need to reinstall or re-enable it. </p><p>To check if Lightning is installed: </p><pre>   Click on Menu (three horizontal lines) &gt; Add-ons and Themes.    In the Extensions tab, search for Lightning. If it is disabled, click the Enable button.    If it's not installed, go to the Add-ons page and search for Lightning to install it. </pre> <p>3. Open Calendar Manually: </p><p>If the calendar is still not showing up, try opening it manually: </p><pre>   Press Ctrl + Shift + C (this shortcut opens the Calendar tab).    Alternatively, you can click Menu (three horizontal lines) &gt; New Tab &gt; Calendar. </pre> <p>4. Reset Thunderbird UI (optional): </p><p>Sometimes, Thunderbird’s interface may have hidden the calendar tab accidentally, and resetting the UI can bring it back. </p><p>To reset Thunderbird's user interface: </p><pre>   Click on the Menu &gt; Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.    In the Troubleshooting Information page, click on Open Folder (next to Profile Folder).    Exit Thunderbird and delete (or move) the file localstore.rdf. This file stores UI preferences, and deleting it will reset the UI layout (but your emails and other data will not be affected).    Restart Thunderbird, and the calendar should reappear if it was simply a display issue. </pre> <p>5. Reinstall Thunderbird (if necessary): </p><p>If none of the above steps works, you might want to try reinstalling Thunderbird while preserving your email data: </p><pre>   Back up your Thunderbird profile by copying the entire profile folder (you can find this folder by going to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Open Folder).    Uninstall Thunderbird via Control Panel &gt; Programs.    Reinstall the latest version of Thunderbird from the official website.    After reinstalling, restore your profile by copying the backup files back into the profile folder. </pre> <p>6. Check Calendar Settings (optional): </p><p>If the calendar is still not visible, you can go into the calendar settings to ensure it's enabled: </p><pre>   Open Thunderbird.    Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Calendar.    Make sure the correct calendar settings are selected. </pre> <p>Hopefully, one of these methods will get your Thunderbird calendar back up and running!

Unfortunately, there's no built-in setting to automatically reverse the tab order so that the most recently opened tab appears first. </p><p>However, here are a couple of potential solutions or workarounds that might help you: 1. Using Add-ons: </p><p>There may be an add-on that allows you to adjust the tab behavior.

You can check the Thunderbird Add-ons page for any updates or new tools that might provide more flexibility in how tabs are managed. 2. Manually Moving Tabs: </p><p>While Thunderbird doesn't offer automatic tab sorting, you can manually reorder the tabs by clicking and dragging them to the left or right. If you open new messages and prefer them to be closer to the left, you could drag the tabs after opening them to maintain that desired order. 3. Using the ""Open Messages in a Tab"" setting: </p><p>If you prefer to interact with your emails in a way that keeps things more organized, you might want to adjust how emails open. For example: </p><pre>   Go to Tools &gt; Options (or Preferences) &gt; General.

This issue can happen if both accounts are using the same SMTP server configuration, and Thunderbird assumes they're sharing the same settings. </p><p>To resolve this and keep each account's SMTP username intact, here’s what you can do: 1. Create Separate SMTP Server Entries for Each Account: Thunderbird allows you to have different SMTP server settings for each account. Follow these steps to ensure that each email account has its own SMTP server configuration: Open Thunderbird and go to Menu &gt; Account Settings. </p><pre>   On the left side, under Account Settings, select Outgoing Server (SMTP).    You'll see a list of SMTP servers. It’s likely that both email accounts are using the same SMTP server. To create separate entries:        Click Add... to create a new SMTP server for your second account.        Enter the SMTP server details (server address, port, authentication method) for the second account.        Make sure to enter the correct username for this account.    Once the new SMTP server entry is added, select it for the second account by clicking OK. </pre> <p>Now each email account will have its own SMTP configuration, preventing the usernames from overriding each other. 2. Assign the Correct SMTP Server to Each Account: After creating separate SMTP entries for each account, you need to make sure that each account uses the right one: </p><p>In Account Settings, select the first email account. </p><pre>   Under the Outgoing Server (SMTP) section, make sure that the correct SMTP server is selected for this account.    Repeat for the second account, ensuring that the second SMTP server (which you created) is selected. </pre> <p>3. Passwords and Password Manager Settings: </p><p>As for not saving the passwords, Thunderbird has a password manager to store login credentials for both incoming (IMAP/POP) and outgoing (SMTP) mail. If you don’t want Thunderbird to save the passwords automatically, you can disable this option: </p><pre>   Go to Menu &gt; Options/Preferences &gt; Privacy &amp; Security.    Scroll down to the Logins and Passwords section.    Uncheck Remember passwords for sites.    If you don't want Thunderbird to prompt for a password every time, you could manually enter it when needed, but this setting will prevent it from saving passwords. </pre> <p>4. Testing the Setup: </p><p>After you've separated the SMTP servers and assigned them to the appropriate accounts: </p><pre>   Send a test email from each account to verify that the correct username is being used for SMTP and that both accounts can send emails independently.    Check the Sent folder in both accounts to confirm the proper outgoing configuration. </pre> <p>By following these steps, Thunderbird will correctly handle separate SMTP settings for each account, and the usernames should no longer interfere with each other. </p><p>Let me know if you run into any further issues! </p>",Sakura,false,1,0

Thunderbird doesn't tell you those settings are being <i>shared</i> across multiple accounts nor gives you the option to create new separate outgoing server settings specific to the new account during the account setup process, and hence you end up changing the outgoing server settings for all the accounts sharing those settings every time you change the settings for one of the accounts… </p><p>You may create and manage multiple outgoing server settings for the same server, but cannot do it from within the main account settings.

Your old emails and files are missing in Thunderbird after reinstalling your OS. </pre> <p>Let's tackle them one by one. Issue 1: ""400 ... malformed"" Error When Adding the Second Gmail Account </p><p>This error typically means that Thunderbird is struggling with Google’s OAuth authentication. Try the following: </p><p>✅ Step 1: Enable IMAP for the account </p><pre>   Log in to your Gmail via a web browser.    Go to Settings (⚙) &gt; See all settings &gt; Forwarding and POP/IMAP.    Ensure IMAP is enabled. </pre> <p>✅ Step 2: Check Less Secure App Access (or Use App Passwords) </p><pre>   Go to Google Security Settings.    If 2-Step Verification is enabled, generate an App Password for Thunderbird and use it instead of your regular password.    If 2-Step Verification is off, try enabling ""Less secure apps access"" (Google has removed this option for many accounts, so App Passwords are preferred). </pre> <p>✅ Step 3: Remove Any Broken Gmail Tokens in Thunderbird </p><pre>   In Thunderbird, go to Preferences (or Options) &gt; Privacy &amp; Security.    Scroll down to Saved Passwords &gt; Remove Saved Logins for the failing Gmail account.    Restart Thunderbird and try adding the account again. </pre> <p>✅ Step 4: Manually Add the Account in Thunderbird </p><pre>   Go to: File &gt; New &gt; Existing Mail Account.    Enter your details (email and password).    Manually enter IMAP/SMTP settings if automatic setup fails:        IMAP Server: <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> | Port: 993 | SSL: SSL/TLS | Authentication: OAuth2        SMTP Server: <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> | Port: 465 or 587 | SSL: SSL/TLS | Authentication: OAuth2 </pre> <p>Issue 2: Missing Old Emails and Files After OS Reinstallation </p><p>Thunderbird stores emails locally in a profile folder. If you didn’t back up your old profile, the emails might be lost unless they were stored on the Gmail server (IMAP). </p><p>✅ Step 1: Check If Your Emails Are Still on Gmail </p><pre>   Log in to your Gmail account via a web browser and see if your old emails are still there.    If they are, they will resync once IMAP is set up correctly. </pre> <p>✅ Step 2: Restore the Old Thunderbird Profile (if backed up) </p><pre>   Find your old profile backup (look for a folder named xxxxxxxx.default).    Locate Thunderbird's current profile folder:        Windows: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\        Linux: ~/.thunderbird/    Replace the new profile with the old one (after backing up the new one). </pre> <p>✅ Step 3: Check Thunderbird Import Options </p><pre>   If you backed up your profile, but importing fails, try using the Thunderbird import tool:        Tools &gt; Import &gt; Import from another Thunderbird installation        Try selecting the backup file manually. </pre> <p>Final Thoughts </p><pre>   If one Gmail account works and the other doesn’t, the problem is likely authentication-related (OAuth, App Passwords, or IMAP settings).    If old emails are missing, check if they were stored locally or if they still exist on Gmail.    If you backed up your Thunderbird profile, manually restore it to recover old emails. </pre> <p>Let me know if you need more details! 🚀With regards Sakura </p>",Sakura,false,0,0
