Start by right clicking the folder, selecting properties and then repair to rebuild the index of the mail.  If everything disappears that will explain the missing mail when you click on the entry in the list.  The next issue is trying to determine where the files have gone, or their contents. </p><p>The causes of this are usually file corruption or an antivirus product ""quarantining"" the entire folder because it has detected some nasty 10 years after it was relevant. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It will be treated according to your settings the same as if it was a message, i.e. moved to <i>Bin/Trash</i>, not deleted immediately, if those are your settings for deleting messages. </p><p>If this is being treated as a special folder by Thunderbird, you should make it a normal folder first, though. Do both folders have the same icon in Thunderbird? </p><p>Is this an IMAP account you access from other applications or devices? Apple Mail calls the folder <b>Archive</b>, whereas Thunderbird calls it <b>Archives</b> by default, although you may configure it to use any other folder you want for that purpose. Something like that could explain why you have both folders. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

After each download, move the messages out of <i>Inbox</i> in Thunderbird, then compact the folder, to make room for the next chunk. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
