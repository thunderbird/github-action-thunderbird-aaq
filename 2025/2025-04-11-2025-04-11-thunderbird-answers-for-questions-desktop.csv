My ISP has had an expired site certificate for a couple of years now, I used to be able to store it permanently. Thunderbird decided at some point that permanently actually means every other day or so but would create an annoying popup to tell you that. A few releases ago, the annoying popup got replace by a silly little window that only stays active for a few seconds and if you don't see it and click on it, you had to restart Thunderbird until you were quick enough to hit it. I guess this ""feature"" is gone completely and I now have to add it manually in the Manage Certificates section that took me a quarter hour to even find.

Before trying it, I re-exported my profile folder because I'm waiting on my ISP to call back and I have little doubt they are going to screw something up (did last time, took a week of mind numbing googling to fix what they did). As it started to export, incoming email started working, I mean like WHILE it was copying to a jump drive. I did nothing but open the Profile folder, right click on it, copy and paste to the jump drive. It download every bit of what I can see is sitting on the server through webmail. I haven't been able to send email since Apr 10 from my desktop. I'm pretty sure it's that certificate and I'm also sure that they aren't going to fix it.

It did not solve my problem, but oddly enough, when I opened my email this morning, the problem no longer existed. It appears that Thunderbird is self-healing. As for your question re. why I'm not using v.115, sometimes (actually quite often) newer is not better. Over the years, I've tried the newer versions and in my opinion, they're more complicated and absolute overkill for what I need or want. Whoever thought that a Check Engine light was better than an oil pressure gauge and a voltmeter? I should also note that I'm using the same T-Bird version on my Windows 10 computer, and it still works for me. I've also just acquired a full gaming Windows 11 computer (haven't even turned it on yet), and I plan to migrate the same version of T-Bird to it.
