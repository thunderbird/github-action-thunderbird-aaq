My ISP has had an expired site certificate for a couple of years now, I used to be able to store it permanently. Thunderbird decided at some point that permanently actually means every other day or so but would create an annoying popup to tell you that. A few releases ago, the annoying popup got replace by a silly little window that only stays active for a few seconds and if you don't see it and click on it, you had to restart Thunderbird until you were quick enough to hit it. I guess this ""feature"" is gone completely and I now have to add it manually in the Manage Certificates section that took me a quarter hour to even find. Thanks, Mozilla for making life increasingly stupid and wasting hours and hours of users' time and sanity. </p>",cable198,false,0,0
