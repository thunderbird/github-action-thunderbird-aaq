REALLY FRUSTRATING when you are migrating from Windows to Linux and Thunderbird is way out of date!  No wonder people don't like migrating to Linux.  You make it truly painful!  Documentation/website for Thunderbird states that flatpak always installs latest version?  RIGHT, what a load of BS. </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,1783939;,jibunnokage
