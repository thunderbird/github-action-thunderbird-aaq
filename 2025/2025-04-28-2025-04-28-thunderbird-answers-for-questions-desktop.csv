That is for security in case the zip file falls into unfriendly hands. If there are saved passwords, thunderbird is using them. if you are receiving error messages, it may be that the password is wrong or the settings are wrong. On your request, you can manually extract the passwords with these steps:: - setting&gt;privacy&amp;security - click savedpasswords and then showpasswords  - copy the passwords for your backup\ - then, highlight the rows that apply to that account and delete them That clears the passwords, so when you next retrieve messages, the account should prompt for password and you can enter it. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You can view and respond to messages from phone, but your sent messages will remain on phone if using POP there, and not visible on PC. Likewise, you will not see messages on phone that were sent from desktop. Also, both phone and desktop will be able to view incoming messages only when the other device has not deleted them. Consider, you're reading from the same source, so if you delete from phone when downloading, it won't be visible on desktop. If you want both to be in sync, the only solution is to use IMAP for both. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
