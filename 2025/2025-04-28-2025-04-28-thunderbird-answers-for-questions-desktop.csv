Later, instead of removing the account, I created a new profile and tried to set up the account again. I got the OAuth2 popup at the initial setup, but then I received this error: ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" After that, I deleted the account, tried setting it up again in the same profile, and also created another new profile and tried, but during the initial setup, I always get the same above error.

I have three POP3 email accounts that I access through Thunderbird, and all are missing. </blockquote> <p>This is typical after a power failure or a PC or a Thunderbird crash. The central prefs.js file in the profile gets damaged and is renamed by TB to <strong>prefs-x.js</strong> or <strong>invalidprefs.js</strong>, while TB creates a new virgin prefs.js file of a size of 6 to 7 kB which doesn't contain any account informations. This explains that TB on startup asks to set up ""your existing email address"". I have seen this many times in Thunderbird forums, it is a ""classic"" incident, but I have never seen TB create a new profil when this happens.  The easiest solution would be to <strong>copy the prefs.js file from a recent profile backup and to replace the virgin prefs.js file.</strong> In very rare cases you can rename a prefs-1.js file in prefs.js and solve the problem. But most times the prefs.js file is really corrupted and cannot be repaired. </p><p>Unfortunately you have already attempted several actions to retrieve your accounts, and one of this actions seems to be the creation of a new profile (first image). These actions make it very difficult for a helper to recover your old working profile without having a sight your desktop screen. </p><p>As a first attempt without guarantee  I propose to start the Thunderbird ""profile manager""  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_start-the-profile-manager-when-thunderbird-is-closed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_start-the-profile-manager-when-thunderbird-is-closed</a> then select your old profile (m87yt764) ""default-release"" and click on ""Start Thunderbird"". There might be a problem that the profile manager will display two profiles ""default-release"" since obviously you have created a new profile which has been given automatically the same name ""default-release"". If you don't know which one to select and open just take the upper one. If this doesn't bring back your old profile quit TB, launch the profile manager again and this time select the other profil.  </p><p>I'm not very optimistic that these tests will retrieve your old profile since you already have fiddled around in it. Probably we will need many screen shots with the contents of those profiles and the profiles.ini file. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

I haven't made any changes other than to select which profile is default. Prior to this issue, I have never been in the troubleshoot section. ""Default-release"" was the default profile when I first viewed that page. I switched it to the other with no results. I've also switched it back with no results. </p><p>So to be clear, I have not made any changes other than copying the Mail and Imapmail folders from the ""release-default"" into the ""default"" profile. </p><p>From your response, I see that ""default release"" was the original.

The ""prefs-63"" file is from 2020, and they go down from there, all the way to ""prefs-1"", all from 2020. </p><p>For background, I was using TB until Godaddy decided to drop email hosting and move to Outlook, which initially was web-based only, but later supported POP3.

BTW the results of your search for prefs.js show that the prefs.js files in both Thunderbird profiles have sizes between 5 and 7 kB which confirms my diagnostic of a corrupted prefs.js file as the cause of the loss of the account parameters. </p><p>Since the Mail and Imapmail folders are still present in the <strong>default-release</strong> profile I propose to continue to work with this profile.  Start TB in your default-release profile, set up a POP account for your email address ""<a href=""http://fightsb762.com"" rel=""nofollow"">fightsb762.com</a>"" and quit TB. Go to your default-release profile folder &gt; Mail:  next to ""<a href=""http://mail.fightsb762.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.fightsb762.com</a>"" you should see a new account folder named ""mail.fightsb762<strong>-1.</strong>com"" (at least that's what I'm hoping for).
