The problems may be my fault since I've grown older, I've tended (believed) using <em>new</em> versions of software present my mind a BIGGER challenge than using the older software/version I have been successfully using?  I'm still using Version115.10.1 </p><p>After our ISP chose to start using Zimbra Oct. 7, 2025 and their <em>tech support</em> could not assist me in getting TB working the had me remove POP3 settings for TB and change to IMAP with their software. </p><p>FINALLY someone helped me get TB working with IMAP.  For 3 days grrr.  Now the ISP says I need to use their web mail, Zimbra. </p><p>So might downloading the current TB version and somehow get the In box, all the folder contnets etc. over - into the new TB help? </p><p>I was going to backup everything tonight, now I have little to NO hope, without help! </p><p>THANKS &amp; remain WELL plus be <strong>SAFE!</strong> </p><p>Robin </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",dulca
