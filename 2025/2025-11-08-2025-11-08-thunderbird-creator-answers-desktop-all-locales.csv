The restore went smoothly, and I used Thunderbird without any problems during my trip. Upon my return, I had problems with system updates (Ubuntu 22.04). The message said that I could not perform a full update but had to choose a partial update, and after doing so, several problems began: none of the installed software worked anymore... After some very complicated attempts, which were difficult for me as an elderly and basic user, I managed to restore most of the software until I was able to update to version 24.04.03, and everything started working fine again except for Thunderbird. I uninstalled and reinstalled it from 'Software', and now it works, but the various accounts are stuck at six months ago. I tried doing the opposite: backing up from my laptop and, via the cloud, downloading it to my PC. I attempted to restore it by following various instructions found online, but without success. I transferred both the backup, made with the ImportExportTools NG extension downloaded from add-ons, and the profile export, but they were not recognised by Thunderbird. Finally, I copied the profile to the .thunderbird folder in Home (I have a vague and distant memory of having solved it this way in the past, but the strange thing is that Thunderbird still sees the situation from six months ago...
