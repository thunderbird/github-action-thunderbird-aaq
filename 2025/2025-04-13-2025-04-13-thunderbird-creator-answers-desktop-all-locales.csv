For some reason, it got to where Thunderbird wouldn't allow me to send out emails.  It would retrieve them, but I couldn't send out.  I tried fixing it to the the limit of my knowledge of these matters - and I could have made things worse - but nothing worked.  Finally, I deleted what I thought was the entire Thunderbird program and downloaded new / reinstalled.  Unfortunately, I still have the same issue.  Any advice?  Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1725353;,dnpcorp
