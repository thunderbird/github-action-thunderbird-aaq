I checked and Google does not block the transfer nor are there any problems with quotas (I am Google Wokspace Administrator). From Google support, they confirm to me that there are no blocks and the operation should go smoothly. They suggest that I contact Thunderbird support. Since <em>transferring messages from one account to another goes smoothly when they have no attachment or when the attachment is less than 5MB in size</em>, I wonder if there is some setting that limits this activity in Thunderbird. </p>",l.amodei,false,0,0
