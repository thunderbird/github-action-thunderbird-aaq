I have been using this service for a number of years without any trouble and have questioned Telstra and they have said that the problem is related to Thunderbird. It would be nice to talk to somebody from your organization that can help. Sincerely Graeme Piera </blockquote> <p>Everyone finds it extremely difficult to try and support folk that simply do not include any diagnostic information in their request.  I have issued such a request for your original topic.  You have posted twice and even now it is still not clear what your issue is. My personal interactions with Telstra support have made it clear I would get better advice behind the school toilets among the kids smoking.  They issue blame where there is none and rarely blame the more likely problem software like Antivirus, VPN and Firewall or helpful products for corrupting settings like CCleaner and other system optimization software. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1
