Help! </blockquote> <p>The issue is rarely one with Thunderbird.  It does happen,  be it is extremely rare.  Post update interruptions are almost always related to antivurs products and their associated software firewalls.  This is exacerbated for ATT customers by the fact that the user password is NOT used in the email client, but a mailkey.  Unfortunately the prompt that comes up asks for a password, as that is what the mailkey is,  so often folks replace a previously working mailkey with the user password they use on the ATT web site. That is designed to fail by the way ATT have implemented their email. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If your server is almost full then it cannot receive mail until you delete some old stuff off server.  Note:  an IMAP account would be effected as well as a Pop account, but the action is not the same. In Thunderbird, you would need to select small batches of emails &gt; right click on highlighted emails and use 'COPY TO' and choose a suitably named folder in 'Local Folders' account. check you have good copies. After copying a load of important or older emails into 'Local Folders' account you can then delete them from the imap folder. Then right click on imap folder and select 'compact' to clean up all the old traces. Finally empty the imap Trash folder. This should release some space on server. </p><p>If you use POP and Gmail: Gmail can only delete emails if they have been put into the Gmail Trash folder. Pop accounts cannot put deleted emails in the server Trash folder as there is no access/no synchronisation of folders. </p><p>Gmail can become a pain if they detect you are using POP and are choosing to keep emails on the server. They start to restrict downloads forcing the user to get fed up and go back to using the webmail account. The fix is simple. Access the gmail webmail account via a browser and look in the 'All Mail' folder. Any email that has no 'label' is easilly seen and means its been 'archived' by gmail.  Basically - Delete a load of old emails.  Pop accounts are not effected because you have already downloaded emails to your computer. </p><p>Please note: if you do use Gmail - do you also use Googe Photos to store images&nbsp;?

Can you find out which files underneath C:\notes\Thunderbird are being updated? </p><p>As per your screenshot your 'Thunderbird b115' profile doesn't have a 'Local Directory'. That means you do backup a whole lot of data you don't have to, primarily cache data.

My original installation is on a Windows 10 computer and I'm trying to get Thunderbird set up on Windows 11 on another machine, hopefully mirroring what's on my Windows 10 installation. </p><p>I did follow the steps to get to the Profiles folder and went up 3 levels to /Roaming, shutdown Thunderbird, verified that it was not running in Task Manager and copied the Thunderbird folder at that level on the Windows 10 machine.  </p><p>Having completed that step I loaded Thunderbird onto the new Windows 11 computer. I suspended the installation when it asked me to create an account , shut down Thunderbird and verified it was not running in Task Manager on the Win 11 machine. When I navigated to C:/Windows/Users/Lou/AppData/Roaming I found a thunderbird folder, which is not the same as Thunderbird. You cannot overlay that folder with a lower case ""t"" with the one captured on my USB drive that has a capital ""T'. I tried renaming the lower case folder with the proper uppercase letter and when I copied the data into it I found duplications of imapmail and default folders in the Profiles folder. The filters were present in one of the imapmail fiolders, but Thunderbird wasn't recognizing that entry. I also tried uninstalling  and reinstallingThunderbird from the Windows 11 machine and just copying into /Roamimng/Thunderbird with the same result. </p><p>So, I havce a history of over 40 years experience in the computer support field, in which I've guided numerous clients through arcane procedures.

I have a few questions to help get to the bottom of your issue.. </p><p>1. When you opened Thunderbird and said ""the interface was broken, menus were blank, so no ability to look at anything., and error message inferring there was a menu config issue was all that was shown"", was it just menus and empty folders? or were the actual accounts missing as well? </p> <ul><li> If the accounts were still there, then this should not indicate the wrong profile location was being used. </li><li> If the accounts were however missing and needed to be re-setup (you did this anyways since you re-installed the snap), then it means the incorrect location for the profile was being used. And if the incorrect profile is being used.. I wonder if your initial install of Thunderbird (that was working before yesterday) was installed before <a href=""https://github.com/ubuntu/thunderbird/pull/40"" rel=""nofollow"">we changed the snap to use profile in `~/.thunderbird` instead of `~/snap/thunderbird/common/.thunderbird`</a>. This change was made back in February so if you had the Thunderbird snap installed before this change and hadn't opened Thunderbird since (or had automatic snap updates turned off), and then opened Thunderbird yesterday and it updated to a version that uses the new `~/.thunderbird` profile directory, then perhaps it would cause profile issues. </li></ul> <p>2.

At the release of Ubuntu 24.04 (until this February), the Thunderbird snap used a profile in `~/snap/thunderbird/common/.thunderbird`. Currently the profile the snap should use is `~/.thunderbird`.

If you have an existing ~/.thunderbird folder already when you re-install the thunderbird snap, then it will use this profile.

I just want to point out that these snapshots of your profile are only created if you deliberately generate them (with `snap save thunderbird' or if you remove the snap) and then they are only stored in this root folder for 30 days. Still I understand that you may want to move these. The backups generated will (by default) go to this location and I'm not sure if you can change that without modifying snapd itself. Modifying profiles.ini will not affect the location of the snapshot.  </p><p>As far as moving these zip files, you can simply move or copy the snapshot to somewhere in your $HOME folder if you like, change the ownership from root to your user, unpack it, and poke around: $ sudo cp /var/lib/snapd/snapshots/14_thunderbird_128.11.0esr-1_735.zip ~/whatever-directory $ sudo chown heather:heather ~/whatever-directory/14_thunderbird_128.11.0esr-1_735.zip $ unzip 14_thunderbird_128.11.0esr-1_735.zip </p><p>I'm happy to help and let me know if you have any other questions&nbsp;:) </p>",linuxflower,false,0,0
