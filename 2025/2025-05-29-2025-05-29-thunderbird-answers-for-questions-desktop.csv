No other settings have changed.  Anyone else having this issue?   </blockquote> <p>Probably a lot of folks with Third party antivirus solutions.  The Norton product is historically  particularly good at messing up mail post an update.  My normal recommendation is to remove any non windows defender security package and see if that helps. </p> <blockquote> If this cannot be corrected, I cannot continue using Thunderbird. Help! </blockquote> <p>The issue is rarely one with Thunderbird.  It does happen,  be it is extremely rare.  Post update interruptions are almost always related to antivurs products and their associated software firewalls.  This is exacerbated for ATT customers by the fact that the user password is NOT used in the email client, but a mailkey.  Unfortunately the prompt that comes up asks for a password, as that is what the mailkey is,  so often folks replace a previously working mailkey with the user password they use on the ATT web site. That is designed to fail by the way ATT have implemented their email. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have a few questions to help get to the bottom of your issue.. </p><p>1. When you opened Thunderbird and said ""the interface was broken, menus were blank, so no ability to look at anything., and error message inferring there was a menu config issue was all that was shown"", was it just menus and empty folders? or were the actual accounts missing as well? </p> <ul><li> If the accounts were still there, then this should not indicate the wrong profile location was being used. </li><li> If the accounts were however missing and needed to be re-setup (you did this anyways since you re-installed the snap), then it means the incorrect location for the profile was being used. And if the incorrect profile is being used.. I wonder if your initial install of Thunderbird (that was working before yesterday) was installed before <a href=""https://github.com/ubuntu/thunderbird/pull/40"" rel=""nofollow"">we changed the snap to use profile in `~/.thunderbird` instead of `~/snap/thunderbird/common/.thunderbird`</a>. This change was made back in February so if you had the Thunderbird snap installed before this change and hadn't opened Thunderbird since (or had automatic snap updates turned off), and then opened Thunderbird yesterday and it updated to a version that uses the new `~/.thunderbird` profile directory, then perhaps it would cause profile issues. </li></ul> <p>2.

All I was presented with was a window ( no meaningful contents, other than an error message),.. with pull down menus at the top,.. but no commands within, just blank spaces.. there were no folders displayed,.. the window was just blank,.. other than a single error message that a menu was not working,.. so no input or control of anything. Now.. AFAIK,.. when I went to bed the previous night,.. all was fine,.. what happened over night I do not know. Having looked at my ~/.thunderbird structure,.. nothing has been updated this year (2025),.. inferring activity is happening somewhere else... And to clarify,.. I <strong>removed</strong> snap Thunderbird and reinstalled <strong>local App</strong> thunderbird,.. 'assuming' I would/ could use my local .thunderbird structure, ( not realising this was not case ). I have been using thunderbird snap since a clean install of 24.04 in May last year,... when snap Thunderbird installed and started up I seem to recall,.. it just found everything,.. and just worked,... so never gave it a second thought as to where it was actually storing folders and emails. ( bad mistake) Imported folders were NOT from a recent export,.. I 'assumed' this was where folders were being stored,... but looking at file dates this is not the case... as it all dates back to probably pre May 2024 install,..

At the release of Ubuntu 24.04 (until this February), the Thunderbird snap used a profile in `~/snap/thunderbird/common/.thunderbird`. Currently the profile the snap should use is `~/.thunderbird`. Wherever the profile is that had the local folders is where you should find them still, so check both places and lmk what you find. </p><p>For example, on my system where I'm running the snap, I have `/home/heather/.thunderbird/i0873qnd.default/Mail/Local Folders`. If I `snap remove thunderbird`, this Local Folders path is still there. If I re-install the snap, then it uses this same profile and sees the Local Folders again. </p><p>Also no `/var/lib/snapd/snaps/thunderbird_735.snap` will not have your local folders.
