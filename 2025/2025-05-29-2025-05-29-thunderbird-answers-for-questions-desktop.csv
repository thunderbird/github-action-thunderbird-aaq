No other settings have changed.  Anyone else having this issue?   </blockquote> <p>Probably a lot of folks with Third party antivirus solutions.  The Norton product is historically  particularly good at messing up mail post an update.  My normal recommendation is to remove any non windows defender security package and see if that helps. </p> <blockquote> If this cannot be corrected, I cannot continue using Thunderbird. Help! </blockquote> <p>The issue is rarely one with Thunderbird.  It does happen,  be it is extremely rare.  Post update interruptions are almost always related to antivurs products and their associated software firewalls.  This is exacerbated for ATT customers by the fact that the user password is NOT used in the email client, but a mailkey.  Unfortunately the prompt that comes up asks for a password, as that is what the mailkey is,  so often folks replace a previously working mailkey with the user password they use on the ATT web site. That is designed to fail by the way ATT have implemented their email. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In Thunderbird, you would need to select small batches of emails &gt; right click on highlighted emails and use 'COPY TO' and choose a suitably named folder in 'Local Folders' account. check you have good copies. After copying a load of important or older emails into 'Local Folders' account you can then delete them from the imap folder.

You would not believe how many people paste the copied Thunderbird into the current Thunderbird and not into the 'Roaming' folder OR if they assumed you meant copy all the contents of the Thunderbird folder in it's entirely, then they paste all of them into the current Thunderbird folder and end up with tons of duplicates and loads of issues and the OS constantly asking if it's ok to overwrite - it can cause no end of confusion. </p><p>I would not have had people using the 'back in file manager' because they lose track of where they are supposed to be.  In that situation it's best to access the usb and 'copy' the 'Thunderbird' folder first. Then access the the profile folder. </p><p>Some people find locating the Thunderbird folder via Thunderbird itself easy enough, but then forget to exit Thunderbird.  </p><p>Sometimes people say they followed the instructions, but then you discover they did not do exactly as advised in the first place. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I wonder if your initial install of Thunderbird (that was working before yesterday) was installed before <a href=""https://github.com/ubuntu/thunderbird/pull/40"" rel=""nofollow"">we changed the snap to use profile in `~/.thunderbird` instead of `~/snap/thunderbird/common/.thunderbird`</a>. This change was made back in February so if you had the Thunderbird snap installed before this change and hadn't opened Thunderbird since (or had automatic snap updates turned off), and then opened Thunderbird yesterday and it updated to a version that uses the new `~/.thunderbird` profile directory, then perhaps it would cause profile issues. </li></ul> <p>2.

Still I understand that you may want to move these. The backups generated will (by default) go to this location and I'm not sure if you can change that without modifying snapd itself. Modifying profiles.ini will not affect the location of the snapshot.  </p><p>As far as moving these zip files, you can simply move or copy the snapshot to somewhere in your $HOME folder if you like, change the ownership from root to your user, unpack it, and poke around: $ sudo cp /var/lib/snapd/snapshots/14_thunderbird_128.11.0esr-1_735.zip ~/whatever-directory $ sudo chown heather:heather ~/whatever-directory/14_thunderbird_128.11.0esr-1_735.zip $ unzip 14_thunderbird_128.11.0esr-1_735.zip </p><p>I'm happy to help and let me know if you have any other questions&nbsp;:) </p>",linuxflower,false,0,0

( as expected with 12G Mbox ),.. ran snap run thunderbird... and voila,.. everything back the way I left some nights ago... have done an apt remove thunderbird to remove the .deb install.. made sure my docking menu icon brings up snap install.... made another 'proper' backup... so ,.. one last question,.. when things 'died' a few days ago,.. thunderbird menu errors etc blank window ( other than error message )... How do/should I remove snap thunderbird interface,.. and restore snap interface,.. ie without removing app data...  ( although this backup was my saviour ) why did the App remove this? and yes make a backup before removal.. could the removal script at least let me/users know, give users some prompts,.. messages to say what it is doing.. as you can appreciate, I waited a long time during the initial removal with no user feedback, ( but app removal failed, not the end of the world, 12G Mbox),.. previous experience has told me to let the system get on 'with it' and not ctrl-C out,... which did cross my mind. </p><p>But again Heather, ... a really <strong>BIG</strong> <strong>thankyou</strong> for taking the time to give me some guidelines... as I was  beginning to despair when I realised the last 18months of emails had gone... and my searches of file structure showed up nothing... </p>",diyhouse,false,0,0

And if you <strong>don't</strong> want a snapshot to be created when you remove a snap, there's a ""--purge"" option that also users wouldn't just know about.

I can now get Thunderbird to download my backlog of email. The only obvious difference I see between the two connections is that typically the Turbo 3 download speed runs at maybe 10 to 15 Mbps. However, my phone connection commonly runs at 20 t0 50 Mbps. </p><p>It doesn't seem to me that email should require a great deal of speed to connect and work properly. At least it never seemed to be an issue with a slow DSL connection years ago. Any suggestions as to what I'm overlooking here? </p>",csBlackburn,false,0,0

You convinced me to once again look into my settings. But this time I went thru the portable AT&amp;T hotspot's settings with a fine tooth comb. I had a similar problem years ago with this device and had posted on the AT&amp;T forums for help but ended up finding the problem on my own. There I posted my findings and the fix hoping it might help someone else with the same problem. </p><p>But when I tried to return to the AT&amp;T forums to find the fix in my previous post, the forum has been taken down. Though I was sure the fix had something to do with the hotspot's settings. And once again I found a sort of ""hidden"" menu and an easy fix from there. And now I can again access my Yahoo email using Thunderbird with Win 10 and Win 7 machines using either of my two data plans. </p><p>Here's a couple of screen shots showing the details. </p><p><a href=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-06-01-12-47-59-539f49.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-06-01-12-47-59-539f49.png</a> Click ""Security"" then ""Security Level"".

Click ""Save &amp; Apply"" and try opening your email with Thunderbird! </p><p>I don't know if these settings are particular only to AT&amp;T products or if they are also found on portable hotspots, routers, modems, gateways, etc. from other ISPs. But why would AT&amp;T not allow emails by default on this Turbo 3 hotspot? Like someone using it wouldn't want to access their emails with a third-party app? </p><p>Anyways this seems to have fixed the problem. And I think I got 'er whupped if she don't jump!
