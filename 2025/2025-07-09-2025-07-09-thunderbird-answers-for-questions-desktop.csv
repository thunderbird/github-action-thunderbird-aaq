I suggest checking within profile to see if there are entries that can be removed, such as any 'nstmp files'.  I suggest NOT zipping the backups unless you do this when Thunderbird is not running. I state that because attempts to import/restore zipped files is a road of failures. If the account is Gmail, I suggest NOT subscribing to AllMail or Import folders, as those are duplicates of other folders and increase disk space and computer resources to send and receive mail. If you want to reduce backup storage space, just exit thunderbird, delete the message folders prior to the backup. On a restore, THunderbird automatically reconstructs them.  My personal approach is periodically purging unneeded messages. That does a lot to keep the folders smaller. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The addressbook only ensures that the messages are not immediately marked as spam. You might check your account online to see if the messages are being flagged prior to being read by Thunderbird. The junk filter needs to be actively monitored and taught, not just for spam, but also for good messages.

Unfortunately, it does little to reconcile me to Thunderbird. ""Unmarking"" junk messages would work for me, if I hadn't noticed that actually, it <em>doesn't</em> learn; messages specifically designated as not junk do indeed get moved to the incoming folder, but often the application will happily ignore the directive when another email arrives from the same source at a later date. As I have a number of email accounts which I like being able to consult on one single application, this strongly suggests that I am expected to play games of whack-a-mole far into the future. I guess it's time to dig out Microsoft Outlook again. I liked Thunderbird, but an inability to learn something as basic as what not to treat as spam is a deal-breaker... </p>",Akominatus,false,0,0
