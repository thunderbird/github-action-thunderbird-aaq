I suggest checking within profile to see if there are entries that can be removed, such as any 'nstmp files'.  I suggest NOT zipping the backups unless you do this when Thunderbird is not running. I state that because attempts to import/restore zipped files is a road of failures. If the account is Gmail, I suggest NOT subscribing to AllMail or Import folders, as those are duplicates of other folders and increase disk space and computer resources to send and receive mail. If you want to reduce backup storage space, just exit thunderbird, delete the message folders prior to the backup. On a restore, THunderbird automatically reconstructs them.  My personal approach is periodically purging unneeded messages. That does a lot to keep the folders smaller. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The addressbook only ensures that the messages are not immediately marked as spam. You might check your account online to see if the messages are being flagged prior to being read by Thunderbird.

Unfortunately, it does little to reconcile me to Thunderbird. ""Unmarking"" junk messages would work for me, if I hadn't noticed that actually, it <em>doesn't</em> learn; messages specifically designated as not junk do indeed get moved to the incoming folder, but often the application will happily ignore the directive when another email arrives from the same source at a later date. As I have a number of email accounts which I like being able to consult on one single application, this strongly suggests that I am expected to play games of whack-a-mole far into the future. I guess it's time to dig out Microsoft Outlook again. I liked Thunderbird, but an inability to learn something as basic as what not to treat as spam is a deal-breaker... </p>",Akominatus,false,0,0

To change from IMAP to pop3 is not something there that you actually can change suddenly. </p><p>Most of the pc users do like to use both of them because they are all together oke with using IMAP and also POP3 and you can choose it in the setup of a new Thunderbird account that you wish to install to. Most human prefer to use IMAP hence because they do like that for the use of more functionality s to use it with the internet together. </p><p>Using things like devices or fridges with options to go on the internet can cause more accident s and having more issue s like having a bot suddenly there with some malware that came up there in the inbox there. But most of the user s of IMAP are normally satisfied. </p><p>IMAP stands for ''<em>mail access protocol</em> You can move the new emails to sub maps yes that. And if you like to login from a webbrowser then choose IMAP. </p><p>POP3 stands for <em>post office protocol</em>. Storing up emails if they have a amount from more then 15 Gb&nbsp;? choose pop3. Do you have a satellite connection or do you have a high cost connection please do use pop 3. </p><p>Changing from IMAP to POP3 on that recent account the option is not there on that pc machine automatically it is not there, that function ain’t there. You have delete that recent account to a get that new version , but do not delete the profile map sub map and thunderbird maps from that machine pc. In that new Thunderbird installation you can choose for that IMap or POP3 option to work again with. </p><p>POP3 using can profit from multiple benefits especially when the user has only has to work or do own and do not have a device more the 1 and not 3 or 5 of them pc machines. POP3 has device limitations yes ,Oke. </p><p>Other goods things about having pop3 on the Thunderbird software is that is it will not have a heavy load for that email server with files that run up big in file sending. </p><p><br> </p><p>Greetings googlethunderbird. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

However, your question does raise an important scenario: If I wanted to drag a folder into a folder that is buried deep in a list of subfolders of a parent folder that is closed, then the ideal behavior would be that if I hover over the closed folder (not less than 2 seconds) it should then open, and so on down the line. But if you simply drag &amp; drop a folder into a closed one then that's where it should go, and stay closed. But having it open instantly without the 2-second hover period is catastrophic. Here's why this is so important for me: I have a top level folder called ORDERS. Under it I have: Orders A-C Orders D-F Orders H-J Orders K-M etc, etc. And under each of these is another group of folders by customer names (some 70 to 80 under each letter group).This tree exists because without it I would have to scroll endlessly to arrive at the desired target subfolder to drop a particular message (or order folder) into. And it is a Huge pain when the long subfolder tree instantly opens upon drag release, forcing me to endlessly scroll again, or jump to the top to close the trees again to drag the next folder to its destination. This never used to happen in the past. Of course I also use Axel Grude's QuickFolders app, which is a godsend. </p>",SadFirefoxUser,false,0,0

E Proprio questo che non capisco, se vede le email vuol dire che la copia e stata eseguita correttamente e  il percorso degli archivi inserito nel file profiles e corretto  Il sistema operativo sul PC nuovo e Windows 22 24h2. Potrebbe essere che devo installare la stessa versione di Thunderbird che era presente sul vecchio PC ( era la versione 115.10.1) ora mi pare che siamo alla versione 140. I file che copiato erano tutti quelli contenuti nella %cartellautente%\Appdata\roaming\thunderbird. Inoltre per sicurezza  ho anche copiato la cartella sempre di Thunderbird presente in %cartellautente%\appdata\local </p><pre>La ringrazio nuovamente per l aiuto che potrà dare. </pre> <p>Fabrizio Fornasaro </p>",fabrizio.fornasaro,false,0,0

Tra la 115 e la 140 non dovrebbero esserci problemi, tant'è che le mail inizialmente vengono mostrate. </li></ul> <ul><li> secondo me il problema risiede nel protocollo usato. Probabilmente i tuoi account sono configurati con IMAP: questo protocollo prevede la costante sincronizzazione con il server. Se le email non sono più presenti sul server, per tener fede al protocollo IMAP, Thunderbird le cancella anche localmente. </li></ul> <p>Se l'ipotesi è fondata potresti risolvere in questo modo: - Copia nuovamente il vecchio profilo sopra il nuovo - Chiudi/spegni/stacca la connessione del computer ad Internet - Avvia Thunderbird - Se la posta è presenta, copiala o spostala in una o più sottocartelle sotto <strong>Cartelle Locali</strong>. - A questo punto dovresti poter ricollegare la rete </p>",@next,false,0,0
