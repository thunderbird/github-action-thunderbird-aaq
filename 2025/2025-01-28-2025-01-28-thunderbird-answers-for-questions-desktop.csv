Make sure you backup important data regularly!</em> </p><p>The current Thunderbird Beta is version 135.0b3 - added just for anyone who reads this and wants to know.  I'm running both an ESR and a Beta. Crtl+N does work as expected in both current ESR and also in current Beta. </p><p>Anyone who installed a ESR version auto gets updated by Thunderbird to the next ESR version and it does not auto update from 'ESR' to the 'Release' version.  </p><p>However, if you have other software auto updating programs on your computer then it may not understand the difference. It is strongly recommended you check your computer to see if the Software Update programs include Thunderbird. You need to stop any Updater Software from controlling Thunderbird and just let Thunderbird control it's own updates. If you have installed via the Windows Microsoft app store then it may be controlling the updates for apps. If you have installed an Anti-Virus product then it may also provide Updater Software and be controlling updates for installed programs. Maybe you have installed Updater Sofware to perform those tasks. Recently, I came across a user who did install correct ESR but it kept updating to the Release version - in that instance the user was on a MAC OS and eventrually discovered a JAMF program installed on MAC was the culprit. So, if you did not initially install the 'Release' version by accicent then you need to find out what is causing the auto update and stop it from performing it on Thunderbrd. </p><p>To stop using the 'Thunderbird Release' and use the 'Thunderbird ESR' Uninstall Thunderbird program.
