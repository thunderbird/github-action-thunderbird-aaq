COPY the files by name, but ignore the .msf entries  - for POP folders, click the mail\&lt;POP account&gt; and COPY the desired files, again ignoring .msf entries - for Local Folders, click the mail\Local Folders and do as above  - now that you have copied them, repeat all the above on the receiving PC </p><p>For addressses, you can copy the entire addressbook using above steps. they are abook.sqlite and history.sqlite. both go in the root folder and you would paste over the top of existing files.
