It runs, but there are messages missing, none of my mailboxes were there, so I assume none of my addresses as well. There were 4 messages in the IN box. There was 1 new msg that came in when I opened the program, and it properly brought over 3 from the old folder. There were 0 drafts, and I have a slew of them on my old app. It brought over a lot of sent msgs which might be okay, hard to sort them all out. Several of the messages were dated no more recently than 8-30. I use my computer every day, there are posts in here up until this morning. It brought over 0 archived, should be some. And in Junk it brought 213 over, but in the old app I have 1. In Trash it brought over 571 msgs, some of which may be correct it's hard to figure it all out. If I did something wrong, why didn't it affect Everything? I'm so dispirited and exhausted by now I'm thinking it might be easier to re-enter the contacts and mailboxes by hand!

But when I changed it to my email account name folder the settings does not stay in the my email accounts name folder it goes in the Local Folders and in the Sent. That's ok at least I have the Sent mail I just sent even though it does not go into the SentMail folder of my primary email account. Thanks so much for your time and efforts. Appreciate it. </p>",Bibb,false,0,0
