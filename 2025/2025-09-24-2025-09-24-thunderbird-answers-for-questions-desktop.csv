I presume you have an imap mail account - but do you download full copies of all emails or download just headers?  When you need to get copies of emails into the 'Local Folders' account, I suggest you always use 'Copy to' and not 'Move to' because if something goes wrong when moving stuff off the server you could lose emails, but if using Copy to' then you can always try again. Can you read your emails in Offline mode&nbsp;? If no then you have not got fully downloaded copies. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;: I have a suitable set of .MSF files (over 100, 000) synced to Dropbox.</strong> Files which have a <strong>.MSF</strong> extension. They are index files which typically contain headers, info on size and info on that folders various  column headers status etc.  They are not easy to read.  They do not contain any email content.  If you believed backing up .msf files is backing up emails then you are mistaken. </p><p>If you have downloaded full copies of emails then they are saved in mbox text files which do not have any extension.  I've attached simple example images below - any file with type 'FILE' is an mbox file containing emails. Any file with type MSF is an index file. If you see folders with a .sbd extension that means the folder may contain subfolders - more mbox files and index files. </p><p>re&nbsp;:<strong>Is it possible that for some reason Thunderbird does something to the files (for no apparent reason)? </strong> </p><p>Whenever you receive, send, delete or move anything, mark as read, tag, alter column header display etc etc or compact folders to remove all old data (anything moved or deleted) then files get updated. So in effect, many files get updated very frequently.  </p><p>If you use an imap account, those files may also get updated whenever there is a synchronisation with server.  </p><p>Dropbox synchronisation to Microsoft Account server is external to Thunderbird and not controlled by Thunderbird. It frequently synchronises especially if any file gets updated. </p><p>Dropbox can be useful especially if you want to use it to synchronise with another computer. But please remember, it's only useful if you have access to it via  password. If you get locked out for any reason you may find you locked out from anything on that server - it could be a real problem if you are relying on it. I would always advise you have a manual l backup to something that does not rely on the internet or access to a server. eg: an external disk drive. </p><p>Dropbox info: <a href=""https://help.dropbox.com/sync/check-sync-status"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.dropbox.com/sync/check-sync-status</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
