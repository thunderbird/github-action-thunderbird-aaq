I have a question about the appearance of a message when I open the message.  In the past, I always had the list of my contacts on the left side of my screen, aligned vertically, when I had an open message on my screen.  That is missing now.  I would like to restore that feature, and I cannot find a way to do that.  Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1779559;,cyanicka46
