Yet, one of my accounts now has an Archive folder that I cannot delete.  No option exists when right clicking the folder and I cannot drag it to the trash.  It has no emails in it, and never has.  Its possible its been there a while and I just didn't notice, bu AFAIK its new. </p><p>I have gone to Account Settings Copies &amp; Folders...and the ""Keep Message Archives in:""  is unchecked.  Further, I checked all accounts to see if one of those might be 'checked'...just with a folder specified in a different (wrong) account.  Not it. </p><p>I've restarted.

I have a question about the appearance of a message when I open the message.  In the past, I always had the list of my contacts on the left side of my screen, aligned vertically, when I had an open message on my screen.  That is missing now.  I would like to restore that feature, and I cannot find a way to do that.  Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",cyanicka46
