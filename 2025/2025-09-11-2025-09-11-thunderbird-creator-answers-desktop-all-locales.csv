Called Sitestar's tech support and they tried to fix the issue. Here is the first error message.  </p><p>Sending of the message failed. </p><p>An error occurred while sending mail: Unable to establish a secure link with Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://mail.sitestar.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.sitestar.net</a> using STARTTLS since it doesn't advertise that feature. Switch off STARTTLS for that server or contact your service provider. </p><p>Sitestar Tech support had me go to account settings, to outgoing server to edit and change the STARTTLS to SSL/TS port  and retry sending the test email. Then got this error message: </p><p>Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: H:RB [172.56.209.199] Connection refused due to abuse. Please contact your E-mail provider.. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. </p><p>Went back to set up and original error message still shows up and email can not be sent.  Any ideas how to fix this. I can still send email thru the sitestar website, but not from my laptop.  I think I used up all the Site star tech supports brain cells.  I use the latest thunderbird. We connect to the internet via a T-mobile tower thing. Windows 11 Thank you </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",Sunflowr
