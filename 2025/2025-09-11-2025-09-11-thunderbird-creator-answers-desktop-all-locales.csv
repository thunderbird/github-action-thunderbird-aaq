Called Sitestar's tech support and they tried to fix the issue. Here is the first error message.  </p><p>Sending of the message failed. </p><p>An error occurred while sending mail: Unable to establish a secure link with Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://mail.sitestar.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.sitestar.net</a> using STARTTLS since it doesn't advertise that feature. Switch off STARTTLS for that server or contact your service provider. </p><p>Sitestar Tech support had me go to account settings, to outgoing server to edit and change the STARTTLS to SSL/TS port  and retry sending the test email. Then got this error message: </p><p>Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: H:RB [172.56.209.199] Connection refused due to abuse. Please contact your E-mail provider.. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. </p><p>Went back to set up and original error message still shows up and email can not be sent.  Any ideas how to fix this. I can still send email thru the sitestar website, but not from my laptop.  I think I used up all the Site star tech supports brain cells.  I use the latest thunderbird.

It had been relatively trouble free until recently. </p><p>When a recent update occured it appeared that Thunderbird had vaporized my e-mails from 2023/24. I had/have numerous e-mails related to a lawsuit that is tremendously important to me. I read on Mozilla's site about a program alled Recoverit from Wondershare. It did not appear to work at all. Not too long after my Lenovo PC died. The techa at Memory Express could only see a single program on my hard drive when I took the hard drive to them for analysis.  I subsequently sent the drive to Secure Data  </p><pre>and they are sending it back to me. </pre> <p>In the meantime my replacement computer is an HP laptop. I purchased Windows 365 since they provided a technician to assist with setup. The tech could not get Thunderbird to work nor could they make Outlook work, MS blamed the server. The server guy says ir works, I have been without my e-mail for more than 6 weeks. </p><p>Can anyone help? </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",Daryllaz1
