But sometimes people compose emails and then delay the sending. Maybe the person was using offline at the time or had to stagger the sending due to server limits.  </p><p>If you select received email to see in Message Pane, click on 'More' &gt; 'View Source' You will notice the 'Date' in the headers which is near the From, To and Subject will be the Date when sender created the email and the top most 'Received by' header is the date the server received the email.  </p><p>You can test this yourself. Create an email to send to yourself and use 'Send Later' so it goes to 'Outbox'. Wait for about 10 minutes,so there is a definite difference in time and then Right click on Outbox and click on 'Send unsent messages' When you get the received email, look at the 'Date' and the 'Received' date column headers. You will see about 10 minutes in the difference. </p><p><br> I sent an email from an account to another email address which was gmail. I created email at 13:07 and used Send Later - so email is now in Outbox. Email is stored in Sent with a date/time 13:07.  I sent unsent email at 13:13 In Thunderbird the newly received email in gmail account says 'Date' column header says 13:07 and 'Received' column header shows 13:13 So thunderbird shows full information. In webmail the gmail server view says date is 13:13 (date received onto that server) and if you need to know the real date when sender composed email you need to click on the 3 dot icon tooltip 'More' and select '&lt;show Original&gt;'Then gmail opens this in a new browser tab and you can see the full source headers and locate the actual 'Date' in the headers. </p><p>If you were to communicate with someone regarding an email they had sent then the senders 'Sent' folder is likely to have the copy of email with Date it was composed and not a date when received on someone elses server. Knowing this Date informaton may be important when communicating with the sender. </p><p>Personally I find it more confusing to only use the 'received' date when replying and mention re: your email dated x when they have a copy in sent saying date y. So, it's a benefit that Thunderbird can easily show both if required. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

A profile is not an account, it's just some sort of reference to the profile data. When you tell Thunderbird to use a different profile, you point it to a different profile folder where all your mail and account settings are stored.  </p><p>A profile you don't use may exist in Thunderbird without the corresponding profile folder if that folder has been deleted. And you may also have a profile folder that's not associated with any profile in Thunderbird if you've copied the folder from elsewhere. </p><p>What you have and are trying to bring back to Thunderbird is a profile <i>folder</i>. In order for Thunderbird to use it, you have to associate it with a <i>profile</i> in Thunderbird. That's why you have to create a new profile (not a new account) in Thunderbird, so you may be able to point Thunderbird to the profile folder you have. </p><p>The instructions to do that given in the documentation I linked seem unnecessarily complicated, indeed, and I'm not sure whether it's because they're outdated or because I'm missing something. They talk about using an external tool to do something that seems can be easily done from within Thunderbird using the 'About Profiles' tab… </p><p>Basically, all you have to do is create a new profile and either associate it with the profile folder you have during the profile creation process, or alternatively, let a new profile folder be created when you create the profile, then (quit Thunderbird first if you do this) replace <i>the contents</i> of that new profile folder with the contents of the profile folder you want to use. </p><p>Hope that makes things clearer and helps you solve the problem. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

I immediately closed the app, and went to the place under C://Users/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profile (folder).  I opened the Profile folder and deleted everything in it.

The part you're missing is what I said in my previous reply, i.e. you have to associate each of the profile folders you have (within that <i>Profiles</i> folder) with a profile in Thunderbird. </p><p>Thunderbird didn't automatically do that when you restored the <i>Profiles</i> folder because you didn't include in the backup a file called <b>profiles.ini</b> that's stored within the <i>Thunderbird</i> folder, together with the <i>Profiles</i> folder. That's where the list of profiles and the folder associated with each of them is stored. Since you didn't restore that file (because you didn't include it in the backup), Thunderbird has forgotten the profiles you had, and you have to create new profiles to tell Thunderbird where to find the profile folders that you have. </p><p>You could fix that by manually editing the <b>profiles.ini</b> (text) file, but I would rather do it by creating new profiles from the <b>About Profiles</b> tab in Thunderbird, associating each of the profiles you create with the corresponding profile folder you have in your Profiles folder, which you can do by using the <b>Choose Folder</b> button that appears when you start the profile creation process. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

If that's not the case, you need to do that now (quit Thunderbird first if it's running), although a better way to accomplish the same would be to copy <i>the contents</i> of that folder, i.e. copy the individual profile folders within that <i>Profile</i> folder into the already existing <i>Profile</i> folder, in order to not overwrite the new default profile folder that Thunderbird created there and thus avoid Thunderbird complaining that it cannot find the only profile it knows about until we fix this. </p><p>As to the <i>profile.ini</i> file, I mentioned it just so you could understand that all this trouble is a consequence of not having included that file in the backup, but you may forget about that file now, we'll fix this from within Thunderbird. </p><p>So assuming your old profile folders are already within the <i>AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles</i> folder, launch Thunderbird and proceed as follows: </p> <ol><li> Choose <b>Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information</b> from the menu bar. </li><li> Click <b>about:profiles</b> in that page to open the <b>About Profiles</b> page.

If you only have 1 profile to restore, as is usually the case, a simpler way to fix the problem would be to <i>reuse</i> the new default profile that Thunderbird created. </p><p>You could do that by just replacing <i>the contents</i> of the new default profile folder with <i>the contents</i> of the profile folder you want to restore (or alternatively by changing the name of the profile folder from the backup to be the same as the name of the newly created default profile folder, then overwriting the latter with the one from the backup). That procedure can only be used to restore a single profile, but if that's all you need, you wouldn't have to create any profiles doing things that way… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

If you don't (because Thunderbird cannot find the default profile folder) then, before you can do anything else, you'll have to do one of the following: </p> <ul><li> <b>Edit</b> <i>profiles.ini</i> to replace any reference to the profile folder that no longer exists with the folder you want it to use instead. This would solve the whole problem if you only have one profile to restore, btw. </li><li> <b>Delete</b> <i>profiles.ini</i>, so Thunderbird creates a new default profile (and asks you to set up a mail account) again. </li></ul>",DavidGG,false,0,0

The whole issue is caused by merely not having included the <b>profiles.ini</b> file in the backup.

I have retrieved all my setting, folders, calendars, etc.  Only issue is on my end:  I think the ""backup"" I got from my backup provider was an older backup.  Therefore, I have everything that was on the old drive through 2023.  The stuff from last year wasn't there.  No problem!  I was more concerned about saved email from years ago from my late mom, young grandkids, etc.  I DO have those!   I'm still going to see if the shop that installed the new hard drive can retrieve the Thunderbird folder from the old hard drive.  If so, that will be up to date.
