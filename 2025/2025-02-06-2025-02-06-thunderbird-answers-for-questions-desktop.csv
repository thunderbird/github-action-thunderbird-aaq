But sometimes people compose emails and then delay the sending. Maybe the person was using offline at the time or had to stagger the sending due to server limits.  </p><p>If you select received email to see in Message Pane, click on 'More' &gt; 'View Source' You will notice the 'Date' in the headers which is near the From, To and Subject will be the Date when sender created the email and the top most 'Received by' header is the date the server received the email.  </p><p>You can test this yourself. Create an email to send to yourself and use 'Send Later' so it goes to 'Outbox'. Wait for about 10 minutes,so there is a definite difference in time and then Right click on Outbox and click on 'Send unsent messages' When you get the received email, look at the 'Date' and the 'Received' date column headers. You will see about 10 minutes in the difference. </p><p><br> I sent an email from an account to another email address which was gmail. I created email at 13:07 and used Send Later - so email is now in Outbox. Email is stored in Sent with a date/time 13:07.  I sent unsent email at 13:13 In Thunderbird the newly received email in gmail account says 'Date' column header says 13:07 and 'Received' column header shows 13:13 So thunderbird shows full information. In webmail the gmail server view says date is 13:13 (date received onto that server) and if you need to know the real date when sender composed email you need to click on the 3 dot icon tooltip 'More' and select '&lt;show Original&gt;'Then gmail opens this in a new browser tab and you can see the full source headers and locate the actual 'Date' in the headers. </p><p>If you were to communicate with someone regarding an email they had sent then the senders 'Sent' folder is likely to have the copy of email with Date it was composed and not a date when received on someone elses server. Knowing this Date informaton may be important when communicating with the sender. </p><p>Personally I find it more confusing to only use the 'received' date when replying and mention re: your email dated x when they have a copy in sent saying date y. So, it's a benefit that Thunderbird can easily show both if required. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

A profile is not an account, it's just some sort of reference to the profile data. When you tell Thunderbird to use a different profile, you point it to a different profile folder where all your mail and account settings are stored.  </p><p>A profile you don't use may exist in Thunderbird without the corresponding profile folder if that folder has been deleted. And you may also have a profile folder that's not associated with any profile in Thunderbird if you've copied the folder from elsewhere. </p><p>What you have and are trying to bring back to Thunderbird is a profile <i>folder</i>. In order for Thunderbird to use it, you have to associate it with a <i>profile</i> in Thunderbird. That's why you have to create a new profile (not a new account) in Thunderbird, so you may be able to point Thunderbird to the profile folder you have. </p><p>The instructions to do that given in the documentation I linked seem unnecessarily complicated, indeed, and I'm not sure whether it's because they're outdated or because I'm missing something. They talk about using an external tool to do something that seems can be easily done from within Thunderbird using the 'About Profiles' tab… </p><p>Basically, all you have to do is create a new profile and either associate it with the profile folder you have during the profile creation process, or alternatively, let a new profile folder be created when you create the profile, then (quit Thunderbird first if you do this) replace <i>the contents</i> of that new profile folder with the contents of the profile folder you want to use. </p><p>Hope that makes things clearer and helps you solve the problem. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

I have a folder from a backup of the entire Profile folder from my old drive.  I know it contains the right info b/c I see the names of folders when I transfer to a thumb drive. I first deleted everything on my computer having to do with Thunderbird ... application and all files I could find. I then downloaded Thunderbird and installed it.  In so doing, I had to fill in the info for a POP 3 account; i.e., incoming server, port, email address, password, outgoing server and port.  When I did that, the application opened.  I immediately closed the app, and went to the place under C://Users/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profile (folder).  I opened the Profile folder and deleted everything in it.  I then copied the contents of my backed up Profile folder and pasted all those contents into the Profile folder mentioned above.  When I then opened Thunderbird, I got a message saying ""Missing Profile.  Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded.  It may be missing or inaccessible.""  What did I do wrong?  Thanks for sticking with me! </p>",brorat,false,0,0

The part you're missing is what I said in my previous reply, i.e. you have to associate each of the profile folders you have (within that <i>Profiles</i> folder) with a profile in Thunderbird. </p><p>Thunderbird didn't automatically do that when you restored the <i>Profiles</i> folder because you didn't include in the backup a file called <b>profiles.ini</b> that's stored within the <i>Thunderbird</i> folder, together with the <i>Profiles</i> folder. That's where the list of profiles and the folder associated with each of them is stored. Since you didn't restore that file (because you didn't include it in the backup), Thunderbird has forgotten the profiles you had, and you have to create new profiles to tell Thunderbird where to find the profile folders that you have. </p><p>You could fix that by manually editing the <b>profiles.ini</b> (text) file, but I would rather do it by creating new profiles from the <b>About Profiles</b> tab in Thunderbird, associating each of the profiles you create with the corresponding profile folder you have in your Profiles folder, which you can do by using the <b>Choose Folder</b> button that appears when you start the profile creation process. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

I'm still in the dark a bit, specifically about how to do: "" I would rather do it by creating new profiles from the About Profiles tab in Thunderbird, associating each of the profiles you create with the corresponding profile folder you have in your Profiles folder, which you can do by using the Choose Folder button that appears when you start the profile creation process."" </p><p>I went to the ""about profile"" tab and saw several items.  I think I understand that somehow I need to insert my old (backup) profile FOLDER inside the ""Thunderbird"" folder under User/AppData.  I also need to have a profile.ini file in that Thunderbird folder as well.  Also, I think I understand that the profile.ini must somehow ""match"" the profile folder that I have backed up on a thumb drive. I don't know how to make this match.  Would you be so kind as to assume I know NOTHING about the paragraph of yours that I copied/pasted above and lead me through it?  (Your assumption would be correct!)  I'm sure this is a simple thing, but it would sure be nice if there was a set of specific instructions on the forum.  Thank you! </p>",brorat,false,0,0

If that's not the case, you need to do that now (quit Thunderbird first if it's running), although a better way to accomplish the same would be to copy <i>the contents</i> of that folder, i.e. copy the individual profile folders within that <i>Profile</i> folder into the already existing <i>Profile</i> folder, in order to not overwrite the new default profile folder that Thunderbird created there and thus avoid Thunderbird complaining that it cannot find the only profile it knows about until we fix this. </p><p>As to the <i>profile.ini</i> file, I mentioned it just so you could understand that all this trouble is a consequence of not having included that file in the backup, but you may forget about that file now, we'll fix this from within Thunderbird. </p><p>So assuming your old profile folders are already within the <i>AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles</i> folder, launch Thunderbird and proceed as follows: </p> <ol><li> Choose <b>Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information</b> from the menu bar. </li><li> Click <b>about:profiles</b> in that page to open the <b>About Profiles</b> page.
