The developers of add-ons must do that. Sometimes, they need time to make changes after a new release of Thunderbird. David suggested a couple strategies for dealing with that situation. Another is to check with developers of your most important add-ons before upgrading Thunderbird. </p><p>I've been using the monthly release.

The ESR release provides fewer updates and, even then, we have tens of thousands who happily run with years-old releases. That is, all updates do not need to be installed. If your release is working fine, leave it alone for awhile. When a new release comes out, wait a few weeks before updating. I also recommend doing full backup prior to any update. Trusting that the update is problem-free, written by humans who may make mistakes, is never a good strategy. On your suggestion, I do agree that a software product with a paid subscription may have a faster response directly to user, but that will never be Thunderbird. I wish you well.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
