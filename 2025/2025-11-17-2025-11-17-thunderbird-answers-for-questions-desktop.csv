I also started Yahoo as a backup to Gmail.   I searched in TB for the draft but couldn't work with it or discover where it was.  I found the same msg in Gmail and was able to copy it and send it.  I can't find it in TB sent emails folder.  Does Gmail copy the emails I have to TB somehow?  I used TB to send the email. I realize this is not a Gmail forum.  I'm considering starting over but want to keep my msgs from family and friends and a few other folders that show history. If any images might help, I'll do my best to provide them. </p><p>[InstallD3F2D26B0DE61CBE] Default=Profiles/6m12bx4f.default-esr Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile2] Name=default-esr IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/6m12bx4f.default-esr </p><p>[InstallD78BF5DD33499EC2] Default=Profiles/btc7lv80.default-release Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/7pxkimj7.default Default=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/btc7lv80.default-release </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p>",dcal53,false,0,0

This time it wasn't there and when I searched for it, I couldn't work with it - Shift + Windows key + T - didn't work as expected so couldn't copy it properly. I did find it in Gmail and could copy it and send it in TB.  Still not in ""Sent"" folder in TB but in Gmail ""sent"" folder.  Why?  Things that I'm used to are not happening as they did before.   I apologize if all this is above your pay grade.  Any help at this point would be helpful.  I am throwing up my hands at this point. I've been using Windows a few years but this logic is beyond me!
