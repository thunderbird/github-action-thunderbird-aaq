Fortunately it dragged 143 with it and I ended up with no Tbird... Ran every possible disk cleaner and registry cleaner I could find then reinstalled 139... </p><p>I got a clean install then proceeded to reclaim and rebuild the profile by copy/pasting from the old email accounts to the new ones then content comparing both side by side before deleting the old profile. By doing this I was able to recover the email account that 143 ate. </p><p>So far its been stable for over an hour and executed the timed mail checks after Tbird was completely reconfigured to its previous settings... </p><p>7 hours and 42 minutes from start to finish and I'm over it... </p>,craign1,false,0,0
