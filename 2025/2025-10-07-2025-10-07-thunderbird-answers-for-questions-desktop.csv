Technically you could do this by using custom CSS, but beside the hassle, it also can break the layout and may be rendered wrong at the receiver side. </p><p>Regards, Balázs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0

But the fact, that you did, is clearly visible, the subject line should have a small blue icon (see the attached image). You can also enable the <em>Status</em> column, that shows the <em>Read</em> or <em>Replied</em> state of the messages, but I find that redundant. </p><p>Regards, Balázs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0

Fortunately it dragged 143 with it and I ended up with no Tbird... Ran every possible disk cleaner and registry cleaner I could find then reinstalled 139... </p><p>I got a clean install then proceeded to reclaim and rebuild the profile by copy/pasting from the old email accounts to the new ones then content comparing both side by side before deleting the old profile. By doing this I was able to recover the email account that 143 ate. </p><p>So far its been stable for over an hour and executed the timed mail checks after Tbird was completely reconfigured to its previous settings... </p><p>7 hours and 42 minutes from start to finish and I'm over it... </p>,craign1,false,0,0
