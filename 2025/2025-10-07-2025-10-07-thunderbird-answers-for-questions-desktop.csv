Zkus postupně:  1. **Restart Thunderbirdu i počítače.**    Někdy pomůže jednoduchý restart aplikace nebo systému.  2. **Vyzkoušej „Nouzový režim“ (Troubleshoot Mode):**     * Klikni na ☰ (menu) → **Nápověda** → **Režim řešení problémů…**    * Potvrď „Restartovat“.      Pokud tam přílohy fungují, vadí některé **rozšíření** nebo **motiv** – zkus je postupně vypnout.  3. **Zkontroluj antivir/firewall.**    Některé antiviry blokují přístup Thunderbirdu k souborům (např. kvůli kontrole příloh).    Zkus dočasně vypnout kontrolu e-mailů nebo přidat Thunderbird do výjimek.  4. **Ověř cestu k souboru.**    Přílohy z „nestandardních“ míst (např. síťové disky, OneDrive offline, šifrované složky) někdy Thunderbird nepřipojí.    Zkus přetáhnout soubor přímo z Plochy.  5. **Zkontroluj velikost přílohy.**    E-mailové servery často omezují velikost (např. 20–25 MB). Pokud je soubor větší, použij odkaz na úložiště (např. Google Drive).  6. **Zkus nový profil Thunderbirdu.**    Někdy pomůže vytvořit nový čistý profil:     * Zavři Thunderbird.    * Spusť `thunderbird.exe -p`    * Klikni na **Vytvořit profil** a přidej svůj účet.    * Otestuj, jestli přílohy jdou připojit.</blockquote>",poljos-moz,false,0,0
