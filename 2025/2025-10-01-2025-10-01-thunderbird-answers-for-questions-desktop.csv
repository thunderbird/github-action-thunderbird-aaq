DKIM and SPF and essentially newer technologies adopted or being adopted by most major providers to largely prevent exactly what you are doing using an email address that is not ""connected"" with the sending servers.  ie BT email on Google. </p><p>The process for you is as simple as adding another new outgoing server to your list of outgoing servers.  The from can be changed in the compose window via dropdown list  above the To: and the identities for the account are used to populate that list. </p><p>So once you have the new SMTP server added go into your account settings and on the first page above the Server settings you will see a button on the bottom right ""manage Identities"".  Every account has one and that is the information shown on that page.  Name email outgoing server etc.  Click on manage identities and add a new one  specially crafted for you AOL correspondent (so make sure to select the correct SMTP server)  </p><p>Because you will be wanting to pick the correct SMTP identity on sending,  you will probably want to uniquely enter your name somehow. So  instead of for instance Paul make it Paul for AOL or PaulB. Picking the right one from a list of two Pauls is not going to work I don't think and the list only shows the display name and email address.  Just be aware the name used will be who the outgoing mail appears to be from (display name) so keep it clean and concise&nbsp;:) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

While IMAP account will eventually syncronise sent folders to the local machine,  pop account never do.

I have also gone through all the settings on the webmail and could not find anything applicable. This is from where I changed the password and turned on 2FA. - Accounting software is a great mention, but I did investigate this – the computer that generates the invoice does not have any email linked to it. - In the mornings the computer is awakened from sleep, this is possibly related. But quite difficult to confirm if the times are exactly the same as I do not have access to the emails being sent out, will possibly need to monitor this. There is no antivirus scanning. </p><p>I just got the email as an attachment and can now see the headers. I have asked the hosting company to investigate the headers, their previous finding was that they could not find the email on their servers and thus they believe it to be spoofing. But I just confirmed on the email attachment that nothing is changed on the email or invoice, which indicates to me that this is not a third party spoofing attempt. </p>",boeboebishop,false,0,0
