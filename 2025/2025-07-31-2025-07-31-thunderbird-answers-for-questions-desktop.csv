I do experience the same issue and agree it does seem to be a nuisance. I could report this as a bug requesting an enhancement, but that does not offer much help right now. </p><p>Have you tried using 'Favourite Folders'&nbsp;? Any subfolder set as a 'favourite folder' will appear with it's top level folder even if top level folder has not been set as Favourite. So in that respect nothing has changed. </p><p>However, it does mean you can choose the current set of folders you are working on, so creating a much shorter list which is easier to find folders and open a new tab and means you can leave that Inbox expanded whilst the 'All Folders' Inbox can be collapsed. You can easily uncheck as favourite when finished and choose others. This can help with work throughput. </p><p><strong>How to set a folder as 'Favourite':</strong> </p> <ul><li> Right click on folder and select 'Favourite Folder' option in the drop down list. </li></ul> <p><strong>To display the 'Favourite Folders' section:</strong> </p> <ul><li> In the 'Folder Pane Header' (where it also has the '+New Message')  </li><li> Click on the 3 dot menu and select 'Folder Modes' and select 'Favourite Folders' </li><li> This may appear at the bottom of the Folder Pane, so scroll down to locate it. </li><li> Where it says 'Favourite Folders', you will see a vertical 3 dot menu icon - click on it and select 'Move up' - this will now display at the top of Folder Pane. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

First, with IMAP, all messages are on the server and also on the PC if you have specified to sync all messages.  I am unclear on what you want. My inference is that you want to move a message to a different online folder and also copy it to a local folder That is a timing problem. You cannot move and copy simultaneously. You could set one filter to move to the other imap folder and set a second filter to then copy to a local folder, being sure to set one to run prior to the other. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To check what is happening, I suggest using the account's website to see if incoming messages are being moved there are if they are staying in the inbox. I think you may find that using the online account is more predictable and consistent than maintaining Thunderbird. The fact that all works well for awhile and then doesn't is not consistent for a software product unless something changes. I regret that I have no suggestions on why your mail is going to trash. Also, if reinstalling thunderbird 'fixes' it, that would indicate that you changed something. I hope you're able to get this working. But do consider using the online account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I also try  to  put  what is in trash back to Thunderbird and it   will not  does not move  to the in box . it either goes to trash or  drafts and  when it  goes to  Drafts  folder this is what  i get at the bottom of  each thing  i put there. Now   what you consider Drafts  are  different than what i put there  i put important  emails and  registration number s etc in drafts.  every thing  i put in drafts says this and  i  do not  know why    it has not always done this  either but it does now so  i  have no clue why this is happening    and every time  i reinstall i lose my contact but thank  god  i copy them before  i reinstall so  i have them to put back in.

There are several low-cost or free email services available that will remove you from those concerns of spam and unsubscribing. They can even give you feedback on who is, and is not, reading your messages. I have been there and I seriously encourage your investigating such services. For example, Mailchimp will let you set up a free account, provided that you send no more than 1,000 messages per month (100 subscribers times 10). So, if you send fewer than 10 messages a month, you're in for free. And there are other similar email providers.  Good luck.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
