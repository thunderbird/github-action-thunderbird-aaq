However, when I hit ""done,"" I get the following message: ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password.""  I thought this was a Spectrum problem, but after inquiring, they told me it was a Thunderbird problem.  I have attempted to connect several times and have checked my username and password carefully to make sure they were correct.  I have also attempted to configure manually, and that has also been unsuccessful.  However, the hostname (<a href=""http://mobile.charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mobile.charter.net</a>), the incoming server port (993) and the outgoing server port (587) are all correct, according to information I saw on the Spectrum website.
