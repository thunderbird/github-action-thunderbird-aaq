I have email for my business with my domain name (Laurel@handknitting.com), and both my personal (laurelmurphy@fastmail.com) and business email are managed by Rackspace.  Only the outgoing mail on my business email is affected. </p><p>Here is the error msg I got today when trying to send from business to private email:   ""<em>Sending of the message failed. </em> An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: &lt;laurel@handknitting.com&gt;: Sender address rejected: Access denied. Please check the message recipient ""laurelmurphy@fastmail.com"" and try again.<em>   </em> </p><p>Rackspace support was able to send successfully from their webmail and from Microsoft outlook using my business email. All of the SMTP settings are exactly the same for both my business and personal accounts.  It is clearly not the server, it is TB. Their suggestion was to uninstall TB and reinstall, or change the client.  </p><p>What do you suggest?

I copied old profile to external drive. I opened Thunderbird on new PC and found Profile folder.  I went up 3 levels and pasted old profile from external drive into folder on new PC.  But my old data have not moved.  When I go into new Thunderbird and choose ""open profile folder"", it shows me 3 files:  the two that the system created in the new download, plus the old Profile that I pasted there.  The new version of Thunderbird uses the ""new download"" profile as the default.  What am I doing wrong?

I have Spectrum netmail.  I recently installed Thunderbird; that went off without a hitch.  When I open Thunderbird and try to get it to connect to Spectrum, I put in my full name, email address and password.  Thunderbird then comes up with a configuration.  However, when I hit ""done,"" I get the following message: ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password.""  I thought this was a Spectrum problem, but after inquiring, they told me it was a Thunderbird problem.  I have attempted to connect several times and have checked my username and password carefully to make sure they were correct.  I have also attempted to configure manually, and that has also been unsuccessful.  However, the hostname (<a href=""http://mobile.charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mobile.charter.net</a>), the incoming server port (993) and the outgoing server port (587) are all correct, according to information I saw on the Spectrum website.  I'd welcome any suggestions to fix this problem.  Thanks in advance. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1709682;1709683;,wolfappeals
