However, when I hit ""done,"" I get the following message: ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password.""  I thought this was a Spectrum problem, but after inquiring, they told me it was a Thunderbird problem.

I have also attempted to configure manually, and that has also been unsuccessful.
