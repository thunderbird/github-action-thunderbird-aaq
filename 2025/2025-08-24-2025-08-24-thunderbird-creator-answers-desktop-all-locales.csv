Now, when I try to add any mail account - enter name and E-mail address - screen goes pale and the doughnut icon spins endlessly. CTRL+ALT+DEL to kill the app. Tried in safe mode - still no go. In every other respect, the app works fine. I can access the other accounts via Outlook, so not a huge deal, but would rather do everything in Thunderbird now that I have switched. Don't want to have to reinstall or create a new profile as I have only just set Thunderbird up (about a month ago). </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,1759184;1759186;,a.g.wright

Changes made on the server do not get reflected in ThunderBird. </p><p>This includes the situation where the address booked entry is originally made in ThunderBird, uploaded to the Server, and then edited on the server (e.g. added extra character to the name field). </p><p>I can sync emails and calenders between ThunderBird and the Server without problem. </p><p>I have tried deleting the abook.sqlite files in my ThunderBird Profile, but this has not had any impact. </p><p>For avoidance of doubt, I am using the ""Syncronise"" menu option in ThunderBird rather waiting for the default automated 'every 30 minutes' setting. </p><p>Question: Can anyone advise how to resolve this one-way synconisation. I would like ThunderBird Address Book to update/reflect changes made on the server </p>",thunderbird;contacts;,thunderbird,contacts,en-US,1759195;,mailboxgateway-jb

My Outlook account is configured as passwordless, meaning I typically sign in via Microsoft Authenticator, biometrics, or a security key. I have already tried deleting and recreating my Thunderbird profile, but the issue persists. Since this is my first time adding this Outlook account, there is no existing outgoing server (SMTP) entry for Outlook in Thunderbird’s list. I attempted to manually configure the SMTP server (<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>, port 587, oauth2), but the same password prompt appears, and I cannot proceed. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1759203;,cepvor
