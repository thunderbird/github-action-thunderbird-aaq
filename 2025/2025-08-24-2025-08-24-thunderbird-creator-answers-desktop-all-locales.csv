The app is fully up-to-date. Now, when I try to add any mail account - enter name and E-mail address - screen goes pale and the doughnut icon spins endlessly. CTRL+ALT+DEL to kill the app. Tried in safe mode - still no go. In every other respect, the app works fine. I can access the other accounts via Outlook, so not a huge deal, but would rather do everything in Thunderbird now that I have switched.

My Outlook account is configured as passwordless, meaning I typically sign in via Microsoft Authenticator, biometrics, or a security key. I have already tried deleting and recreating my Thunderbird profile, but the issue persists. Since this is my first time adding this Outlook account, there is no existing outgoing server (SMTP) entry for Outlook in Thunderbird’s list. I attempted to manually configure the SMTP server (<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>, port 587, oauth2), but the same password prompt appears, and I cannot proceed. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1759203;1759213;,cepvor

In order to transfer it to another computer I tried to copy the profile to a new disk and it failed. An error message stated that ""The destination you have specified does not exist"". I manually copied the profile folder, and found that the problem occurs when attempting to copy the file (no file type is given. File name is printed bolt) as follows: mozilla profiles&gt;cc739xtg.default&gt;mail&gt;local folders&gt;unsent messages. (1,835,282 KB file) Unsent messages.MSF (6KB file) was copied with no problem. I did not find a way to open unsent messages file to read its content. Unsent messages does not show in my TB folders. As far as I understand there are no unsent messages in my TB accounts. 1. How to overcome the unsent messages file copy problem? 2. Can I try to delete both unsent messages and unsent messages.msf files without damage the profile? 3. How can I open unsent messages file to read its content? Thank you for your assistance.

Now when I see 'Install' I won't do it because I don't want the hassle of having to export everything to an already overfull hard drive.  If I did that I suspect that when I import everything back I'd have to re-create all my folders, and then sort out which email goes into which folder. </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,1759246;,Poppa_Mintin
