Now, when I try to add any mail account - enter name and E-mail address - screen goes pale and the doughnut icon spins endlessly. CTRL+ALT+DEL to kill the app. Tried in safe mode - still no go. In every other respect, the app works fine. I can access the other accounts via Outlook, so not a huge deal, but would rather do everything in Thunderbird now that I have switched. Don't want to have to reinstall or create a new profile as I have only just set Thunderbird up (about a month ago). </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,1759184;1759186;,a.g.wright
