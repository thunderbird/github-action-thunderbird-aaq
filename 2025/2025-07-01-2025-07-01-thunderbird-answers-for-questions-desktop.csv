The normal versions the regular versions of Thunderbird do have more updates and are better in fixing bugs. And you can receive these updates every four weeks The answer on your question is that there will not be a possible situation of deleted emails or other profile files / data. By deleting that good old account. </p><p><br> Completely remove. What I always do is to be sure that the system is really cleaned for a new version first to download. The first step is to completely remove all of Thunderbird files first .then restart your system after that and then you can install a new version.(if you are do have and just are keeping problems with updates there in that system) Then it is better to make back ups of all data first on usb devices for example before go to do the total deleting of that complete Thunderbird software on that pc machine. And use a cleaning tool to clean up the system and the software before . Then you can install that latest version. </p><p>Updates can have minor errors that can become errors. </p><p><br> Greetings googleThunderbird. </p>,Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

Prior to any editing of the 'prefs.js' file, Thunderbird must not be running and I would advise creating a copy of that 'pregfs.js' to be used as a backup just in case an error occurred. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:master PW and account PWs were lost</em> This may have been a security reason. Master Password (now called Primary Password) is usually used by people who both share a computer and both use the same username. So the Master password then acts as an addition protection against prying eyes as both people would be able to see each others profile details.  If Primary Password is removed then all stored passwords would get removed unless Thunderbird was running and correct Primary Password was entered.  </p><p>However, as you copied the contents of one profile into another - I'm not sure whether the necessary files were indeed copied over, or whether uou deleted all the contents of the new esr profile before you pasted in all the copied data. That might explain them not working. </p><p>The files that concern passwords and certificates are&nbsp;: cert9.db, key4.db, logins.json, pkcs11.txt </p><p>logins.json = Stores encrypted passwords, and requires key4.db and cert9.db to work.
