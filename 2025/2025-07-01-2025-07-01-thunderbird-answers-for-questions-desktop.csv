The normal versions the regular versions of Thunderbird do have more updates and are better in fixing bugs. And you can receive these updates every four weeks The answer on your question is that there will not be a possible situation of deleted emails or other profile files / data. By deleting that good old account. </p><p><br> Completely remove. What I always do is to be sure that the system is really cleaned for a new version first to download. The first step is to completely remove all of Thunderbird files first .then restart your system after that and then you can install a new version.(if you are do have and just are keeping problems with updates there in that system) Then it is better to make back ups of all data first on usb devices for example before go to do the total deleting of that complete Thunderbird software on that pc machine. And use a cleaning tool to clean up the system and the software before . Then you can install that latest version. </p><p>Updates can have minor errors that can become errors. </p><p><br> Greetings googleThunderbird. </p>,Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

Prior to any editing of the 'prefs.js' file, Thunderbird must not be running and I would advise creating a copy of that 'pregfs.js' to be used as a backup just in case an error occurred. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:master PW and account PWs were lost</em> This may have been a security reason. Master Password (now called Primary Password) is usually used by people who both share a computer and both use the same username. So the Master password then acts as an addition protection against prying eyes as both people would be able to see each others profile details.  If Primary Password is removed then all stored passwords would get removed unless Thunderbird was running and correct Primary Password was entered.  </p><p>However, as you copied the contents of one profile into another - I'm not sure whether the necessary files were indeed copied over, or whether uou deleted all the contents of the new esr profile before you pasted in all the copied data. That might explain them not working. </p><p>The files that concern passwords and certificates are&nbsp;: cert9.db, key4.db, logins.json, pkcs11.txt </p><p>logins.json = Stores encrypted passwords, and requires key4.db and cert9.db to work. Replaces signons.sqlite, which had replaced signons.txt.  pkcs11.txt   = Security module database. cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db were replaced by cert9.db, key4.db, and pkcs11.txt. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

You must remove the imap account account first and then create the Pop account. </p><p>Did you remove the the Imap account and then create a new Pop account? If yes, then you will not see any folder that is on the server - as seen via webmail. Pop accounts will have their own set of default folders created by Thunderbird. Pop accounts can only access the server Inbox and download whatever is in it. Any emails the server puts into the server 'Spam' folder will never be downloaded to Thunderbird. </p><p><br> re&nbsp;:I have 2 accounts in TB. In one of them Thunderbird has a folder named 'Junkmail' but on the server the folder is called 'Spam.' Thunderbird is not allowing me to rename the folder. </p><p>That can occur if there is both a 'Spam' and a 'junkmail' folder on the server. Sometimes a 'junkmail' folder can be a residual folder from eg: a verizon account which got moved to another server where there is 'Spam' folder. You would be able to 'subscribe' to see any folder on the server. You would not be able to 'rename' something that is set up as the default junk/spam folder. That default folder would need to have the flag for Junk' removed so it appears asa  normal folder in order to rename - however, you should do that when there is already a default 'Spam' folder which the server uses. You should 'unsubscribe' from seeing the 'junkmail' and make sure you are subscribed to see the 'Spam' folder. Then make sure the Account Settings &gt; Junk Settings' are set up to use 'Other' and select 'Spam folder on mail account name'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
