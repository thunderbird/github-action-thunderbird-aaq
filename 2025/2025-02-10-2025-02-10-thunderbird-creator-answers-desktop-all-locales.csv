For example when I receive an email about a financial transaction such as a online payment or a charge, I edit the subject adding the amout, what was the charge/purchase for and sanitized last four of account number plus any other useful info.  I move these emails to a separate folder, either ""eBills"" or ""Receipts"".  That way I can quickly find receipts, bills, and other transactions without having to open each individual mail message. </p><p>Apparently Thunderbird does not support this functionality.  Is that correct? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Robert </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1711193;,robertconley

But when I try to send an identical email to the identical label members through the Google Workspace account in Thunderbird 128, it says there are too many recipients in the To: line.  Is this limitation being imposed by Thunderbird itself or is it imposed by Google on messages sent from Thunderbird?  Google Workspace chat AI bot says it's likely Thunderbird, but is it? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1711195;1711291;,doctorjah
