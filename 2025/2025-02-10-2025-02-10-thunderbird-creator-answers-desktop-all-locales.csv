I have copied and pasted my email signature from an email and tried using the Samsung flow app to copy it to clipboard. Both ways don't bring across images or coloured text and I can't see where to add/ edit either. Is there a way to add images or colour the text on the android mobile version of the Thunderbird email signature? </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",info687

In working through the [**""Hello World"" Extension Tutorial**](<a href=""https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/hello-world-add-on"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/hello-world-add-on</a>), I decided to try calling the function `messenger.notifications.getPermissionLevel()` function described in the [MailExtensions notifications API documentation](<a href=""https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/notifications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/notifications.html</a>).  </p><p>When I use code like: ``` let allowed = await messenger.notifications.getPermissionLevel(); ``` I see the following error message on the Developer Tools console: ``` Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: messenger.notifications.getPermissionLevel is not a function ``` </p><p>Meanwhile, over at GitHub, I see [thunderbird/webext-schemas/schema-files/notifications.json#L228-L247](<a href=""https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-schemas/blob/d0c42f0f1e82244095f002387a2a4d253ab679fb/schema-files/notifications.json#L228-L247"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-schemas/blob/d0c42f0f1e82244095f002387a2a4d253ab679fb/schema-files/notifications.json#L228-L247</a>), which includes the field, `""unsupported"": true`. It also lacks a field `mdn_url`, and there is no entry for it in the [Mozilla browser extensions docs](<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/notifications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/notifications</a>).  </p><p>So, is messenger.notifications.getPermissionLevel() supported in Thunderbird 128esr? And, where is that answer documented? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",JDLH
