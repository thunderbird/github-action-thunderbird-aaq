A POP3 server and Thunderbird clients are deployed on the local network. When the Thunderbird client receives a message and it appears in the client as new, the user attempts to save all attachments (15 MB) and clicks ""Save All."" This process takes about 1.5 minutes. In Thunderbird version 115, saving attachments takes 5-10 seconds. Could you please tell me if there's a setting I need to disable in the Thunderbird client? Can I open the ""Advanced Settings"" in the client and see what specifically I can disable to speed up saving attachments?
