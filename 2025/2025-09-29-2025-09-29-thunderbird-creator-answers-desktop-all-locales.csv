So, if different you need to clarify. </p><p>YOUR REPLY: Please post/upload an image of the 'Folder Pane' which shows everything in 'Local Folders' account. Then post/upload images that show what is in the profile folder: Assuming you are using Windows OS </p><pre>   In search type: %Appdata%    select the %Appdata% file folder    Select 'Roaming' folder    Select 'Thunderbird' folder    Select 'Profiles' folder    Select name of profile folder    Select 'Mail' folder    Select 'Local Folders' folder  </pre> <p>Make sure the view is showing all contents in column details format, extensions and hidden files must be allowed. Make window large enough to show all contents - or if necessary, post more than one image. This means I can compare profile with Folder Pane and check to see if appropriate files are missing. What Anti-Virus do you use? Is it allowed to scan your Thunderbird profile folders? Do you use any Anti-Virus or other cleanup program like CCleaner or Wisecleaner that cleans up temp files etc? If yes, then what do you use?  </p><p>MY REPLY First, your instructions do not work because following your path, I go down each line until I reach (Select Profiles folder) Once opened it gives me the names of my 2 alpha numerical profiles and I opened each profile there is no such thing as ""Local Profile"" folder. The View shows all files, My AV is Bitdefender; I have no clean up software My system is w10 pro x64 I have been using T-Bird for years and installed dozens of updates always using my same system and tools so something seems to be wrong with the update itself. I will wait for your reply Thank you for your support Best Regards Douglas Noades </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",douglasnoades
