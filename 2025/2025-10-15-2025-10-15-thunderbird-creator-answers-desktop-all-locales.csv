That's why it's important to be aware of the problems. üòä)</em> </p><p>Hello </p><p>Nowadays, emails are often formatted like Word documents to appeal to recipients as much as possible, because unfortunately, emails are considered ""by nerds and for nerds"" if they look like a text editor from 20 years ago ‚òπÔ∏è  </p><p>Although ribbons are loved by 95% of users (this popular usability feature is almost 20 years old!), Thunderbird, unfortunately, still does not offer anything similarly simple.  </p><p>Therefore, it would be very useful if users could place EVERY menu command in the unified toolbar üòç so that important functions do not have to be searched for somewhere in a sub-sub-sub menu, but can be accessed with a single click on the toolbar. </p><p><strong>Therefore my question:</strong> How can we place any Menu Command onto the unified toolbar? </p><p>For example, we would like to have a drop-down list with all fonts in the toolbar, so that we can assign a font to selected text with just two clicks and, above all, so that we can filter the over 130 fonts in the drop-down list üòä </p><p>Thanks a lot, kind regards, Thomas </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",Firefox.com80

One person who regularly emails me uses an iPhone. The message comes through but the attachment does not. If I go directly into the Gmail account via Firefox the attachment is there.
