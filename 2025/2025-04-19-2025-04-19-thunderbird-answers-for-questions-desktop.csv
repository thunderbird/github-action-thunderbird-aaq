An email from xfinity that includes a link to my xfinity account attaches itself to my tbird program in such a way that no new emails can be received. I have cleaned the cache, opened task manager and closed every tbird open link, I have removed all xfinity emails on the original email server (also xfinity). Nothing removes the problem message. Is there a way to remove it without removing the whole tbird program (and then reinstalling)? It was such a pain to do this last time around. When you do a normal clean out it doesn't actually remove every element. Going in to find every little thing causes me a lot of effort and stress. This one faulty message is making me give up on tbird altogether. Thanks for your help! Annie </blockquote> <p><br> </p><p>Ugh, that sounds super frustrating. Have you tried starting Thunderbird in Safe Mode (Help &gt; Troubleshoot Mode) and see if the bad message still blocks things? Also maybe check the profile folder and delete the specific inbox file (like `Inbox` and `Inbox.msf`) for that account just back them up first.

In trying to move the message folder from under Local Folders to a folder under the target account is where the problem occurs.

You can manually Highlight a batch of emails - right click on them and use 'Copy to' and from options select the Pop account and choose the folder where you want emails to get put. </p><p>It might take a while especially if you have an Anti-Virus program set up to scan every file you open. It's also a lot of clicking etc. </p><p>I would use the following method because it does it in one move. But first - make sure you know the exact name of the pop account folder which needs to receive the copy of folder. </p><p>In Account Settings </p> <ul><li> Select 'Server Settings' for the pop account </li><li> look bottom right for 'Local directory:..... </li><li> You need to make a note of what is on the far right... </li><li> eg: Mail/<strong><a href=""http://pop.account.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.account.net</a> </strong> or perhaps it says Mail/<strong><a href=""http://pop.account-1.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.account-1.net</a></strong> </li></ul> <p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; TRoubleshooting Information </li><li> Under 'Application Basics' - half way is Profile Folder - click on 'Open Folder' </li></ul> <p>A new window opens showing you the contents of your 'profile name' folder. </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird now. - this is important. </li></ul> <ul><li> Click on 'Mail' folder to see contents. </li></ul> <p>You will see the 'Local Folders' mail account and also all your pop mail accounts. </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Local Folders' folder and select to open in a new window. </li><li> Back in the 'Mail' folder - select the correct pop mail account to see contents. </li></ul> <p>Now you should have two windows open side by side. One shows you the pop mail account set of contents and the other shows you your 'Local Folders' contents. </p><p>For the sake of senario - lets say the folder you want to copy is called 'Clubs' - it's currently in 'Local Folders' account and you want it in a Pop account. </p><p>In 'Local Folders' folder look for the mbox file which has same name as the folder - Clubs.  Note mbox files do not have any extension, so 'Clubs' is name of mbox file (Clubs.msf is just an index and is not relevant - it has no emails) - if you also have a folder with same name as mbox file and a .sbd extention eg: 'Clubs.sbd', then that means it contains subfolders to Clubs. </p> <ul><li> You would need to Copy the 'Clubs' mbox file and the 'Clubs.sbd' folder </li><li> Then moving over to the 'pop account' folder window </li><li> Right click in pop account folder and select 'Paste' </li></ul> <p>Thus getting a copy of 'Clubs' box file and 'Clubs.sbd' in the pop folder. </p><p>When you now start Thunderbird, the Pop account will have a new folder called 'Clubs' and it should display all the subfolders as well. </p><p>I've included an image below showing an example of copy pasting mbox files from Local Folders into a Pop account folder. In your case you are only needing to copy a specific mbox file (and possibly a .sbd folder if subfolders are involved.) </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Another, simpler, option is to create a manual filter to COPY (not move) the messages from local folder to the IMAP folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
