I have 2 accounts setup but only one local folders folder with lots of other folders under it. I wanted to move all the messages associated with one of the accounts to a folder under the account which is not under local folders. In trying to move the message folder from under Local Folders to a folder under the target account is where the problem occurs. The ImportExport plugin will allow an import of a mbox file under local folders but doesn't give the option to import an mbox file when attemping an import under the target account. I hope thats clearer. </p>,kerrystares,false,0,0

Obviously that method does take some time as the server places limits on how much can be uploaded via imap to server. </p><p>But you say you are using Pop, so nothing is being uploaded anywhere.  You can manually Highlight a batch of emails - right click on them and use 'Copy to' and from options select the Pop account and choose the folder where you want emails to get put. </p><p>It might take a while especially if you have an Anti-Virus program set up to scan every file you open. It's also a lot of clicking etc. </p><p>I would use the following method because it does it in one move. But first - make sure you know the exact name of the pop account folder which needs to receive the copy of folder. </p><p>In Account Settings </p> <ul><li> Select 'Server Settings' for the pop account </li><li> look bottom right for 'Local directory:..... </li><li> You need to make a note of what is on the far right... </li><li> eg: Mail/<strong><a href=""http://pop.account.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.account.net</a> </strong> or perhaps it says Mail/<strong><a href=""http://pop.account-1.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.account-1.net</a></strong> </li></ul> <p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; TRoubleshooting Information </li><li> Under 'Application Basics' - half way is Profile Folder - click on 'Open Folder' </li></ul> <p>A new window opens showing you the contents of your 'profile name' folder. </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird now. - this is important. </li></ul> <ul><li> Click on 'Mail' folder to see contents. </li></ul> <p>You will see the 'Local Folders' mail account and also all your pop mail accounts. </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Local Folders' folder and select to open in a new window. </li><li> Back in the 'Mail' folder - select the correct pop mail account to see contents. </li></ul> <p>Now you should have two windows open side by side. One shows you the pop mail account set of contents and the other shows you your 'Local Folders' contents. </p><p>For the sake of senario - lets say the folder you want to copy is called 'Clubs' - it's currently in 'Local Folders' account and you want it in a Pop account. </p><p>In 'Local Folders' folder look for the mbox file which has same name as the folder - Clubs.  Note mbox files do not have any extension, so 'Clubs' is name of mbox file (Clubs.msf is just an index and is not relevant - it has no emails) - if you also have a folder with same name as mbox file and a .sbd extention eg: 'Clubs.sbd', then that means it contains subfolders to Clubs. </p> <ul><li> You would need to Copy the 'Clubs' mbox file and the 'Clubs.sbd' folder </li><li> Then moving over to the 'pop account' folder window </li><li> Right click in pop account folder and select 'Paste' </li></ul> <p>Thus getting a copy of 'Clubs' box file and 'Clubs.sbd' in the pop folder. </p><p>When you now start Thunderbird, the Pop account will have a new folder called 'Clubs' and it should display all the subfolders as well. </p><p>I've included an image below showing an example of copy pasting mbox files from Local Folders into a Pop account folder. In your case you are only needing to copy a specific mbox file (and possibly a .sbd folder if subfolders are involved.) </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Instead, you should use the importexport utility to export eml files and then import those. IMAP is not designed for high volume uploads, but the addon should be able to handie that okay. Another, simpler, option is to create a manual filter to COPY (not move) the messages from local folder to the IMAP folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
