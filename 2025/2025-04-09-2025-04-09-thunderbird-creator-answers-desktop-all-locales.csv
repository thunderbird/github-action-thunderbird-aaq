They first noticed the error (ss) about a couple of weeks ago and anything from then won't download (incoming), but I believe they are able to send emails. I can see that the messages are 'waiting' on the server at least and they can temporarily use Webmail. </p><p>I looked through the forums and any other info I could find and have checked or tried the following: </p> <ul><li> If their Antivirus or Firewall are blocking access </li><li> There is enough space on their system </li><li> File permissions for the 'Thunderbird' folder </li><li> Access details </li><li> Downgrading to an earlier version of Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>Unfortunately the error is still coming up each time they try to get their messages. </p><p>They have been using Thunderbird for almost a year now with one minor issue in that time. And I'm a bit puzzled as to what to try next. Has something similar happened to anyone else? Any suggestions for what I can do or check next? </p><p>The email account is through their domain and hosting and they are using Windows 8 and Thunderbird version 102.15.1 (from version 115.18.0 - 32-bit). </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1724494;,metalphoenix

When I check the task manager for activity, there is non. I.e. CPU activity is very low (where it should be about 80 - 100%) and no disk activiy is going on for about 30 min.  I close Thunderbird, but I can't reopen TB. It says it's already open. So I kill the tb process. Then I re-open TB and it has about 1.4GB of e-mail imported. crash reports bp-2189a8c5-f639-4dd2-abfb-257f10250408 bp-34687354-02bc-4ebe-90fc-855d20250408 </p><p>Is there something that can be done to fix the issue? </p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards, Hermann </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",hermann-san

Quando compongo la mail e poi voglio allegare un file pdf, andando alla ricerca della cartella sul server dove è salvato il file che voglio inviare, mi allega il link alla cartella e non mi entra dentro alla cartella dove è salvato il file stesso. Come posso risolverlo? Grazie a chiunque mi risponderà. Buona giornata a tutti </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,"",tommasopazzo
