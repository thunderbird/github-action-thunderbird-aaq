They first noticed the error (ss) about a couple of weeks ago and anything from then won't download (incoming), but I believe they are able to send emails. I can see that the messages are 'waiting' on the server at least and they can temporarily use Webmail. </p><p>I looked through the forums and any other info I could find and have checked or tried the following: </p> <ul><li> If their Antivirus or Firewall are blocking access </li><li> There is enough space on their system </li><li> File permissions for the 'Thunderbird' folder </li><li> Access details </li><li> Downgrading to an earlier version of Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>Unfortunately the error is still coming up each time they try to get their messages. </p><p>They have been using Thunderbird for almost a year now with one minor issue in that time. And I'm a bit puzzled as to what to try next. Has something similar happened to anyone else? Any suggestions for what I can do or check next? </p><p>The email account is through their domain and hosting and they are using Windows 8 and Thunderbird version 102.15.1 (from version 115.18.0 - 32-bit). </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1724494;,metalphoenix
