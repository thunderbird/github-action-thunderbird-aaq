And I'm a bit puzzled as to what to try next. Has something similar happened to anyone else?

I want to remain in body text - that is, with no double spacing of paragraphs - when I compose e-mails. I have done a good bit of searching and the answer I keep finding is ""Uncheck the 'Use paragraph format instead of body text' box in Composition on the Options tab."" The problem is that every time I close and re-open Thunderbird, the option has been automatically re-checked.  This happens even if I uncheck the box, close the program, and then immediately re-open it without having written an e-mail or done anything else. So this has nothing to do with importing formatting by responding to an existing e-mail. I found the corresponding setting in the Config Editor and set it to False, but the same thing happens: It defaults back to True as soon as I re-open Thunderbird.  Is there something I can do to keep that ""Use paragraph formatting"" option turned off?   </p><p>I am using Thunderbird version 68.12.1, 64 bit. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1724522;,shardstrat

Only Thunderbird is resisting re-installation.  Fortunately Webmail is working so we aren't quite cut off, but I'd like Thunderbird  back. The installation process tells me it's installed, but when I try it I get the message: 'Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account'.  </p><p>So: what can I do? How can Webmail be happily working with, presumably, those same settings?

I would have thought this should be pretty basic.. ie highlight the font and then select the font colour from the menu and choose a colour. Its seems when you choosing the colour from the mac colour picker the hex code in the thunderbird window and hence the colour does not update. If you manually type in the hex code in the thunderbird font colour picker then the colour can be changed which would be very painful. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1724547;,matthewmalios1967

Where do I go?   I want to configure compact because, ever since I said to compact automatically some months ago, the compact process causes (1) all emails in the current folder to disappear for some seconds and (2) cancels the conversation thread mode and I have to remember to un-cancel it.   If I can work out how to configure compact, I'll probably go back to doing it manually (at times that suit me) to avoid these 2 problems. </pre>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1724550;1724552;,Lindsay13Graham
