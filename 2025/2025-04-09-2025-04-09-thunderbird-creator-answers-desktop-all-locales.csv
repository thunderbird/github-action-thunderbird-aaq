I have done a good bit of searching and the answer I keep finding is ""Uncheck the 'Use paragraph format instead of body text' box in Composition on the Options tab."" The problem is that every time I close and re-open Thunderbird, the option has been automatically re-checked.  This happens even if I uncheck the box, close the program, and then immediately re-open it without having written an e-mail or done anything else. So this has nothing to do with importing formatting by responding to an existing e-mail. I found the corresponding setting in the Config Editor and set it to False, but the same thing happens: It defaults back to True as soon as I re-open Thunderbird.  Is there something I can do to keep that ""Use paragraph formatting"" option turned off?   </p><p>I am using Thunderbird version 68.12.1, 64 bit. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1724522;1724572;,shardstrat
