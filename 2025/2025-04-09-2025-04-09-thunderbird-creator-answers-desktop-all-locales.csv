They first noticed the error (ss) about a couple of weeks ago and anything from then won't download (incoming), but I believe they are able to send emails. I can see that the messages are 'waiting' on the server at least and they can temporarily use Webmail. </p><p>I looked through the forums and any other info I could find and have checked or tried the following: </p> <ul><li> If their Antivirus or Firewall are blocking access </li><li> There is enough space on their system </li><li> File permissions for the 'Thunderbird' folder </li><li> Access details </li><li> Downgrading to an earlier version of Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>Unfortunately the error is still coming up each time they try to get their messages. </p><p>They have been using Thunderbird for almost a year now with one minor issue in that time. And I'm a bit puzzled as to what to try next. Has something similar happened to anyone else? Any suggestions for what I can do or check next? </p><p>The email account is through their domain and hosting and they are using Windows 8 and Thunderbird version 102.15.1 (from version 115.18.0 - 32-bit). </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1724494;,metalphoenix

When I check the task manager for activity, there is non. I.e. CPU activity is very low (where it should be about 80 - 100%) and no disk activiy is going on for about 30 min.  I close Thunderbird, but I can't reopen TB. It says it's already open. So I kill the tb process. Then I re-open TB and it has about 1.4GB of e-mail imported. crash reports bp-2189a8c5-f639-4dd2-abfb-257f10250408 bp-34687354-02bc-4ebe-90fc-855d20250408 </p><p>Is there something that can be done to fix the issue? </p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards, Hermann </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",hermann-san

1504832,2025-04-09 02:08:16 -0700,2025-04-09 02:08:16 -0700,"""Use paragraph format instead of body text"" setting won't stick","<p>Hello. I want to remain in body text - that is, with no double spacing of paragraphs - when I compose e-mails. I have done a good bit of searching and the answer I keep finding is ""Uncheck the 'Use paragraph format instead of body text' box in Composition on the Options tab."" The problem is that every time I close and re-open Thunderbird, the option has been automatically re-checked.  This happens even if I uncheck the box, close the program, and then immediately re-open it without having written an e-mail or done anything else. So this has nothing to do with importing formatting by responding to an existing e-mail. I found the corresponding setting in the Config Editor and set it to False, but the same thing happens: It defaults back to True as soon as I re-open Thunderbird.  Is there something I can do to keep that ""Use paragraph formatting"" option turned off?   </p><p>I am using Thunderbird version 68.12.1, 64 bit. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",shardstrat

Only Thunderbird is resisting re-installation.  Fortunately Webmail is working so we aren't quite cut off, but I'd like Thunderbird  back. The installation process tells me it's installed, but when I try it I get the message: 'Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account'.  </p><p>So: what can I do? How can Webmail be happily working with, presumably, those same settings? I called Plusnet who were helpfull as ever but they couldn't do anything.  </p><p>Incidentally, Thunderbird and all its files disappeared during the recovery process - if that helps. I am in the habit of copying the Profiles to a memory stick every month   and have the most recent, about a month old. </p><p>Email: john@wilson48.plus.com </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",JOHN1170
