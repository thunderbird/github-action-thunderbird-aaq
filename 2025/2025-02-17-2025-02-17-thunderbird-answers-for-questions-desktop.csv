Forum email notifications appear to not be working for some reason, I don't get them either. But sorry about <i>my</i> delay, I was unsure how to proceed in your case so I decided to reply in other threads first while I figured what to do in this case…&nbsp;:) </p><p>The fact that the folder that has the problem is <i>Inbox</i> complicates matters by compounding the problem in that folder with the necessity to receive new incoming messages. We're going to separate the two problems by moving the file where the <i>Inbox</i> contents are stored on disk into <b>Local Folders</b>, so we me deal with it separately there, and make Thunderbird create a new empty <i>Inbox</i> to let you receive incoming messages normally. </p><p>The following article explains what's a profile and how to locate the profile folder in the filesystem, you probably know that already. We're going to move files around there: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p><p>Now, locate the folder within the profile folder where mail for this account is being stored. This being a POP account, it should be a folder within the <b>Mail</b> folder in the profile folder, named after the incoming server. If in doubt, you may go to <b>Account Settings &gt; Server Settings</b> in Thunderbird and check the <b>Local Directory</b> there. </p><p>You should see there files corresponding to each of the folders belonging to this account. Thunderbird stores mail using text files in mbox format with no filename extension. Accompanying <i>.msf</i> files are index files that can be removed, they're automatically re-created when not present. Now, proceed as follows: </p> <ol><li> Quit Thunderbird. </li><li> Make a backup copy of the profile folder, just in case. </li><li> Move <b>Inbox</b> from the account folder into <b>Local Folders</b> (which is located also in the <b>Mail</b> folder, together with the account folder). </li><li> Delete <b>Inbox.msf</b> </li><li> Launch Thunderbird. </li></ol> <p>As a result of having removed both <b>Inbox</b> and <b>Inbox.msf</b> from the account folder, Thunderbird should now create a new <i>Inbox</i> mbox file (and the associated <i>.msf</i> index) to store your incoming messages and you should be able to receive and see incoming mail normally now. </p><p>And as a result of having moved <i>Inbox</i> to <b>Local Folders</b> in the filesystem, a new <i>Inbox</i> folder should appear under <b>Local Folders</b> in the folder pane in Thunderbird… BUT… that may or may not solve the problem of messages not appearing there… If the mbox file is corrupt and Thunderbird cannot display its contents, there is little you can do about it, I at least don't know how to solve <i>that</i> problem… </p><p>Post back with the results and feel free to ask any questions you may have. </p><p>PS: You appear to be typing spaces or tabs at the beginning of paragraphs in your posts, presumably to indent them, but they're interpreted as meaning some special formatting that makes your posts more difficult to read.

There is always a great time to learn, but not if by so doing I am at risk of causing further damage, or ending up in a situation where I don't know what to do. What utilities would you suggest? How idiotproof are these things? Do they work their magic all by themselves, or, if they encounter an anomaly, do they ask you what you want to do? If so, that is not for me, and I will enlist the help of an IT professional locally, which may take a few days. I don't need to lead myself into further difficulty. I note your instructions for what to do after the disc utility, for which I thank you. Regarding your surprise at the size of the Inbox etc files which have appeared, I do not know how much of my mail is still on the server, and I am unclear whether the files which have magically reappeared have downloaded from the server or were here locally all along, but just not displaying for some reason. I had assumed the latter (for no valid reason).

It has not downloaded any Sent items, but maybe they are not retained on the server? It has not picked up the files from the POPMail2025-02-20.sbd folder. This is a matter of concern. I understand that this could be due to corruption, but something else has happened that is surely not right, and may also be the cause.  I will detail exactly what I did. I started in the Thunderbird Inbox window, deleting from Local Folders the POP Mail 2025-02-20 folder created previously, because I noted that all the other folder names did not contain spaces and I thought this might matter.  I then created a replacement new folder POPMail2025-02-20, and under that a sub-folder with the same name. Though I didn't think to screenshot it, those folder names were there in the panel on the left hand side of the Inbox window when I quit Thunderbird.  I then went to the file structure and checked that the POPMail2025-02-20.spd folder had been created under Local Folders (your Step 5).  Further down local folders were two new files POPMail2025-02-20 and a corresponding .msf file. At the time I mistakenly believed that they related to the original local folder I had created (and deleted) so I deleted them.  I then renamed the POP account folder in accordance with your Step 4, and started to copy (not move - I wasn't keen to delete things) the Inbox, Sent, etc files from the renamed account into the POPMail2025-02-20.spd folder (your step 6).  When I opened that folder (which I expected to be empty) I noted that there were another two files POPMail2025-02-20 and the corresponding .msf file. I left them alone. At this point I spotted the pattern that Thunderbird creates these files as a result of a new Local Folder being set up, and that the two I had deleted from Local Folders had been created by this mechanism second time around, rather than relating to my original Local Folder POP Mail 2025-02-20.  I then launched Thunderbird.  The Inbox window came up and downloading from the server started.  At this point I noticed that, under Local Folders in this view, the POPMail2025-02-20 folder and its subfolder of the same name, which I had created, were not there.  They were when I previously quit Thunderbird. Can this be why Thunderbird has not picked up the contents of the .spd folder.  I attach  3 relevant screenshots. Help Please! I am very keen to undo whatever has to be undone and to repeat the process, or to try another route to get Thunderbird to make these files visible. As ever, thank you. Iain </p>",iwright2,false,0,0

What has me confused is how or where you are finding a web page showing complete themes either via browser or from Thunderbird's add-on manager  I can not  replicate that at all.  I recall seeing it in the past,  but I can not longer get such a category to show. ahh, found it,  it is still indexed at google,   just not visible on the main web page so a google search for ""complete themes"" will locate the page on which nothing is compatible with a version after 68.  I guess it was left on the server for the Luddites that have not updated their Thunderbird for years. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

SO I guess you have a third party one,  probably injected into Thunderbird by an antivirus product.  Try disabling the feature in your antivirus program and restarting your computer just to clear the air and see if that makes it better. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
