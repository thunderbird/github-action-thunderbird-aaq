Some things to note: </p> <ul><li> There should only be 1 <b>Local Folders</b> (with no <i>.sbd</i> suffix) at the top within the <b>Mail</b> folder. Knowing what you did that caused not 1 but 2  <b>Local Folders.sbd</b> subfolders within it might help. </li><li> For each folder used to store messages in Thunderbird, there should be a corresponding text file in mbox format (with no filename extension) and an accompanying <i>.msf</i> index file. An additional <i>.sbd</i> folder with the same name would appear only if you had created subfolders of that folder in Thunderbird. It seems strange that for what appears to be every leaf (final) folder used to store messages in Thunderbird, there appears to also be a <i>.sbd</i> folder in the filesystem. It's as if you had created subfolders for every leaf folder in Thunderbird. Again, that's weird, not necessarily wrong, but has to be the result of something you did… </li></ul> <p>You could try to fix that by tidying up the <b>Local Folders</b> filesystem hierarchy (quit Thunderbird and make a backup copy of the profile folder before start moving files around), but it's unclear to me why/how would you have got into this mess to begin with… Was it working fine on the old PC? Do you still have access to it? Does it show the same <b>Local Folders</b> filesystem hierarchy? </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
