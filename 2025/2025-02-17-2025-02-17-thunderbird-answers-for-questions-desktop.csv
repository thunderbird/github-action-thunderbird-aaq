This being a POP account, it should be a folder within the <b>Mail</b> folder in the profile folder, named after the incoming server. If in doubt, you may go to <b>Account Settings &gt; Server Settings</b> in Thunderbird and check the <b>Local Directory</b> there. </p><p>You should see there files corresponding to each of the folders belonging to this account. Thunderbird stores mail using text files in mbox format with no filename extension. Accompanying <i>.msf</i> files are index files that can be removed, they're automatically re-created when not present. Now, proceed as follows: </p> <ol><li> Quit Thunderbird. </li><li> Make a backup copy of the profile folder, just in case. </li><li> Move <b>Inbox</b> from the account folder into <b>Local Folders</b> (which is located also in the <b>Mail</b> folder, together with the account folder). </li><li> Delete <b>Inbox.msf</b> </li><li> Launch Thunderbird. </li></ol> <p>As a result of having removed both <b>Inbox</b> and <b>Inbox.msf</b> from the account folder, Thunderbird should now create a new <i>Inbox</i> mbox file (and the associated <i>.msf</i> index) to store your incoming messages and you should be able to receive and see incoming mail normally now. </p><p>And as a result of having moved <i>Inbox</i> to <b>Local Folders</b> in the filesystem, a new <i>Inbox</i> folder should appear under <b>Local Folders</b> in the folder pane in Thunderbird… BUT… that may or may not solve the problem of messages not appearing there… If the mbox file is corrupt and Thunderbird cannot display its contents, there is little you can do about it, I at least don't know how to solve <i>that</i> problem… </p><p>Post back with the results and feel free to ask any questions you may have. </p><p>PS: You appear to be typing spaces or tabs at the beginning of paragraphs in your posts, presumably to indent them, but they're interpreted as meaning some special formatting that makes your posts more difficult to read.

From the details you shared, it looks like the problem may be due to a corrupted index file, especially since you've identified the `Inbox.msf` file as being 0 KB. This file is used by Thunderbird to index the messages in your Inbox, and if it gets corrupted, it can cause the inbox to appear empty. </p><p>First, I suggest you try deleting the `Inbox.msf` file. Go to the folder where Thunderbird stores your emails (`C:\Users\Iain\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\bv3rkl2t.default\Mail\<a href=""http://mail.salight.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.salight.co.uk</a>\Inbox`) and find the `Inbox.msf` file. Make sure you don’t delete the actual `Inbox` file, just the `.msf` index file. Once deleted, restart Thunderbird, and it should rebuild the index automatically. This can often fix the issue where the Inbox isn't displaying messages properly. </p><p>Additionally, check the file permissions of your Thunderbird profile directory. Sometimes, antivirus software or security settings can lock files<a href=""https://ssoids.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">,</a> preventing Thunderbird from accessing them properly. Ensuring that the files are accessible and not locked could help resolve the issue. </p><p>It’s also a good idea to back up your Thunderbird profile if you haven’t already. This will ensure that you have a copy of your important data in case anything goes wrong. You can find the backup instructions on the Mozilla support site, which will guide you through the process. </p><p>If these steps don’t work, the problem might be more complex, possibly involving deeper file corruption or a configuration issue.

""Allow immediate notifications...""</blockquote> <p>This is an IMAP account, right? Unchecking those settings wold be enough for a POP account, because a POP client only needs to connect to the server to check for new messages, but not for IMAP, because the nature of IMAP is that everything is stored <i>on the server</i> and hence the mail client needs to connect to the server to remain in sync, not just to check for new mail, so every time you tell Thunderbird to show the contents of a folder, you're telling it to connect to the server for synchronisation reasons. Using an IMAP account, meant to store mail <i>on the server</i>, for <i>local</i> archiving purposes is fundamentally wrong. You're trying to use the account for something it's not meant for. </p><p>You need to decide first whether you want to keep your mail stored locally on your computer, remotely on some server, or both, and then use the right tool for <i>that</i>. For mail to be stored remotely on a server, you need an <i>active</i> IMAP account. For mail you want to keep stored locally on your computer using Thunderbird, you may use <b>Local Folders</b>, at the bottom of the list of accounts in the folder pane. You may create folders there to store and organise your mail locally on your computer however you wish, independently of any mail account you may have. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
