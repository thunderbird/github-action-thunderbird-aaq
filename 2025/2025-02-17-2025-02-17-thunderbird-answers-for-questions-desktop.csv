Forum email notifications appear to not be working for some reason, I don't get them either. But sorry about <i>my</i> delay, I was unsure how to proceed in your case so I decided to reply in other threads first while I figured what to do in this case…&nbsp;:) </p><p>The fact that the folder that has the problem is <i>Inbox</i> complicates matters by compounding the problem in that folder with the necessity to receive new incoming messages. We're going to separate the two problems by moving the file where the <i>Inbox</i> contents are stored on disk into <b>Local Folders</b>, so we me deal with it separately there, and make Thunderbird create a new empty <i>Inbox</i> to let you receive incoming messages normally. </p><p>The following article explains what's a profile and how to locate the profile folder in the filesystem, you probably know that already. We're going to move files around there: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p><p>Now, locate the folder within the profile folder where mail for this account is being stored. This being a POP account, it should be a folder within the <b>Mail</b> folder in the profile folder, named after the incoming server. If in doubt, you may go to <b>Account Settings &gt; Server Settings</b> in Thunderbird and check the <b>Local Directory</b> there. </p><p>You should see there files corresponding to each of the folders belonging to this account. Thunderbird stores mail using text files in mbox format with no filename extension. Accompanying <i>.msf</i> files are index files that can be removed, they're automatically re-created when not present. Now, proceed as follows: </p> <ol><li> Quit Thunderbird. </li><li> Make a backup copy of the profile folder, just in case. </li><li> Move <b>Inbox</b> from the account folder into <b>Local Folders</b> (which is located also in the <b>Mail</b> folder, together with the account folder). </li><li> Delete <b>Inbox.msf</b> </li><li> Launch Thunderbird. </li></ol> <p>As a result of having removed both <b>Inbox</b> and <b>Inbox.msf</b> from the account folder, Thunderbird should now create a new <i>Inbox</i> mbox file (and the associated <i>.msf</i> index) to store your incoming messages and you should be able to receive and see incoming mail normally now. </p><p>And as a result of having moved <i>Inbox</i> to <b>Local Folders</b> in the filesystem, a new <i>Inbox</i> folder should appear under <b>Local Folders</b> in the folder pane in Thunderbird… BUT… that may or may not solve the problem of messages not appearing there… If the mbox file is corrupt and Thunderbird cannot display its contents, there is little you can do about it, I at least don't know how to solve <i>that</i> problem… </p><p>Post back with the results and feel free to ask any questions you may have. </p><p>PS: You appear to be typing spaces or tabs at the beginning of paragraphs in your posts, presumably to indent them, but they're interpreted as meaning some special formatting that makes your posts more difficult to read.

""Allow immediate notifications...""</blockquote> <p>This is an IMAP account, right? Unchecking those settings wold be enough for a POP account, because a POP client only needs to connect to the server to check for new messages, but not for IMAP, because the nature of IMAP is that everything is stored <i>on the server</i> and hence the mail client needs to connect to the server to remain in sync, not just to check for new mail, so every time you tell Thunderbird to show the contents of a folder, you're telling it to connect to the server for synchronisation reasons. Using an IMAP account, meant to store mail <i>on the server</i>, for <i>local</i> archiving purposes is fundamentally wrong. You're trying to use the account for something it's not meant for. </p><p>You need to decide first whether you want to keep your mail stored locally on your computer, remotely on some server, or both, and then use the right tool for <i>that</i>. For mail to be stored remotely on a server, you need an <i>active</i> IMAP account. For mail you want to keep stored locally on your computer using Thunderbird, you may use <b>Local Folders</b>, at the bottom of the list of accounts in the folder pane.
