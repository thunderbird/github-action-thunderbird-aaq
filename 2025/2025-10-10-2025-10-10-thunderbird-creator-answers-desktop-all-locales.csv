I've tried to read about fixing these myself, to no avail. (I mean, I can Read; I just can't fix this.) I've tried to Compact ALL folders individually. But that seemed to do nothing. (Before 6 October, the Thunderbird window would at least ""flicker"" a little after compact.) Trash is empty. Tried disabling McAfee AntiVirus &amp; Firewall. And, no, this isn't happening because I'm using McAfee; I've been using McAfee since Windows XP and Thunderbird since before it ""broke away"" from Mozilla. They have, until 6 October, played nice together. I really like Thunderbird so I do not want to find another email client/program/what-have-you. There are LOTS of saved emails that I cannot move/copy to ""save space"", so...Help? Please? </p><p>Thanking you in advance, tonyg </p><p>P.S.-I am not computer illiterate.

But the Thunderbird address book on the Samsung only shows the email addresses associated with emails that have been sent or received since I installed  Thunderbird on the Samsung. It does not include the rest of my address book. Similarly, it only contains the emails that have been sent or received since I installed Thunderbird on the Samsung. When I follow the instructions to open the (Thunderbird) profile folder, I get a message that says “C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\fbclykvb.default-esr is unavailable.” </p><p>With help from Currys (where I had bought the Samsung), we were able to copy the (ApsData) Thunderbird folder from the (old) HP laptop to the (new) Samsung) laptop.  (They also ran something called mailmerge, but I didn’t follow the precise details.) I can now find the Thuderbird folder in the AppData/Roaming folder. In the Profiles, there are 2 subfolders, hw7ms2fs.default-release and w1a31rjn.default. w1a31rjn.default has only one file – times.json hw7ms2fs.default-release has lots of subfolders and files, but no file named fbclykvb.default-esr. Thunderbird is still working properly  on the Samsung, but I still can not access my larger address book, or emails that were receive or sent by Thunderbird on the HP. How do I fix it? The people at Currys tried to help, but they don’t know much about Thunderbird, and said I needed to get support from Mozilla. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",JPGunn54
