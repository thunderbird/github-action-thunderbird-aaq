But the Thunderbird address book on the Samsung only shows the email addresses associated with emails that have been sent or received since I installed  Thunderbird on the Samsung. It does not include the rest of my address book. Similarly, it only contains the emails that have been sent or received since I installed Thunderbird on the Samsung.

(They also ran something called mailmerge, but I didn’t follow the precise details.) I can now find the Thuderbird folder in the AppData/Roaming folder. In the Profiles, there are 2 subfolders, hw7ms2fs.default-release and w1a31rjn.default. w1a31rjn.default has only one file – times.json hw7ms2fs.default-release has lots of subfolders and files, but no file named fbclykvb.default-esr. Thunderbird is still working properly  on the Samsung, but I still can not access my larger address book, or emails that were receive or sent by Thunderbird on the HP. How do I fix it? The people at Currys tried to help, but they don’t know much about Thunderbird, and said I needed to get support from Mozilla. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1771032;,JPGunn54
