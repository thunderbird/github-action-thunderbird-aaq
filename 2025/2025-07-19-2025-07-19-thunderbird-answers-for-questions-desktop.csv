Incoming mail is only going to the AllMail folder (unlike before, when everything would also go to my Inbox, unless it was blocked or designated as spam). And there has been a marked reduction in the number of emails coming in even to AllMail. Not sure what might have caused this. I did all the things suggested for gmail: deleted unimportant messages, buying more storage. I am using less than 10% of my google storage at this point. So I suspect it's a Thunderbird issue. I am unaware of changing any settings in TBird, though. The problem started overnight. </p>",landesroger,false,0,0

You will get better advice if you post screenshot of what you are wanting to import. Asking for advice on the end result is fruitless. We have no idea what you imported. You cannot just import messages, so a screenshot may explain what you're attempting. My guess is that you have messages from a POP account and want to switch to betterbird. AND, since you prefer betterbird, why are you coming here for advice? </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So, prior to the upgrade, I suggest you exit thunderbird and do backup of the profile. THEN, I suggest uninstalling the 32-bit version (do NOT check the option to 'remove data') and then install the 64-bit version. The profile should remain intact. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
