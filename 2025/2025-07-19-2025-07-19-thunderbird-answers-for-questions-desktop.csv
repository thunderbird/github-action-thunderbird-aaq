Do you receive mail on the PC when the phone is turned off? There are two possibilities; one is that the settings on PC are wrong, causing you to not receive mail. The other option is that the phone is set for POP and retrieves messages and deletes from server. You can verify which it is by these steps: - turn phone off - from online account, send yourself an email  - see if you receive it on PC  - after checking that, turn phone on and check mail there </p><p>If you received it on PC, then the phone is the problem.
