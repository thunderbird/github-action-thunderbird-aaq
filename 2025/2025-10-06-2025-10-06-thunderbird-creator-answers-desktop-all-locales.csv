There are two users on the old computer, both with Thunderbird.  When moving the email profile to the new computer, does it pick up both users, or does this need to be done separately for each individual Thunderbird email account?  If so, I assume I need to set up both users on the new computer before starting the Thunderbird move.  Also, how can I be absolutely sure I'm dealing with a recent enough email version on the old computer?  My Thunderbird updates frequently but the new one seems to be slightly off. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",glennedward
