There are two users on the old computer, both with Thunderbird.  When moving the email profile to the new computer, does it pick up both users, or does this need to be done separately for each individual Thunderbird email account?  If so, I assume I need to set up both users on the new computer before starting the Thunderbird move.  Also, how can I be absolutely sure I'm dealing with a recent enough email version on the old computer?  My Thunderbird updates frequently but the new one seems to be slightly off. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1770009;,glennedward

Any modifiers like -crlfeol, -text, -binary, ... did not make a difference. </p><p>Omitting signed attributes (-noattr) however helped. The signature was verified. </p><p>Looking at the signed attributes, nothing seems wrong: hash in messageDigest is correct, sha256 and rsaEncryption is given. Checking more carefully the signature, the hash of the attribute section is also correct. Manually verifying the DER attribute section with the given signature is also fine. </p><p>The question is, what is the reason that Thunderbird rejects the signature? I didn't manage to produce a log output of the verification, so this general error 1041 is all I have. Is Thunderbird more strict as openssl? And if so, at what point?   </p><p>The only point I see where there could be a problem in handling the attributes is the header of the DER attribute section. In the full signature this starts with 0xa0, as stand-alone block it should be 0x31 - only then the hash matches. However, that's wild guessing. </p><p>Any ideas?
