Any modifiers like -crlfeol, -text, -binary, ... did not make a difference. </p><p>Omitting signed attributes (-noattr) however helped. The signature was verified. </p><p>Further investigations now showed that the reason for that is a mismatch of the signing time in the signed attributes block with the RFC 5322 date in the header (or a missing date, which is the reason, the openssl smime output is rejected). If there is no match, Thunderbird shows a 1041 error (unknown problems with the signature). </p><p>However, I'm wondering whether such a test a reasonable. The standards don’t instruct MUAs to compare signingTime to the RFC 5322 Date. Flagging a mismatch is not required by spec and in my opinion adds little to no security value. The RFC date header can be easily modified and the signing time is openly readable.  </p><p>Does anyone knows why it has been decided to test that? </p>",thunderbird;security;,thunderbird,security,en-US,1770871;,EinPhysiker

I close the pop-up and a 2nd one pops-up.  I close it and say 10 or 15 mins they pop back up in the same series. It's very frustrating. I can't tell if it's Yahoo or a scam cookie.  I notice the URL at the top of page and it's the same one every time and every day. The same URL shows:  ""<a href=""https://login.yahoo.com/?src=thunderbird&amp;client_id=dj0yJmk9NUtCTWFMNVpTaVJmJmQ9WVdrOVJ6UjVTa2xJTXpRbWNHbzlNQS0tJnM9Y29uc3VtZXJzZWNyZXQmeD0yYw--&amp;crumb=uE2cxQuNxpE&amp;login_hint="" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.yahoo.com/?src=thunderbird&amp;client_id=dj0yJmk9NUtCTWFMNVpTaVJmJmQ9WVdrOVJ6UjVTa2xJTXpRbWNHbzlNQS0tJnM9Y29uc3VtZXJzZWNyZXQmeD0yYw--&amp;crumb=uE2cxQuNxpE&amp;login_hint=</a> ...""  &lt;... it goes on for a few more lines.  It's long. I went to Firefox and cleared all 'cache' and 'cookies' and they still pop-up in Thunderbird.  Heck, they just popped up again while writing you! How do I stop this intrusion while using Thunderbird? Thanks, RonD </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1770110;1770124;,goCaT2web

Also, I have another account linked to my Thunderbird, with no changed credentials, and while there is no similar error message, thunderbird suddenly also has problems connecting to it and asks to retry a few times (3-4) before actually connecting everytime I open it. </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,1770107;1770111;1770117;1770128;1770142;,lilithoma11
