They see email for communication, and since HTML is a markup language, you can never know how your message is received. And, all of what you want to do can be done in Thunderbird. Multiple fonts, different sizes, underlines, etc. But, since HTML is  a markup language, it sometimes requires some tweaking. You can do some extra editing - and also see how the markup language is applied, by adding this addon - thunderbirdHTMLedit, from <a href=""https://betterbird.eu/addons/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://betterbird.eu/addons/index.html</a> </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

MS Outlook desktop software may do what you want, as my perception is that the MS word processor function can create email (but it's been two decades since I've used that software). Otherwise, I am not aware of any email client that handles HTML as you desire. That is largely due to the dependence on HTML tags as a markup language. Use of Thunderbird for extensive HTML composition is a rare question here, as the majority seem content with occasional HTML emphasis facilities.  I do recommend you try the thunderhtmedit addon again, as it is superior by far, in my opinion. And simpler to use. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Thunderbird opens this file:  c:\users\&lt;your id&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.ini to get the name and location of the profile. You can edit that yourself with Notepad, or you can, from desktop, do this:  - click windows key and 'r' key  - enter thunderbird.exe   -p    and press enter - this is the profile manager. click the 'create profile' button and follow the steps to locate your profile, give a shortcut name, then click 'choose' and then finish and launch </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I kept a backup copy of that file - it is 499 Mb as I have emails back to 2011 mostly in off-line folders on my PC! Having done that only one of errant emails nnow shows up in the search results but that does open fully show the email when clicked on. I guess the fact that the other one doesn't now show up even in the index means that at about that time there was a glitch of some kind and one of the mails somehow got deleted or not saved, although it was indexed. Unless you can think of any further things to try. The volume of my email database may be part of the problem. I seem to remember that a couple of years ago I was having a problem of some sort and I had to move most of the years out of my Thunderbird folders into off-line storage still in the profile. I'll consider storing most of the older year's folders on the PC Instead. How best should I do that but still allow me to search that data set  if required? Thanks again! </p>",quakerdave,false,0,0

At least the indexed messages are now opening which is the main problem. The loss of this one email and attachment isn't a problem.

Here goes: </p> <ol><li>  in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  </li><li>  then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top.

Notice I also set monospace font. </li><li> if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font.

You can see it while composing when selecting other styles, but that's manually done each time. I think you will do best by creating templates. Thunderbird's terminology generally follows normal expectations; for example, header one generates the H1 tag, header two generates the h2 tag, etc. How that appears to recipients depends on how their email client represents it. If a user just wants a special sig, that is readily done with HTML in the account pane - but requires the user to know sufficient HTML to do that.  Changing H1 to  4pt Arial would require a special style sheet, so a template would be the only approach that I can see. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
