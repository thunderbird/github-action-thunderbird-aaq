I fixed it by clearing the cache and restarting the app. If that does not work, try checking your notification settings or reinstalling the app! </p>",rke35511,false,0,0

As I have mentioned, the email comes internally and in the web UI on gmail it is marked ""This message was not sent to Spam based on your organization's settings."" So the issue is stricly TB. </p><p>I don't have a filter, but if the junk filter works properly it shouldn't be necessary.
