They provide my internet service and email. I have been using Thunderbird for many years and know it quite well. My issue is this.  About a year ago Centurylink had a major update with it's services. Since that time I've been having issues using Thunderbird for my e-mail.  I'm currently using the 139.0.2 (64-bit) release. </p><p>Getting e-mail using Thunderbird is very slow and sometimes nearly impossible.  I have to open the Centurylink e-mail and get caught up on e-mail using their e-mail service.  They also want me to start paying for the e-mail service through <a href=""http://Centurylink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Centurylink.net</a> services. </p><p>Another anomaly is any sent messages I send using Thunderbird will not post to my Sent folder in Thunderbird.  I use IMAP because my Desktop and Laptop share the same e-mail so I can have those readily available on each.  I have been through all of Thunderbirds settings multiple times chasing a remedy to these issues without any results. This is very frustrating! </p><p>If I delete my e-mail account from <a href=""http://Centurylink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Centurylink.net</a> and attempt to use Thunderbird solely, would this be something you would suggest? I'm not familiar with how to SAVE Thunderbird e-mail files when changing ISP's or where the information is saved.  That is very important to me before attempting too many changes in trying to find a temporary remedy to these issues. </p><p>I'm trying to hold out for any big changes for another year, due to getting fiber brought into our area and access provided to all customers in the next year. </p><p>I'm very excited about Thunder having e-mail provided exclusively. However, not seeing any target dates for this service, I'm trying to put off having to jump through two or three changes until our fiber is available.  </p><p>Any help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you in advance for the help! </p><p>John N. Miller </p><p>PS. I have just donated another $20.00 toward Thundermail and Thunderbird Pro projects. </p>",jmil43;wsmwk;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:139.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/139.0;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/faq-changing-imap-pop""]",1,0,1,,,
