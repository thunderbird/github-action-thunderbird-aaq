I set Thunderbird to use the ""table""format for incoming messages and it says ""Views updated and installed"" or something like <a href=""http://that.My"" rel=""nofollow"">that.My</a> choices do not stick, and T-bird reverts back to some default view i do not like. This started when I installed a T-bird upgrade to automatically add new functions monthly.  </p><p>1) How do i make my changes stick?  2) Or is this a bug that will be fixed in the next update?  3) Something else. </p><p>Thanks in advance,  </p><p>Chris Wood </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1743689;,lw85381

Rather than me going through every filter manually, can't Thunderbird tell me which filter affected a given message? I'd like to be able to right-click a message and be shown the exact filter(s) which affected it. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1743683;1743695;,mozilla448

I backed up my profile and installed Release 139.0.2.  The following error is now popping up periodically in Thunderbird: ""The folder 'Inbox on [myemailaddress]' could not be compacted because writing to folder failed. Verify that you have enough disk space, and that you have write privileges to the file system, then try again."" </p><p>I do not think this message is really related to disk space (there's plenty available) or file write privileges since nothing should have changed.  I see that others have encountered this message where Thunderbird is trying to compact other folders.  However, I did not see a solution applicable to my situation. </p><p>Thank you, in advance, for any insight in getting rid of this error. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",jer042000
