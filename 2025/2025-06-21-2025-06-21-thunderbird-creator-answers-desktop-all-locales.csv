I set Thunderbird to use the ""table""format for incoming messages and it says ""Views updated and installed"" or something like <a href=""http://that.My"" rel=""nofollow"">that.My</a> choices do not stick, and T-bird reverts back to some default view i do not like. This started when I installed a T-bird upgrade to automatically add new functions monthly.  </p><p>1) How do i make my changes stick?  2) Or is this a bug that will be fixed in the next update?  3) Something else. </p><p>Thanks in advance,  </p><p>Chris Wood </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",lw85381

Rather than me going through every filter manually, can't Thunderbird tell me which filter affected a given message? I'd like to be able to right-click a message and be shown the exact filter(s) which affected it. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mozilla448
