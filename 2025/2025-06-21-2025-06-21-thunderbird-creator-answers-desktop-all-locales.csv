I set Thunderbird to use the ""table""format for incoming messages and it says ""Views updated and installed"" or something like <a href=""http://that.My"" rel=""nofollow"">that.My</a> choices do not stick, and T-bird reverts back to some default view i do not like. This started when I installed a T-bird upgrade to automatically add new functions monthly.  </p><p>1) How do i make my changes stick?  2) Or is this a bug that will be fixed in the next update?  3) Something else. </p><p>Thanks in advance,  </p><p>Chris Wood </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1743689;,lw85381

Rather than me going through every filter manually, can't Thunderbird tell me which filter affected a given message? I'd like to be able to right-click a message and be shown the exact filter(s) which affected it. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1743683;1743695;,mozilla448

I backed up my profile and installed Release 139.0.2.  The following error is now popping up periodically in Thunderbird: ""The folder 'Inbox on [myemailaddress]' could not be compacted because writing to folder failed. Verify that you have enough disk space, and that you have write privileges to the file system, then try again."" </p><p>I do not think this message is really related to disk space (there's plenty available) or file write privileges since nothing should have changed.  I see that others have encountered this message where Thunderbird is trying to compact other folders.  However, I did not see a solution applicable to my situation. </p><p>Thank you, in advance, for any insight in getting rid of this error. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1743711;,jer042000

They provide my internet service and email. I have been using Thunderbird for many years and know it quite well. My issue is this.  About a year ago Centurylink had a major update with it's services. Since that time I've been having issues using Thunderbird for my e-mail.  I'm currently using the 139.0.2 (64-bit) release. </p><p>Getting e-mail using Thunderbird is very slow and sometimes nearly impossible.  I have to open the Centurylink e-mail and get caught up on e-mail using their e-mail service.  They also want me to start paying for the e-mail service through <a href=""http://Centurylink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Centurylink.net</a> services. </p><p>Another anomaly is any sent messages I send using Thunderbird will not post to my Sent folder in Thunderbird.  I use IMAP because my Desktop and Laptop share the same e-mail so I can have those readily available on each.  I have been through all of Thunderbirds settings multiple times chasing a remedy to these issues without any results. This is very frustrating! </p><p>If I delete my e-mail account from <a href=""http://Centurylink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Centurylink.net</a> and attempt to use Thunderbird solely, would this be something you would suggest? I'm not familiar with how to SAVE Thunderbird e-mail files when changing ISP's or where the information is saved.  That is very important to me before attempting too many changes in trying to find a temporary remedy to these issues. </p><p>I'm trying to hold out for any big changes for another year, due to getting fiber brought into our area and access provided to all customers in the next year. </p><p>I'm very excited about Thunder having e-mail provided exclusively. However, not seeing any target dates for this service, I'm trying to put off having to jump through two or three changes until our fiber is available.  </p><p>Any help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you in advance for the help! </p><p>John N. Miller </p><p>PS. I have just donated another $20.00 toward Thundermail and Thunderbird Pro projects. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jmil43

I'd like to move over to Thunderbird. </p><p>I have several GB of dbx files that I would like to import/transfer/convert and be able to access in Thunderbird. </p><p>I tried to use the import tool in thunderbird, but choosing ""Import from Outlook"" gives me the error: ""There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."" I don't see how this is relevant.  Regardless, I have now selected outlook express as the default email action, but get the same error. </p><p>I have also tried the ""Import from file"" option, but the only options are ""backed up profile"", ""calendars"", ""address books"". It would seem to me that it would be common for people to move from Outlook Express to Thunderbird, so it seems bizarre to me that there isn't an option to import DBX files.   I've opened DBX files in notepad before, I know they're just text, importing them should be a no-brainer.  Do I have to write my own conversion program? </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1743722;,thunderbirdquestion1
