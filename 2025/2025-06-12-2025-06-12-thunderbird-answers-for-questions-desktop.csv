It will say 'Value data:' and this is where you remove the contents and then type in a suitable negative number. You might need to enter: -255  or if you already see a number simlilar to that try something larger such as: -360 Then click on 'OK' Whatever you set for ScrollHeight', you need to also set up for 'ScrollWidth'. </p><p><strong>But in Thunderbird, you may want to set this up with specific control:</strong> In Thunderbird. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Scroll to bottom and click on 'Config Editor' button </li></ul> <p>It opens in a new tab </p> <ul><li> In top search area type: <strong>scrollbar.</strong> </li><li> Look for the following 3 lines (as numbered below) and edit them. </li></ul> <p><strong>1.</strong> 'widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.size.override' - change number to eg: 50 (you can modify this a suitable size ) <strong>2.</strong> 'widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style' - change number to 4 <strong>3.</strong> 'widget.non-native-theme.win.scrollbar.use-system-size' - toggle to say 'false' </p> <ul><li> To edit a number click on the 'pencil' icon </li><li> Change number and then click on the 'tick' icon to save </li><li> To toggle from true to false - clickon the far right toggle icon </li></ul> <p>Once you have those three set up, you can then alter the first one to find a suitable size.

Please confirm you have this set up. </p><p><strong>Anti-Virus:</strong> This might be set up to auto scan any file that gets opened etc, so could be causing an interference when Thunderbird is starting up or even when attempting to download. I would advise that you set up an exemption to not scan your <strong>Thunderbird</strong> folder that contains all info on profile(s). If you downloaded Thunderbird from the official website&nbsp;: <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> Then the profile will by default be here: C:/Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </p><p>Another way to check if AV is an issue: Restart computer in 'Safe mode with Networking' mode - please note you will need to use an ethernet cable to connect computer to router as it will not work using wireless connection. </p><p><strong>VPN</strong> Please check your computer to see if you have enabled a VPN. Many Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and some auto enable it.  I use Norton365 and after an update discovered it has auto enabled a VPN which basically caused all kinds of issues. Most servers do not like VPN because it hides the expected IP address, so server blocks access because it thinks you are a hacker. Switch off the VPN or you can create a split tunnelling and set up Thunderbird to use it. </p><p>Report back to confirm Thunderbird is set up as allowed program, AV is not auto scanning your profile, there's no VPN operating. </p><p>Now please offer the following information: <strong>Q: </strong>Are you both using the same computer or different computers&nbsp;? <strong>Q: </strong>What OS are you both using? Windows 10, 11, MAC, Linux&nbsp;? <strong>Q: </strong>What version of Thunderbird are you both using? </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What type of mail account are you and your wife using  - Pop or IMAP&nbsp;? <strong>Q: </strong>What Anti-Virus have you got installed on computer (s)&nbsp;? </p><p>Please post information so we understand what server you are trying to connect to and what server settings you currently using. Post images that show: </p> <ol><li> Account Settings &gt; Server Settings </li><li> and also the 'Outgoing Server SMTP' Settings </li></ol> <p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Scroll down to 'Mail &amp; News Accounts' section </li><li> Either post an image showing all that section or Copy all the dta in that section and paste it into this forum question. </li></ul> <p>Don't forget to post the info asked by david - image of any error message is important. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Hierdoor ontstaat een grote kans op misbruik van dat apparaat en daar moet je dus ook geen belangrijke apps, zoals die van de bank, op willen installeren. Helaas zit er dan niets anders op dan een nieuw apparaat te kopen. </p>",Mozilla-assistent,false,0,0
