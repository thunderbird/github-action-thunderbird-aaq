Check the account settings have expunge inbox on on exit checked and that the user actually restarts the application frequently.

My guess is it is.  </p><p>Compacting forces an expunge server side as a part of the process although I have a sneaking feeling that was dropped in the last couple of versions instead relying on the preference mail.imap.expunge_option and Thunderbird actually closing down to send the expunge message. </p><p>So; </p> <ul><li> Check in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">Config Editor</a> that mail.imap.expunge_option is not set to 0 </li><li> Check the user actually shuts down Thunderbird to allow the expunge housekeeping to run. </li><li> If the user has a laptop, ensure they actually shut it down before disconnecting from the network.  It may be that Thunderbird is still running in the background when they literally pull the plug so housekkeping fails daily. </li><li> Check the user has not gone and set Thunderbird to check mail every minute or two,  basically nothing else will ever happen and all mail may never be downloaded in that scenario.

The 11.4Gb mbox returns almost 12000 matches.

The Thunderbird program must be set up as an allowed program. Please confirm you have this set up. </p><p><strong>Anti-Virus:</strong> This might be set up to auto scan any file that gets opened etc, so could be causing an interference when Thunderbird is starting up or even when attempting to download. I would advise that you set up an exemption to not scan your <strong>Thunderbird</strong> folder that contains all info on profile(s). If you downloaded Thunderbird from the official website&nbsp;: <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> Then the profile will by default be here: C:/Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </p><p>Another way to check if AV is an issue: Restart computer in 'Safe mode with Networking' mode - please note you will need to use an ethernet cable to connect computer to router as it will not work using wireless connection. </p><p><strong>VPN</strong> Please check your computer to see if you have enabled a VPN. Many Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and some auto enable it.  I use Norton365 and after an update discovered it has auto enabled a VPN which basically caused all kinds of issues. Most servers do not like VPN because it hides the expected IP address, so server blocks access because it thinks you are a hacker. Switch off the VPN or you can create a split tunnelling and set up Thunderbird to use it. </p><p>Report back to confirm Thunderbird is set up as allowed program, AV is not auto scanning your profile, there's no VPN operating. </p><p>Now please offer the following information: <strong>Q: </strong>Are you both using the same computer or different computers&nbsp;? <strong>Q: </strong>What OS are you both using? Windows 10, 11, MAC, Linux&nbsp;? <strong>Q: </strong>What version of Thunderbird are you both using? </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What type of mail account are you and your wife using  - Pop or IMAP&nbsp;? <strong>Q: </strong>What Anti-Virus have you got installed on computer (s)&nbsp;? </p><p>Please post information so we understand what server you are trying to connect to and what server settings you currently using.
