All email addresses in the Microsoft Account are now regarded by Microsoft as 'alias' accounts. Whether they are <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>, <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> or <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> or any other email address that uses the outlook office365 servers. They need to use same 'password' as the Microsoft Account. One of the email addresses will be set up as 'primary'. You can chose whatever is set up 'primary', but whatever you set up can only be used as the smtp server for all email addresses/mail accounts in third party email clients.   You said ""  I wonder if there is a conflict when I have both a school email account and a personal outlook account in Thunderbird. ""   There is no conflict with incoming mail, but when it comes to 'sending', you can only send via whatever is set up as primary account. So if you can send via your 'school' account then it's likely that school account is set up as the primary account. So, your outlook account may only be able to send using the smtp used by the school email addess. Unless you change the 'primary' account to outlook, then both accounts would use the outlook as smtp for sending. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1
