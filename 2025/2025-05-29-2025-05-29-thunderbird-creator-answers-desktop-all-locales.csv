It was a shared account so that account is still open but I have no more need of accessing it.  So I went into my TB\Account Actions\Remove Account.  It no longer exists on my main TB page which shows my different email accounts.  Suddenly, and constantly, I have this window pop up, requesting my login info, which I no longer have.  When I close the window, it just opens back up.  I have to close it in order to get to my main TB window.  It's horribly frustrating.
