It worked just fine years ago with AT&amp;T and more recently Frontier email servers. Several months ago Frontier discontinued their email service. But I had a ""Free Email For Life"" account which they automatically switched over to a Yahoo Email account which allowed me to continue using my long standing ""@Frontier.com"" address. The change over went pretty smoothly and Thunderbird was still working as expected. Until it didn't. </p><p>In the last month or two Thunderbird in two Windows machines will not connect to my Yahoo email account. I continually get messages indicating a ""time out"" issue when attempting to connect. But I can still access my email by logging directly into my Yahoo webmail account. </p><p>The two main Thunderbird installations, one on a Win 10 laptop and  another on a Win 7 Pro desktop are the main problem areas with time-outs and no connection established. Oddly enough Thunderbird for Android seems to work just fine on my phone. </p><p>The only free tech help that Yahoo would provide was essentially to check my SMTP server settings, which I did again for probably the fourth or fifth time. I also changed my password which was a couple years old . . . just in case. But I'm still spinning my wheels. </p><p>Hopefully someone else has had a similar experience and can tell me what I may have overlooked. I don't want to switch to Gmail or any other server if I can avoid it. Yahoo offers their own 3rd party app but it seems a bit futzier and more invasive than Thunderbird. Somebody please point me in the right direction of where to dig in next. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1738190;1738267;1738521;,csBlackburn
