The ""almost"" is because the unified trash folder just contains the set of acount  trash folders, rather than a consolidated trash, but at least they are all grouped conveniently together.  </p><p>But - why does life always have a but? One problem / oddity is that whilst the folder strucure I had under the 'main' acount in all folders is almost exactly reproduced under the same acount under unified folders, a couple of sub folders do not apear in the main acount but apear only under other acounts. They cannot  be moved into their original location, and don't have the same content as the originals! Also the in box has folder has pulled in hundreds of old mails!   </p><p>So yes, I will likely pull up the unified option whilst going through my daily bulk delete, but not use it for anything else. </p>",29847gv,false,0,0
