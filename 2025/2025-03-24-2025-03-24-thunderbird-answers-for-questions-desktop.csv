I share that for any future similar instances. Although there is no setup for a password change, if the password is failing, you should see a prompt to enter a new one. If the account is POP, the messages do transfer when using the above URL process. To force a prompt, you could go to settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, click savedpasswords and then showpasswords and then highlight the rows for that account and delete them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Some email providers, such as Gmail, require an 'app' password that is unique to each PC, while others use the same password everywhere. My general advice is this: when setting up an account DO NOT enter the password until first request for messages and you receive a prompt for it. In most instances, if an app password is required, the email provider will accept your password and will then store a special password for the PC. If an app password is not required, the normal password itself will be accepted and stored on the PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
