I share that for any future similar instances. Although there is no setup for a password change, if the password is failing, you should see a prompt to enter a new one. If the account is POP, the messages do transfer when using the above URL process. To force a prompt, you could go to settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, click savedpasswords and then showpasswords and then highlight the rows for that account and delete them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Some email providers, such as Gmail, require an 'app' password that is unique to each PC, while others use the same password everywhere. My general advice is this: when setting up an account DO NOT enter the password until first request for messages and you receive a prompt for it. In most instances, if an app password is required, the email provider will accept your password and will then store a special password for the PC. If an app password is not required, the normal password itself will be accepted and stored on the PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Most email issues stem from security software. This is especially so with Google who appear to me to look at the location of the IP address used to connect to the server and the one allocated to your mobile phone and then start ringing alarm bells because often they are on different continents. </p><p>GMail does have hard limits of the volume of email you can send in a day and the amount of bandwidth that is made available via any single account.  Could you husband be exceeding these limits and having Google simply disable further use of the account until the 24hour limit clocks over again.  Note that when a provider says you are limited to X number of email per day.  A single email addressed to a correspondent and CC'ed to yourself counts as two.  A mailing list of 20 or 50 contacts is that many emails,  it is the recipients that are counted,  not the number of clicks on send. </p><p>Likewise sending invoices from accounting packages often also counts to the days total. </p><p>Sure Thunderbird is largely feature comparable with Outlook, and simply installing the software and setting the account will allow you to become familiar with Thunderbird.  As IMAP is syncronised,  the Thunderbird and outlook views of the mail account should be the same, just be aware Outlook has a nasty habit of changing the default mailing program to itself each time it is launched.  You can set Thunderbird to check when it is Launched and I strongly suggest you set that up. </p><p>Another thing you probably need to be aware of is Thunderbird has native sync of Google contacts and calendars. While you can continue to sync your phones as you do now,  Thunderbird can join that synchronized group and also have the same data available.  The only thing not synced natively is Tasks, and you say you do not use those anyway.  If you do decide to use them,  they can be synced with an addon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Each is a separate file. Please note - Imap accounts can only display whatever is on server, meaning they synchronise so you cannot really regard any imap account folders as independent copies. However, they can be used to create a backup that is independent of the server and Thunderbird also offers a 'Local Folders' account and any email copied into that account is independent of server. Perfect for important emails or in the event you need to reduce number of emails on server to increase quota, but need to store and still have access to email. </p><p>Regarding any Anti-Virus. If you allow Anti-Virus to scan incoming or outgoing mail it can cause a delay. If you allow it to scan any file that is opened it can cause a temporary not responding.  Thunderbird does not allow Remote Content to be displayed by default, so opening an email is not going to cause a problem. Clicking willy nilly on links you have not checked what the true link is OR opening unexpected attachments because you are curious is asking for trouble.  But these are actions by the user. Opening an email in itself  is not going to cause a problem.  If you do want Anti-Virus to be allowed to scan everything then please do not allow it to auto fix anything as Anti-Virus products have no concept that a single file is not necessarilly a single email.  If allowed to fix then you stand a chance of it nuking the entire file and loss of email in entire folder - not a happy situation especially if you use Imap as it's likely to delete emails in that specific folder on server. That's just general info and applies regardless of email client. Anti-Virus is a great idea but be wary when it comes to email clients. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

A couple clarifications: - NordVPN is set to view my home WIFI as trusted, so I don't believe it is active during most send/receive cycles. (We need it for when we travel and use public networks. ) - Email volume is unlikely to be an issue.  He maybe sends 5-10 emails on a busy day, very few having more than 1-2 recipients. Incoming email volume is maybe 30/day. No mass business related mailings involved. </p><p>I will see if I can temporarily disable ESET from scanning emails for a week to observe the impact it may be having.
