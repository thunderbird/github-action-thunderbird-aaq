Well, after 10+ years, the inevitable finally happened today when I Shift-Deleted several messages, it was actually several *hundreds* of messages, like maybe 1000+. Inbox is almost empty, can't Undo. I have not closed Thunderbird and have copied out the file ""Inbox"" (1.04 MB) and ""Inbox.msf"", in the hopes of being able to retrieve the lost mail. I'm hoping those deleted messages are still in the Inbox, but I don't know how to retrieve. Any help or hints would be very appreciated. Oh, one more stupid thing - my backup of Thunderbird is several months old, which would help, but I'd still feel stupid.
