The Windows has local folders the Pop does not. What happens to the emails on the machine without? I was trying to make room on Windows for a dualboot. I copied everthing to usb then accidentally deleted my user files. 1)How do I recover the local folders from the usb? And/or 2)Do I even need to since I have Thunderbird on Pop? My concern is that, since I set up local folders on Windows, that those emails never got sent to the Pop machine. Otherwise, they all might be there and I just have to locate them which means I don't have to restore the Windows emails. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",willpfister

To reload, I had to search for 'thunderbird' on my computer over and over again until there was no 'thunderbirds' to delete - that included several thunderbird downloads as well. I wiped my laptop clean of all thunderbirds and then it could finally be downloaded.

My laptopn has Thunderbird profile set up to receive from both and data is held on our local NAS  Wifes Laptop does the same and her data is on her folder on local NAS.  For the shared email, we can each access and it creates a local copy on BOTH of our respective folders on the NAS.   Whilst this works, i cant help wondering if we're setting up a sync loop.   THe shared email isnt used much, but is there a way that we  can share the exact same files /data for the shared email on the local NAS.   ie. Still have one view in Thunderbird client but have the shared email data be on a common shared folder.    Still keeping our separate profiles.  This worked for Outlook pst files.  But New Outlook is a disaster hence moving to THunderbird. . This seems to be a simple scenario.   3 email accounts 1 shared.   3 local data sets.  One shared.    2 separate laptopns and  THunderbird installations.   One common local NAS.  ANyone have any guidance for best practice&nbsp;?
