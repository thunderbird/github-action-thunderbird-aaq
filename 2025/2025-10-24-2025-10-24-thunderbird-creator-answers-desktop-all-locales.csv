The Windows has local folders the Pop does not. What happens to the emails on the machine without? I was trying to make room on Windows for a dualboot. I copied everthing to usb then accidentally deleted my user files. 1)How do I recover the local folders from the usb? And/or 2)Do I even need to since I have Thunderbird on Pop? My concern is that, since I set up local folders on Windows, that those emails never got sent to the Pop machine. Otherwise, they all might be there and I just have to locate them which means I don't have to restore the Windows emails. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",willpfister

This failed utterly and I had to have someone help me to reload thunderbird on this laptop. I've never had luck with sending emails ever since it was reloaded. To reload, I had to search for 'thunderbird' on my computer over and over again until there was no 'thunderbirds' to delete - that included several thunderbird downloads as well. I wiped my laptop clean of all thunderbirds and then it could finally be downloaded. But I didn't think to try to send a message when my tech guy was there so I didn’t catch that I couldn’t send them. </p><p>thanks again.  </p><p>r </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",RobinClaire
