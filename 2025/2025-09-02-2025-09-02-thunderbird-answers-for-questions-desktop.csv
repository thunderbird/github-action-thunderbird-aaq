According to the DNS records for your domain <a href=""https://intodns.com/hycotec.on.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intodns.com/hycotec.on.ca</a>  you are also using the services of <a href=""https://www.vadesecure.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vadesecure.com/en/</a>  but I see nothing in the DNS for  <a href=""http://smtp.internic.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.internic.ca</a> being a permitted sender for the domain in the MX records, despite internic telling you to use it. So my guess is this is entirely a problem created by your hosting provider and someone who has signed up for enhanced email security. </p><p>Why internic would be advertising an email address at official website of NBC as the technical contact for the domain I have no idea. <a href=""https://www.internic.ca/whois/hycotec.on.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.internic.ca/whois/hycotec.on.ca</a> </p><p>So I am seeing some sort of corporate mess that I am not qualified to untangle.  I am thinking that there may be more ideology in this setup than there are facts. </p><p>However despite their assertion that these are correct settings. Incoming: </p><pre>   IMAP    Server hostname: <a href=""http://imap.internic.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.internic.ca</a>    Port: IMAP (993)    SSL: SSL/TLS    Authentication: Normal Password </pre> <p>Outgoing: </p><pre>   Server hostname: <a href=""http://smtp.internic.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.internic.ca</a>    Port: SMTP (587)    SSL: STARTTLS    Authentication: Normal Password </pre> <p>I have doubts about the server (<a href=""http://smtp.internic.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.internic.ca</a>) actually being correctly configured in DNS to send mail for <a href=""http://hycotec.on.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">hycotec.on.ca</a>.  It is not mentioned in the MX record for the domain greatly increasing the chance a recipient server will block it as spam. </p><p>There is none of the modern delivery validation mechanisms configured.SPF,DKIM or DMARC  See <a href=""https://mxtoolbox.com/emailhealth/hycotec.on.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mxtoolbox.com/emailhealth/hycotec.on.ca/</a> </p><p>So delivery to most major mail providers will be more than a little problematical.  You need someone to configure email on the domain if you actually want it to be delivered to customers inboxes instead of the spam folder, or not at all.  This is not a Thunderbird issue I do not think as fundamental domain configuration information is either incorrect of missing entirely. This is a DNS issue in my opinion. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The problem is that 'running a manual filter' from my current list of 50+ is time consuming when a simple 'run all filters' would do the job. I could also make a case for a toggle to switch all those filters from manual to auto which would actually be better for the 95% of the time I am at home.
