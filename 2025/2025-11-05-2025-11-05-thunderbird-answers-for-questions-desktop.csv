Then a “Sending Message” window popped up, and eventually another pop up that said “login to server smtp.mail.....failed” and it gave me the options to retry, enter new password, or cancel. When I click enter new password the window disappears, nothing appears prompting me for an new password.  Then I start repeatedly getting the same pop up I get when I start Thunderbird (telling me “too many requests”) indicating my credentials failed. Hitting “cancel” just stopped the attempt to send the email, and hitting “retry” just put me back to the “Sending message” infinite loop and then another “login to server smtp.mail.....failed” box. Any other suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks again for answering. David </p>",beach_boy_dave,false,1,0

I rechecked as you suggested.  I don't have any new entries.  I don't have any entries at all.  When I go to setting&gt;privacy&amp;security and click saved passwords, there are no (as in zero) saved logins.  And Thunderbird won't let me create a new login using my online email address because it gives me an error message that my incoming server already exists.  My login isn't there under saved logins, but when I try to re-create my login with my email address Thunderbird won't create it because it thinks it already exists -- but I can't see it, I can't see or change the password, and it won't connect to my email provider's server because my provider made me change the password online and I can't update it on Thunderbird.  I can't delete any entries because there are no entries.  Its there somewhere, but it isn't anywhere I can find it or see it or change the password. I appreciate your suggestions. Thanks for sticking with me. David </p>",beach_boy_dave,false,0,0

That's the normal process when the entries in settings&gt;privacy&amp;security are removed. At this point, my approach would be this:  - If IMAP account, simply delete the account and start over. nothing will be lost  - if POP account, my approach would be a bit different -   delete the POP account, but DO NOT tick the box to remove data.  -   create the account again and thunderbird will resume control of the account data  FOR SAFETY, I recommend backing up the profile first. Not needed, but I like to be safe. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Details below: David, When I started Thunderbird to try your last suggestion it prompted me for a new password. In other words, Thunderbird finally did what you originally thought it would do. My saved login then reappeared and I changed the password in Thunderbird. I suspect the prompt for a new password wasn't getting through on my prior attempts because I was already logged into my email via my web browser when I started Thunderbird. Online mail was my only option to use email without Thunderbird working. This last time, when I started Thunderbird without already being in my web based email, it asked me for a password in Thunderbird and then it worked fine. This was the first time since the problem began that I started Thunderbird without already being in my email online. I never had a problem starting Thunderbird with online mail open before, but then my Thunderbird password was still valid and the server never had to come back and request password authentication. I checked after the problem was fixed, and I can now start and use Thunderbird just fine whether or not I'm already in my email account via the web. Thanks You, David </p>",beach_boy_dave,false,0,0

I just tested the indicated method in a small IMAP account and the transition of 460 messages from mbox to maildir worked rather quickly. It certainly will take more time for the 88.000 messages in your Inbox. To be on the safe side create a backup copy of your 26.4 GB Inbox before launching the transition... </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

I have a windows 11 laptop I inadvertently left at my daughter's house (2 hours away) on October 28.  It was turned off so no changes could have occurred over the past 9 days.  I get home and opened my old windows 10 laptop (on October 28) and get the message ""Edge: too many requests"".  I tried to find a solution - changed server configuration, reinstalled Thunderbird, etc.  I decided to buy a new laptop, windows 11, clean install of thunderbird, same problem.  Wasted a lot more time online trying to determine where the problem was.  As a final test, today I made it back to my daughter's and turned on my laptop - same problem.  So, something has changed since (on?) October 28 so that I cannot access yahoo on my Thunderbird client, on any of my three laptops.  Since there were no changes to my original machines, and I bought a new laptop and installed a clean Thunderbird client, I'm assuming it's a yahoo problem.   </p><p>Any help from anyone or Thunderbird? </p>",dbardin1,false,0,0
