I'm not a super-techie person and I don't want to lose more emails. I hope there's a safer way to do this. And in your attached image, the arrows are also missing. I'd love to have the arrows and the wide scroll bar, as in my screenshot. It's very awkward to use the current style. </p><p>Thanks, DD </p>",DD46,false,0,0
