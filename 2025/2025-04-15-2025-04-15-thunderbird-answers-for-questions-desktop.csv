I think this because no other app on my system has this issue. I think what is happening is that the second column is staying on white when it should go dark.  The first column also is an issue as it goes dark but does not turn text white or a lighter shade with a dark theme is applied.   </p><p>This all tells me that the UI in the Address book is not the same as the UI elements in the email app of Thunderbird. The fix would be to use the same elements in the address book as are in the email app portion. The titles or CSS element names should be changed to match those of the email client which works fine in all themes. Something is not changing in the address for the labels of the elements correctly. </p>,sautez8,false,0,0

Here is how to do that: - salvage the addresssbook by clicking tools&gt;import&gt;import from a file&gt;addressbook&gt;sqlite   and click the 'abook.sqlite file in that backup. Repeat to import the history.sqlite file  - for any POP account, locate the account at the Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; folder in the backup and copy (when thunderbird not running) the inbox and sent folders (ignore the msf files) to your active profile's Mail\Local Folders folder - also, copy the Mail\Local Folders folders to the active profile's Mail\Local Folders folder  </p><p>The above steps will salvage the messages. IMAP accounts will selfpopulate.  If unsure of where your active profile is, do this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - exit thunderbird. you are now in the profile folder  </p><p>In future, I suggest these steps that capture everything and restores everything:  </p><p>here is the info in brief steps:  </p><p><strong>BACKUP</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is not running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol> <p><strong>RESTORE</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is installed and NOT running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there. This may prompt to overwrite an existing folder of same name. allow it </li><li> start thunderbird and all should be there </li></ol>",davidsk,false,0,0
