Do you see that? </p><p>I believe that threads are designed to sort in ascending chronological order at all times. That is their purpose: to show how discussions have flowed since the first message. </p><p>If you want to control sorting by date, you may want to use the conversations view. I keep a button for it on my main toolbar so I can access the conversation view for any discussion in one click. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird</a> </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
