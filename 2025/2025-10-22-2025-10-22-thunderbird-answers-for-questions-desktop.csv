I see there's a problem, but that post mentions Firefox, where I'm having trouble with Thunderbird. Also, it mentions Linux Mint &amp; Fedora, but I'm using Zorin Pro. Do you think it's still the same problem?  I'm very new at using Linux, so do you know if there's a simple way around this? I've never used the Terminal before, but I plan to start learning. It would be great if I could get my email working on this computer before several months from now! </p><p>Thanks, DD </p>",DD46,false,0,0

Then I closed TB and restarted, but just got the same screen that wants me to set up my account. No emails or anything in there.

I had not thought that this would prevent searching Allmail on my laptop but I can still do this on my mobile. I presume everything will go back to as it was before if I subscribe to Allmail again - I am going to do this next. Then I shall have a rethink and maybe instead delete some substantial ImapMail folders that are redundant. </p>,msturdy77,false,0,0
