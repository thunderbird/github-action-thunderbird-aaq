How to access it after Win10 crash and new setup?,"<p>Recently, I accidently upgraded my Win10 Home to Win11 Home. It didn't work at all, so I tried to recover my original C:\ drive with Acronis True Image 2021. That did NOT work, so I was forced to Install everything anew.  Since years hence, I have my Thunderbird profile, and all my emails (some 9 GB in size), stored on a separate  HDD.   In my experience, MS will always just screw up the C:\ drive, and not affect other HDD's. Learned that the hard way. The profile is still safe and undisturbed on that other HDD, but I can't seem to be able to access it. It holds some important info there, like my addressbook, and licensenumbers.  I am including some pics: The 'Appdata' and the 2 '.inifiles' are from the C:\ drive; the 'marked entry' is from the other HDD. It seems I have been here before: I just found a 'memo to self' pointing out that the dates of the file(s) are important.... Must have been years ago (and I'm not getting younger). Thanks on beforehand. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1753235;,amcw.dehaan

Today I requested a new Outlook email account, I got it then I tried to include it in my Thunderbird program. I can see the initial email there but all subsequent emails are not received in T'Bird. I don't want to use the Outlook program to manage these emails. I have had a look at Outlook mail settings but can see nothing obvious there which is stopping emails being forwarded or picked up by T'Bird.    I did see an article in the FAQ which says I can import emails from Outlook to T'Bird but it requires me to first install a much older version of T'Bird which I don't want to do. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1753227;,g.k.fib88144
