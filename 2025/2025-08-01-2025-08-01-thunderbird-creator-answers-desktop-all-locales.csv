How to access it after Win10 crash and new setup?,"<p>Recently, I accidently upgraded my Win10 Home to Win11 Home. It didn't work at all, so I tried to recover my original C:\ drive with Acronis True Image 2021. That did NOT work, so I was forced to Install everything anew.  Since years hence, I have my Thunderbird profile, and all my emails (some 9 GB in size), stored on a separate  HDD.   In my experience, MS will always just screw up the C:\ drive, and not affect other HDD's. Learned that the hard way. The profile is still safe and undisturbed on that other HDD, but I can't seem to be able to access it. It holds some important info there, like my addressbook, and licensenumbers.  I am including some pics: The 'Appdata' and the 2 '.inifiles' are from the C:\ drive; the 'marked entry' is from the other HDD. It seems I have been here before: I just found a 'memo to self' pointing out that the dates of the file(s) are important.... Must have been years ago (and I'm not getting younger). Thanks on beforehand. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",amcw.dehaan
