Since years hence, I have my Thunderbird profile, and all my emails (some 9 GB in size), stored on a separate  HDD.   In my experience, MS will always just screw up the C:\ drive, and not affect other HDD's. Learned that the hard way. The profile is still safe and undisturbed on that other HDD, but I can't seem to be able to access it. It holds some important info there, like my addressbook, and licensenumbers.  I am including some pics: The 'Appdata' and the 2 '.inifiles' are from the C:\ drive; the 'marked entry' is from the other HDD. It seems I have been here before: I just found a 'memo to self' pointing out that the dates of the file(s) are important.... Must have been years ago (and I'm not getting younger).

There already exists a POP account for this domain name and I’ve had it since TB came out (I used Pegasus Mail before). </p><p>The account names are displayed the same in TB except the IMAP account. ""___@___.com""  The above is the POP account and it only displays the email name: ""___@___com"" </p><p>""___@___.com IMAP"" The above IMAP account also displays the word “IMAP” in the title. </p><p>I have over 46000 messages in 58 sub folders on this POP account and I want to keep all of them for now.   </p><p>My biggest question is - when I Delete the POP account, ""will TB also delete all the sub folders at the same time&nbsp;?"" </p><p>Right now, the Inbox on the IMAP account does not retain any messages.  When I start TB, we know it auto checks all email accounts and downloads new mail to each account.  Emails to my domain name go to the IMAP account first.  When I open the Inbox in the IMAP account, I can see all the downloaded messages but only for a second.  They disappear from IMAP and transfer to the POP account. </p><p>Every 10 minutes after that, TB downloads messages from all accounts again.  This time any messages to the IMAP account can be opened &amp; viewed. They can also be deleted or moved to another folder.   3 to 5 minutes later, they ALL appear in the POP account.  Any messages not deleted remain in the POP account Inbox.  No messages remain in the Inbox for the IMAP account. </p><p>I know I need to move all the folders and sub folders from the POP account display to the IMAP account display.  This is going to take a while.  Like I said, the Inbox will not retain any mail, it automatically moves to the POP account after 3 to 5 minutes. </p><p>I have moved the ‘Sent’ mail folder to the IMAP account and started on some of my Archives files.  The first one I moved from POP to IMAP was a ‘Sent 2008-2015' folder.  This folder has 5363 messages.  I just did a ‘drag and drop’ with my left mouse button from the POP Archive folder to the IMAP Archive folder.  It worked like a charm.  Took a couple of minutes and you could see TB counting off the messages being moved at the bottom of the screen. </p><p>Seem like TB was teasing me, it will no longer copy large count sub folders with ‘drag and drop’.  I think that first folder is the largest. TB will sometimes create the proper folder name but not move any messages.  I have to go in and select 100 or so messages at a time and 'drag and drop' them into the newly created folder in the IMAP account.  Sometime I ‘drag and drop’ and TB doesn’t do anything. It going to be tedious to get all my email moved from POP to IMAP.  Of course, I will do it if necessary but is there some other method of moving the sub folders from the POP to the IMAP account that is faster&nbsp;? </p><p>I created IMAP accounts for my two other POP accounts and I only had to move the Inbox mail from POP to IMAP.  One of the POP accounts only had the Inbox and Trash folders and the other one had those 2 plus five sub folders.  One of these folders have 3381 messages.  Had to move them 100 or so at a time.  The other 4 folders had a small number of messages and transferred easily.  Deleting the POP accounts at that point was no problem. </p><p>So, again, my biggest concern is deleting the main POP account and TB deleting the sub folders.  If I have to get them moved before deleting, so be it. </p><p>Thanks for any help. </p>",jmallard;davidsk;,false,false,false,";solver_id:6866676;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:141.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/141.0;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/automatic-account-configuration"", ""/en-US/kb/faq-changing-imap-pop""]",13,0,0,,,

The problem I just ran into today is how Thunderbird does file names on Linux compared to Windows. Windows has the sender's email in parentheses (example@example.com) and Linux has the sender's email in angle brackets &lt;example@example.com&gt;. The problem that has arisen, is that when trying to save an email to a location that is attached via smb (for example: smb://192.168.1.111/Network_Attached_Files) it fails. I can save the email locally, but then even trying to cut and paste to the smb location still fails. I found the problem to be the angle brackets in the file name, smb just doesnt accept it. Thunderbird on Windows uses parentheses so the file name isnt a problem. </p><p>Is there any way to change how Thunderbird saved the file name by default, to change the angle brackets back to parentheses like it does in Windows? (when you right click -&gt; save as for example) </p><p>Or is there a way to simply remove the sender name and email from the file name by default? So just the subject name and date is there. </p><p><br> </p><p>I find it strange that I am the first person who seems to have come across this problem. I suppose saving emails on a network attached storage location is far less common than locally on a PC, but still Id think there would be at least a hundred+ people who use Thunderbird and use network storage that this would have already affected and been a problem.
