How to access it after Win10 crash and new setup?,"<p>Recently, I accidently upgraded my Win10 Home to Win11 Home. It didn't work at all, so I tried to recover my original C:\ drive with Acronis True Image 2021. That did NOT work, so I was forced to Install everything anew.  Since years hence, I have my Thunderbird profile, and all my emails (some 9 GB in size), stored on a separate  HDD.   In my experience, MS will always just screw up the C:\ drive, and not affect other HDD's. Learned that the hard way. The profile is still safe and undisturbed on that other HDD, but I can't seem to be able to access it. It holds some important info there, like my addressbook, and licensenumbers.  I am including some pics: The 'Appdata' and the 2 '.inifiles' are from the C:\ drive; the 'marked entry' is from the other HDD. It seems I have been here before: I just found a 'memo to self' pointing out that the dates of the file(s) are important.... Must have been years ago (and I'm not getting younger).

There already exists a POP account for this domain name and I’ve had it since TB came out (I used Pegasus Mail before). </p><p>The account names are displayed the same in TB except the IMAP account. ""___@___.com""  The above is the POP account and it only displays the email name: ""___@___com"" </p><p>""___@___.com IMAP"" The above IMAP account also displays the word “IMAP” in the title. </p><p>I have over 46000 messages in 58 sub folders on this POP account and I want to keep all of them for now.   </p><p>My biggest question is - when I Delete the POP account, ""will TB also delete all the sub folders at the same time&nbsp;?"" </p><p>Right now, the Inbox on the IMAP account does not retain any messages.  When I start TB, we know it auto checks all email accounts and downloads new mail to each account.  Emails to my domain name go to the IMAP account first.  When I open the Inbox in the IMAP account, I can see all the downloaded messages but only for a second.  They disappear from IMAP and transfer to the POP account. </p><p>Every 10 minutes after that, TB downloads messages from all accounts again.  This time any messages to the IMAP account can be opened &amp; viewed. They can also be deleted or moved to another folder.   3 to 5 minutes later, they ALL appear in the POP account.  Any messages not deleted remain in the POP account Inbox.  No messages remain in the Inbox for the IMAP account. </p><p>I know I need to move all the folders and sub folders from the POP account display to the IMAP account display.  This is going to take a while.  Like I said, the Inbox will not retain any mail, it automatically moves to the POP account after 3 to 5 minutes. </p><p>I have moved the ‘Sent’ mail folder to the IMAP account and started on some of my Archives files.  The first one I moved from POP to IMAP was a ‘Sent 2008-2015' folder.  This folder has 5363 messages.  I just did a ‘drag and drop’ with my left mouse button from the POP Archive folder to the IMAP Archive folder.  It worked like a charm.  Took a couple of minutes and you could see TB counting off the messages being moved at the bottom of the screen. </p><p>Seem like TB was teasing me, it will no longer copy large count sub folders with ‘drag and drop’.  I think that first folder is the largest. TB will sometimes create the proper folder name but not move any messages.  I have to go in and select 100 or so messages at a time and 'drag and drop' them into the newly created folder in the IMAP account.  Sometime I ‘drag and drop’ and TB doesn’t do anything. It going to be tedious to get all my email moved from POP to IMAP.  Of course, I will do it if necessary but is there some other method of moving the sub folders from the POP to the IMAP account that is faster&nbsp;? </p><p>I created IMAP accounts for my two other POP accounts and I only had to move the Inbox mail from POP to IMAP.  One of the POP accounts only had the Inbox and Trash folders and the other one had those 2 plus five sub folders.  One of these folders have 3381 messages.  Had to move them 100 or so at a time.  The other 4 folders had a small number of messages and transferred easily.  Deleting the POP accounts at that point was no problem. </p><p>So, again, my biggest concern is deleting the main POP account and TB deleting the sub folders.  If I have to get them moved before deleting, so be it. </p><p>Thanks for any help. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1753298;,jmallard

However, the situation is as follows: - username and password are stored in TB passwords - Nevertheless, 9 authentication windows (for 7 calenders/tasks) open after every app start. These must be processed in the exact correct order, 1-n. If you try to enter the credentials in a window out of order, it won't work. Furthermore, windows out of order can neither be closed nor can you click Cancel. I've since discovered that it's sufficient to enter the credentials only in the first window. However, the remaining windows then have to be laboriously closed IN THE CORRECT ORDER. - Also, even during a session, an authentication window opens repeatedly, depending on session duration </p><p>Since the authentication generally works, this clearly seems to be a Thunderbird problem. </p>",thunderbird;calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",julia.mason

The problem I just ran into today is how Thunderbird does file names on Linux compared to Windows. Windows has the sender's email in parentheses (example@example.com) and Linux has the sender's email in angle brackets &lt;example@example.com&gt;. The problem that has arisen, is that when trying to save an email to a location that is attached via smb (for example: smb://192.168.1.111/Network_Attached_Files) it fails. I can save the email locally, but then even trying to cut and paste to the smb location still fails. I found the problem to be the angle brackets in the file name, smb just doesnt accept it. Thunderbird on Windows uses parentheses so the file name isnt a problem. </p><p>Is there any way to change how Thunderbird saved the file name by default, to change the angle brackets back to parentheses like it does in Windows? (when you right click -&gt; save as for example) </p><p>Or is there a way to simply remove the sender name and email from the file name by default? So just the subject name and date is there. </p><p><br> </p><p>I find it strange that I am the first person who seems to have come across this problem. I suppose saving emails on a network attached storage location is far less common than locally on a PC, but still Id think there would be at least a hundred+ people who use Thunderbird and use network storage that this would have already affected and been a problem. Is the angle bracket thing in the file name something new maybe? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",PouchesInc
