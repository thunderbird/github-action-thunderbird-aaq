I ran a filter in my inbox to find all the relevant emails and selected all so they were highlighted. Then I went to ""Message"" and ""Move to"" and found the folder in my local folders where I wanted the emails moved to, clicked on it and they were gone. An interesting additional thing: I just tried it again with a couple of other emails and I can't get the emails to move at all! ie. the email remains in the inbox and nothing appears in the local folder. Unfortunately with the others they managed the first step into oblivion but not the second! So I've got a new problem my emails can no longer be moved. I will try a few more varied attempts to explore this additional and possibly related problem. I looked in the profile folder found ""INBOX"" and ""INBOX.msf"" but I can't find any of the relevant emails (in any case I don't think the email content would be in there). It's an IMAP account so everything is stored at the providers server. I've sent them a message to see if they have any kind of backup but it's night time here (Scotland/England) and they won't respond until tomorrow. Just saw your second post: That's an option I hadn't thought of and fits with the non specificity of the original email! The fact I couldn't identify the sender should have set off some alarm bells. Another alarm bell is that you just got a similar email... what's the chances of both of us hitting 95% on the same day! So maybe my new problem (not being able to transfer any emails between folders) is related? I'm going to run a scan and try to see if anything else is gubbed. And reinstall Th if the email provider can find my missing emails. Thanks again for your suggestions </p>",23justinrose,false,0,0

Here's what I did to fix everything for those poor souls trawling google... </p><p>1. First issue was that while I had indeed imported my orgs root certificate, I did not import my issuing certificate authority cert. This was complicated by the fact that my signing certificate and my encryption certificate had different certificate authorities (why??). But after importing both intermediaries and then clearing/re-adding my personal certs, I was able to sign/encrypt messages to myself. 2. You will have to do the same with anyone you exchange messages with. I wasn't able to send emails to outside folks until I had imported all of their intermediary and root certificates.  </p><p>Note on the off chance that someone from Mozilla reads this, please add some information to the error message that spells this out!
