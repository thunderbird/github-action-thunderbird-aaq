Sometimes, when requesting ""Get Messages"" from a Thunderbird  account, I will see a message count appear, download, and then conclude. 2. However, when looking through the email inventory for this account, no email appears. 3. IOW. If I have ""Myemail"" defined, and I'm ABSOLUTELY sure that ""Myemail"" is entirely empty. </p> <ol><li> I then select ""Get Messages"" for ""Myemail"", and I see one, or more, email documents found, and begin receipt. </li><li> When the receipt concludes, I open ""Myemail"" Inbox, only to find nothing there. I wander through the entire ""Myemail"" definition(s), only to find that any/all email receipt(s) for ""Myemail"" have disappeared. </li></ol> <p>This is an infrequent occurrence, but does occur. But, the real problem is the synchronization between a specific Thunderbird email account(i.e. ""Myemail""), and what a product called ""YOTA email migrator""(<a href=""https://yotasoftware.com/thunderbird-migrator/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yotasoftware.com/thunderbird-migrator/</a>) says about the current contents of ""Myemail"". Obviously, the discrepancies are varied, but there will usually be some kind of discrepancy in reporting an ""inbox"", ""sent"", ""trash"", etc. discrepancy. I never keep my email collective permanently in my Thunderbird definitions.  </p><p>My Thunderbird account definitions redefine ALL message repositories from the default (C:) definitions to another (Q:) residency, permanently mounted external drive. So, by the end of my day, my Thunderbird email inventories have all been drained/distributed to other more topic related final storage. </p><p>I've been a long time Thunderbird user, except during the time when Tbird was struggling with many definition changes for POP3 access. But, I've returned to Tbird now that the smoke has apparently cleared. But, this is my FIRST use of the ""YOTA email migrator"", which was acquired for use during a ""Mailbird"" usage, while Tbird was being rebuilt. </p><p>If you install this ""YOTA email migrator"" product on your Tbird system, I'm sure you will experience the Tbird email (sub)directory discrepancies  that I am describing. I've learned that because my Tbird directories are always zeroed by the end of the day, I can simply erase all those ""Local directory"" definitions, and they will be rebuilt upon the next Tbird initialization. At which time, the Tbird/YOTA director(ies) content representation will be equal at zero. But, as Tbird email content begins to arrive, and be saved, moved, deleted, etc. the message directory representations  between Tbird, and ""YOTA email migrator"" begin to drift apart. </p><p>I KNOW this explanations are quite complex, but I think it will become quite clear if you install the ""YOTA email migrator"" product, and then begin to review the eventual discrepancies between Tbird's message inventory(ies), and that reported by ""YOTA"". </p><p>Thank you, very much. And, I'm usually frequently available if desired. </p><p>Gary Walker - xxxx@outlook.com - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/thunderbird/form"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/thunderbird/form</a> </p>",twf6714;MattAuSupport;wsmwk;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:135.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/135.0,4,0,0,,,"{""username""=>""wsmwk"", ""display_name""=>""Wayne Mery"", ""avatar""=>""https://firefoxusercontent.com/3f0645137479a481e67f7fb3ff1d945b""}"

I like the shared profile as I can see all accounts there by opening Thunderbird once, but I have no interest in seeing the email from multiple accounts in the same inbox for organizational reasons. Apparently I created the shared profile when I first opened those accounts. I am interested in combining the now separate POP accounts/profiles so that they all open at once in TB, but not in the same profile as those currently sharing a profile again for organizational reasons. End results two profiles one for service one and one for service two each of which opens showing all the accounts from that service and having local folders that are shared. Is it possible to do that? I expect there may be a problem with combining local folders which are currently in three separate profiles so the stored emails are accessible in the combined profile. In that event, I would plan to keep the separate profiles only to access those stored emails and disconnect them from getting new email using them only to access the local folder stores they already contain, and use the new combined profile to get new emails and store only new email copies locally. </p>",anynonmouse;davidsk;DavidGG;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",2,0,0,,,
