But in all these years there's one thing I never understood:| </p><p>Why all the wasted vertical space? </p><pre>It makes it difficult to use on a laptop when a third of the screen is used for basically nothing. </pre> <p>Advantages: All of the items in the options drop down could be buttons. (One click instead of click-drag-release click) You could easily make that area only one or two lines vertically by putting the Subject and List ID on the same row. And the yellow line about"" blocking remote content"": That could also just be a button instead of taking up 2 horizontal rows. </p><p>On my laptop it looks like this.
