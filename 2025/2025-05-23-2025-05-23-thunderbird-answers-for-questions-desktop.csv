I found that my Thunderbird profile folder is very large at 565GB, but my email occupies only 40GB on the server. I checked the contents of my configuration folder and found many files named nstmp-1 nstmp-2 etc, dozens of them, which are taking up a lot of my hard disk space.

Then the original storage file is deleted, the new one replaces it, and a new index for this message file is created (for example Inbox.msf). The end result is the gaps (the dirt) are gone. </em> </p><p>This means you need enough space to be able to open that 6GB + file. This is not just about disc space it's also about the available RAM space.  </p><p>Please note that each folder as you see it in Folder Pane is actually a single mbox text file. So 6GB is a large single text file and at this point it's unknown whether this is problem with available RAM or whether there is some corruption in the file. My advice would be to assume there is corruption as the worst senario and the risk is too high to ignore. In Local Folders - Create some new folders and move emails out of that large folder into the new ones. Organising the distribution over a few folders - It's all about spreading the risks. Once the original folder is empty, then you can delete it and finally empty the Trash to remove completely. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If there are too many emails left on the gmail server and you are using POP then gmail deliberately become a pain.

So it's impossible for a Pop account to put any deleted mail into the gmail server Trash folder. With gmail accounts only emails that get put into the gmail server Trash folder can be deleted.

When I try to reopen TB again later, I get the same 'crash page' that I just tried to close.  I thought the 'End Task' command in the Task Manager was going to be a miracle fix - as 'Thunderbird' on the list of running tasks did disappear....but when I went to check, and 'opened' TB, it was back to the same crash page. </p>",CuriousQ,false,0,0

If you share your computer with other people  AND also allow them access to your computer User Account, you may not want prying eyes to have access to your saved passwords, so Thunderbird allows you to set up a 'primary password' and you will get asked specifically for that 'Primary Password' once per session at start up. The 'Primary Password' should be a unique password, it should never be any password you use for mail accounts.  I have come across some people who had no idea what they were setting up and they used a mail account password as their Primary Password, so were confused. Clarify - on start up are you being asked for a 'Primary Password'&nbsp;? </p><p>Upload an image (to this question in forum) of that initial request for password pop up so we can sort out whether you are being asked for a Primary Password or gmail account password. </p><p>In Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security scroll to 'passwords' section Is this checkbox selected  'Use a Primary Password'&nbsp;? </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:But when I try to sign into thunderbird email, it asks me to sign in with my gmail account.</em> </p><p>Assuming you still have a gmail account with google and you still have a gmail mail account set up in Thunderbird, then when you start Thunderbird, it will auto try to connect to server.  You should have the imap or pop gmail account set up with an Oauth2 token password, so connection should be automatic and you should not be asked for any gmail password - unless you deliberately removed the saved gmail passwords/tokens. </p><p>Have you removed the saved passwords for gmail from Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Saved Passwords? </p><p>Please note - if you have set up a VPN then the gmail server will probably refuse connection and you will get a prompt to enter password. </p><p>Check computer - if you have enabled a  VPN then switch it off or create a split tunneling and set up Thunderbird to use it. Some Anti-virus products offer a VPN and might have enabled it by default. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
