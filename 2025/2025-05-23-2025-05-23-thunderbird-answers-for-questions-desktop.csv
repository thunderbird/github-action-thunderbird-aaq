Then the original storage file is deleted, the new one replaces it, and a new index for this message file is created (for example Inbox.msf). The end result is the gaps (the dirt) are gone. </em> </p><p>This means you need enough space to be able to open that 6GB + file. This is not just about disc space it's also about the available RAM space.  </p><p>Please note that each folder as you see it in Folder Pane is actually a single mbox text file. So 6GB is a large single text file and at this point it's unknown whether this is problem with available RAM or whether there is some corruption in the file. My advice would be to assume there is corruption as the worst senario and the risk is too high to ignore. In Local Folders - Create some new folders and move emails out of that large folder into the new ones. Organising the distribution over a few folders - It's all about spreading the risks. Once the original folder is empty, then you can delete it and finally empty the Trash to remove completely. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

I did what you suggested: chopped up the large Inbox into several subfolders and moved the emails into these folders. Also, to wipe the slate clean, I created a new profile and did this there.

After trying changing all the recommended settings, I checked my passwords in Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security. There was a weird one dated today with OAuth.  I deleted it.  Then TBird asked for my password, which I keep on a spread sheet. Entered it and now it works fine. </p>",queenblogalina,false,0,0
