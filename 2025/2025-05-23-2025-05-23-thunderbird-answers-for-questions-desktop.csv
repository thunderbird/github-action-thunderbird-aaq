I found that my Thunderbird profile folder is very large at 565GB, but my email occupies only 40GB on the server. I checked the contents of my configuration folder and found many files named nstmp-1 nstmp-2 etc, dozens of them, which are taking up a lot of my hard disk space. I want to know what these nstmp files are for, can I delete them, and what impact will deleting them have on my emails?  Thank you all. </p>",hsy906,false,0,0
