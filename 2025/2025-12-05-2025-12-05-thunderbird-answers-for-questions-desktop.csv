I really do not know what it is you are asking.  Partially because you have made no attempt to define where you want to use these fonts.  Speaking for my position there is only one place you get to select fonts,  that is when you write an email and by default you can choose most fonts installed on your system.  So I really do not understand where you are coming from. </p><p>This is what I see when I select the font dropdown in composing an email..

It means that the pc or laptop has to be on all time also at night times.. It costs a lot of electric power to stay on. You can Create that option to use a sjablone or concept and the use of message filters to create  that wanted automatic autoresponse in Thunderbird. It s not easy to setup but possible it is for you to create that autoresponse for Thunderbird. still interested in that function to use it?alright! </p>,Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
