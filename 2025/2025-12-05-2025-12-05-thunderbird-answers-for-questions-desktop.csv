I really do not know what it is you are asking.  Partially because you have made no attempt to define where you want to use these fonts.  Speaking for my position there is only one place you get to select fonts,  that is when you write an email and by default you can choose most fonts installed on your system.  So I really do not understand where you are coming from. </p><p>This is what I see when I select the font dropdown in composing an email..  Don't you also have that available? </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-12-05-02-05-25-301d22.png""> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
