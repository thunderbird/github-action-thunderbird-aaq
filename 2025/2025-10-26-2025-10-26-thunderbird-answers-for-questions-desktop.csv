Thunderbird might open the inbox file thousands of times to download thousands of emails.  It depends on the protocol in use and the folders they come from among other things.  But check in setting that you do not have allow the antivirus to scan incoming mail selected.  This writes a temp file for each incoming mail and then copies it if the antivirus does not clobber it.

Right-click the copy of the Thunderbird profile folder you created earlier on the data transfer device. Then select Copy. Open Thunderbird.

Alternative method for manual transfer between computers running Windows 10 and Windows 11 The instructions in this chapter are based on you having a standard installation of Windows and using computers that have been upgraded from earlier versions of Windows to Windows 10. </p><p>Locate the main profile folder on your source computer (as described above). Locate the main profile folder on your destination computer (as described above). Keep in mind that your username (identified by the ~ character, see the file paths below) may be different on the two computers, but this is irrelevant for the manual transfer described here. Completely exit Thunderbird on both computers. On your source computer, copy the Thunderbird folders contained in the two file paths Windows(C:)/Users/~/AppData/Roaming and Windows(C:)/Users/~/Appdata/Local as separate folders to a data transfer device (USB stick, external drive, or similar) so that they are not overwritten. On your destination computer, delete all Thunderbird folders in the destination folders Windows(C:)/Users/~/AppData/Roaming and Windows(C:)/Users/~/Appdata/Local, or rename both Thunderbird folders if you need a data backup or want to keep your old profile. Copy the correct Thunderbird folders that you previously saved separately from your data transfer device to the two target folders mentioned above on your target computer to replace the deleted or renamed Thunderbird folders. Start Thunderbird on the destination computer and test it. Make sure that the inbox tab is identical to the tab on the source computer, but other tabs with Thunderbird messages may have been opened. </p>",karl-heinz.kopplin,false,0,0

Gmail understands it's not helpful to users, so they invented 'labels'  which look like folders.  Labels work like a tag, if email in 'All Mail' has a 'Inbox' label then show a virtual version in the gmail Inbox. The advantage of this system means one email stored in 'All Mail' can have more than one label and therefore appear in more than one 'folder'. When emails get deleted they have to go into the gmail Trash folder, where after a period of 30 days, they get completely delted and disappear from the 'All Mail' folder store. </p><p>However, POP accounts can only access the gmail server 'Inbox' and get a download into the Pop account Inbox. Pop accounts have no concept of 'labels'. You downloaded the email and you now have a full copy stored on your computer.  When you delete an email in a Pop account - even if you say if I delete then delete off server, it cannot be put into the gmail Trash as there is no access to any other folder/label on server. So gmail reads this as 'Remove the label' and store in 'All Mail'.  in addition, anything you send via your Thunderbird gmail account is using the gmail smtp server, so gmail will apply a 'Sent' label of anything you send so it displays in gmail 'Sent' folder'label and it will be stored in the 'All Mail' folder. In the end, you have a load of old emails still stored in the 'All Mail' folder and this is now using up your gmail quota. Gmail then become a bit of a pain and start to restrict the downloads. Not that they will tell you this - it's just something I've discovered after many years of experience.   </p><p>In all the other cases I've come across - it has always been Pop account and Gmail - the following fixes the issue. Gmail wants you to logon to your gmail webmail account via a browser, access the 'All Mail' folder and delete all those old emails off the server to increase the allowed quota.   Please do this now. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
