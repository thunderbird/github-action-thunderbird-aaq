No error message this time,  OTOH when I started downloading again I didn't get an error message this time; let's see what happens. </p><p>EDIT --deleted a bunch of things manually from <a href=""http://USA.net"" rel=""nofollow"">USA.net</a> web interface to catch up with what was already downloaded/what hit as ""downloaded"" on IMAP.  Was able to reproduce error that I got after only 7 messages downloaded -- froze again, restarted T-bird , and this is the message I got (see upload) </p>",Threemoons,false,0,0

I restarted T-bird, got a bunch more messages -- these ""hit"" as IMAP and were moved to trash automatically when I went to the <a href=""http://USA.net"" rel=""nofollow"">USA.net</a> interface.  Then it froze again after 1500 messages.  Went back, quit Tbird, logged out of <a href=""http://USA.net"" rel=""nofollow"">USA.net</a> online, got back in to Tbird, started download again and this time only got 7 messages.  Same thing RE rinse repeat but this time when I tried to download anything I got this error (see upload) </p><p>Maybe a timeout thing with <a href=""http://USA.net?"" rel=""nofollow"">USA.net?</a> </p><p>Thanks again.  Stumped.  Have had that account for more than 20 years; periodically it acts up but this is new. </p><p>Quick edit:  Domain shows as <a href=""http://usa.net"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.net</a> but I have to log in at <a href=""http://netaddress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">netaddress.com</a>  if that helps. </p>",Threemoons,false,0,0

Thunderbird might open the inbox file thousands of times to download thousands of emails.  It depends on the protocol in use and the folders they come from among other things.  But check in setting that you do not have allow the antivirus to scan incoming mail selected.  This writes a temp file for each incoming mail and then copies it if the antivirus does not clobber it.  That might be tipping things over. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
