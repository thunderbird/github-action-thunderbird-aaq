Thunderbird might open the inbox file thousands of times to download thousands of emails.  It depends on the protocol in use and the folders they come from among other things.  But check in setting that you do not have allow the antivirus to scan incoming mail selected.  This writes a temp file for each incoming mail and then copies it if the antivirus does not clobber it.

In the tab that opens, go to the “General Information” section, find the entry Profile Folder, and click on the Open Folder button. Your Thunderbird profile folder will now open in Windows Explorer. Close Thunderbird. In Windows Explorer, go up three levels in your Thunderbird profile folder. Right-click on the Thunderbird folder. Then select Copy. Right-click on the device you are using for data transfer. Then select Paste. If you are using a local device (e.g., a USB stick) for data transfer, safely remove this device from the source computer. Tip: You can also use these steps to create a backup copy of your Thunderbird profile folder. </p><p>On your destination computer Connect the same device you used to copy your Thunderbird profile folder from the source computer to your destination computer. Right-click the copy of the Thunderbird profile folder you created earlier on the data transfer device. Then select Copy. Open Thunderbird. (If the window for setting up email accounts appears, close it.) Click the menu button, click Help, and select Troubleshooting Information. In the tab that opens, go to the Profile Folder entry in the General Information section and click the Open Folder button. Your Thunderbird profile folder will now open in Windows Explorer. Close Thunderbird. In Windows Explorer, go up three levels in your Thunderbird profile folder. Right-click in the folder. Then select Paste. When prompted, replace your current data. Alternative method for manual transfer between computers running Windows 10 and Windows 11 The instructions in this chapter are based on you having a standard installation of Windows and using computers that have been upgraded from earlier versions of Windows to Windows 10. </p><p>Locate the main profile folder on your source computer (as described above). Locate the main profile folder on your destination computer (as described above). Keep in mind that your username (identified by the ~ character, see the file paths below) may be different on the two computers, but this is irrelevant for the manual transfer described here. Completely exit Thunderbird on both computers. On your source computer, copy the Thunderbird folders contained in the two file paths Windows(C:)/Users/~/AppData/Roaming and Windows(C:)/Users/~/Appdata/Local as separate folders to a data transfer device (USB stick, external drive, or similar) so that they are not overwritten. On your destination computer, delete all Thunderbird folders in the destination folders Windows(C:)/Users/~/AppData/Roaming and Windows(C:)/Users/~/Appdata/Local, or rename both Thunderbird folders if you need a data backup or want to keep your old profile. Copy the correct Thunderbird folders that you previously saved separately from your data transfer device to the two target folders mentioned above on your target computer to replace the deleted or renamed Thunderbird folders. Start Thunderbird on the destination computer and test it. Make sure that the inbox tab is identical to the tab on the source computer, but other tabs with Thunderbird messages may have been opened. </p>",karl-heinz.kopplin,false,0,0

(new PC) </blockquote> <p>Even with this new picture I am unable to explain why your archive year subfolders (2008, 2009, ... etc) are not displayed as subfolders of ""archive"" - as they should -  but directly as folders of the Local Folders. On the other hand the Unsent Messages and Trash files should not be stored in ""archives.sbd"" but directly in Local Folders. May be I am missing something in your pictures, that's why I prefer working with folder hierarchy views like in the macOS Finder.  </p> <em><p>myerscough.paul <a href=""#answer-1775140"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> And with it the old PC's folders view showing local folder </blockquote> <p>I think that the best and most easy solution would be as follows: on your old PC copy the <strong>entire</strong> ""Local Folders"" folder from Mail (in the profile folder), transfer it on the new PC. On the new PC open the profile folder &gt; Mail, quit Thunderbird and move Local Folders in another directory, e.g. Documents. Then put your Local Folders from the old PC in the Mail folder on the new PC and start Thunderbird. </p> <em><p>myerscough.paul <a href=""#answer-1775140"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> I wonder if there is any problem with handling duplicate folder names.
