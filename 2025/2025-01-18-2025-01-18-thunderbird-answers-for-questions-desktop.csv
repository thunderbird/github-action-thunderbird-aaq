But for some reason you are asking the same question expecting a different answer.  Nothing has changed.  Except you apparently think you have email in those folders.  Do not be sure of that.  If it is IMAP it is little more than a local cache and is subject to deletion without notice.  Simply accessing the folder may be enough to see the mail in it deleted as the server can not be contacted and logged into. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

The question I referenced (which I cannot add to) does not help in all situations which I explained and then described my situation, which I have not seen others have. </p><p>The question hasn't changed because it is the same question (with a nuance) and if I could have added to it I would have, but there was a BANNER to say if you have the same or similar question then ask it again as it was archived. Which is exactly what I did and then got ragged on by you. </p><p>I know exactly how IMAP works and how its different from say POP3. This is not a question about how IMAP works. its about ""Is there a way to stop Thunderbird attempting a log in"" period. </p><p>There is no IMAP protocol based reason to force you to have to log in every time you open thunderbird and then repeatedly during the day. This is a thunderbird thing. </p>",developerchris1,false,0,0
