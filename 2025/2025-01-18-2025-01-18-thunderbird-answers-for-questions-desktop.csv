But for some reason you are asking the same question expecting a different answer.  Nothing has changed.  Except you apparently think you have email in those folders.  Do not be sure of that.  If it is IMAP it is little more than a local cache and is subject to deletion without notice.  Simply accessing the folder may be enough to see the mail in it deleted as the server can not be contacted and logged into. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
