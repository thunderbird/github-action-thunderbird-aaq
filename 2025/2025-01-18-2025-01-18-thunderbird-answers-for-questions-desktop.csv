But for some reason you are asking the same question expecting a different answer.  Nothing has changed.  Except you apparently think you have email in those folders.  Do not be sure of that.  If it is IMAP it is little more than a local cache and is subject to deletion without notice.  Simply accessing the folder may be enough to see the mail in it deleted as the server can not be contacted and logged into. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

The question I referenced (which I cannot add to) does not help in all situations which I explained and then described my situation, which I have not seen others have. </p><p>The question hasn't changed because it is the same question (with a nuance) and if I could have added to it I would have, but there was a BANNER to say if you have the same or similar question then ask it again as it was archived. Which is exactly what I did and then got ragged on by you. </p><p>I know exactly how IMAP works and how its different from say POP3. This is not a question about how IMAP works. its about ""Is there a way to stop Thunderbird attempting a log in"" period. </p><p>There is no IMAP protocol based reason to force you to have to log in every time you open thunderbird and then repeatedly during the day.

It seems Thunderbird is unable to stop that process which can be rather annoying for some people. </p><p><br> Do you ever need to Get Messages from that gmail account in the future&nbsp;? If no then, it may be a good idea to get copies of emails put into the 'Local Folders' mail account - but make sure you use the 'Copy to' option and then double check you have good copies of full email and not just headers. That means you could then remove the account. </p><p>Possible workaround - Create a new profile just for the imap gmail account and set everyting up and get emails etc. Then you can remove the gmail account from main default profile. Always start with usual default profile, but should you ever need to check the gmail account and get it updated then open the secondary profile.  Then it should only download server when you use that other profile. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
