But for some reason you are asking the same question expecting a different answer.  Nothing has changed.  Except you apparently think you have email in those folders.  Do not be sure of that.  If it is IMAP it is little more than a local cache and is subject to deletion without notice.

If no then, it may be a good idea to get copies of emails put into the 'Local Folders' mail account - but make sure you use the 'Copy to' option and then double check you have good copies of full email and not just headers. That means you could then remove the account. </p><p>Possible workaround - Create a new profile just for the imap gmail account and set everyting up and get emails etc. Then you can remove the gmail account from main default profile. Always start with usual default profile, but should you ever need to check the gmail account and get it updated then open the secondary profile.

This is the standard practise for anyone using an imape account if they need to keep emails but not keep the account. It's also used when people need to keep access to emails, but need to move them off the server in order to increase their available quota. Then you do not need to keep the gmail account. You can always make an image of the saved passwords display, just in case you need to use it and store it in a useful desktop folder.  </p><p>Select gmail imap folder - highlight emails in folder and use right click on highlighted emails &gt; Copy to &gt; select folder in 'Local Folders' mail account.
