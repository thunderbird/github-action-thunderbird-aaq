Somewhere, there is a step being done that causes this problem. Let's start over. - Delete the appata\Local\THunderbird folder on new PC = Delete the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder - download and install a current version from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> - start thunderbird once and exit 0this creates the dummy appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder  - NOW, repeat the steps I posted.

Instead of downloading from the repository using dnf (sudo dnf install thunderbird) which downloaded and installed version 140.03, I went directly to the Thunderbird website where I downloaded v144.0.   This took care of the problem after de-installing all traces of the offending software. </p><p>I might also note that, originally, I download the flatpack for v140.03.
