I've tried multiple ways, and none of them work: - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-R or Ctrl-L) - Menu item  </p><pre>  -- Message &gt; Reply   -- Message &gt; Forward </pre> <p>- Right click, then select Reply or Forward - Customized menu -- buttons for Reply and Forward </p><p>Other keyboard shortcuts/menu items work from the Message List, including compose new message, open, delete, tag, forward as attachment, etc. </p><p>When I open the Message Pane (F8), I am able to reply and forward from the Message List using all of the above methods. But I don't want the Message Pane displayed. </p><p>When i opened TB in ""troubleshooting mode,"" the problem persisted. I don't have any extensions installed.  </p><p>I searched and searched and couldn't find anyone else asking this question, so I'm hoping someone here can help. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tdn
