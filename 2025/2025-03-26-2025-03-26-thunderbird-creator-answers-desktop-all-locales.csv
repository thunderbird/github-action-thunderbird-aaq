I often need to transfer e-mail from one account to another within the client.  Transferring messages from one account to another goes smoothly when they do not have attachments or when the attachment is less than 5MB in size When the message I move contains attachments weighing more than 5MB, Thunderbird crashes and the transfer does not happen. The only solution found, which I would like to avoid, is to download the message with a ‘'save as,’' then drag the .eml file to the right folder in the different account. I have checked and Google does not block the transfer nor are there any problems with quotas (I am a Google Wokspace administrator). Google support confirms to me that there are no blocks and that the operation should go smoothly. They suggest that I contact Thunderbird support. Is there a procedure or setting in the program that allows messages to be transferred smoothly from one account to another even when they contain attachments?
