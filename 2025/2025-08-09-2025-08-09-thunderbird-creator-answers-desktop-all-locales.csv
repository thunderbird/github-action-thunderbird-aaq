All I want to do is get back to my emails. </pre> <p>I've been using Thunderbird for as long as I remember. </p><p>First, some background. For weeks now my computer has been telling me It needs more space to download updates. I throw out a few ""Gigs"" but it always wants more. </p><pre> My C:Drive, ""110 GB solid state"" is only for the Windows 10 operating system and a very small </pre> <p>number of programs. Everything used to take up less than half the drive. All my personal work is on a separate drive. I've been saving for a new computer for a long time, still not there yet. </p><pre> My Problem:  I switched on my computer and it said Thunderbird had downloaded updates do I want to install </pre> <p>them, yes. It twirled a bit but it never started Thunderbird, So, I tried starting it from the shortcut on desk top. But it said ""It had been changed or moved"" and no longer worked, neither would the one from the start column. </p><pre> So I tried Re-installing Thunderbird. In the instructions it said download then press ""Run"". </pre> <p>First it said I don't have permission to load it where it was before. It's my computer, I'm the only one here and I installed it here in 2010. (Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird) </p><pre> So I downloaded to ""User"" then it says ""Finish installing"".. How, there's no buttons and no </pre> <p>mention of ""Run"". I'm completely stuck, can anybody help me&nbsp;??  I've just realized without Thunderbird how can we communicate&nbsp;?? </p><pre>  Norm </pre>",thunderbird;install;,thunderbird,install,en-US,"",movinggraphics
