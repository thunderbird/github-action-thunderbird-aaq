All I want to do is get back to my emails. </pre> <p>I've been using Thunderbird for as long as I remember. </p><p>First, some background. For weeks now my computer has been telling me It needs more space to download updates. I throw out a few ""Gigs"" but it always wants more. </p><pre> My C:Drive, ""110 GB solid state"" is only for the Windows 10 operating system and a very small </pre> <p>number of programs. Everything used to take up less than half the drive. All my personal work is on a separate drive. I've been saving for a new computer for a long time, still not there yet. </p><pre> My Problem:  I switched on my computer and it said Thunderbird had downloaded updates do I want to install </pre> <p>them, yes. It twirled a bit but it never started Thunderbird, So, I tried starting it from the shortcut on desk top. But it said ""It had been changed or moved"" and no longer worked, neither would the one from the start column. </p><pre> So I tried Re-installing Thunderbird. In the instructions it said download then press ""Run"". </pre> <p>First it said I don't have permission to load it where it was before. It's my computer, I'm the only one here and I installed it here in 2010. (Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird) </p><pre> So I downloaded to ""User"" then it says ""Finish installing"".. How, there's no buttons and no </pre> <p>mention of ""Run"". I'm completely stuck, can anybody help me&nbsp;??  I've just realized without Thunderbird how can we communicate&nbsp;?? </p><pre>  Norm </pre>",thunderbird;install;,thunderbird,install,en-US,"",movinggraphics

The search bar is visible but it's impossible to write inside it. There's no way to ask for help to the developer, unless you use GiyHub, but I'm not a developer, so I'd like to know only if there's some known issue with the actual version of Thunderbird (I use the 141.0) or, instead, nobody signalled this problem. This function is so useful and the default Thunderbird search doesn't work well. </p><p>Can you give me some information? </p><p>I've attached a screen of the issue, the box spotted by the red arrow is not usable </p><p>Thank you </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,it,1755084;,manuel.filippucci

My main account retrieves messages quickly (within a couple of seconds) but my other accounts take several minutes (20-30 min) even although there are only a couple of light messages to sync. I do not want to switch to IMAP because I want to delete my messages from the server once they've been synced to my computer. </p><p>Here is an excerpt from the console error messages: 12:42:06,307 pop3.server3.3: NetworkTimeoutError: a Network error occurred Pop3Client.sys.mjs:365:18 12:42:06,308 pop3.server3.3: SecurityError info: Pop3Client.sys.mjs:407:20 </p><p>12:47:08,468 pop3.server4.6: NetworkTimeoutError: a Network error occurred Pop3Client.sys.mjs:365:18 12:47:08,471 pop3.server4.6: SecurityError info: Pop3Client.sys.mjs:407:20 </p><p>12:52:08,522 pop3.server6.7: NetworkTimeoutError: a Network error occurred Pop3Client.sys.mjs:365:18 12:52:08,529 pop3.server6.7: SecurityError info: Pop3Client.sys.mjs:407:20 </p><p>12:57:58,751 pop3.server4.69: NetworkTimeoutError: a Network error occurred Pop3Client.sys.mjs:365:18 12:57:58,755 pop3.server4.69: SecurityError info: Pop3Client.sys.mjs:407:20 </p><p>I have verified that my POP3 settings match those recommended by gmail (server, port, SSL/TLS, authentication), but the errors persist. </p><p>Could you please advise me on: Possible causes for these types of errors in Thunderbird. Steps to diagnose and fix this issue (especially regarding certificates and connection timeouts). Whether any specific configuration is needed for Gmail POP3 with OAuth2. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help.
