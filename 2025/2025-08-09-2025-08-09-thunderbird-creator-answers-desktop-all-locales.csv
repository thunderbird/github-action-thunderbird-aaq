All I want to do is get back to my emails. I've been using Thunderbird for as long as I remember. </p><p>First, some background. For weeks now my computer has been telling me It needs more space to download updates. I throw out a few ""Gigs"" but it always wants more. My C:Drive, ""110 GB solid state"" is only for the Windows 10 operating system and a very small number of programs. Everything used to take up less than half the drive. All my personal work is on a separate drive. I've been saving for a new computer for a long time, still not there yet. </p><p>My Problem: I switched on my computer and it said Thunderbird had downloaded updates do I want to install them, yes. It twirled a bit but it never started Thunderbird, So, I tried starting it from the shortcut on desk top. But it said ""It had been changed or moved"" and no longer worked, neither would the one from the start column. </p><p>So I tried Re-installing Thunderbird. In the instructions it said download then press ""Run"". First it said I don't have permission to load it where it was before. It's my computer, I'm the only one here and I installed it here in 2010. (Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird) </p><p>So I downloaded to ""User"" then it says ""Finish installing"".. How, there's no buttons and no mention of ""Run"". I'm completely stuck, can anybody help me&nbsp;??  I've just realized without Thunderbird how can we communicate&nbsp;?? </p><pre>  Norm </pre>",thunderbird;install;,thunderbird,install,en-US,1755136;,movinggraphics

The search bar is visible but it's impossible to write inside it. There's no way to ask for help to the developer, unless you use GiyHub, but I'm not a developer, so I'd like to know only if there's some known issue with the actual version of Thunderbird (I use the 141.0) or, instead, nobody signalled this problem. This function is so useful and the default Thunderbird search doesn't work well. </p><p>Can you give me some information? </p><p>I've attached a screen of the issue, the box spotted by the red arrow is not usable </p><p>Thank you </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,it,1755084;,manuel.filippucci

Unlike many competitors, it prioritizes user privacy, offering built-in tracking protection, enhanced security, and customizable settings. Being open-source, it benefits from global developer contributions, ensuring constant improvement. Its speed, lightweight design, and support for numerous extensions make it a favorite among power users and casual surfers alike. Firefox also emphasizes transparency, avoiding invasive data collection. Regular updates keep it secure and modern, while its cross-platform support ensures a seamless experience across devices. For those seeking a reliable, fast, and privacy-focused free browser, Mozilla Firefox remains unmatched. <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">more details</a> </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",alightmotionseo
