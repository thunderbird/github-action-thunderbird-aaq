The second image (the one on the right) it had 'Alternative text' box selected but the alternative text was a load of base64 data of the actual image. This data should not be in the 'Alternative text' - it is the data for the inline image that auto is created by Thunderbird and gets shown at the bottom of the email after the content in the Content type: image/jpeg etc section.

I just have G-mail and I use Thunderbird to see it on my computer and just the regular mail app on the two apple devices.  The weird thing was it happened a while ago and I called Apple.  The man was super helpful and helped me with a recovery tool.  It brought back all my old deleted files, but the missing video was not in it.  It was alot of busy work to go through everything only to find that wasn't there.  So he figured it was something wrong with the G-mail server.  I don't know how long G-mail keeps things on server, but I have some e-mails that I have saved for years, so it must not have a limit.  I don't want my devices deleting things automatically.

To give context, here is some background. I used Juno 4 since email was first available --- probably more than 30 years ago. Last summer, the Juno 4 local client stopped working (the Juno Webmail still works). Thunderbird was the only local email client I could find. As soon as I started using it, it used my Juno email address. That made life much easier than if I would have had to change to a new email address. </p><p>Juno was straightforward and very simple to use.

So that is my background. </p><p>Here are some things I don't understand: </p><p>""Local Folders are folders physically on your computer and not usually associated with accounts."" </p><p>1. Juno 4 was a POP client so all emails were stored physically on my computer. I have many thousands of stored emails. Thunderbird is unclear as to whether or not it is POP.

What is an account? </p><p>""These (local folders) are not useful if you use your email account equally between phone an PC or between multiple PCs."" </p><p>3. I use my phone for talking.

No details of the account have been posted, and it seems a waste of time without that from him. The Juno site indicates that Juno 5 supports POP and IMAP that seems the safest road, especially since he has so many folders. The work to possibly convert and import all the folders seems a big task since I am not aware even of the Juno folder format. This looks iike a rabbithole, lacking facts. It isn't our responsibility to know his account settings.  </p><p>To Joe,  - click to 'account settings' menu - click 'server settings' link in left side.  if the right side of screen says IMAP, then the account is IMAP. if you do not want IMAP, then delete the account. then, start over and create a new account and be sure to specify POP during setup  - once you have the account working, you can investigate importing folders. to do that, and receive assistance, you need to do a screenshot of the Juno folders as they appear in Windows File Explorer. That will let people here make suggestions on what might work.

The junk filter in Thunderbird has to be trained.” I thought that is what I was doing. What should I do to train it? For example, if I designate email from a specific email address as junk, Thunderbird still puts emails from that address in my inbox. Thunderbird also arbitrarily puts emails NOT designated as junk in the Junk box. </p><p>2 POP and IMAP. I know that Juno is POP because all email downloaded to the Juno client is removed from the server. That is not the case with Thunderbird. Yet, Thunderbird documentation is vague about whether it is POP or IMAP. How can I set it to POP (respectively to IMAP)? </p><p>Regarding backups, I have all my data on a separate drive --- J:\ This includes installable applications, so if my C:\ drive becomes corrupted and Windows needs to be reinstalled, I can reinstall my applications. </p><p>Juno is on the J drive with a simple path: J:\Juno I would like to do that with Thunderbird. </p><p>3. ""C:\Users\User\Appdata\Roaming\Thunderbird I don’t buy into Microsoft’s trip. For example, I use Windows 7 and I have tweaked Windows 7 so that most of its stupid “features” have been removed or disabled. This would be difficult to do with Windows 10 and impossible with Windows 11 and beyond. I may just try to copy Thunderbird to the location I want and see whether I can make it work. </p><p>4.

It is a place where you can create folders to store messages that will exist only on your computer's drive, not on a server and not associated with any e-mail address. Such folders in Thunderbird can exist in two places: the local folders ""account"", where they have no conection to an e-mail address, and a POP account, where they are associated with an e-mail address.

If you want messages on the server (as well as in a local cache), they must be in server (IMAP) folders. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

Otherwise, Thunderbird isn't really usable for multiple machines because it requires all that manual filing of messages on multiple machines, instead of just doing it on one and having it duplicated on the others. </p>",davidkachel.photographer,false,0,0

More of a local cache.  If something happens to the account (like your do not renew the hosting package) or you do something questionable like delete all the mail server side or in another instance of Thunderbird or even if your mail server gets hacked and the hacker deletes the account contents. The next time Thunderbird goes online your local copies will be toast. </p><p>So I strongly suggest to anyone with Business records to maintain to use something other than IMAP to make your legally required archives.  You can export all the mail in an account from Thunderbird periodically as a backup,  but you can not rely on IMAP. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
