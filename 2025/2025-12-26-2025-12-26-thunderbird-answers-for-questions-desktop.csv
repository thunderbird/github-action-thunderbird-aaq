I just have G-mail and I use Thunderbird to see it on my computer and just the regular mail app on the two apple devices.  The weird thing was it happened a while ago and I called Apple.  The man was super helpful and helped me with a recovery tool.  It brought back all my old deleted files, but the missing video was not in it.  It was alot of busy work to go through everything only to find that wasn't there.  So he figured it was something wrong with the G-mail server.  I don't know how long G-mail keeps things on server, but I have some e-mails that I have saved for years, so it must not have a limit.  I don't want my devices deleting things automatically.

To give context, here is some background. I used Juno 4 since email was first available --- probably more than 30 years ago. Last summer, the Juno 4 local client stopped working (the Juno Webmail still works). Thunderbird was the only local email client I could find. As soon as I started using it, it used my Juno email address. That made life much easier than if I would have had to change to a new email address. </p><p>Juno was straightforward and very simple to use. By contrast, Thunderbird has all kinds of bells and whistles which completely baffle me. So that is my background. </p><p>Here are some things I don't understand: </p><p>""Local Folders are folders physically on your computer and not usually associated with accounts."" </p><p>1. Juno 4 was a POP client so all emails were stored physically on my computer. I have many thousands of stored emails. Thunderbird is unclear as to whether or not it is POP. Maybe it is IMAP and I don't understand what IMAP really is. </p><p>2. What is an account? </p><p>""These (local folders) are not useful if you use your email account equally between phone an PC or between multiple PCs."" </p><p>3. I use my phone for talking. Full stop. </p><p>4. With Juno, I could and still can use webmail from any computer. When the local client was working, I just used that for my main PC at home.

IMAP is a technology that keeps the messages on the server; that is useful if the user uses more than one PC or also uses phone for email access. POP keeps everything on the user's PC.  </p><p>An account is the setup for one email address. Thunderbird can handle an unlimited number of accounts. For example, some users have a personal email account and a business email account. Thunderbird keeps all messages separate for each.  </p><p>Subfolders can be helpful if you want to isolate some messages into groups for later review. For example, I have a subfolder for receipts and one for copies of online orders. My wife uses subfolders for each of her friends, letting her review prior discussions easily. To create a subfolder, just highlight the parent folder (such as Inbox), rightclick and select the 'new folder' option.  </p><p>Be sure to create a backup periodically; PCs sometimes crash.

Thunderbird <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/146.0/releasenotes/"" rel=""nofollow"">146 included many improvements</a> to the hub so disabling it should not be something you do until it is proven to be the issue. Unfortunately logging in the an email account in a browser no longer even confirms you know the password. Things between applications and webpages are so different now that the login processes often have not even a vague association. </p><p>Most folk that get this error also have issues with their antivirus or it's firewall component.  Those using the Norton product get far more exposure in this forum than the Norton product popularity would suggest.  Then there is the issue that some mail providers require you to enable access outside of a browser,  so lets start with what antivirus you use and do you get the same issues when you disable it.  They also often block access if there are more than a couple of failed login attempts.  So a failed setup can automatically lock setup out for 24 hours depending on the provider. </p><p>Folks are often using a VPN these days.
