Originally, Authentication Method was 'Normal Password' and you entered a normal password. Then gmail said Authentication Method was 'Normal Password' and you needed to switch on 2FA and use an app generated password instead of Normal Password.  This is still an option that's available but why use it when Oauth is now an option. That app specific/generated password is stored in the same location as all passwords and/or oauth tokens. </p><p>Gmail then wanted to use Oauth, so Thunderbird adapted. Now,  Authentication Method is set up as Oauth2 and the Oauth token is set up and stored by Thunderbird when you state to allow Thunderbird access to the gmail server. Thunderbird then uses the Oauth2 token. But once Oauth was available you could switch off gmail 2FA and not use an app generated password. </p><p>But I believe the one time 2SA (2 step verification) is Google adding a second level of security (albeit with a warning that texts maybe vulnerable to hacks) and I thought was just asked for by Google for verification that you really are you and you enter that 6 digit code into a Google sign in window. It is not required by Thunderbird itself as it will use the oauth token nor is it stored by Thunderbird. </p><p>Google say: <em>Use a verification code from a text message or call</em> <em>A 6-digit code is sent to a number you’ve previously provided. Codes can be sent in a text message or a voice call, which depends on the setting you chose.

Sure enough word had placed the information on the clipboard also as HTML.   A block of code 39,633 character long was what was offered.  Including extensive cascading style sheets that were not even used.

That is: with a new version of Thunderbird already set up to download messages from the IMAP account and showing all the dozens of folders that I maintain, and with Thunderbird not running, I replace the existing, empty copy of msgFilterRules.dat with the older, previously working one where all 31 filter rules worked as expected, leads to ALL of the ""move"" action filters reporting non-existent folders. Note the lack of change in the IMAP account; all the folders are still there. </p><p>Perhaps there is a semantic issue here for ""folder exists"" or not. I know that I need to ""subscribe"" to folders under IMAP or they don't show up. Perhaps this relates somehow to that subscription process? </p><p>I just checked my subscription status via a right-click within the folders window and a folder that just failed for a ""move"" action (a pop-up message reported the failure and at the same time, the filter was disabled), showed a check-mark under the subscription window; I am subscribed to that folder. I wonder if Thunderbird does not internally keep track of these subscriptions or rather if there is a disconnect between the subscriptions shown in the folders window and the subscribed folders known to the filter mechanism? Alternatively, perhaps Thunderbird keeps an alias name to the IMAP folder (something kind of internal ID for disambiguation?) and when changing hosts or profiles, those internally used names change? </p>",mdalphin1,false,0,0

The sync happens later. </p><p>Perhaps just dump the snap version and use DEB instead.  They do not have anywhere near the issues the SNAP ones do.

I see the issue of subscription to folders - I wonder is there an ""update"" all subscribed folders or ""sync"" all subscribed folders button so that the subscriptions are up to date and accessible to the mail filters? Is that even possible? I already know that installing Thunderbird on a new host, connecting it to Gmail and letting it synchronize to my ancient IMAP folders takes a very long (&gt;30 min) synchronization time and when that is done, most of the folders remain non-synchronized, requiring that I view them before the mail headers are downloaded. </p><p>As for SNAP, I have already adjusted Firefox to download directly from the Mozilla repo and I download the tar.gz of Thunderbird for installation in /usr/local/.

Or is the troublesome one offered by say Yahoo and the others by gmail.   </p><p>Is the troublesome on IMAP and the others POP? </p><p>Once thing you need to accept early,  if the person is in your address book and that address book is selected in the account settings as containing trusted addresses Thunderbird never places mail from those addresses into spam.  See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_whitelisting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#w_whitelisting</a> </p><p>Just because you see the issue you are describing appear in Thunderbird that is not necessarily where the issue lies.  Actually it is rarely where the issue lies.  Most folk these days have IMAP mail accounts and therefore their mail is synchronized to the mail server. This means if your mail provider comes up with hair brained definition of SPAM,  then suddenly Thunderbird will demonstrate exactly that by virtue of Synchronization. I mentioned Yahoo above,  but Outlook likewise does not offer you a way to opt out of their definitions and actions regarding spam either. Likewise of you have a phone app that does something odd (some delete mail very quickly to save space on cheaper phones with limited storage) and we see folk here complaining that Thunderbird is deleting their mail.  We also see regularly folk complaining that all their mail goes to spam instead of their inbox.  Historically this have been a function of antivirus products that fancy themselves as SPAM or SCAM managers.  But the nuances can be difficult because most folk these days own laptops with Wifi internet and that make most diagnostics difficult. They are cheap and cheerful for a reason. </p><p>So yes I see the problem,  but I am looking at a very large picture.  Much larger than the one I think you are looking at, where you are seeking a solution within Thunderbird for a problem that has not yet been more than blamed on Thunderbird for an account that I know nothing about at all.  Perhaps you might share enough information that I can stop guessing about what providers you use and what antivirus etc.  BTW if you say McAfee or Norton I will just tell you to uninstall them and see if the problem goes away.  I am done fighting with those two products. I see them as being as insidious as the threat they purport to protect from. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
