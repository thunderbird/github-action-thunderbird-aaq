Sure enough word had placed the information on the clipboard also as HTML.   A block of code 39,633 character long was what was offered.  Including extensive cascading style sheets that were not even used.  So just because there is an issue in Thunderbird the source might not be Thunderbird. </p><p>Just to be sort of complete,  word also placed rich text formatted text, plain text,  an enhanced meta file image of the text and a binary object that could be used for object linking and embedding among others.

That is: with a new version of Thunderbird already set up to download messages from the IMAP account and showing all the dozens of folders that I maintain, and with Thunderbird not running, I replace the existing, empty copy of msgFilterRules.dat with the older, previously working one where all 31 filter rules worked as expected, leads to ALL of the ""move"" action filters reporting non-existent folders. Note the lack of change in the IMAP account; all the folders are still there. </p><p>Perhaps there is a semantic issue here for ""folder exists"" or not. I know that I need to ""subscribe"" to folders under IMAP or they don't show up. Perhaps this relates somehow to that subscription process? </p><p>I just checked my subscription status via a right-click within the folders window and a folder that just failed for a ""move"" action (a pop-up message reported the failure and at the same time, the filter was disabled), showed a check-mark under the subscription window; I am subscribed to that folder. I wonder if Thunderbird does not internally keep track of these subscriptions or rather if there is a disconnect between the subscriptions shown in the folders window and the subscribed folders known to the filter mechanism? Alternatively, perhaps Thunderbird keeps an alias name to the IMAP folder (something kind of internal ID for disambiguation?) and when changing hosts or profiles, those internally used names change? </p>",mdalphin1,false,0,0

That should open file manager at the appdata\roaming folder and from there you would see the thunderbird folder. Another way to find profile is to click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open profile' and then exit thunderbird. you will now be in the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Usually expressed as a number of emails per day/hour or the like.  Each email address counts as an email for those type of things. SO if you address an email to 100 people and your provider limits you to 50 per hour,  the mail will not send. </p><p>BTW I think you forgot your link to the archived topic. </p><p>Support document on addressing an email:  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_adding-recipients-to-your-email-message"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_adding-recipients-to-your-email-message</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
