I've now found the Files &amp; Attachments section in v102 -- one of the options for PDF files is Use Adobe Acrobat (default) and that must have been ticked (by default) in earlier versions from 91.  Tbird, in its wisdom, changed that in my copy of ver 102, and I have now changed it back to the Adobe option as above. </p><p>While I'm grateful that you identified the settings element that I wanted, I was very surprised that, particularly as you are a Moderator, you chose to use such pejorative language answering my question.  There are many Tbird users who, for good reasons (usually associated with add-ons that are not available in later versions), use an older version.

It will remain open for 6 months waiting for you. </p><p>Fundamentally you have to look at the source of your text before you even think about complaining.  Microsoft Word and other application software generally classed as ""Word processors"" are designed to place marks on paper. They are mostly very good with old fashioned typography.  Not so much with modern copy and paste as the capability of the destination is unknown. </p><p>A good example of that is when you paste from Microsoft Word.  I was playing with the process for another support topic just a couple of days ago. Pasting from word a small sentence ""Some  silly text"" from word to Thunderbird with a hyperlink under silly.  In plain text terms 16 characters was placed on the system clipboard by word for me to paste.  However Thunderbird if it has a choice will paste formatted HTML text.  Sure enough word had placed the information on the clipboard also as HTML.   A block of code 39,633 character long was what was offered.  Including extensive cascading style sheets that were not even used.  So just because there is an issue in Thunderbird the source might not be Thunderbird. </p><p>Just to be sort of complete,  word also placed rich text formatted text, plain text,  an enhanced meta file image of the text and a binary object that could be used for object linking and embedding among others.  Pressing copy is an apparently  simple function,  but what happens under the hood is complex and can involve a lot of moving parts. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

What to do? </blockquote> <p>Quite possibly just get rid of your antivirus.  Windows 11 has a quite competent antivirus in Defender.  Antivirus products cause the vast majority of configuration failures either through their various malware detection routines (Nortons SONAR is an example) or through their software firewalls and VPNs.  This also extends to each and every update of Thunderbird for some of them. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Usually expressed as a number of emails per day/hour or the like.  Each email address counts as an email for those type of things. SO if you address an email to 100 people and your provider limits you to 50 per hour,  the mail will not send. </p><p>BTW I think you forgot your link to the archived topic. </p><p>Support document on addressing an email:  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_adding-recipients-to-your-email-message"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/addressing-email#w_adding-recipients-to-your-email-message</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
