The error started yesterday (21 November) and I get the same error message as ajs1101. Just finished conversing with Optus support and they confirmed that it's not at their end: webmail works okay, can receive email and send it (will note there was a hiccough earlier briefly when could not send from webmail, but okay now). All settings as recommended (port for incoming server actually different from what Optus recommends, but when I changed it from 995 to 110, Thunderbird stopped being able to download emails, so changed it back again. Port for outgoing is as recommended, 25.) </p><p>I have the latest version of Thunderbird for Mac, 145.0. </p><p>My partner, who also uses Thunderbird, cannot receive emails either. He has an older Mac running an older OS.  </p><p>I have included two images, the second one showing details of selected server. When I clicked 'fetch certificate' it failed. Does that signify anything important? </p>",thewordygecko,false,0,0

It has essentially been reserved for servers for the last 20 years. </p><p>Is there a VPN in use,  many ISP's refuse to send mail unless you connect to the internet using their service.  A VPN masks that.  It used to be a mostly US issue,  but it does sound like the sort of thing Optus would do. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
