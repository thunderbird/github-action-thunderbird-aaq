I don't know which version you have been using lately on your old Mac Mini. Most of the files in this profile have modification dates from 2012, which means thirteen years ago. Since 2012 many of those files should have migrated to a new format, some files have been abandoned or been replaced by others, e:g localstore.rdf by xulstore.json </p><p>If you started an actual Thunderbird version in this profile maybe you would see your accounts and messages, but you'd have no address books, your passwords would be lost, TB would ask them again and again without being able to save them since it can't migrate signons3.txt to logins.json, neither migrate all .mab files to the new .sqlite format.  I have seen those problems in the German forum when user wanted to pass directly from TB 38 or 45 to TB 115 without creating a new profile. I wonder why your old profile from 2012 didn't evolve during all those years. Did you never update to new Thunderbird versions? </p><p>There is another glitch in your qqg8c078.Restoration profile folder with the modified date from 11/21/25: it contains a <strong>second</strong> qqg8c078.Restoration profile folder with a modified date from 2/11/24.

You are right that there is a 2012 Profile that was a significant save.  I had archived a lot of my work files into local folders in TB that I didn't access much. I had a hackintosh prior to going back to a mini-mac and I remember temporarily struggling with a TB update just prior to reorganizing all those files.  I am running the most current version of TB on both machines 140.05esr.  The profile with the 2012 local files was the first I found so I was mildly relieved I hadn't lost 'everything'. When rounded up all of the Profiles I had (both old and the ones I created in my panic of losing my data) I went through each by the sbd files.  The one I posted to show you was the one that had very recent folders that I had created in the Inbox. (all of which had disappeared during the migration). I think what you're telling me is that that Profile, while it may have those folders listed, is still not 'complete', giving TB the direction it needs to load the profile and operate as it had before I attempted any of this.  I do indeed get asked for my passwords repeatedly. I stupidly bought a 2024 mini with only 256 working memory and added an 8G stick (never again) so I ended up botching my use of CCC to make a backup startup disc if things went sour.  Mapenzi, I did update TB each time I was notified (I'm a lot better at that than I am using my TimeMachine). Your question makes me think I haven't found the most current Profile yet.  It was the largest with 12+G and it had those recent folders so I assumed I had it. I can dig again. Rick had asked if I needed the passwords, addresses, and calendars. The first 2 are easily replaceable. The calendars may be more important. </p>",jorma12,false,0,0

The calendars I remember working really hard to keep updated while using a Mac and working in a Windows environment, so there is some info. I'd be reluctant to lose. However, the folders that I had everything from the past 13 years organized within the Inbox are certainly the most critical pieces for me. The one aspect of this retrieval that I'm most concerned about at this point is choosing the wrong profile to work with as I attempt whatever strategy to return to the original state. As I look at that Inbox that had my 2025 Mail.sbd the items are listed as .mozeml files.

The more and larger the files without extensions, the more messages you should be able to salvage. </p><p>And then wait for guidance from Mapenzi.

For the last couple of hours I reexamined every TB profile I had looking for the sbd files in the Mail and and IMap folders.
