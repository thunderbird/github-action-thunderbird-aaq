Before the last update to TB 140.0.1esr, I was using the version 128.11.1esr on my computers without any issue. But, following the installation of TB 140.0.1esr on one of my computers running MacOS 10.15.7, I notice a strange behavior of the application: (1) the application was running slower than the previous version, (2) when I try to close the application, I receive the system message that this ""application quit unexpectedly"", (3) the diagnostic test of my system shows that the CPU time is used at about 35% by the TB application. I had to completely remove the TB 140.0.1esr and painfully reinstall the previous version (128.11.1esr), due to the corrupted user profile! Now the TB 128.11.1esr runs normally and required about 0.3% of CPU time. So it will be imperative to look upon the compatibility of TB 140.0.1esr with MacOS 10.15.7. I did not try to install this update to my Mac M2 machines, following my issues with Mac intel machines.

Here's why I'm asking. My email on Thunderbird is currently a POP account, which means my folders only reside on my computer and are not accessible on my other devices. I need to change my email to IMAP so the folders reside on my email provider's computer and are thus available on all my devices. Before I make that change, I'm told I have to back up my existing emails and folders. How do I do that? How do I reinstall them once I've reconfigured Thunderbird to IMAP? </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1749843;,johndavid.pankratz

Okay, now I have two sets of mailboxes on Thunderbird, one set on the old server (messages up to February 2025) and one set on the new server (all messages thereafter). Yesterday I set about migrating to get all the messages onto the new server so that I can discontinue the old service entirely. Mailbox by mailbox I copied my entire email filing system successfully – with one exception. When I tried to do this with my ""Sent"" mailbox, the messages just don't move.  </p><p>Okay, try a workaround: on the old server I created a new mailbox called ""Sent messages"" (in contrast to the built-in ""Sent"" mailbox). I moved all my messages from the ""Sent"" mailbox to that one. Success. Now I tried moving (or copying using the alt key) messages from ""sent messages"" to a mailbox of the same name on the new server. Nothing happens. Or perhaps, sometimes it copies the one message that I directly pointed to but will not do a mass move or copy. </p><p>I'm guessing that it has an issue with moving messages that are 'from me'. But I really want to save this history! is there some good way around this issue? </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1749866;1750105;1750114;,ken225

The SMTP error only occurs when I try to send mail from via my cable modem. Called our ISP (Videotron), but they swear it cannot be a problem with them, because I am able to send mail via their Webmail interface. I am skeptical, but they state that the ""internal error AUP#EML-005"" is not coming from their SMTP server, that it must be generated erroneously by Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1749938;,Montreal67
