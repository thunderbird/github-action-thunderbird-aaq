So if ""Account Action"" no longer available where are the many steps featured there?  I did find ""Remove account"" in, I think, Account Settings"".  Cannot get my primary Comcast account to re-install or retrieve email.  I can get secondary account with inbox working okay.   Have tried deleting account and re-installing.  But ""Done"" is grayed-out. My account server settings are thus: Manual configuration: Incoming: Imap Hostname:  <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a> Port: 993 Connection security: SSL/TLS Authentication method: OAuth2 Username: xxxxx [my email addresss] </p><p>Outgoing server: Hostname: <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> Port: 465 Connect. security: SSL/TLS Authentication method: OAuth2 Username: xxxx [my email addresss] </p>",edmeek,false,0,0
