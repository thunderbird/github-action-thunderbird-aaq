I just followed the instruction here: <a href=""https://sites.google.com/a/wis.edu.hk/students/leavers-guide/how-to-open-mbox-files-from-google-takeout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/a/wis.edu.hk/students/leavers-guide/how-to-open-mbox-files-from-google-takeout</a> </p><p>After that worked, I decided I would like to use the app for all of my e-mail accounts. Firstly, I added my main e-mail account in which all e-mails were received and displayed on the app. However, after posting my initial query here I noticed that I was unable to send e-mails.  </p><p>After I added additional e-mail accounts, none of the e-mails were received to those accounts, so they were one step behind the initial account that I had added, despite going through the same process.  </p><p>I deleted and reinstalled the app - started from scratch as I deleted all the other files on the laptop. I will not reinstall the add-on.  </p><p>David, are you suggesting that I may need to go to <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> to change some settings there regarding IMAP? I had to do a search for IMAP - at the limits of my knowledge here.  </p><p>Thanks </p>",kknnwwllcc,false,0,0
