I had transferred my email account to The Messaging Company (big mistake I think) because my provider (Exetel) suggested them when they stopped hosting an email service. That's when I started having trouble receiving emails that I knew were sent and I thought that maybe my old emails were kept on the server too long and were taking up too much space so I went into Thunderbird to change the settings to delete emails that had been on the server for 2 weeks or more. I've tried starting Thunderbird in safe mode with no result. I downloaded the latest version from the Mozilla site and reinstalled Thunderbird but as soon as I start the program it takes me straight into the ""frozen"" Account Settings page that I can't get out of. I have gone into The Profiles folder and I've included a screenshot of what's there. The latest profile was created when I tried to change the Account Settings. Can I delete that profile and go back to the one created on 9/6/2025? </p>",geoffreysmith,false,0,0

I am trying to learn some more every day. Forgive me if I didn't explain myself clearly. I just installed Thunderbird, and I have read that you can move your emails from the provider's IMAP server to a local file reducing the amount (quota) of space they have provided me (also I would like to have all my emails in my local NAS).  </p><p>For years I have used Outlook and the way I ""moved or Backup"" my emails was to create a .pst file on my NAS and clear the inbox and sub-folder from Outlook. Now, I was trying to create a set of folders in Thunderbird to move those emails into my local NAS and reduce the numbers of emails on my provider's server. (Maybe I dont have a full understanding of ""local folders""). </p><p>So, my question is how to direct my ""archives"" emails to a local NAS and remove them from my provider's server. (see attached) when I create a ""local folder"" I get the ""mailbox://nobody@Local folders/archives location. I tried to type there to redirect but won't allowed it.

Anything in 'Local Folders' account is stored on computer in Thunderbird profile.  It does not synchronise with any server. The mbox files storing emails are completely separate. </p><p>If you want to increase the amount of quota in an imap account then you would do this: In 'Local Folders' account </p> <ul><li> Create suitably named folders ready to receive emails. </li></ul> <p>In Imap account </p> <ul><li> select/highlight batches of emails. </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails and select '<strong>Copy to'</strong> and choose 'Local Folders' &gt; folder name </li></ul> <p>I would always advise you use 'Copy to' and not 'Move to' because if something goes wrong then you can repeat the action. There is a lot of server jibber jabber going on when it comes to imap accounts and some people also have an AV scanning anything file that gets opened. The 'Move to' does have the effect of deleting off server, so if something goes wrong with communication with server you may lose emails. It's not worth the risk. </p><p>Important: Do check you can read the emails you have copied into Local Folders because I have known people to unwittingly copy just headers which is no use. </p><p>Once you are certain you have good copies, then you can start to delete all those emails from the Imap folder. That in turn deletes off server thus increasing quota allowance. Please remember to 'compact' the imap folder after you have moved/deleted emails as this cleans up the mbox file and removes all old traces of moved/deleted emails. It also reduces file size and helps to reduce risk of file corruption - basic good housekeeping maintenance. </p> <ul><li> Right click on folder and select 'Compact' </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

Much to my surprise Comcast allows you to keep using your Comcast email even after you've canceled your service. The only requirement is that you log into those accounts in their web UI once every 90 days. So for the time being we have no issues sending and receiving Comcast email despite not being on their network. I'm not counting on that lasting forever. It does make transitioning to gmail easier. </p><p>I use a VPN for work but I do that inside a virtual machine. I do not use any form of VPN on the host machine. The issues happened whether the virtual machine was running or not. </p><p>The new computer did not come with anything preinstalled but we have been using Bitdefender for some time now. At the first difficulty I uninstalled their Thunderbird plugin and that didn't seem to make a difference. What has helped - and possibly solved the issue - is to create exceptions for the two gmail mailbox folders in question. Makes some sense though we don't need to do that for Comcast and never had to do it on the old computer. Or on my wife's machine for that matter.
