You say that the messages appeared after re-starting Thunderbird, so they were downloaded successfully and they are present. But you also say that they are lost.

I don't know why they did not appear at first but then appeared later. I also am not familiar with that error message. If you see it again, would you please post a screenshot of it? </p><p>One possible explanation for not seeing any messages at first even though the count of messages appeared above the message list is that you had a quick filter set. Re-starting Thunderbird removed the quick filter and showed the messages. This may not be what happened in your case. It's just a possible explanation that should not cause any concern. </p><p>And that message appeared *before* Thunderbird retrieved the one hundred messages, so it was not relevant to them? </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

These are the ones present the last time I ran Thunderbird, a few days ago. This is what was meant by the ""existing"" adjective: ""Having closed Thunderbird and relaunched, the folder with all the existing emails appeared."" The new ones – those received in the intervening period – do not appear in the list and are not on the server either. </p>",DonnyDave,false,0,0
