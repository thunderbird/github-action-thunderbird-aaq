OR do you mean you have two computers, old one using Windows 10 and new one using Windows 11&nbsp;? </p><p>Did you need to reinstall Thunderbird? If yes, where did you get the download/installation of thunderbird&nbsp;? This is important because the official website download from this link: <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> would put the Profile in an easy accessible default location as mentioned in all the  various Help  Articles etc , but if you got the latest Thunderbird via the Windows App Store then it gets more complicated as Windows stores everything in a completely different location. </p><p>Did Thunderbird ask you to create a mail account?  If yes, this tells me you are using a new profile.  This info combined with previous question would tell me where it got created. </p><p>In Windows C drive, do you see a folder called 'windows.old'&nbsp;? If yes - click on it to see the contents do you see this 'Thunderbird' folder this in that location: </p> <ul><li> C:/Users/Username/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>Does that 'Thunderbird' folder contain 'Profiles' folder which has profile name folders that contain abook.sqlite files of good size&nbsp;? Does the 'ImapMail' or 'Mail' folder contain mail account name folders&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
