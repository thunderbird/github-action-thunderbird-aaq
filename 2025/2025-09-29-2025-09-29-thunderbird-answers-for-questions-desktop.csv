There should be a couple of hundred folders in there- none are showing, just a Trash &amp; an Outbox folder. When I look in the two current profile folders, looking at the respective folder tree .json files, I can see all the folder names there, but they are not showing up in Thunderbird. I tried restarting the program but it made no difference. So two steps forward, one step back! </p><p>Any help greatly appreciated. </p><p>Ken. </p>",bats059,false,0,0

If your website has caching, try clearing it and then refresh the page. Also, check that your website is public and not locked behind a login. If you're using a website builder like WordPress or Wix, double-check that you’re adding the tag in the SEO or custom code section. </p>",sanjay210no,false,0,1
