You're not. We're peers, just as you, offering tips where we know them. Developers usually set a max release level to what they feel sure will work. So, when a developer sets an addon for a max of 128, that does not mean it won't work with 128, it only means that 136 wasn't available when the addon was updated. You can experiment on your own, if you don't mind a bit of risk. the addon is actually a zip file. you can unzip it, open the manifest.json file and change the max number to whatever you wish, rezip and install and see if it works. I have done that many times with no problems with addons, but not 100%. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Possibly Refused by server because server has no space</strong> If you have used up your quota - amount of space allowed on server, then server cannot offer space to send.

Please note:  If you have a Pop account then emails in Thunderbird are copies on your computer and they do not synchronise with server. So no worries.
