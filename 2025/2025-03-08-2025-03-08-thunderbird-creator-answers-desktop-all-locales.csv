Some error message would flash but disappear to quickly to be read. </p><p>UPDATE - it turned out to be address book corruption due to the database updating T136 does.  I started T136 and exported all my address books then went to the tbird profile and deleted all abook.sqlite files and restarted Tbird and sent emails w/o issues.  reimported my exported address books and problem solved. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1716629;,petermoore1

When I did that I had no internet connection, so obviously it was impossible to test Thunderbird's sending speed. When I posted this reply, no one responded. I read on another forum that the poster had the same problem and had seen a post where it was recommended to change Windows security settings so that it wasn't scanning the Thunderbird logs every time. The poster could no longer find that post although this had had helped him resolve the problem.  Does this make any sense to any of you? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1716628;,s_beecher

Soon after, my browser screen appeared and showed Thunderbird’s site requesting me the donation. I have been paying it regularly, thus I would like to skip this site to go further. However, there is no way to go further. I am writing this now from my mobile phone.
