I manage a bunch of mailing lists for a small non-profit. Just got a group of new email addresses. I need to add them to a new mailing list, then after I've verified that they're valid and that the people do in fact want to get these emails, merge them into at least two of the existing mailing lists. I have them in a CSV file. First problem was finding where ""create a mailing list"" had moved - no longer on File - New in Address Book (why, by the way? That's the logical spot for it.). Then found that there's no way to import a file of addresses into a mailing list - they can only be imported into an address book. Ok, I'll import into a new address book, then create a mailing list, then drag and drop the contacts from the new address book into the new mailing list (which is both what I'd have expected to work, and what a support article I found said). Not what I wanted, because the new mailing list will be under the new address book, which is not where it needs to be, but I'll deal with that later. Nope - doesn't work. I can select any of or all the contacts, I can drag them, but everywhere on the panel has the ""not permitted"" symbol *except* another address book, which does me no good at all. Ok, try creating a new mailing list where I actually want it to be, then cutting and pasting the names and addresses from another file. Nope, can't find any way to cut and paste 2 fields into a mailing list in edit mode and have the data go where it needs to be, even a single contact, much less a bunch of them. It seems bizarre that something as fundamental as mailing lists would be as difficult to use as it seems, so I'm hoping I've missed something obvious. Currently on 128.7.0, BTW - I usually let TB update whenever it asks. Windows 10 on that box, but also pretty up to date. </p>",samarak;MattAuSupport;rmrubinsl;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:136.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/136.0;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/how-create-and-use-mailing-lists-thunderbird"", ""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data""]",5,0,5,,,
