Seeing screenshots of incoming server settings and also the SMTP server settings may, at minimum, help verify the configuration. there is also the possibility that there is an addon that attaches content, or an antivirus program that attaches an advertisement (such as Avast or AVG). It may also help to actually see the content of a message.  Can you send messages to other recipients successfully?  Without attachments? Thunderbird is just an agent, neither adding nor removing content. Sending a simple one-line email to yourself may be helpful.

La cose che mi fa strano è che su outlook ho creato un profilo con gli stessi account (chiaramente con lo stesso protocollo) e non assisto a questi blocchi. Ieri poi ho segnalato in un'altra discussione (perchè non ritrovavo questa) che ho constatato un'anomalia nel carico del processore  indicato nella scheda  sull'utilizzo risorse di thunderbird e quella di windows: su thunderbird veniva indicato un uso del processore superiore al 100 per cento, mentre su gestione attività per lo stesso processo (NUMERO PID) il processore risultava carico solo per un 5%. I blocchi di scrittura si manifestano in concomitanza con questi picchi nell'utilizzo del processore che si manifestano in maniera apparentemente ciclica </p>",criluma001,false,0,0
