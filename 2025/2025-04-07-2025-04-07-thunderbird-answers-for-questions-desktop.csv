The tabs are transparent (Which I like) and when I change this json file: </p><p>{""applications"": {""gecko"": {""strict_min_version"": ""60.0"", ""id"": ""carl@mail.com""}}, ""theme"": {""images"": {""theme_frame"": ""LakeTahoeHeader.jpg""}, ""colors"": {""frame"": ""#4a9acc"", ""tab_background_text"": ""#000000""}}, ""version"": ""7.3"", ""name"": ""Tahoe-Carl"", ""manifest_version"": 2} </p><p>and only change the the ""tab_background_text"" value does the theme change. #000000 is black text typical with a light theme, but hard to read with the darker header image (see pic).  The original creators ""tab_background_text"" color was off white (typical of a dark theme) and when I change the color back to that off white the entire TB theme changes to a dark theme. </p><p>I would like to be able to have a light theme for TB (black text in all other areas of TB) but white text for the header tabs.  So if the userChrome.css  method is the only way to achieve this result then I would be interested in that rabbit hole (-: </p><p>Thanks </p>",carlkmail,false,0,0
