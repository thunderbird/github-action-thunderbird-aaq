An Imap account connected to a google workspace email. It downloaded every email from that account and of course, when I deleted them from my client, it deleted them from the server. Thankfully I was able to restore the gmail account's emails. Heart attack avoided. I would now like to have my client account not do that. I know I can set up a local folder version of the emails but I'm worried that if I delete the 10's of thousands of emails from the original folder it will still delete them from the server. How do I get around this? Is it even possible. Kindly yours, Aaron. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",makemerichestoday
