A few months ago my ISP blew up and died, and I had to reconfigure everything for a new ISP.  I figured Gmail was a decent email-storage ISP, and I'd use Tbird for the email client.  That's what I did with my old ISP. </p><p>My laptop was 8 years old, so when my ISP died I got a new one.  I assumed I'd be able to copy the Data folder onto my new laptop, and point my new Tbird at it.  That's basically what I did the last time I got a new laptop.  No such luck, the new Tbird doesn't see the old config or message history.  Not sure why.  So I started using Gmail's mailer interface.  Bad mistake.  I HATE Gmail, specifically the Gmail web interface. </p><p>Ideally I would like to copy my Tbird history onto my new laptop, merge the old Tbird messages with the Gmail history from the last few months, and move onto Tbird for day-to-day use.  I see many messages suggesting conversion processes, but I'm confused by the OAuth issues &amp;etc, and I'm not sure if/how I can do the merge.  Help? </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1789505;1789546;,garyfritzz

I’d like to ask: </p><p>Is there an official roadmap for when Outlook calendar sync will be supported in Thunderbird? </p><p>Will Outlook contacts sync be added at the same time, or as a separate feature? </p><p>I believe many users would benefit from clarity on this, since full Outlook integration is critical for those working in Microsoft-centric environments. </p><p>Thanks in advance to the Thunderbird team and volunteers for any updates or guidance. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1789579;1789583;,stank-appease-tug

Now in the listing of emails received it shows my name wrongly spelt. I can't find anywhere in my transferred account settings where this spelling mistake actually occurs. It is the kind of mistake that a native speaker of English would make when they see my name. How can Thunderbird have made this mistake in a completely automatic transfer? Disturbing and unnerving. Is this AI deciding that I spell my own name wrongly maybe? Please help if you can. </p>,thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1789613;1789615;1789620;,bergischestrasse
