That's what I did with my old ISP. </p><p>My laptop was 8 years old, so when my ISP died I got a new one.  I assumed I'd be able to copy the Data folder onto my new laptop, and point my new Tbird at it.  That's basically what I did the last time I got a new laptop.  No such luck, the new Tbird doesn't see the old config or message history.  Not sure why.  So I started using Gmail's mailer interface.  Bad mistake.  I HATE Gmail, specifically the Gmail web interface. </p><p>Ideally I would like to copy my Tbird history onto my new laptop, merge the old Tbird messages with the Gmail history from the last few months, and move onto Tbird for day-to-day use.
