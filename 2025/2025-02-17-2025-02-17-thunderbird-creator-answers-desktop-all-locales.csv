Did not go well.  I have all primary folders showing, but over half do not display messages even though properties show there is varied amounts of data in the folders.  Nearly ALL Sub Folders do Not display even though the .sbd folders show up in the profiles. I have search your files for methods to recover messages, display folders, transfer files, raise the dead and after life experiences.  Nothing seems to work.  I have gone into the 'file' portion of the folders list, not .MSF File, with NotePad and can see email data.  I am at the point of trying to find a way to move this data over into TB messages, but not sure how to go about that.   I am seeing the same thing on both computers Win10 and Win11 as described above - the folders that show data seem to be the first 10 or so and then nothing after that.  I can only think I cut the first transfer attempt short before every thing was moved.. No idea really what is happening. If I have a new message I want to save to one of the Main Folders, that do not show messages, I can see the data count increase, but the newly moved message does not show up in the Folder I moved it to.  If I make a new Sub Folder under the Main Folder, and move the new message to it... it shows up and the sub Folder shows up like it should.  I need some guidance on how to recover the messages because some of them are important.. I would like to get them right on the Win10 machine, then I could go and do the same correction to the Win11 PC... Thanks in Advance for your help.
