Did not go well.  I have all primary folders showing, but over half do not display messages even though properties show there is varied amounts of data in the folders.  Nearly ALL Sub Folders do Not display even though the .sbd folders show up in the profiles. I have search your files for methods to recover messages, display folders, transfer files, raise the dead and after life experiences.  Nothing seems to work.  I have gone into the 'file' portion of the folders list, not .MSF File, with NotePad and can see email data.  I am at the point of trying to find a way to move this data over into TB messages, but not sure how to go about that.   I am seeing the same thing on both computers Win10 and Win11 as described above - the folders that show data seem to be the first 10 or so and then nothing after that.  I can only think I cut the first transfer attempt short before every thing was moved.. No idea really what is happening. If I have a new message I want to save to one of the Main Folders, that do not show messages, I can see the data count increase, but the newly moved message does not show up in the Folder I moved it to.  If I make a new Sub Folder under the Main Folder, and move the new message to it... it shows up and the sub Folder shows up like it should.  I need some guidance on how to recover the messages because some of them are important.. I would like to get them right on the Win10 machine, then I could go and do the same correction to the Win11 PC... Thanks in Advance for your help.

I have clicked on that to bring up the dialog box with the ""Repair"" icon.  It shows 'Inbox' in the 'Name' box but I note that the 'Location' box is blank.  Presumably it should not be.  Presumably it should show either the location of locally stored messages on my hard drive, or the location of the messages on the email server.  I am not sure which. I have found the directory on my hard drive where I believe the messages are stored locally.  The size of the file suggests to me that they are all there.

Searching on line there are plenty of people asking this question and the most common reply is ""you can't"". No reason, just the ""you can't"". </p><p>How hard can it be? It would basically require a simple check box on the ""Account Settings -&gt; Server Settings"" page that asks ""Temporarily suspend account?"" and then some simple if()/else if()/else logic to check/not check. Probably should add an int/bool somewhere in one of the myriad config files to keep track and that's it. </p><p>According to another post regarding this topic, there are bugs on this that are now 14/15 years old but when I clicked on the links to check them out, the pages timed out. 14/15 years and no change/fix - seriously. I don't see how this, to someone familiar with the code base, would be more than a one day task, that includes doco, coding &amp; testing. The fix offered in the above post was to copy all the stuff to a local folder - so what happens in a  few weeks time when you want to check that account again - copy it all back? And then copy it back again a few weeks later, back a forth like a yo-yo. Not a well though out idea! If there is a valid reason, I'd like to hear it from someone who actually works for Mozilla/Thunderbird and knows coding rather than someone who just posts to this forum a lot and guesses. </p><p>Thunderbird is constantly popping up pages telling me all about freedom and donating.

This applies to emails I try to print, as well as attachments. I have no other printer, so I cant test elsewhere. Thunderbird troubleshooting mode does not help. Brother studied it and said its not a printer issue. Logmein studied it and said its not a logmein issue.

The three twc email accounts connected and downloaded emails from the server.  However, nothing happened with the Bellsouth account.  When I tried to send out an email from this Bellsouth account, TB timed out after about a minute.  The account server settings looked fine for both incoming and outgoing.  I then tried the same Bellsouth settings on my laptop that also had an installation of Thunderbird.  It successfully installed the same Bellsouth account and downloaded emails from the server without issue.  So the credentials and settings I was using on my wife's computer were correct. </p><p>I went back to my wife's computer, trying to see what the problem was.  I noticed in the passwords table, only the password for the Bellsouth <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a> server appeared.  The <a href=""http://outbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">outbound.att.net</a> entry was missing (both the inbound and outbound passwords were there in my laptop's TB password table).  So, I uninstalled the <a href=""http://bellsouth.net"" rel=""nofollow"">bellsouth.net</a> account and after restarting TB recreated my wife's Bellsouth account.  Nothing changed and the password table still only listed the <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a> password.  </p><p>What would you suggest?  Do I need to delete my wife's Bellsouth account from TB, exit TB, then uninstall TB and start over with a reinstall?
