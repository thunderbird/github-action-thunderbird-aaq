I have tried passwords related to the router supplied by my ISP and any correspondence about my account with them.  After reading dozens of FAQs and posts in the communitiy I am more confused than ever.  Why should it suddenly forget a critical password?  Nothing has changed apart from maybe a TB update.  Thankfully the mail addresses affected are not ones I use often, but they are the ones assigned by my ISP and are used for voicemail alerts, etc. I have considered reinstalling Thunderbird but don't know how to do it without putting my two most important addresses at risk, and with no guaratee it would solve the missing password problem anyway.

Most incoming, unread emails aren't counted. This feature has always worked correctly for me previously, ever since I first installed Thunderbird several years ago. When I go into Thunderbird, the count of unread emails in whatever folder they're in is still correct, the problem is just with the counts on the taskbar and tray icons. </p><p>I'm not 100% sure, but I *think* it might be the case that emails which end up in the default ""Inbox"" folder are added to the counts, but those which are automatically allocated on arrival to other folders on the basis of filter rules aren't being added to the counts displayed on the icons. I have searched for others reporting the same issue and haven't been able to find anything, so it seems unlikely that it's a bug.
