AS a result it's Highly efficient, improves work throughput and reduces the impact of RSD. It's also easier for those who only use the keyboard, as they can use the arrow keys and enter key to select etc. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;: mean seeing the content of the e-mail in the top view without a new window opening or a new tab opening. Just like in Google.</em> </p><p>Thunderbird is not designed to be a carbon copy of Google/Gmail webmail account. I understand you may have set up the following in Google webmail account. In gmail webmail account&nbsp;: Google completely hides the Message List if you have used the 'Settings' &gt; 'Reading Pane' &gt; 'No Split' </p><p>This option does mean the work throughput is slower as you have to close/use the back icon or reselect the label -aka folder in order to go back to list. The addional clicks therefore are inefficient use of time and can over time be a factor in acquiring Repetitive Stress Disorder - not so bad if you have only a few emails, but really it's an option be used with discretion.  But google do offer other options to display email below or on the right of the list of emails. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:that F8 doesn't work on my system.</em> What system?   F8 key on keyboard is the Thunderbird shortcut to enable or disable the 'Message Pane'. </p><p>Are you using any addons&nbsp;? Some people use this addon:  Thunderbird Conversations 4.3.1 </p><p>That addon has been known to cause a few things to not work as expected, so if you are using it then the only ways to see if it's interfering is to either uninstall the addon or you could test using: </p> <ul><li> 'Help' &gt; 'Troubleshoot Mode' </li><li> select 'REstart' </li><li> select 'Continue in Troubleshoot mode' </li></ul> <p>This then restarts Thunderbird with addons disabled and in Thunderbird default mode. </p><p>As aheads up: Thunderbird does offer a 'Conversation' view by default. If you have several emails which are repies to a thread and if you have also sent replies, you will have related emails in eg: Inbox and Sent. Using the right click &gt; 'Open' &gt; 'Open Message in Conversation ' It opens in a  new tab showing the entire amalgamation of all responses no matter what folder they are stored in. </p><p>Thunderbird now offers the ability to alter the buttons in Message Header so you can choose to only display icons or only text or both.  In Message Header area click on 'More' button and choose the 'Customise' option. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
