I understand that it is not designed to display the content of an e-mail but ergonomically and consitently-wise it is the only good way to display the content of an e-mail, so to not get distracted. You promote Thunderbird being flexible, but the designers/programmers have overlooked the advantage of this way of displaying the content of an e-mail. Gmail is ergonomically well made, as if it is made by autistic people who don't like to be distracted. I want to switch to Thunderbird ao I have been trying to use the program and the app for 2 weeks now, but trying to write an e-mail is draining all of my energy with all this bad ergonomics.. I can't believe this program is truely tested with respect to intuitivity and by new users. I have sent some tips to the ""connect""-forum (why another forum?) but voting is not the best way. Ergonomic study by ergonomically trained people is. I am kind of expert in this.. and I need a program to be good too. Otherwise I cannot focus.

I do not find it helpful if viewing an email means completely hiding the list of emails and needing to do a load of back and forth clicking to get rid of it.

Such as only restrict in a date range or only restrict on a name or only on 'to me'. The initial filter also shows part of email which is handy if there are only a few messages to search. It's all well and good if you only see a couple of emails because you can select one and do not even need to see as a list, but if first search returns a lot, then it's useful to perform additional filters on the results to narrow down the search to a more manageable list to view. </p><p>Sometimes I use the 'Edit' &gt; 'Find' &gt; 'Search Messages' option  to get an instant list.

Example of my search result saved folder called 'New Mail' in an account. It has been set up to search over 14 folders on one account, but if desired I could search it over more than one account. Why 14  fodlers...because I have Message Filters that move emails on download to various folders.

That means it depends upon other variables. A long email is always not going to be fully visible and scrolling will be required. Some people like HTML but it may add a load of 'pretty' stuff which takes up space.  </p><p>if you are struggling with visibility and use a larger font or increased scaling issues, then everything takes up more space and it may be beneficial to get a larger monitor screen if using a desktop or when you upgrade your laptop consider a larger size. </p><p><br> Rick said: <em>re: people who file messages after searching.

The right click option is the alternative.  However, it's more logical to use Message Filters to locate and move several emails from a folder.  It does depend on what exactly you are trying to achieve in the first place. Looking for a single mail that was not filed correctly or wanting to search for a batch of emails and have them all moved.  If they are all from a particular sender then search on sender or sort folder by sender and then they would all be grouped together. If part of a conversation - ongoing replies then switch on threading as that may group them. As I said it all depends on what the requirements and needs are which may be achieved alot easier by alternative methods. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
