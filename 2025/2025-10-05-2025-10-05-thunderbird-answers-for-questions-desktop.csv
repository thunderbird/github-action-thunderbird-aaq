One of my favorite free utilities is 'Everything' from <a href=""https://www.voidtools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.voidtools.com/</a>  It's tiny, and can search your hard drive in milliseconds. Install it and enter thunderbird.exe and it will find it almost faster than you can remove fingers from keyboard. Post where you found it and we can assist.
