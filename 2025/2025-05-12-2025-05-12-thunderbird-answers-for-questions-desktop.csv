My signature should appear after my answer but before the quote. Signature should be inserted in case  of answers as well as for forwarded messages. Both check boxes are checked.

Here's a way to do that:  - click account setting pane and then the desired account. click server settings pane and note the Local Directory entry (bottom line) on the pane. This is where the account is stored. write that down.  - now, on the other PC, click to same pane for that same account and overtype the Local Directory entry to match the one on the other PC. Thunderbird will likely close and restart.  - you should now have access to the one account from both thunderbird setups, one at a time. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
