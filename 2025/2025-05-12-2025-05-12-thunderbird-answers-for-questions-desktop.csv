Grey italics usually means read only,  so perhaps I am thinking you dumped the wrong thing in the wrong place.  Windows does a pretty good job of pretending a zip file is a normal folder,  but it is not.  My guess is the code that reads the folder contents to build the lists can read inside the zip by virtue of the windows API,  but the code that reads the message body can not. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
