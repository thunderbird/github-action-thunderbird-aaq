(Help setting up profile from documents folder.),"<p>HELP!!   </p><p>I am trying to move my Thunderbird profile (containing a huge number of mail files dating back to 1995!!) from a Windows 10 computer to a new Windows 11 computer.  My active profile has been kept in my Documents file (for easier automatic cloud backup).  I have spent days trying everything I can to make this work.  The best I can do is two profiles, one that can check mail, but contains no historic mail or files -- the other that has all my emails but won't connect with my server.  ""The following is a special account.""  ""There are no identities associated with it.""  I was wondering if I could merge these two profiles?  Or? </p><p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated!!!!!!!! </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",lanny2
