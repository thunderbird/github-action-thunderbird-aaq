IMAP synchronises a mail server with Thunderbird so you have, in effect, two versions of the same contents. Delete a mail in one, it's deleted in the other - and so on. You have Local Folders that you can bring an email into your computer (to put it crudely) but the server account is 'live' and represents what's on the primary mail server. POP3 downloads emails into the computer and - as I use it - deletes the mail off the server. It also has Local Folders to organise emails in.  There are pros and cons for both *but*, although I know a bit about the IMAP set up, I can't definitively give help with it as I use a POP3 account. </p>",frisée,false,0,0

THEN removing any Registry entries (using Ccleaner). Then restarting my computer and running the Setup program to reinstall Thunderbird.

Not a bad idea IMO, but some things like my email and <a href=""http://Neverwintervault.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Neverwintervault.org</a> didn't like it, and refused connection. Once I disabled the 'service' for all my privacy settings, everything is back to normal. I'm able to connect with <a href=""http://Neverwintervault.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Neverwintervault.org</a> AND my email program (Mozilla Thunderbird) also works.
