IMAP synchronises a mail server with Thunderbird so you have, in effect, two versions of the same contents. Delete a mail in one, it's deleted in the other - and so on. You have Local Folders that you can bring an email into your computer (to put it crudely) but the server account is 'live' and represents what's on the primary mail server. POP3 downloads emails into the computer and - as I use it - deletes the mail off the server. It also has Local Folders to organise emails in.  There are pros and cons for both *but*, although I know a bit about the IMAP set up, I can't definitively give help with it as I use a POP3 account. </p>",frisée,false,0,0
