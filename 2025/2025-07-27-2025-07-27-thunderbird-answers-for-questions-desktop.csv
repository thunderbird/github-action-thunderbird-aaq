Perhaps you need to add an exception for that server if you trust the server is actually correct despite the name not even looking vaguely similar.  Or perhaps you need to change your connection security to none and not use an encrypted connection. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

IMAP account folders fully synchronise with server to display whatever is on server. So consider it as a mirror image of whatever you see in webmail account. Whilst you can choose to download full copies of emails, you should not consider those imap folders as totally independent copies on your computer as they can only display whatever is on server. But they can be used to create an independent backup. You can create folders and subscribe to see or not see folders on server. </p><p>Pop accounts get created by Thunderbird with specific set of default folders and you can add more folders to organise emails. None of those folders synchronise with server. Pop accounts connect with server and can download whatever is in the server Inbox to Pop Inbox. </p><p>Pop account folders are totally independent copies on your computer, so it is possible to have different emails on server or even no emails on server and still have emails in the Pop account.  </p><p>The main disadvantages of a Pop account is you cannot see anything the server puts in Spam folder. If you create Pop accounts and choose to 'leave messages on server', then a second Pop account or IMAP account on another device will be able to download the same emails, but if you have various folders used to organise and store emails, then you would have to replicate on each device - basically do the entire process twice. </p><p>In Thunderbird you can have many imap and/or pop accounts one for each email address and it does not matter if you have accounts on different servers. You see all emails in all accounts in one view. </p><p>First you may need to access webmail and check the IMAP option is enabled. </p><p>In Thunderbird: </p> <ul><li> Menu app icon (3 lines) &gt; New account &gt; Email </li><li> Enter name, email address and password - usually same password as used to access webmail account, but there are some server that insist on specific app generated passwords. </li><li> Click on 'Continue' and Thunderbird will attempt to locate server settings. It will also attempt to choose IMAP protocol by default. </li></ul> <p>Not all server settings are known so you may need to click on 'Manual Config' to manually setup the server settings. Each provider will have their own specific server settings for email. Clickon 'Done' to create mail account. </p><p>Please note this is basic instructions, some servers require additional setup instructions especially if the server uses Authentication Method: Oauth2. </p><p>Suggest you make sure you are not using a VPN as most servers do not like it because they cannot see your IP address and therefore think you may be a hacker. So if you want to use a VPN then set up split tunnelling and allow Thunderbird to use it. </p><p>It would be helpful if you tell us what server you are trying to connect to eg: gmail, comcast, BT, etc so we can offer any specific info you may need to know. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
