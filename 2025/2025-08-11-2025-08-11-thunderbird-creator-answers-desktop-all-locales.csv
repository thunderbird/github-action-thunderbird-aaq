My profile has multiple accounts configured as IMAP to multiple email services. I also have the Status Bar and Activity indicator enabled. Randomly, both indicators will show busy for an extended period of time. When I view this in the Activity Manager I see one or more folders hung for 10 or 20 minutes downloading one message out of several. This occurs in multiple accounts and servers. </p><p>I have researched this and attempted the fixes presented. I have cleared the cache files and compacted and rebuild email folders as suggested, but the slow update still occurs.  </p><p>Then I decided to try and capture a ProMon.exe trace to see what is happening. What I found was Thunderbird.exe was spending all of the time while hung access the following file: C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\LocalLow\Intel\ ShaderCache\4a5eb0e65e559fc08e65ecb2fa9d650817ae895582a7a7ede162866d3e47a05a, like it was stuck in a loop. </p><p>When Thunderbird is operating normally, it is accessing this file but only for short period of times. Research says that it is ok to delete the files in this folder. I did that and it seemed to help for awhile. But it started happening again. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? Is there a Windows thing to look further into? Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,1755510;,DoctorBashir

All incoming messages are fine and my accounts sync non-outgoing messages just fine (in fact, my typical way of sending e-mails is to save to drafts and then pull up the draft in Outlook and send it).  </p><p>I know that this has been a problem for multiple users over the years and I've tried all the typical solutions.  I'm currently using: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> Port 587 Starttls Oauth2 </p><p>Although I have tried the workarounds that I've found in the discussion boards including: - alternative ports -SSL/TLS instead - no authentication (this worked for a similar problem many years ago) </p><p>To me, the most glaring detail is that as soon as I'm off campus, it returns to working immediately which would suggest that the work network is doing the blocking. I've talked with our T&amp;I multiple times and they confirm that nothing that they no of is blocking my SMTP which means its probably a setting they don't know about. They can also log into the e-mail settings and confirm that my SMTP is specifically not blocked (which makes sense because it works off campus). </p><p>For context, we use Crowdstrike as our endpoint protection. </p><p>We are a small place and my IT group is being pretty cool by throwing some time and resources at this.
