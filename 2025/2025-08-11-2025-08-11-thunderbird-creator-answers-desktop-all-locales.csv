1528389,2025-08-10 17:07:30 -0700,2025-08-10 17:07:30 -0700,Folder update is randomly very slow when downloading messages.,"<p>My Thunderbird (version 115.12.2) is running on a Windows 11 system. My profile has multiple accounts configured as IMAP to multiple email services. I also have the Status Bar and Activity indicator enabled. Randomly, both indicators will show busy for an extended period of time. When I view this in the Activity Manager I see one or more folders hung for 10 or 20 minutes downloading one message out of several. This occurs in multiple accounts and servers. </p><p>I have researched this and attempted the fixes presented. I have cleared the cache files and compacted and rebuild email folders as suggested, but the slow update still occurs.  </p><p>Then I decided to try and capture a ProMon.exe trace to see what is happening. What I found was Thunderbird.exe was spending all of the time while hung access the following file: C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\LocalLow\Intel\ ShaderCache\4a5eb0e65e559fc08e65ecb2fa9d650817ae895582a7a7ede162866d3e47a05a, like it was stuck in a loop. </p><p>When Thunderbird is operating normally, it is accessing this file but only for short period of times. Research says that it is ok to delete the files in this folder. I did that and it seemed to help for awhile. But it started happening again. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? Is there a Windows thing to look further into? Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",DoctorBashir

I know my email address and password, but every time I try to sign in it want's me to verify my recovery phone number. I can furnish the number but then it wants to send a code to that number, and I no longer have that phone number. So, it keeps sending me through a loop and gets me back to the same problem. I can't sign in becuase I have no way to receive the sign in code. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",slotpilot41

I've tried copying the profile folder &amp; .ini files over, but I get an error on Kubuntu about the version difference. I've not been able to work around that error, and the page it points me to seems not helpful (that may just be me). I'm willing to re-create each account in Kubuntu manually, but all my accounts have numerous sub-folders along with matching rule filters. I've ported the filters over OK, but I need to know how (if possible) to recreate the sub-folders en masse in Kubuntu. </p><p>Any help (including ""You Can't"") is appreciated. </p><p>Thanks Nick </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,"",zdvqvxvzm4
