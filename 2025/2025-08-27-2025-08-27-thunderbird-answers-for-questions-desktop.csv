Then it can detect possible threats, but always ask what to do. So can stop it fixing/quarrantining if it discovers something in the Thunderbird profile folders. </p><p>But you should find a lot of info on Kaspersky on their website. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:Can we delete the folder ( email.asiaepmail-1)</em> </p><p>That's a bit drastic - did you compact the folders and then run AV to see if it picked up those files again? It would be useful to have some feedback. </p><p>The folder called '<a href=""http://email.asiaepmail-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">email.asiaepmail-1.com</a>'  is the pop mail account folder containing all your emails. It looks like you have a huge number of emails stored in just a single text file document called 'Inbox'. That is somewhat risky. I would strongly advice you create more folders and move emails from Inbox into suitably named folders to help with sorting and organisation. It will also reduce the risk of losing all emails should anything happen to the Inbox. Then as you would have moved a load of emails from 'Inbox' folder, compact the 'Inbox'. </p><p>Pop mail accounts do not synchonise with server, they can only access server Inbox and download mail. If those emails are not on the server (as seen in webmail account) and you delete that folder then you will lose everything. If they are still on server, then recreating the pop account will download everything again. But have you accessed the server via webmail account using a browser and made sure there are no bad emails still on server&nbsp;? You would not want to download them again. </p><p>If you really want to delete everything: You would first need to access 'Account Settings' and remove the pop mail account. Then access 'Settings' &gt; 'Privacy &amp; Security' - click on 'Saved Passwords' button and remove all lines associated with that account/email address to remove all stored passwords for the account. Finally Exit Thunderbird, access profile and delete the '<a href=""http://email.asiaepmail-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">email.asiaepmail-1.com</a>' folder.  Please remember to empty the computer Recycle Bin to ensure everything has been removed. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

When I did that, upon restart Thunderbird gave a message along the lines of ""Cannot connect to email server"".  So I knew that the problem was that it was trying to connect to Comcast's email server upon startup and failing. - I did a little more research and found something on Xfinity forums back in March that mentioned the same issue that I'm seeing.  They explained that the problem was that ""Comcast servers won't accept IPv6 traffic"". - The fix was to go to Settings | General in Thunderbird.  Then scroll all the way down and click on the Config Editor button. Search for ""network.dns.disableIPv6"".  It was set to False, and I set it to True.  That fixed the issue.

For several years I have been successfully using Thunderbird on my desktop computer, using Microsoft and Windows 10. I have been notified that Windows 10 will no longer be maintained by Microsoft after 30 Sept 2025, and users are being encouraged to move to Windows 11, which is mainly designed for computer games, and requires a larger computer than my existing one. I am not interested in computer games, and do not wish to purchase a new computer, when my existing computer is more than adequate for my needs. This raises several questions.        Is it possible that I will be able to continue using Thunderbird with Microsoft and Windows 10, even though Windows 10 will not be revised?         Is it possible for the same Thunderbird software to be driven by software other than Microsoft and Windows 10?  If so, which software?        Thank you.                       From: Alastair. </blockquote> <p>1. If you have an MS account, W10 updates can be extended for free for another year. </p><p>2. I have updated 2nd and 4th generation Intel PCs (10+years old) from W10 to W11, using widely available methods. </p><p>3. I rather doubt TB will stop being supported on W10 any time soon, and at worst there will always be an older version available, like there is for W7 users. </p><p>4. There are several Linux versions which run current and future versions of TB.  Zorin, Mint etc. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

That may mean that there will be no more security updates (although I won't be surprised if the updates continue.) But if your operating system is working properly, there's no reason your current programs, including Thunderbird, won't continue to work like they do now. If a future version of Thunderbird will not work on Windows 10, I'm sure they will let us know - probably the install process will halt if you try to install it on an incompatible OS. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

At that time you will continue to be able to use Thunderbird with Windows 10 with the latest Thunderbird offered for Windows 10 but you'll no longer be able to get bugs fixed and/or securities issue fixed.    There is no known date when this will occur. Based on experience with Windows 7,  very likely,  Thunderbird will continue to release bug fixed for windows 10 for possibly  3 to 4 years ( please note that this is a pure speculation ). </p>",MichelT,false,0,0
