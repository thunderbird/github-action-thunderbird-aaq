Some HTML emails are being displayed as plain text source code rather than rendered properly. Standard HTML emails work fine, but I run a personal e-commerce site using WordPress, and all notification emails sent from that site appear as source code. When viewed on other tablets or iPhones, these emails display correctly with the markup intact. Furthermore, HTML emails from other sites show no issues and display correctly in Thunderbird. 　My operating system is Windows 11 Home, and I am using the latest version of Thunderbird. Any advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated. </blockquote> <p>Do you use Bitdefender?  If not, does Repair Folder from the folder Properties (context menu) help? </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

On the Xf portal, this neophyte can't start Xf email...I cant even create an account (see below), so I can't click thru to Security to uncheck/check Third Party Access Security. If I use the Xf portal to ""check email"" I get the useless notice called  ""Using and managing Xf email accounts"", which states that ""since last June new Xf customers can't create an Xf email (<a href=""http://Comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Comcast.net</a>) account.""

Please access the Firewall and make sure the Thunderbird program is set up as an allowed program. Do not switch it off because either the default will take over or you will not be protected and it solves nothing. Confirm you have set up Thunderbird as allowed program. </p><p><strong>VPN</strong> Please check computer to see if a VPN has been enabled. Servers tend to dislike VPN's as they hide IP addresses, so they can block access. Some Anti-virus products now offer VPN and it has been known for them to auto enable it. </p><p><br> re&nbsp;: I have two email addresses - it will not work for either.
