Some HTML emails are being displayed as plain text source code rather than rendered properly. Standard HTML emails work fine, but I run a personal e-commerce site using WordPress, and all notification emails sent from that site appear as source code. When viewed on other tablets or iPhones, these emails display correctly with the markup intact. Furthermore, HTML emails from other sites show no issues and display correctly in Thunderbird. 　My operating system is Windows 11 Home, and I am using the latest version of Thunderbird.

For several years I have been successfully using Thunderbird on my desktop computer, using Microsoft and Windows 10. I have been notified that Windows 10 will no longer be maintained by Microsoft after 30 Sept 2025, and users are being encouraged to move to Windows 11, which is mainly designed for computer games, and requires a larger computer than my existing one. I am not interested in computer games, and do not wish to purchase a new computer, when my existing computer is more than adequate for my needs. This raises several questions.        Is it possible that I will be able to continue using Thunderbird with Microsoft and Windows 10, even though Windows 10 will not be revised?         Is it possible for the same Thunderbird software to be driven by software other than Microsoft and Windows 10?  If so, which software?        Thank you.

That may mean that there will be no more security updates (although I won't be surprised if the updates continue.) But if your operating system is working properly, there's no reason your current programs, including Thunderbird, won't continue to work like they do now.
