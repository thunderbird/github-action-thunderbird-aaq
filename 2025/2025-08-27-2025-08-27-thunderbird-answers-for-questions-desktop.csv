For several years I have been successfully using Thunderbird on my desktop computer, using Microsoft and Windows 10. I have been notified that Windows 10 will no longer be maintained by Microsoft after 30 Sept 2025, and users are being encouraged to move to Windows 11, which is mainly designed for computer games, and requires a larger computer than my existing one. I am not interested in computer games, and do not wish to purchase a new computer, when my existing computer is more than adequate for my needs. This raises several questions.        Is it possible that I will be able to continue using Thunderbird with Microsoft and Windows 10, even though Windows 10 will not be revised?         Is it possible for the same Thunderbird software to be driven by software other than Microsoft and Windows 10?  If so, which software?        Thank you.

That may mean that there will be no more security updates (although I won't be surprised if the updates continue.) But if your operating system is working properly, there's no reason your current programs, including Thunderbird, won't continue to work like they do now.
