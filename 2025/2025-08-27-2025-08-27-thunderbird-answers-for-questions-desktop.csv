Some HTML emails are being displayed as plain text source code rather than rendered properly. Standard HTML emails work fine, but I run a personal e-commerce site using WordPress, and all notification emails sent from that site appear as source code. When viewed on other tablets or iPhones, these emails display correctly with the markup intact. Furthermore, HTML emails from other sites show no issues and display correctly in Thunderbird. ã€€My operating system is Windows 11 Home, and I am using the latest version of Thunderbird. Any advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated. </blockquote> <p>Do you use Bitdefender?  If not, does Repair Folder from the folder Properties (context menu) help? </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
