Every time I write any email it freezes after about 2 minutes. If it's a short email, it gets sent. If it's longer, before I can get to the end, the program freezes, and I have to use Task Manager to stop it. No problem receiving and reading emails. This started about a month ago. </p><p>I use Bitdefender, but it still happens with that off. Windows is up to date. Any ideas why this is happening? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,1771501;,jt15
