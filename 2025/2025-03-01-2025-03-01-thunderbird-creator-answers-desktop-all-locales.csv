I have local install Thunderbird 128.7.1esr (64-bit) on my Win 11 Pro and running well. I use it for my business.  I have latest Thunderbird portable downloaded from portableapps on my removable drive. I intend to use it for my personal emails.  I tried to execute the portable version while running the local version. It won't allow me to run it and this error message appeared. I thought the portable version should be isolated and run within the removable drive.  Is there a way to run both at the same time? </p>,thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1715494;1715495;1715497;,nospam17
