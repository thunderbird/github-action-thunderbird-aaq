IMAP is <strong>NOT </strong>going to work for you to do what you are attempting to do. </p><p>IMAP is fundamentally different to POP and you need to change your view of mail stored locally to something more akin to a temporary cache rather than a discrete local copy of something that you originally downloaded from a server. </p><p>You can still have you local folder and you can still copy and move mail to them, but your IMAP mail account can <strong>not </strong>form a part of your local folders. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The fact that TB doesn't crash in a new profile tells us that something is wrong in your old profile. It may be very difficult and time-consuming to search and find the culprit, and one needs good knowledge of the profile contents. And if you create a new profile and then copy/paste the contents of the old in the new profile you import also the crash problem. Do you have ""crash reports"" in Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Crash reports ....? </p><p>Most times it is easier to restart from scratch, set up your accounts POP or IMAP just as they are in the old profile. Only if POP you must import the account folders from the old profile. Address books can be easily imported, and if you used the Local Folders to store messages you would copy/paste ""Local Folders"" from the ""Mail"" folder in the old profile in ""Mail"" in the new profile folder. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
