1512082,2025-05-15 18:51:45 -0700,2025-05-15 18:51:45 -0700,Getting a handsake with my AT&T email source?  Does not connect.  Relates a password error repeatedly.,"<p>SAB.  Things were smooth for 7 years. Now with latest 430/25 TBird update and some 1 May 2025 phishing attempts through email, I cannot connect with AT&amp;T.   I can view my email on the connect ATT site, but cannot get the messages to download to the Tbird email client.  AT&amp;T claims that since I get the mail through their web page site, the problem rest in TBird/Mozilla???  Thank You  A mozilla supporter, Dennis Giba, Westmont IL </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",dmarjdmarj
