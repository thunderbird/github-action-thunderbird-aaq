This problem started with the previous versions of Thunderbird circa Nov/Dec 2024. A Thunderbird or Windows update resolves the problem for a short time but then the problem it reoccurs. Server settings are all correct and have been checked multiple times. I've deactivated Norton AV and firewalls, added and/or verified port exceptions but to no effect. This problems has resulted in many overlooked important emails until they've been double checked on webmail portal. Is trouble sending and receiving emails a broader issue with Thunderbird users and are Google and Microsoft deliberately making it difficult to use Thunderbird as an email client?
