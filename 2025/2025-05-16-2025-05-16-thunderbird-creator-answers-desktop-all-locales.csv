Things were smooth for 7 years. Now with latest 430/25 TBird update and some 1 May 2025 phishing attempts through email, I cannot connect with AT&amp;T.   I can view my email on the connect ATT site, but cannot get the messages to download to the Tbird email client.  AT&amp;T claims that since I get the mail through their web page site, the problem rest in TBird/Mozilla???

There was an update to the program over night and now when I load thunderbird it is unable to show me the content of emails in any of the folders. I can see the emails in the list and all the folders are shown in the folder tree on the left. Howevr I am not able to access the content of the emails. My thunderbird profile folder is on a network share, this fileserver is a windows based machine. If I copy the profile to my local machine the profile works correctly and I am able to open emails and view the contents. It is only when my profile is on the network that I cannot view the contents of the emails. I ran thunderbird in safe mode and this does not resolve the situation. I have tried to repair the folders but this did not work. I deleted the .msf files but this also did not work. I ran the thunderbird debugger and then tried to access an email, the debugger stopped on the follwing exception: NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS: Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsITreeView.setTree]. What could be the problem with my emails? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",chisel900
