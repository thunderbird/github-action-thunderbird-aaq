Things were smooth for 7 years. Now with latest 430/25 TBird update and some 1 May 2025 phishing attempts through email, I cannot connect with AT&amp;T.   I can view my email on the connect ATT site, but cannot get the messages to download to the Tbird email client.  AT&amp;T claims that since I get the mail through their web page site, the problem rest in TBird/Mozilla???

One is current but the other 2 have a Date Modified of 30/12/2021. Can I safely delete these 2? I know the names are not relevant but the suffixes are .default-release and .default. Thanks Chris </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",chris119
