When I try to install it my previous password is refused. I was able to reset it but none of my data (inbox messages, addresses etc ) are there. I also use an extended support version of Ubuntu 16.04 and have Thunderbird still working there perfectly.  When I originally installed Ubuntu 22.04 I had no problem with password refusal or all my data not being imported from U16.
