The Gmail account was opened with default options, and it was added to Thunderbird with default options. They did appear in the Gmail app on an Android phone, but with the label 'Primary' rather than 'Inbox'. Investigation of Gmail accessed via a web browser showed that the Inbox contained four tabs: 'Primary', 'Promotions', 'Social' and 'Updates'. Doing Get started with Gmail &gt; Customize your inbox &gt; Default &gt; Customize allowed me to ""Deselect all categories to go back to your old inbox"". This didn't fix Thunderbird (even though I forced a Get New Messages for) but, after I'd blundered around a bit more, it started working. So, I'm not sure whether I did something else to fix it, or it just took several minutes to start working. Also, the Android phone now shows 'Inbox' rather than 'Primary'. Question: Is there a way of sorting this out at the Thunderbird end, without having to make setup changes at the Gmail end? It would be very useful if Thunderbird could sort this out automatically when we add a Gmail account. Until then, it would be useful if your solution or, if no solution, my work-around could be publicised in Help.
