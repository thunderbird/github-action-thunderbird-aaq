The Gmail account was opened with default options, and it was added to Thunderbird with default options. They did appear in the Gmail app on an Android phone, but with the label 'Primary' rather than 'Inbox'. Investigation of Gmail accessed via a web browser showed that the Inbox contained four tabs: 'Primary', 'Promotions', 'Social' and 'Updates'. Doing Get started with Gmail &gt; Customize your inbox &gt; Default &gt; Customize allowed me to ""Deselect all categories to go back to your old inbox"". This didn't fix Thunderbird (even though I forced a Get New Messages for) but, after I'd blundered around a bit more, it started working. So, I'm not sure whether I did something else to fix it, or it just took several minutes to start working. Also, the Android phone now shows 'Inbox' rather than 'Primary'. Question: Is there a way of sorting this out at the Thunderbird end, without having to make setup changes at the Gmail end? It would be very useful if Thunderbird could sort this out automatically when we add a Gmail account. Until then, it would be useful if your solution or, if no solution, my work-around could be publicised in Help.

When I perform a global search only one of each pair of identical emails is listed. </p><p>If I delete the email that shows up, and then repeat the global search, the results now include the other copy of the email that was previously not displayed. </p><p>This proves that both copies have made it into the Gloda (the global index) but the filtering of the results is hiding duplicate emails.  </p><p>If this is ""works as intended"", then I am happy with that, but I am curious about two things... </p><p>1. When account A and account B contain duplicate emails, it is somewhat random whether the one in account A or the one in account B is hidden. However, I rebuilt the global index yesterday, and after that, a global query with duplicate emails showed all the ones from account A and hid all the ones from account B. Today, after receiving more duplicate emails, the duplicates of today's emails in account B are displayed and those in account A are hidden. I am wondering what defines which gets hidden. </p><p>2. What is being checked to discover that two emails are identical? Looking at the message source I see that although the message bodies are identical, the headers are wildly different for the most part. Is it perhaps checking the ""Message-ID:"" line of the header? </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,"",BillSparrow
