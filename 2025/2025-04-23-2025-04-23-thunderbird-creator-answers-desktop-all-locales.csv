After that update, clicking on the Thunderbird icon in the dock starts thunderbird under a generic icon that appears on the right side of the dock (showing the dot indicator under it), rather than showing the thunderbird icon with the running indicator under it. </p><p>I am using X11, fully updated Ubuntu 24.04.2, with Thunderbird installed as a snap.  Work correctly until last week.  If I start the application manually from the command line, same generic icon appears.  (If I start firefox snap from the command line, the firefox icon shows the ""running"" indicator under it as it is supposed to. </p><p>Note:  Thunderbird IS running and running fine - I have not found any other issues, just this potential regression. </p><p>Anyone have any ideas?  I thought I would post here before filing a bugzilla bug report.  I was not able to find any mention of this (or a similar) problem in the last year. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",web3451

When I delete an email and it moves to the Trash folder, Thunderbird no longer displays inbox emails. Trash folder is displayed after archives folders. After restarting Thunderbird, it is restored again. I did an inbox folder repair, but it did not help. Then I deleted the Inbox.msf file and waited for the system to recreate it, but that did not help either. I also did compact folders -&gt;general -&gt; Disk space, but that did not help either. If I want to use the program, after each email moved to the trash, I have to restart Thunderbird. Please, I need help with solving this problem. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rkymantas

They are really GMail accounts, only the domain is customized by my university. After upgrading Thunderbird to version 128.9.2esr (on Fedora Linux), the first time I started the application, it couldn't log on to the @unimib.it account, but it could log on to the @campus.unimib.it account. This was strange: I removed the @unimib.it account and tried to add it as a new account, but Thunbderbird could not connect. At the same time it can connect to @campus.unimib.it with the same settings. I have attached a screenshot of the problem, what could be the problem? Thunderbird does not show any informative output. </p><p>Thank you in advance, Have a great day! </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,it,1727648;1727650;,inbox23
