To send and email, use the command Ctrl+Enter 3. If you don't have a send button, you may have switched off one of the toolbars. In the composition window go to View/Toolbars 4. When you say you did not receive an email, do you mean it didn't arrive at the server? OR did TB not download it? Did TB not even try? What error messages do you get? </p>",frisée,false,0,0
