All I got was an empty message screen.  This happened for new and previously existing read messages.  The problem was limited to my Email account and did not affect other folders such as Drafts, Sent, Trash, etc.  I right-clicked on the Email folder under the Inbox, opened Properties and hit the Repair Folder button, which made all the headers disappear as well!  I didn't see any help messages with issues specific and/or limited to just the Email folder in Inbox.  Can someone help!

I uninstalled the Thunderbird program and reinstalled yet the compromised account wouldn’t receive emails.  I ended up deleting my account. Now all folders and previously saved emails are gone.

When returning home six months later I have been able to delete the old data profiles in the desktop and transfer the 'current data' from the laptop over.  This system has worked for some years however after recently upgrading the laptop to the latest version (140.2.1esr) and installing the latest version on the desktop (both 140.2.1esr) the transfer of data fails. The program identifies the data on the laptop as an ""old program"".  Could someone point me in the right direction and advise where I am going wrong at the moment. Thanks in anticipation , Bruce </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,"",frankestarr
