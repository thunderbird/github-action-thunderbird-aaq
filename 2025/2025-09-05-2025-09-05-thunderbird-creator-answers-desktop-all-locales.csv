All I got was an empty message screen.  This happened for new and previously existing read messages.  The problem was limited to my Email account and did not affect other folders such as Drafts, Sent, Trash, etc.  I right-clicked on the Email folder under the Inbox, opened Properties and hit the Repair Folder button, which made all the headers disappear as well!  I didn't see any help messages with issues specific and/or limited to just the Email folder in Inbox.  Can someone help!

When returning home six months later I have been able to delete the old data profiles in the desktop and transfer the 'current data' from the laptop over.  This system has worked for some years however after recently upgrading the laptop to the latest version (140.2.1esr) and installing the latest version on the desktop (both 140.2.1esr) the transfer of data fails. The program identifies the data on the laptop as an ""old program"".  Could someone point me in the right direction and advise where I am going wrong at the moment.

Is there way to do this so I can cleanly sort them into example: </p><p>Users-Ads Business Partners Professionals  </p><pre>  Chiropractors   Nurses   Medical Dr's </pre> <p>I currently have 12 different email addresses that are different businesses The Address Books don't make any sense at all. </p><p>So there a way I can go thru Thunderbird Address book or sent emails for email business  so I can cleanly sort this out. </p><p>The person who set it all up passed away and the computer is owned by my sister who is now  running the business. </p><p>Trying to figure out a good way to get all this put together where it would make better sense. It is really overwhelming. She only wants to send ads out maybe once a week or 2 maybe even a month. </p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions. </p><p>Also have a complete folder nightmare where inbox and other folders have nested folders as well to sort out. </p><p>Appreciate any thoughts on the above and thanks for your time. </p><p>Phillip </p>,thunderbird;contacts;,thunderbird,contacts,en-US,"",OkieUnix
