All I got was an empty message screen.  This happened for new and previously existing read messages.  The problem was limited to my Email account and did not affect other folders such as Drafts, Sent, Trash, etc.  I right-clicked on the Email folder under the Inbox, opened Properties and hit the Repair Folder button, which made all the headers disappear as well!  I didn't see any help messages with issues specific and/or limited to just the Email folder in Inbox.  Can someone help!
