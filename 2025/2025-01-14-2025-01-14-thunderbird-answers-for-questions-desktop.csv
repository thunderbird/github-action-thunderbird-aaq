My question is about the email account credentials.   </p><p>Without a primary password, the logins.json file contains what appear to be encrypted passwords.  But since they can be deciphered without a password (by simply running Thunderbird) they are obviously only obfuscated in some way.   Even after enabling a primary password the logins.json file is still exactly the same.   This is why I don’t see how any actual encryption has taken place.   </p><p>A physical breach is not high risk for me, but the simple act of backing up my data (offsite or cloud) could be leaving obfuscated but unencrypted account credentials for a bad actor to find.

The problem is that if I split a subject folder in time (archiving) in order to make the current one smaller, I lose visibility of the older mail -- the stuff in the not-latest folder -- when I  quick filter or expression search (that's  nice add-on) the latest mail folder, or try to follow a topic that goes back in time a ways. I don't know if the regular ""search"" function works on archived messages, but it's such a terrible function (1994 called and wants its search back) that it is not a useful substitute for quick filter. Hence I would like a way to have those smaller folder files but make several of them (per topic, not the whole collection) look like one bigger one.  </p><p>The closest analogy I can think of now -- not relevant but as an example -- is unified inbox, where more than one account's inbox is shown as one. I don't use that because I use POP and filter on various parameters into the folder layout I want but I think it's in T'bird (and in my phone's mail program). Here I'm asking about unifying a folder (not just ""inbox"") out of multiple (older mail) sub-folders. Perhaps the unified inbox code could contribute to that? </p>",fred37,false,0,0

In microsoft account accessed via a browser If you have more email addresses or hotmail addresses etc , microsoft now regard one is 'primary' and all others are alias to the account. This is not a problem when it comes to receiving mail, but can be an issues when you want to send. When it comes to 'sending' - that is smtp in  Thunderbird - it can only send using the 'primary' email address.  You can choose what you want to be set as 'primary', but whatever email address you set up as 'primary' - only that email address/username can be used for SMTP. So if you want to send using a specific 'outlook' email address then make sure it is set up as the primary email address. But then if you have another <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account as well, it will only be able to send using whatever you setup as  primary email address. So choose the email address which you want to set up as 'primary'. </p><p><strong>Check the following on your computer:</strong> <strong>1.</strong> If you have a VPN enabled then switch it off because servers do not like VPN - they think someone is trying to hack your account.

You can switch it back on once account is set up and running ok. To set up the acceptance of allowing Thunderbird access to server it needs to use the localhost, hence switch off anything using it. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> Access the Firewall (this might be default one which came with coputer or may be controlled by an Anti-Virus product you installed).
