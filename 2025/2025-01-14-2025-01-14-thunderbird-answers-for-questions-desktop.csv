My question is about the email account credentials.   </p><p>Without a primary password, the logins.json file contains what appear to be encrypted passwords.  But since they can be deciphered without a password (by simply running Thunderbird) they are obviously only obfuscated in some way.

The problem is that if I split a subject folder in time (archiving) in order to make the current one smaller, I lose visibility of the older mail -- the stuff in the not-latest folder -- when I  quick filter or expression search (that's  nice add-on) the latest mail folder, or try to follow a topic that goes back in time a ways. I don't know if the regular ""search"" function works on archived messages, but it's such a terrible function (1994 called and wants its search back) that it is not a useful substitute for quick filter. Hence I would like a way to have those smaller folder files but make several of them (per topic, not the whole collection) look like one bigger one.  </p><p>The closest analogy I can think of now -- not relevant but as an example -- is unified inbox, where more than one account's inbox is shown as one. I don't use that because I use POP and filter on various parameters into the folder layout I want but I think it's in T'bird (and in my phone's mail program).

And that search function, while powerful, is very clumsy -- it takes a lot of precise mouse movement to go down those menus and find the folder. Contrast to, say, Quick Filter, where you just type into the box that's already there. </p><p>Now I realize that those virtual search folders are more permanent, which is good, which is why I think the virtual folder mechanism is probably hiding in plain sight. But because it's hidden behind search, it is only there after you've gone through the folders you want to include in the virtual folder, one by one, and add them. Yes, you can search subfolders -- but that doesn't work for the purpose I'm talking about, because the mechanism for keeping folders small, Archiving, puts them below Archive at the top level of Local Folders (I keep everything in local folders, as I don't own my own server) rather than below the parent (new incoming filtered mail) folder. And that's good, because if I had to waste space on the left side of the screen with folder-its archive rather than just folder with archives below the list, the folder list wouldn't fit! And I don't want to have to scroll the folder list. </p><p>I wonder if some clever programmer could come up with an add-on that created a set of virtual folders, if they could be displayed contiguously, by automating that search of each desired parent folder and its collection of archives. I mean this could also be an enhancement that MZLA did, but they seem to have other priorities. </p>",fred37,false,0,0

In microsoft account accessed via a browser If you have more email addresses or hotmail addresses etc , microsoft now regard one is 'primary' and all others are alias to the account. This is not a problem when it comes to receiving mail, but can be an issues when you want to send. When it comes to 'sending' - that is smtp in  Thunderbird - it can only send using the 'primary' email address.  You can choose what you want to be set as 'primary', but whatever email address you set up as 'primary' - only that email address/username can be used for SMTP. So if you want to send using a specific 'outlook' email address then make sure it is set up as the primary email address. But then if you have another <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account as well, it will only be able to send using whatever you setup as  primary email address. So choose the email address which you want to set up as 'primary'. </p><p><strong>Check the following on your computer:</strong> <strong>1.</strong> If you have a VPN enabled then switch it off because servers do not like VPN - they think someone is trying to hack your account. So server may deny access. </p><p><strong>2</strong>. If you use a program which uses the 'localhost' eg: Apache Xampp then switch it off whilst setting up the Oauth token. You can switch it back on once account is set up and running ok. To set up the acceptance of allowing Thunderbird access to server it needs to use the localhost, hence switch off anything using it. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> Access the Firewall (this might be default one which came with coputer or may be controlled by an Anti-Virus product you installed). Make sure Thunderbird (thunderbird.exe) and also the thunderbird updater.exe is set up as an allowed programs. </p><p><strong>In Thunderbird check you have the following set up:</strong> </p><p>'<em>1</em>.

Entering the email it was sent to,  while somewhat onerous, is simpler than trying to suppress future email via a mail client.   </p><p>While there used to be some sort of urban story about confirming your email address exists if you enter it in  unsubscribe  links fundamentally the real spammer simply do not care if the email addresses exist.  Some even send mail to random addresses in the hope they hit one that does exist.  Their clicks per email send are almost nothing but when you send  500 million email almost nothing is still quite a substantial number.  Those senders rarely offer an unsubscribe link, even where is is a legal requirement.  One thing that is generally overlooked is when an SMTP server tries to deliver an email to the email address.  The receiving server will refuse mail for many reasons,  one of those reasons is the email address does not exist on that server.  So if the marketer was interested in knowing which of the addresses they sent email to, they would simply log the send failures. </p><p>Legislation, in the EU and Australia, that I know of requires marketing mails to have an unsubscribe links.  Google has come on board requiring the links in what they consider bulk emails.  The result is that the vast majority of unsubscribe links now function as advertised and are not some sort of honey trap for harvesting email addresses.  But not of the legislation requires it to be a single click and done.  Hence the ask some questions in the hope folks will abandon the idea.
