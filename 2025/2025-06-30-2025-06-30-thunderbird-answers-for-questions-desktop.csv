Yes, I set up my primary personal account, completed the import, then followed the same process for another 9 accounts connected with business and creative activities. Very easy and straightforward. I certainly appreciate that displaying the setup dialog is essential for a new user to follow, but expected that once the process had been completed, opening the program would display a menu header  above a blank message frame, perhaps showing the TB logo, rather than repeating the configuration dialog every time the app is opened (regardless of whether the checkbox had been ticked or left unticked). Anyway, it's no big deal, and it doesn't detract from the the fact that in every other way I'm finding TB suits my simple ""send and receive email"" needs much better than the bloated ""bells and whistles"" alternatives. </p>",nmrn2012,false,0,0

Meaning you do not have an issue with something in Thunderbird. </p><p>I do not intend to sound rude towards you, but I would be 'naive' to respond to you in order to save my personal data in an alternative format.  </p><p>Please note, saving in an alternative format does not mean the emails have not been tampered prior to that action.  So the reasoning of saving an in an alternative format just in case you think it might be used in a legal situation is now a moot point. That does not mean saing in another format would be useful in certain situations. </p><p>AS a heads up .pst files can be exported to other formats, altered and then resaved as pst. But I suspect you are already aware of that fact. So just because it's a pst file and in Outlook does not mean it's not had any alterations. But I agree it's not so easy to alter as an mbox file.  </p><p>Outlook emails can be exported as eml files. There are plenty of pst to mbox and vis versa converter programs. Any email regardless of whether viewed in Outlook or Thunderbird or any third party email client can be copied and pasted into various programs and manually altered prior to printing. It can also forwarded to any email address as an attachment and therefore imported into any email client. When I say email - I do mean you can also 'view the source' not just read the visible email.  </p><p>It's easier to manipulate an mbox file - this is true - assuming you know what you are doing. Also assuming you have computer User Rights to access it, many do not have those rights when working for companies.  It also means it's easier to recover emails in many circumstances.  </p><p>User Access rights to mail storage folders is already something that can be set up by organisations which offers some additional protection.  So would in effect protect mbox files. This does not make it completely secure as someone always needs accessibility for obvious reasons, but it limits access and increases the integrity of emails. </p><p>Many legal situations prefer emails to be stored in a pdf format which can be done in Thunderbird if desired. Emails whether downloaded in Outlook, Thunderbird or any other third party email client will be acceptable in legal cases but the credibility of e-mail evidence will be scrutinized in all cases and that is expected.  </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:b.	Lack of Server-Side Enforcement</em> <em>Thunderbird relies on whatever SMTP/IMAP servers it connects to.</em> <em>Unless the server enforces policies (like DKIM signing, DMARC, or header filtering), client settings are only soft limits.</em> </p><p>Anyone can own a domain and not just companies or a business and set up DKIM. Therefore a valid DKIM signature alone is not necessarilly an indicator for a trustworthy e-mail.  </p><p>I think you will find most servers now perform DKIM checks. You can easily see the DKIM information in the 'View Source' of emails whether using Outlook or Thunderbird.  </p><p>In addition there is a Thunderbird addon DKIM Verifier just in case people want to see that information in the Message Header area, but servers perform those checks and Thunderbird is not a server. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

What I am asking for is for Thunderbird to be made such that the emails that it downloads from, say, a Gmail server are a little more legally acceptable. </p><p>My cyber security lawyer had told me that Outlook client emails are valid proof in the courts of law, but Thunderbird emails are not.  The reason that he told me was that Outlook client emails do not allow the header of the email to be edited after it has been sent, while there are lesser restrictions on Thunderbird emails.  It is possible that he explained to me in simple language without covering all the technical aspects but simplified it for me by saying that the difference lies in whether the header can be edited or not.  </p><p>By now, I am beginning to understand that it is not so simple as just whether the header can be edited or not, but has many other nuances to it.  While I am not a techie, and am unlikely to understand these nuances, I can explain my question better below.  </p><p>If there is anything that can be done to improve the legal validity of emails downloaded from the Gmail server into the Thunderbird client (possibly by making changes in the way that Thunderbird downloads and stores emails), then would it be helpful to have that done?  If, over a period of time, it improves to the level where emails downloaded by Thunderbird from the Gmail server are acceptable to a court of law, at least in India, which accepts Outlook client emails downloaded from the Gmail server, then it would add considerably to the utility of Thunderbird.    </p><p>This is what I was trying to say and I request you to let me know, in simple words if possible, whether such improvements can be made to the Thunderbird software.  Even if it is in highly technical language, I can always ask Chat GPT to explain it to me.  </p><p>My whole request was not a problem that I faced in Thunderbird, but a suggestion to make Thunderbird even better.  I assume that I have been able to explain my question better and I look forward to your reply on whether Thunderbird would consider it worthwhile to move in that direction, if it is not already doing so.  </p><p>Thanks and Regards, Tapan  (Tapan Singhal) </p>",tapan.datapower,false,0,0

There are two different error codes. In the first screenshot - assuming this is on the Windows computer running Bitdefender A/V software: ""The certificate for ... does not come from a trusted source."" </p><p>On the Windows computer, click the 'Get Certificate' button, then 'View'. This should open a new Certificate Viewer window with the certificate details.

So the problem could be a missing intermediate or root certificate. As a result Thunderbird cannot verify the entire certificate chain, hence the exception prompt. That wouldn't explain why exception prompts are show frequently though. So it may still be some thing else. But more information is needed. </p><p>So even though you do get an exception prompt in both cases, the cause is different for each. I have no idea about Thunderbird for Android.
