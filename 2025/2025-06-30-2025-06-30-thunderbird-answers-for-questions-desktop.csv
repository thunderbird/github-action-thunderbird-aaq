So really I have no idea what you even mean by a blank page.  You install it,  set it up with your mail account details and when you open it , it reaches out to your mail provider and gets your mail. </p><p>What is this blank screen? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

I was looking for a way to open without the ""Choose what to set up""  and ""Import From another program"" info - both of which are quite valid and useful, but not necessary to show every time the program is opened.

I know Apple images do not go well in emails as they use an Apple proprietary file format by default that blurs image and movie  into a single file.  These tend to appear in emails as a blank placeholder, often in a frame. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
