I've connected Thunderbird to both accounts. Recently, I made a configuration change somewhere in Thunderbird, and it asked me for my ""full name."" I put it in, not thinking it would change how incoming emails are displayed because under General-&gt;Settings-&gt;Message List, I have the ""Full name and email address"" option checked. </p><p>However, for both Gmail and Yahoo, I only see that ""full name"" that I put into my settings when I read an email message. It does not show the actual name (if any) that is in the email header, nor does it show the email address. Basically, the To header in the incoming message is ignored. </p><p>I've checked the account settings for both Gmail and Yahoo. Default Identity-&gt;Your Name, hasn't changed for either account. Both names are different from the ""full name"" that I put in recently. I'd like for Thunderbird to show the actual To header for both accounts. </p><p>Does anyone know hot to fix this? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>Robert Orosz </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rdo80241
