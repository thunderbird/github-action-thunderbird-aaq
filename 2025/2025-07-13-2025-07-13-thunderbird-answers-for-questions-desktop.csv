If you're wanting to switch to thunderbird, the simplest approach (in my opinion) would be this:  </p> <ol><li> exit betterbird </li><li> make a backup copy of the appdata\roaming\betterbird folder </li><li> then rename the betterbird folder to thunderbird  </li><li> then install thunderbird from <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> </li></ol>",davidsk,false,0,0

I spoke with them yesterday - and they asked me to change the password and it worked for a moment; I was able to send a test email from Thunderbird and then it immediately stopped working again. I called them this morning and because they are able to send a test email FROM MY ACCOUNT directly from their server, they claim it is not their problem. Furthermore, because I am able to send emails from Outlook from my computer, they view this as a proof of their claim.  </p><p>I need to leave home now; I will try to take a screen shot later on this afternoon. My son is going to visit me and maybe he will be able to help me with providing this information for you. Thank you, again! Halina </p>",halinahlad,false,0,0
