So the feed properties do not have the feed address (xmlUrl), which would allow it to be uniquely identified with feeds in the OPML file, feeds in another aggregator application, or with the Google Alerts interface. Also, when importing, the htmlUrl address, which is used to specify the address of the web interface for managing feeds (useless information for the application, but sometimes useful to the user), seems to be lost. </p><p>Also, as far as I understand, Thunderbird does not provide the user with the ability to see the date a feed was added to the application (or filter or sort feeds by this property), or an error log when updating it.

First of all let me say that I am happy with the default use of paragraph style and if I want to have occasional single spacing I can use shift-enter instead of enter.  Most queries on formatting seem to be about getting single spacing all the time.  That is not my issue. That means that if I compose an email from scratch everything is just the way I want it, using the default settings. The problem arises when I reply to an email.  The settings then seem to be ignored.  For instance the line spacing can be fixed to single spacing whether I select paragraph or body text and no matter what I do I can't get it to follow the default behaviour.  Also, I noticed that the font goes to ""sans-serifArial"" instead of the usual ""Variable Width"".  In fact if I try to select ""Variable Width"" in the Format menu it is just ignored.
