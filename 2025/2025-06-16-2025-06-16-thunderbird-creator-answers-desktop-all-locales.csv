The email is created using bash script that is launched from a desktop icon. My system is Linux Mint. </p><p>This works quite well except that if the email body contains commas then everything from the comma on-wards does not appear. For example if the email body should be ""Hello Fred, In response to your email of the..."", what appears is ""Hello Fred"".  </p><p>I have tried changing the HTML/Text settings in Thunderbird, but to no avail. Have also tried creating an email from the terminal, but again the result is the same. </p><p>I would very much appreciate some guidance with this. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",perryg

Now even as far back as 2016  i have some   things  i sent to drafts  and they have my name from and too.  I  think my  Thunderbird is just messed up ok send one photo of  just the  yellowline at the bottom  and send a draft  i had saved from 2019  that has the same  yellow line </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mdm54
