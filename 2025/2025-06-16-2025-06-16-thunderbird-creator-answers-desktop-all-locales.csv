First of all let me say that I am happy with the default use of paragraph style and if I want to have occasional single spacing I can use shift-enter instead of enter.  Most queries on formatting seem to be about getting single spacing all the time.  That is not my issue. That means that if I compose an email from scratch everything is just the way I want it, using the default settings. The problem arises when I reply to an email.  The settings then seem to be ignored.  For instance the line spacing can be fixed to single spacing whether I select paragraph or body text and no matter what I do I can't get it to follow the default behaviour.  Also, I noticed that the font goes to ""sans-serifArial"" instead of the usual ""Variable Width"".  In fact if I try to select ""Variable Width"" in the Format menu it is just ignored.
