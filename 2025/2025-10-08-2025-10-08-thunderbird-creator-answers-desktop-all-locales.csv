Possibly because I was changing some settings, possibly because of a Thunderbird update, there are a couple of wonky things going on in my Folder Pane and elsewhere. Among them is the fact that one of my ""Archives"" folders now has a ""Sent"" icon instead of an ""Archives"" icon (see attached). Does anyone know how to fix this? I've tried the following: 1. Repairing the Thunderbird folder. 2. Restarting Thunderbird and my computer. 3. Installing the latest version of Thunderbird (without uninstalling though). </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1770604;1770639;,dohanian

Trying to back up both my inbox messages and sent messages.  Problem relates to backing up inbox messages.  First, attempted to back-up (sing the  save as function) to desktop (folder).  Plan was One Drive would back these up from Desktop.  Have 199,000 messages in inbox.  Did not save all of them. Then tried to save them in smaller increments to external storage (plenty of storage available). Successful with 4 back-ups of approximated 15,000 messages in each batch.  Now will not back-up the full 15,000 ....last successful was 5,000 messages. When it fails, message says ""Unable to save the message.  Check your file name and try again later.""  The file naming convention has been the same for all files and have carefully checked to make sure it is not the file naming convention. </p><p>What is the problem?  Does someone have a solution? </p><p>Can you please help me so I can successfully back-up all my inbox messages?  Once I figure out an approach want to continue backing up messages using this approach. </p><p>Greatly appreciate your help!! </p><p>Best, Monica </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1771537;,mschwinberg

It was suggested to use Thunderbird to download everything from my Yahoo Mail account.  I've downloaded Thunderbird, set up the server parameters as instructed, and it appears to have downloaded (synchronized) everything just as it appears in my Yahoo Mail account, via iMap.  I would like to currently (temporarily) stop Thunderbird from downloading and synchronizing with my Yahoo Mail account so that I can sort through and delete/save/organize what's been downloaded into Thunderbird, and delete everything in my Yahoo Mail account so that I can resume receiving new mail messages in my Yahoo Mail account.  I like the Thunderbird app so far and am considering using it as a one stop app for all of my online email accounts...Yahoo, Gmail, etc.  I apologize for taking up time and space for this question, as I'm presuming it's something pretty simple to do, but for some reason, I'm just not seeing how to do this in Thunderbird Settings.  Can someone please guide me on how to do this?  I used iMap to download/synchronize my Yahoo Mail with Thunderbird.  Thanks in advance!! </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1770590;1771148;,jbchylln
