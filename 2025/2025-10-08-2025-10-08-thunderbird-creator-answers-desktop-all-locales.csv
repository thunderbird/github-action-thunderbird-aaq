Possibly because I was changing some settings, possibly because of a Thunderbird update, there are a couple of wonky things going on in my Folder Pane and elsewhere. Among them is the fact that one of my ""Archives"" folders now has a ""Sent"" icon instead of an ""Archives"" icon (see attached). Does anyone know how to fix this? I've tried the following: 1. Repairing the Thunderbird folder. 2. Restarting Thunderbird and my computer. 3. Installing the latest version of Thunderbird (without uninstalling though). </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",dohanian

I recently transferred the domain and email hosting to OVH, which caused the old mail server configuration to stop working. </p><p>Here’s the current situation: </p><p>The account in Thunderbird is still using a POP server (<a href=""http://ssl0.ovh.net"" rel=""nofollow"">ssl0.ovh.net</a> – port 995), while OVH uses IMAP (port 993). </p><p>I cannot change the server type from POP to IMAP within the existing account settings. </p><p>When I try to add a new account, Thunderbird completely freezes after I click “Continue” and never gives me access to “Manual Configuration.” </p><p>I also cannot delete the existing account because it contains all my previous local emails that I need to keep. </p><p>At the moment, I’m able to send emails from this account via OVH, but I don’t receive any incoming messages. </p><p>What I’d like to do is simply update the server configuration to OVH’s IMAP settings, without losing my existing local messages or recreating the entire profile. </p><p>Could you please let me know if there’s a way to: </p><p>Force an existing POP account to switch to IMAP, </p><p>Or safely recreate the account as IMAP without losing local data and without Thunderbird freezing during setup? </p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance, </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1770424;,gust.matys
