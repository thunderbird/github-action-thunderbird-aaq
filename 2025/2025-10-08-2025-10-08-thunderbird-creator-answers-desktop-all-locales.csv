After creating the new profile, things were working better, but still some problems.  It's been several days.  Twice it marked my own e-mails as Junk, and both times I marked them as Not Junk, but that didn't seem to ""take"". </p><p>An e-mail in my Drafts folder is my ""in case of death"" e-mail.  I was editing it to change the To addresses, then told it to save as Draft.  That immediate Draft went straight to the Junk folder.  WTF?  So I go to the Junk folder, select it, right click, and ""Mark as Not Junk"". </p><p>Instead of going to the Drafts folder, Thunderbird sent it.  Not only that, the old Draft of the e-mail was sent also! </p><p>I'm royally pissed off!  How could Thunderbird do something so stupid?  First classify my own saved Draft as Junk after my having marked my own e-mails twice before as Not Junk, then send it when I said it was not Junk?  This is stupid. </p><p>Needless to say, I had to hurriedly sent a retraction e-mail, then made phone calls. </p><p>Something is really wrong with Thunderbird Junk processing.  After creating the new profile, I've seen junk e-mails sit in my Inbox for 15 minutes before suddenly Thunderbird decides that they are junk. </p><p>Thunderbird WAS a good program, but after having to start over with a new Profile, setting up my e-mail addresses again, install add-ins, go through all the settings again, import my e-mails, addresses, and calendars, then have things still going wrong, I'm wondering why I'm still using Thunderbird. </p>",Bruce91;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:143.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/143.0,2,0,1,,,
