Possibly because I was changing some settings, possibly because of a Thunderbird update, there are a couple of wonky things going on in my Folder Pane and elsewhere. Among them is the fact that one of my ""Archives"" folders now has a ""Sent"" icon instead of an ""Archives"" icon (see attached). Does anyone know how to fix this? I've tried the following: 1. Repairing the Thunderbird folder. 2. Restarting Thunderbird and my computer. 3. Installing the latest version of Thunderbird (without uninstalling though). </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",dohanian

I recently transferred the domain and email hosting to OVH, which caused the old mail server configuration to stop working. </p><p>Here’s the current situation: </p><p>The account in Thunderbird is still using a POP server (<a href=""http://ssl0.ovh.net"" rel=""nofollow"">ssl0.ovh.net</a> – port 995), while OVH uses IMAP (port 993). </p><p>I cannot change the server type from POP to IMAP within the existing account settings. </p><p>When I try to add a new account, Thunderbird completely freezes after I click “Continue” and never gives me access to “Manual Configuration.” </p><p>I also cannot delete the existing account because it contains all my previous local emails that I need to keep. </p><p>At the moment, I’m able to send emails from this account via OVH, but I don’t receive any incoming messages. </p><p>What I’d like to do is simply update the server configuration to OVH’s IMAP settings, without losing my existing local messages or recreating the entire profile. </p><p>Could you please let me know if there’s a way to: </p><p>Force an existing POP account to switch to IMAP, </p><p>Or safely recreate the account as IMAP without losing local data and without Thunderbird freezing during setup? </p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance, </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,1770424;,gust.matys

Trying to back up both my inbox messages and sent messages.  Problem relates to backing up inbox messages.  First, attempted to back-up (sing the  save as function) to desktop (folder).  Plan was One Drive would back these up from Desktop.  Have 199,000 messages in inbox.  Did not save all of them. Then tried to save them in smaller increments to external storage (plenty of storage available). Successful with 4 back-ups of approximated 15,000 messages in each batch.  Now will not back-up the full 15,000 ....last successful was 5,000 messages. When it fails, message says ""Unable to save the message.  Check your file name and try again later.""  The file naming convention has been the same for all files and have carefully checked to make sure it is not the file naming convention. </p><p>What is the problem?  Does someone have a solution? </p><p>Can you please help me so I can successfully back-up all my inbox messages?  Once I figure out an approach want to continue backing up messages using this approach. </p><p>Greatly appreciate your help!! </p><p>Best, Monica </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,"",mschwinberg
