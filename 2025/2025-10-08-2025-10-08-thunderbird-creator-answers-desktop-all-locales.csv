Possibly because I was changing some settings, possibly because of a Thunderbird update, there are a couple of wonky things going on in my Folder Pane and elsewhere. Among them is the fact that one of my ""Archives"" folders now has a ""Sent"" icon instead of an ""Archives"" icon (see attached). Does anyone know how to fix this? I've tried the following: 1. Repairing the Thunderbird folder. 2. Restarting Thunderbird and my computer. 3.

Trying to back up both my inbox messages and sent messages.  Problem relates to backing up inbox messages.  First, attempted to back-up (sing the  save as function) to desktop (folder).  Plan was One Drive would back these up from Desktop.  Have 199,000 messages in inbox.  Did not save all of them. Then tried to save them in smaller increments to external storage (plenty of storage available). Successful with 4 back-ups of approximated 15,000 messages in each batch.  Now will not back-up the full 15,000 ....last successful was 5,000 messages. When it fails, message says ""Unable to save the message.  Check your file name and try again later.""  The file naming convention has been the same for all files and have carefully checked to make sure it is not the file naming convention. </p><p>What is the problem?  Does someone have a solution? </p><p>Can you please help me so I can successfully back-up all my inbox messages?

My old Tbird profile has profile folders for two POP accounts and two IMAP accounts. I managed to copy the profile and set up new accounts and now emails work, but in the process I disconnected the old profile on c: . When trying to create a new account on c: (so that I can access the old profile to delete old mails and get more space)  I run into either ""incoming server already exists"" or I am asked a password which I can't find.  </p><p>Any help would be highly appreciated! Should I just delete the old profile, or is there a procedure to safely remove it? Or is a Tbird reinstall in order? Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",nils.rostedt
