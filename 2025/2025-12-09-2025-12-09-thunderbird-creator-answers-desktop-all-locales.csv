Thunderbird has downloaded all my emails and folders from my <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> account. Can send, receive, edit emails no problems and all is visible from Outlook client on other machines. Thunderbird does not show my calendar entries or contacts. I do not wish to import from Outlook as I would like to access my <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> from several locations. Been through online Help articles. Nothing seems to work. Have installed TbSync and Lightning Calendar Tabs add-ons with default settings. I have tried suggestions provided in this Mozilla Support. Other forum suggestions don't seem to relate to the version I have.  </p><p>I'm sure it is something simple as everything else I have done with my new environment is working wonderfully.
