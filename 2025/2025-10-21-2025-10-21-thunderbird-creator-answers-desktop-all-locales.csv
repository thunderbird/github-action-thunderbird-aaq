At this time all dialog boxes were too small to read or even see the text impute area for the password. This was a newly (re)created account inTB. It worked fine to download but would not send. [I eventually solved/worked around this by using a different login name.] However the UI problem is probably still there to be a problem for others. The first ""Sending message"" box was too small, about 1/4 the normal size I expect, but could be resized if you were quick enough. The Error message and Password Entry boxes would be overlaid and both too small to read content or see the buttons or text entry fields. They could not be resized. </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,1773620;,cwinte
