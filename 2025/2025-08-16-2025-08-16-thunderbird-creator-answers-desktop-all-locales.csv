I have 500,000 messages in Yahoo email. I have setup the latest Thunderbird in Windows 11. How can i make sure that all the 500,000 emails are downloaded (40Gb) to my Thunderbird on the PC?’ Currently the Inbox shows close to 10,000 emails.   I am not sure how to check or ensure that every single email i have in Yahoo is downloaded to my laptop.  Have already been running out of space in Yahoo given their new policies of storage.
