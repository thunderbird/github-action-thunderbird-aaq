When collapsed, the card shows only the name or email of the sender of the first message in the conversation. Is there a way of getting a list of all correspondents to show? Or at least, to show the sender of the last message?  This is especially relevant in the case of email chains with multiple correspondents. Currently, whomever started the chain will always be the first message and hence the top-most card. When new people respond, it shows the thread as ""unread"", however, the name of whomever sent the new email remains hidden until I expand the thread.  Is there any way to change that behavior? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1757240;,jdhauck
