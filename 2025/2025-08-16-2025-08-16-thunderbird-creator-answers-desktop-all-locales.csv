When collapsed, the card shows only the name or email of the sender of the first message in the conversation. Is there a way of getting a list of all correspondents to show? Or at least, to show the sender of the last message?  This is especially relevant in the case of email chains with multiple correspondents. Currently, whomever started the chain will always be the first message and hence the top-most card. When new people respond, it shows the thread as ""unread"", however, the name of whomever sent the new email remains hidden until I expand the thread.  Is there any way to change that behavior? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1757240;,jdhauck

I save them in a folder structure year/issue, so 2025/001, etc. </p><p>When I have a bunch of emails and want to save the attachments, it seems Thunderbird does not remember the location I selected last. Only when I have two emails in a row with the same type of attachment (.txt) does it remember. But in many cases I have multiple attachments and select Save All, and then the location is often one level higher than the last folder and sometimes somewhere else, although likely a folder I have used before but longer ago. </p><p>What is the logic behind the folder selection when I select Save or Save All? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;attachments;,thunderbird,attachments,en-US,"",jerry1
