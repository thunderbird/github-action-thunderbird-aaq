The shutdown of Pocket really hit hard, and it makes me worry: could Thunderbird face a similar fate? Especially now that Mozilla seems to be focusing its efforts more on Firefox and AI browser development, I’d like to ask the community and official team a few questions: </p><p>1. What is the current organizational structure around Thunderbird’s development and maintenance? I understand that since 2020, Thunderbird has been placed under MZLA Technologies—an independent, wholly‑owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation—and is managed by the Thunderbird Council. Does this mean Thunderbird operates under a fundamentally different model from Pocket? </p><p><br> 2. Is there any possibility of Thunderbird being discontinued, divested, or “down‑scaled” in the future? Does Mozilla have any plans to shrink Thunderbird or shift strategy in a way similar to Pocket? </p><p><br> 3. What is Thunderbird’s planned roadmap and how are resources being allocated? From what I’ve seen, Thunderbird is undergoing UI redevelopment (Supernova), monthly releases, mobile client initiatives, and new Pro services like Thundermail, Appointment, and Send. Does this reflect Mozilla’s confidence in its future? </p><p><br> 4. How can users and community members show support or express concerns? If we want to help ensure Thunderbird’s continued health and growth, what steps can we take to encourage Mozilla to allocate more resources? </p>",thunderbird;undefined;,thunderbird,undefined,en-US,1746645;,ziguilc2001

El problema que estamos presentando con las versiones 128 y 139 es que al momento de descargar los correos este los marca como descargados, sin embargo no aparecen en ninguna bandeja, quisiera saber como puedo hacer para que thunderbird realmente me descargue los correos.  Cabe destacar que cuando tenia Windows 7 esto no me ocurría y ahora que tengo windows 10 y 11 ocurre todos los dias. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;needsinfo;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,es,1746923;,gvtoet

In one of my two e-mail accounts I manage with Thunderbird via IMAP, the archive options (where I would like to configure that the archived messages go into folders organized by year) are greyed out.  See attached screenshot.  (In the other account, these options are accessible.)   The account in question is a google-based work account; is this related to the inaccessibility of the archiving options?  Can this restriction be overcome? Thanks in advance.
