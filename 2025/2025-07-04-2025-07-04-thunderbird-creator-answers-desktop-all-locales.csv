The shutdown of Pocket really hit hard, and it makes me worry: could Thunderbird face a similar fate? Especially now that Mozilla seems to be focusing its efforts more on Firefox and AI browser development, I’d like to ask the community and official team a few questions: </p><p>1. What is the current organizational structure around Thunderbird’s development and maintenance? I understand that since 2020, Thunderbird has been placed under MZLA Technologies—an independent, wholly‑owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation—and is managed by the Thunderbird Council. Does this mean Thunderbird operates under a fundamentally different model from Pocket? </p><p><br> 2. Is there any possibility of Thunderbird being discontinued, divested, or “down‑scaled” in the future? Does Mozilla have any plans to shrink Thunderbird or shift strategy in a way similar to Pocket? </p><p><br> 3. What is Thunderbird’s planned roadmap and how are resources being allocated? From what I’ve seen, Thunderbird is undergoing UI redevelopment (Supernova), monthly releases, mobile client initiatives, and new Pro services like Thundermail, Appointment, and Send. Does this reflect Mozilla’s confidence in its future? </p><p><br> 4. How can users and community members show support or express concerns? If we want to help ensure Thunderbird’s continued health and growth, what steps can we take to encourage Mozilla to allocate more resources? </p>",thunderbird;undefined;,thunderbird,undefined,en-US,1746645;,ziguilc2001

I have been using TB forever and I never had that problem before. It is POP3. When I try Folder Repair, the program simply throws out all messages whose content is not accessible (so if my Sent folder has 40,000 messages it comes back with a Sent folder of 2,000). Clearly something got corrupted but I am not sure what. In the picture below, the header is visible but (a) not clickable (different header showing) (b) no content is displayed. I used to copy the content of the TB folder to my laptop and back (while keeping different profile names assigned during installation. The problem seems to have started when I changed profile names and began using identical profile names on both the desktop and laptop. Also, the total size of the folders is around 65Gb, in case there is a size limit. Any ideas?
