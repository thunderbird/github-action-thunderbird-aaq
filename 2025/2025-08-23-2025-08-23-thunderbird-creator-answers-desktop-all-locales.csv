However, TB seems to be not up to the task. I can move one email at a time but that, of course, is not practical for my purposes. However, even if I break it down into 30 or 40 emails at a time, it copies some of them and not others. Anyone know what the problem is? I will admit that some of the emails are quite large (5-10 MB). Could this be the issue?  Are there limits on the size of a folder?  How do I know what those limits are? </p><p>Working with TB 128.11.0esr (64-bit) on a Macbook running Sequoia 15.4.1. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1758974;1759017;1759051;,queenmab100
