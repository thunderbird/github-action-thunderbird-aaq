Inbox says there are nearly 1600  messages in there somewhere, but only displaying about a dozen.  Fresh reopening might suggest, say 8 emails have been downloaded, but perhaps only 3 of them show on Thunderbird.  If I go on the net to my ISP (Hotkey /iPrimus) the missing ones show up there.  I have tried removing and reinstalling Thunderbird without fixing the problem.  I tried the repair files button but no difference.  Any suggestions?  Hotkey say it's not them. I can send a screenshot if needed </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",tgvincent

On opening any email it freezes for a couple of seconds resulting in a ""Wait for the program to respond"" or ""close program message"" .  This also happens when performing any action in Thunderbird. This has been happening for the past two or three weeks. Can you tell me how to fix this or is it something you need to do to fix. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",myralandis
