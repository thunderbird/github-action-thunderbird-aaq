Using Thunderbird (143.0.1) on a Mac (Sequoia 15.7) that has text replacements doesn't work. Mac text replacements ordinarily are filled In when the space bar is pressed, but in Thunderbird the replacements are filled in regardless, so, for instance,  I have the text replacement ""tr"" -- when I press those letters followed by a space it ordinarily expands to the word ""there"".  In Thunderbird every time I type those two letters, even if they are followed by other letters, it expands.   </p><p>So if I type ""trunk"" It looks good until I hit a space, when it expands to ""thereunk"". This happens whether I type the word or use speech input (Talon).  I use a lot of text replacements for common words, so this happens frequently, making it unusable.  </p><p>I'm a longtime Thunderbird user just now switching to a Mac. I'm hoping for a fix so I can use text replacements in Thunderbird, but a short term workaround would be the ability to turn text replacements off through the edit\substitutions menu (like other programs including Notes).   </p><p>Thanks for listening.

After months of researching online trading, I stumbled across what seemed to be a professional brokerage firm. Their platform looked polished, their representatives spoke with confidence, and at first, small withdrawals went through without issues. This gave me false reassurance, Encouraged, I gradually invested more until I had over $77,000 worth of Bitcoin tied up with them. That’s when things went wrong. Suddenly, my withdrawal requests were pending indefinitely. Support became evasive, asking me to pay extra fees, taxes, and even insurance deposits. Deep down, I knew I had been deceived. The realization was devastating. That was my savings, money I had worked years to build. Sleepless nights followed. I searched for solutions online, but most recovery services I found looked just as suspicious as the brokers who scammed me. Then, I came across Swift Recovery Services. What caught my attention was not just their professionalism but also their transparency. Unlike others, they didn’t make unrealistic promises. Instead, they explained how blockchain tracing, transaction analysis, and direct negotiations could help track stolen crypto. From the first consultation, I felt I was in safe hands. They asked for every detail transaction IDs, wallet addresses, email trails, and communication logs with the fake brokers. Their team went to work immediately, combining legal expertise with advanced crypto forensics. Within weeks, there was progress, Finally, after weeks of waiting that felt like months, I received the notification I thought I’d never see my $77,000 worth of Bitcoin was recovered. The relief was indescribable. Thanks to Swift Recovery Services, I not only reclaimed my stolen funds but also regained peace of mind.

I'm a professor, and have used Thunderbird for like ~15 years, and generally love it. I have 1000s of messages archived in local folders, which I have been doing forever. </p><p>I was using Thunderbird 143.0.1, on a reliable Windows 11 system. Yesterday I noticed about ~50 folders just randomly missing, and panicked thinking maybe my hard drive was corrupt. My subsequent troubleshooting was: </p><p>[a] I fortunately made a Paragon Hard Drive Backup from earlier in September, and restored it. That backup was using Thunderbird 142.0. All of ~50 folders were back to life!!! (minus messages that I archived over the last month, of course). </p><p>[b] Thunderbird then did an un-solicited auto-update back to 143.0.1. Now the same ~50 folders are gone again&nbsp;!?! WTF. </p><p>[c] I did another Paragon Restore back to the same early September time point, but unplugged my ethernet cable. Then I started again, and turned Thunderbird Auto Updates to ""off"", keeping me at 142.0. </p><p>[d] Now everything is fine, Thunderbird works, and my folders are intact. </p><p>Conclusion: at least on my computer, Thunderbird 143.0.1 is bad and deletes a massive number of my important work folders. It doesn't look like they were archived, just completely lost. For now, I will keep ""auto updates"" off., and only consider updating after I do future Paragon backups. I will also maybe transition to IMAP folder storage. (I've been doing local folder storage for the last ~15 years). </p>",thunderbird;update;,thunderbird,update,en-US,1768673;,marcxanderson

I've used Zoho mail for years via TBird, but now I've had to download the latest version of TBird, I can't log into my Zoho mail.  Each time I try, I feed TBird my Zoho account name, it says 'found your account' and asks for the password, and instantaneously it says ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password"". </p><p>As the username and password work fine via webmail, how come a brand-new download of TBird running on a brand-new download of Win11 has got the 'wrong configuration'?
