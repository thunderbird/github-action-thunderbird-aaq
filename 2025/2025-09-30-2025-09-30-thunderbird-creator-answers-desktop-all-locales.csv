Inbox says there are nearly 1600  messages in there somewhere, but only displaying about a dozen.  Fresh reopening might suggest, say 8 emails have been downloaded, but perhaps only 3 of them show on Thunderbird.  If I go on the net to my ISP (Hotkey /iPrimus) the missing ones show up there.  I have tried removing and reinstalling Thunderbird without fixing the problem.  I tried the repair files button but no difference.  Any suggestions?  Hotkey say it's not them. I can send a screenshot if needed </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",tgvincent

On opening any email it freezes for a couple of seconds resulting in a ""Wait for the program to respond"" or ""close program message"" .  This also happens when performing any action in Thunderbird. This has been happening for the past two or three weeks. Can you tell me how to fix this or is it something you need to do to fix. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",myralandis

Since Thunderbird doesn't seem to support Exchange calendars (as also per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/microsoft-oauth-authentication-and-thunderbird-202"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/microsoft-oauth-authentication-and-thunderbird-202</a>) I would like to integrate Nextcloud calendars. I have followed the official Nextcloud guide for Thunderbird calendar integration, but it is not working. I suspect it is due to the federation, since Thunderbird ""Add a calendar"" return me a ""You credentials have not been accepted"". My question is: does Thunderbird’s ""Add a calendar"" feature support in some way calendar access with OpenID Connect or OAuth2 federation authentication methods? (or there is a way to configure Thunderbird to do so with calendars?) </p>",thunderbird;calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",morgaur.zarka
