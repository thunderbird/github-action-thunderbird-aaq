Inbox says there are nearly 1600  messages in there somewhere, but only displaying about a dozen.  Fresh reopening might suggest, say 8 emails have been downloaded, but perhaps only 3 of them show on Thunderbird.  If I go on the net to my ISP (Hotkey /iPrimus) the missing ones show up there.  I have tried removing and reinstalling Thunderbird without fixing the problem.  I tried the repair files button but no difference.  Any suggestions?  Hotkey say it's not them. I can send a screenshot if needed </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",tgvincent
