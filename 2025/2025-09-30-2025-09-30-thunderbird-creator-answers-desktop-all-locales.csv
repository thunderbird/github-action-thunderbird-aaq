Inbox says there are nearly 1600  messages in there somewhere, but only displaying about a dozen.  Fresh reopening might suggest, say 8 emails have been downloaded, but perhaps only 3 of them show on Thunderbird.  If I go on the net to my ISP (Hotkey /iPrimus) the missing ones show up there.  I have tried removing and reinstalling Thunderbird without fixing the problem.  I tried the repair files button but no difference.  Any suggestions?  Hotkey say it's not them. I can send a screenshot if needed </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1768500;,tgvincent

On opening any email it freezes for a couple of seconds resulting in a ""Wait for the program to respond"" or ""close program message"" .  This also happens when performing any action in Thunderbird.

Since Thunderbird doesn't seem to support Exchange calendars (as also per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/microsoft-oauth-authentication-and-thunderbird-202"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/microsoft-oauth-authentication-and-thunderbird-202</a>) I would like to integrate Nextcloud calendars. I have followed the official Nextcloud guide for Thunderbird calendar integration, but it is not working. I suspect it is due to the federation, since Thunderbird ""Add a calendar"" return me a ""You credentials have not been accepted"". My question is: does Thunderbird’s ""Add a calendar"" feature support in some way calendar access with OpenID Connect or OAuth2 federation authentication methods? (or there is a way to configure Thunderbird to do so with calendars?) </p>",thunderbird;calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",morgaur.zarka
