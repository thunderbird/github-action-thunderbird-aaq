When I tried to send an email, this message pops up:  <strong>Login to server <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> with username [email removed]@twc.com failed</strong>, and I can't receive messages too! 2.  There is only 1 Outgoing Server (SMTP) at the bottom of the left pane, and should there be 2? I would be grateful if someone could help me solve this annoying problem.

On my browser or my mobile, I can connect without any problem to my e-mail provider. After consulting my provider, his suggestion was to try installing my account again. I did but it didn’t work (same error) I tried installing older version which Thunderbird was functioning on. It didn’t work either. Even that I cleaned my PC from Thunderbird totally. To clear this point on Versions 139.0 and 139.0.1 Thunderbird function as always before. Up to now any Thunderbird update took automatically the existing setting without any problem.

It only seems to happen when I use the Reply button that's on the bottom-right -- the biggest one, at the bottom of the thread. When I use that button, a field appears below the thread, where I can type my reply, but my signature isn't there, nor is it included in the message found in the Sent folder. When I reply to an email individually, a new window opens with a field populated by my signature. So this seems like a bug to me, unless there is some obscure setting for this that I can't find. I am a new/returned user so I wanted to check in here first. If others think this is a bug, I'll go through the Bugzilla process. </p><p>In the screenshot: the reply button at the bottom doesn't include signature, while the reply button in the top right area does include signature. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",raptor_malice
