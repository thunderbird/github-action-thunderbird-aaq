I have two accounts:  Harry's (herman.harry@twc.com) and mine (swherman@twc.com).  When I tried to send an email, this message pops up:  <strong>Login to server <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> with username swherman@twc.com failed</strong>, and I can't receive messages too! 2.  There is only 1 Outgoing Server (SMTP) at the bottom of the left pane, and should there be 2? I would be grateful if someone could help me solve this annoying problem. Thank you so much and I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Sheila </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1742111;1742145;,swherman

Had to get a new Google account as the old was was very screwed up.   I have TWO email accounts:  GMail and Outlook.  Outlookk account forwards all incoming mail to GMail account, so I should get mail only from GMail, but both accounts are set up in TB anyway.  Outlook is set up as IMAP.  GMail is set up as POP, necessary for some reason GMail setup (<a href=""http://gmail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.google.com</a>) told me.  Something about keeping message on the server or deleting them.  Have an APP PASSWORD for GMail account because TB didn't like the POP account. Set up TB on my laptop physically.  To speed up rest of work, I used TB ""Export to mobile"" on my phone and tablet.  That's when the problems seemed to start.  Finally had to set up TB on BOTH Android devices, which as far as I know, I did correctly. With that background, why am I not getting email on either Android device?  Any help greatly appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",dalewebb1
