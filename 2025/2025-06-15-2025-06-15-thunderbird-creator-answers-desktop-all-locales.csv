I have two accounts:  Harry's (herman.harry@twc.com) and mine (swherman@twc.com).  When I tried to send an email, this message pops up:  <strong>Login to server <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> with username swherman@twc.com failed</strong>, and I can't receive messages too! 2.  There is only 1 Outgoing Server (SMTP) at the bottom of the left pane, and should there be 2? I would be grateful if someone could help me solve this annoying problem. Thank you so much and I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Sheila </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",swherman

I select the application/file I want to open  and I am off and running.  How do I get back to this screen to open another application/file?  I like the graphical interface.  I understand I can open another application/file from the “File/Open” menu but I really like this  graphical presentation when selecting my next file to open. </p>,thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",rmosco77
