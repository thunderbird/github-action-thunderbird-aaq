Are those messages really being marked as junk by Thunderbird or do they just appear in the <i>Junk</i> folder? Do they show a banner saying ""Thunderbird thinks this message is junk mail""? If not, then it could be a message filter you have that's not working as expected or, more likely, the junk/spam filter <i>at the server</i>, not Thunderbird, what's moving them thereâ€¦ </p><p>PS: I sometimes see a guy answering as if it was a broken bot, but this is a users forum, not some automated tech support service, there are not AIs answering here. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
