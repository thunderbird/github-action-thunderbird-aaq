He had briefly installed a beta version of Thunderbird before this happened. Is that your case as well? Did you recently install a beta version of Thunderbird? </p><p>Account settings are stored in a <b>prefs.js</b> file within the profile folder. If there is a problem with that file, you may be able to fix the problem by re-creating only that file rather than the whole profile, but that will still require setting up your mail accounts again, then point Thunderbird to the folder it was using to store mail for each account before. </p><p>Go to the account <b>Server Settings</b>. Does the <b>Local Directory</b> field at the bottom of that pane appear blank as well? If it's blank, does the <b>Browse</b> button to the right of it let you figure what is that directory, i.e. which is the folder in the filesystem where Thunderbird stores your mail for this account? Knowing this will make setting up your accounts again easier, so take note of that for each of your accounts while you're checking that if you may figure that info there. </p><p>The following article explains what's a profile and how to locate your profile folder: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p><p>Go to that folder in the filesystem, quit Thunderbird if it's running, and look for a <b>prefs.js</b> file there.

As this could be in any address book, suggest you select 'All Address Books' and then make sure you have the following column headers enabled 'Name', 'Email Addresses', 'Address Book' You can then try a few different sorts, but as the email address is specifically yours and its correct, click on the 'Email Addresses' header to sort by that option and scan down looking for your email address.
