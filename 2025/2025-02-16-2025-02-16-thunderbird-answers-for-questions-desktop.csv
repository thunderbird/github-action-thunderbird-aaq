Are those messages really being marked as junk by Thunderbird or do they just appear in the <i>Junk</i> folder? Do they show a banner saying ""Thunderbird thinks this message is junk mail""? If not, then it could be a message filter you have that's not working as expected or, more likely, the junk/spam filter <i>at the server</i>, not Thunderbird, what's moving them there… </p><p>PS: I sometimes see a guy answering as if it was a broken bot, but this is a users forum, not some automated tech support service, there are not AIs answering here. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

He had briefly installed a beta version of Thunderbird before this happened. Is that your case as well? Did you recently install a beta version of Thunderbird? </p><p>Account settings are stored in a <b>prefs.js</b> file within the profile folder. If there is a problem with that file, you may be able to fix the problem by re-creating only that file rather than the whole profile, but that will still require setting up your mail accounts again, then point Thunderbird to the folder it was using to store mail for each account before. </p><p>Go to the account <b>Server Settings</b>. Does the <b>Local Directory</b> field at the bottom of that pane appear blank as well? If it's blank, does the <b>Browse</b> button to the right of it let you figure what is that directory, i.e. which is the folder in the filesystem where Thunderbird stores your mail for this account? Knowing this will make setting up your accounts again easier, so take note of that for each of your accounts while you're checking that if you may figure that info there. </p><p>The following article explains what's a profile and how to locate your profile folder: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p><p>Go to that folder in the filesystem, quit Thunderbird if it's running, and look for a <b>prefs.js</b> file there. Make sure you have read&amp;write permissions for that file and check whether there are additional <b>prefs-<i>N</i>.js</b> versions of it, where <i>N</i> is a number. </p><p>Post back with the results. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Is the username there the same as the email address from which you're trying to send the message? Your SMTP server may require both to be the same. </p><p>Another possibility is you're using a VPN and the SMTP server doesn't accept sending mail from the IP address your VPN is making you seem to have. In that case, check whether your VPN has an option called <i>split tunneling</i> which would allow you to let Thunderbird bypass the VPN. Otherwise, you'll have to disable the VPN to be able to send with that SMTP server. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
