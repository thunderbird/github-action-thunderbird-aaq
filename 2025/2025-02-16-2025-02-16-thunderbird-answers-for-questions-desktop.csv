Are those messages really being marked as junk by Thunderbird or do they just appear in the <i>Junk</i> folder? Do they show a banner saying ""Thunderbird thinks this message is junk mail""?

He had briefly installed a beta version of Thunderbird before this happened. Is that your case as well? Did you recently install a beta version of Thunderbird? </p><p>Account settings are stored in a <b>prefs.js</b> file within the profile folder. If there is a problem with that file, you may be able to fix the problem by re-creating only that file rather than the whole profile, but that will still require setting up your mail accounts again, then point Thunderbird to the folder it was using to store mail for each account before. </p><p>Go to the account <b>Server Settings</b>. Does the <b>Local Directory</b> field at the bottom of that pane appear blank as well? If it's blank, does the <b>Browse</b> button to the right of it let you figure what is that directory, i.e. which is the folder in the filesystem where Thunderbird stores your mail for this account? Knowing this will make setting up your accounts again easier, so take note of that for each of your accounts while you're checking that if you may figure that info there. </p><p>The following article explains what's a profile and how to locate your profile folder: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p><p>Go to that folder in the filesystem, quit Thunderbird if it's running, and look for a <b>prefs.js</b> file there.

In that case, check whether your VPN has an option called <i>split tunneling</i> which would allow you to let Thunderbird bypass the VPN. Otherwise, you'll have to disable the VPN to be able to send with that SMTP server. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

It has nothing to do with 'Language' and 'Appearance' is about font and colour and size  - it has nothing to do with Themes. </p><p>Please note it is possible to download a Theme, so that means it's an addon hence why they are in same location. It's not going to change because a generic Theme is not the same as choosing how you prefer to alter the appearance of the contents when using the selected theme. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:but can't find a solution to switch to a readable light version. </strong> </p><p>I suggest you offer more information on your real issue and see if a good solution can be found that suits you. </p><p>Please tell me what OS you are using because the 'System Theme' on Thunderbird will be dependent upon what settings you have on computer. For example: Windows OS has a settings for customised app mode which is dark or light. Windows OS - Settings &gt; Personalisation &gt; Colours will also effect eg: Task bar, button background colours and the thin strip colour which depicts what eg: Quick Filter optins are set. </p><p>So if computer has apps mode set to Light then the 'System Theme' setting in Thunderbird will also be Light.  </p><p>Please offer info about what you are finding difficult to 'read' and perhaps  post an image to help explain the problem. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The “Thunderbird” file is the whole profile including folders and mail filters. Do not be confused by the “profile” folder inside the “Thunderbird” folder.
