Perhaps use the filter log to view that information.  it is accessed from the filter dialog along with edit etc.  It can however be exceedingly slow to load into the dialog and may appear on first glance to be empty.  That is because the filterlog.html file can be many megabytes in size (mine is 87MB) and Thunderbird can take many minutes to parse the entire log to load it.  Generally it is much much faster to double click on the file in the profile folder and load it in Firefox. </p><p>Have a look at your message source. (Ctrl+U) to get the message ID,  then search in the Firefox tab (ctrl+F) for the message id.
