For new Thunderbird users, you can use the import wizard to directly transfer your emails, contacts, and settings. Just open Thunderbird, go to the ""Import"" option, select Outlook Express, and it should do the job. If you're already using Thunderbird, go to Tools &gt; Import, choose ""Mail,"" then select Outlook Express to bring everything over. However, the manual method can be a bit tricky, especially with large files, and you might lose some data or need to do things like contacts and emails separately. A smoother alternative is to convert your DBX files to PST, and then convert the PST files into MBOX format, which Thunderbird supports. This can help avoid issues and make the transfer easier. </p>",sanjay210no,false,0,0

Not sure all the info requested at ""change the DESCRIPTION"" as to exactly what the full email addresses included.  Did note that the Google accounts used ""smtp"" and the RoadRunner (RR) did not...and, if i needed to include my addresses.  Did try adding ""smtp"" to the RR address, but not work and spent too much time changing back.  Did go to the ""THEN click account settings again and found at the ""botttom line"" that one Google account said ""<a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> (DEFAULT)...and, after looking at each email line it was the only one.  I also looked at the ""edit"" tab for each address and all showed ""default"" on the ""port:"" line with the RR's showing port#587 and the Gmails showing port# 465.  Looks to me that the Default is the problem, but do not know if undo is correct or how to do it.  Any additional advice?  Again, many thanks for your help and reply.
