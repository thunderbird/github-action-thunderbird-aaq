I now use a windows 11 PC Recently, it have been taking a very long time to connect to my POP3 email server (am I using the right terminology?)--which is <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a>. Then, about a week ago, it stopped connecting entirely. I tried everything, then as a last resort, I saved all my profile data (I know how to do this) on to an external drive, uninstalled Thunderbird from the PC, deleted all the files, both local and roaming, and then downloaded and installed it again, just as if I was a first time user. Still would not connect. I can still receive emails on my ipad, phone, and on <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> on a browser, so I know that my password is correct.

I got to Thunderbird as Microsoft got rid of the Mail &amp; Calendar app which I had been using for quite some time as my calendar on my Windows laptops (both personal and from work). What was really good about it was the capability of connecting my calendars from work (Office) and personal (Google) in the same place on my Windows laptops. Once again, I was really satisfied with the Calendar from the Mail&amp;Calendar app from Windows. The main feature that I really liked was that it had a multi-week view and that I could scroll through the weeks and view the current week on top. Weirdly enough it is not a feature so common in calendar apps. Because of that, I did a little research and Thunderbird had that feature, so I started using it, but unfortunately I run into my main issue (and an additional one): - In my work calendar I have set some recurring events happening on the ""last working day of the month"" for several months. Unfortunately when I get access to my calendar on Thunderbird (by using the Provider for Exchange ActiveSync and TbSync extensions) I get the event repeated on all the working days of the last week of a month (as in the picture included image, where it should be only on the 31st - case of march 2026), which is pretty annoying. Is there a way to fix that? </p><p>As a note, the same happens in my Android phone when I get the calendar information from Outlook in my Google calendar, which is also pretty annoying. </p><p>Finally, as an additional issue (which I think is related to Google unfortunately, but I might as well ask), the Birthday calendar (which I have set as extracting the information from Contacts) is getting duplicated in my main calendar when I sync to Thunderbird. Therefore, I get see twice the birthdays: one in the Birthday calendar itself, and other in my main calendar. I would appreciate a fix for that as well. </p><p>Thanks in advance for the suggestions. Kind regards, Vicente. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1700770;1700771;1700773;,olguing.v
