It means I cannot unsubscribe from anything either.   When I tried to follow manual instructions they did not make sense and what was described was not what was on the set up.   I am not a tech I don't understand and for Thunderbird to have no way to get help is beyond shameful and insulting.  It is a ""fuck you"" to all of us.  Insult to injury is the constant nag for donations.  How dare you ask for this when you provide no help at all.  It should be illegal to do this.  I have tried for help on here before and received no answer.   I cannot function like this.  There is no Kindness here. ' When I try to take a screen shot the pop-up message disappears.

What happens is that I select an ics file to import (to my google account).  The import starts but only ever imports the first event.

It is definitely associated with the email address I'm trying to use it for. - Thunderbird WILL let me use this smart card to decrypt emails that I previously sent to myself. Thunderbird reports that the emails were also signed (accurate), and that the CA/trust chain is valid. - OpenSC and PCSC are both installed and appear to be happy. </p><p>Inconsistent Behavior: - Thunderbird will not allow me to add my personal certificate (smart card) for S/MIME signing, or encryption. The certificate manager says it cannot find a certificate associated with my email address. Drafting a new email does not offer options to Sign, or Encrypt. - Device Manager shows that the smart card's status is 'Logged In' (pin was entered correctly) - Thunderbird is using the smart card to decrypt and validate the signature of emails I previously sent to myself. (When I try to open these emails WITHOUT my smart card inserted, I cannot decrypt these emails. If I try to open the emails before entering my pin, I get prompted to enter my pin.) </p><p>So I can decrypt emails with this card. Emails signed with this card are valid.
