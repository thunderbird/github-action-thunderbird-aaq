Do you understand the impact of not being able to use links in emails?  It is the only way to access what the email is about.  It means I cannot unsubscribe from anything either.   When I tried to follow manual instructions they did not make sense and what was described was not what was on the set up.   I am not a tech I don't understand and for Thunderbird to have no way to get help is beyond shameful and insulting.  It is a ""fuck you"" to all of us.  Insult to injury is the constant nag for donations.  How dare you ask for this when you provide no help at all.  It should be illegal to do this.  I have tried for help on here before and received no answer.   I cannot function like this.  There is no Kindness here. ' When I try to take a screen shot the pop-up message disappears.  This is what it says ""This file does not have an app associated with it for performing his action.  Please install an app or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Apps Settings page."" I tried and it would not do it and only Chrome was offered.  I do not use Chrome.  I need my email back.  Thunderbird has effectively ruined my life.  It should not be this hard or disrespectful. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1707941;1707957;,annagp3
