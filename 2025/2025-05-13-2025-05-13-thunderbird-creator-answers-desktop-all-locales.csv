Unfortunately the icons for the two are so similar it's difficult to tell them apart.  I'd like to suggest that Thunderbird/Mozilla allow users to substitute their own icons for the running programs if they don't want to use the default one. </p>,thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",coffent1

I can move email into a external folder, but can only move a few at a time. I want to move all the email in one folder to folder outside of Thunderbird.  Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",revoswin2
