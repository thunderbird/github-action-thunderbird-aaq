Unfortunately the icons for the two are so similar it's difficult to tell them apart.  I'd like to suggest that Thunderbird/Mozilla allow users to substitute their own icons for the running programs if they don't want to use the default one. </p>,thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",coffent1

I can move email into a external folder, but can only move a few at a time. I want to move all the email in one folder to folder outside of Thunderbird.

Is there any way of saving these folders elsewhere so they are not backed up, or perhaps excluding them from backup somehow? </p><p>You are great with help, and just recently helped greatly! </p><p>Cheers, Jim. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",jim4001
