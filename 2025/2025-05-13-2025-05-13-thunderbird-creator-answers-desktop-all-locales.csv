Then I have to make my reply as a new separate message, which is just bad!  This does not happen very often, and many times I happens only to one out of many of my replies in the same thread! Which really baffles me. Is this a bug?  </p><p>Could somebody help me understand why this is happening? Is there a quick way to spot what and where exactly is the problem with my new email, so that I can remove or change the specific part and do my job? </p><p>Below you can see the error message I get: ""Sending of the message failed.
