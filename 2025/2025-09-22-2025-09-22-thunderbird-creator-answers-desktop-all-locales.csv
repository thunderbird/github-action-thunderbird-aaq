Setting up, it asks to import from a file.   I specify the .profile I stored. It says it added all the files, and finds al  email accounts. But when trying to add the Startmail email account to Thunderbird, it fails with message ""Unable to login at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password. I can login (for example) to my startmail email address through <a href=""http://Startmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Startmail.com</a> on Firefox. </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",joroles1

After a password change in Spectrum webmail, I lost the ability to receive and send e-mails using my old pop-server account.  I tried many things at this communities recommendations but no success.  So I changed the name of my old e-mail address and then created a new email account with my former e-mail name and also set up the new e-mail account to an IMAP account.  Then when prompted for a password, I correctly inputted the Spectrum webmail password and now I receive e-mails to this account on Thunderbird!  Hurray!!  However, I still cannot send out e-mails from this account as I get the message that the outgoing server ""(SMTP) <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>"" timed out.  And no - it is not an antivirus issue. </p><p>By the way, my phone e-mail account of the same address is able to send out e-mail messages.  However, I wish to handle my most sensitive messages to send off of my desktop version of the same e-mail address and that is where I am not able to send an e-mail. </p><p>Yikes - Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",zbadger
