It may well be that the error is in the profile. I do not recommend uninstalling, as the issue is likely elsewhere. Presuming you still have a copy of the old profile, a simple approach would be to copy the addressbook from the old profile to the new installation. Here are tips to do that: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - now, exit thunderbird. you are now in the profile.  - there are two addressbooks:   abook.sqlite and history.sqlite (this one is for collected addresses) - at this point, you can copy/replace the two folders with folders of the same name in the old profile  - then restart thunderbird and you should have the full addresbook. If not, then the addressbook itself is incomplete from the copy. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Do not assume anything - always check it out. </p><p><strong>1. Firewall</strong> Access Firewall - it might be the default supplied with OS or controlled by an Anti-Virus product you installed. Thunderbird must be set up as an allowed program. </p><p>Please confirm you have Thunderbird set up as an allowed program </p><p><strong>2. VPN</strong> Please check your computer for a VPN which has been enabled. Some Anti-Virus packages now offer VPN and in some cases auto enable it. Please switch off any VPN or create split tunnelling and set up it up for Thunderbird to use it because gmail server will not like it as it hides your IP and server will think someone is trying to hack your account, hence block access. </p><p>Please confirm VPN is disable/switched off.  I had some people not realise they even had a VPN let alone one that was enabled.  </p><p><strong>3. Localhost</strong> If you use a program that uses the localhost eg: Apache or Xampp - typically programs used by people who manage websites then you need to switch it off until the oauth token has been set up. You can enable it agin afterwards. </p><p><strong>4. Cookies</strong> In Thunderbird  Check cookies settings are as follows - they must be set up as allowed else it will fail. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li></ul> <p>Web Content </p> <ul><li>     Select 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Accept third party cookies 'Always' </li><li>     Click on 'Exceptions: button </li><li>     Add this: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> </li><li>     Set it to 'Allow' </li><li>     click on 'Save Changes'  </li></ul> <p><strong>5.

Once I have the second account working, I'll upgrade to 128, then 139; a step at a time. </p><p>Since late last year, while struggling with macOS, I had been using the two profiles on the second device, from the admin account on the system device.

I have a full day today; tomorrow I will have time to prepare answers to your questions. </p><p>Two quick answers, which should help:  &gt;  I have never installed applications in a user's Library.  I have two user accounts, one for work and one for everything else.  I install all applications in /Applications. So all applications were erased and only those that come on the OS file were installed after the erase. (I did not restore the system device from my backups, because Apple wants a clean install to pursue my bug-or-design-flaw.) &gt;  I have several storage devices (yes, Mac Pro).  The user data is on a separate ""Internal""* storage device, not on the system device. The two profiles are in /Volumes/User Data/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Thunderbird. User Data is a volume on a separate device. One profile in each user directory. </p><p>Well, three: &gt;  I erased only the system device, /.  I did not not erase the user data device.  After the erase, I confirmed that the OS problem was still present.   I then installed Thunderbird on the system device. </p><pre> *  As I expect you know well, macOS has four kinds of storage devices: System, SATA, bus and truly external.

Here are the answers to your questions. </p><p>Where in the file system are you installing Thunderbird? &gt; On the system storage device, at /Applications </p><pre>   See my previous response for more on this. </pre> <p>Do you actually have two internal storage devices (do you have a Mac Pro?) or do you mean two volumes on one storage device? &gt;  Two internal devices; Mac Pro. </p><pre>    See my previous response for more on this. </pre> <p>What do you mean that Thunderbird does not like your profiles? &gt;  Says the profile is missing or damaged.  </p><p>How are you connecting Thunderbird to your profiles?  &gt;   I start Thunderbird and the profile manager opens. The most recent profile is highlighted. I click to open. </p><pre>  (While struggling with macOS since October, I at first could not open the user accounts, I copied the profiles from the two user accounts to /Users/Administrator/Library/Thunderbird, and used e-mail from there.  Since I had two separate user profiles, I was using the profile manager. After the reinstall of macOS, see the answers below.) </pre> <p>What happens when you do? &gt;  Thunderbird will not open the profile. See the previous answer. </p><p>In what way did version 115 not work for you? &gt;  Would not open the profile. From which computer accounts?  &gt;  Both macOS user accounts.  I created an third e-mail account for Administrator on the e-mail server. Thunderbird, launched from the Admin account, works as designed for that new account. Accessing profiles stored where? &gt;  For each of the &lt;now three&gt; users, on ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles. (Where ~ is either in /Users or in /Volumes/User Data/Users.) </p><p>What do you mean when you say that a profile is ""accepted"" and not accepted?  &gt;  Thunderbird will open the profile and work as usual and Thunderbird will not open the profile. Which profiles by which computer accounts?  &gt;  Each user profile, by the user account which has that profile in ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles How are you trying to use the profiles?  &gt;  Open, receive mail, create messages, send them. What happens when you do? &gt;  Works normally with the new Administrator account; with the other two accounts, can’t open the profile. </p><p>You refer to an admin account and two user accounts. Are you trying to get Thunderbird in each account working with two or three profiles? &gt;  After the October macOS disaster, and before the clean macOS reinstall, I sometimes copied a profile (see above) or made a copy of a profile, and then started using the copy. After that OS reinstall, I used what had been the most recent profile, for each account, in that accounts Profiles folder. </p><pre>Now my first question is more relevant: Where is the Thunderbird app?  </pre> <p>&gt;  /Applications Where are your profiles?  &gt;  /Volumes/User Data/&lt;User&gt;/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles, where they have been for years. Except for the just created Admin user. Are they all in ~/Library/Application Support/Thunderbird/Profiles? &gt; None. Well, I don’t know where the new Admin profile is, but Thunderbird is quite happy with it. It is wherever Thunderbird created it. </p><p>If the profiles are in the default location in ~/Library/Application Support/Thunderbird/Profiles, then the admin account can access all profiles and the non-admin accounts can access only their own profiles. Putting the profiles outside the permissions of the non-admin accounts would explain why Thunderbird works with all profiles from the admin account but not from the non-admin accounts. &gt; During the time I could not log in to the user accounts, they were both in /Users/Administrator/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles. They worked fine there.  Since I was again able to log in to the user accounts, the user profiles are back in /Volumes/User Data/Users/&lt;User&gt;/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles. </p><p>But why multiple accounts and multiple profiles and the desire to access two or more profiles from one account? &gt;  One macOS account for each user. </p><pre>   The only present reason to access more than one profile from any user account will be to recover any messages that may be in a copied-and-saved profile but have been lost in a later profile for that user.  That is something I will look into after all this is behind me.    I use Profile Manager only since the time that I could use only the macOS Admin account. Since I am again able to log in to the user accounts, I use Profile Manager in those accounts, but always select the highlighted current profile. </pre> <p>Do you need this complexity? &gt;  I need the complexity of having two profiles, one for the user account for my confidential work, and the other for the user account for all else.  I doubt I will ever use the third profile for the Administrator account, unless I get into an even deeper macOS problem in the future. </p><p>Would you please tell us more about the problem itself? Simply that Thunderbird, opened from /Applications, and asked to use a profile in /Volumes/User Data/Users/&lt;User&gt;/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles, declines to use that profile. Though it was using it for months before the very recent erase and reinstall. </p><p>I hope all is covered in my answers above.  You’ve seen my post of June 1st. </p><p>I now have some time to work on this, and will look at the permissions of the user data, after the macOS erase and ""clean"" install, the re-creation of the two macOS user accounts, and the configuration of those two accounts to use the user data on the UserData internal SATA SSD, /Volumes/User Data/. </p><pre>   (Except for Thunderbird, so far no trouble with the few other applications that I have reinstalled on /Applications, including Firefox, which is using my pre-disaster and pre-erase configurations.) </pre>",joaquin.oakland,false,0,0

I'm sorry that I made you work that hard. </p><p>In short, you have two macOS user accounts (let's ignore the admin account for now) that use Thunderbird and need to access profiles in a certain location, from which they have accessed those profiles in the past, but when you try to open those profiles from those accounts, Thunderbird does not open them because, it says, they are missing or damaged (or does it say ""inaccessible""?).

I've read the article on TBird junk and I admit that I don't completely understand how the app decides what is junk. For context, I've used TBird for many years and recently had to remove and reinstall it because of an issue with my server. I had no issues prior to that. I have adjusted the settings per the article and have marked all messages as either ""junk"" or ""not junk"" on a daily basis for the past week or so, which is my understanding of the ""whitelisting"" procedure. All of that has had absolutely no effect on the massive amount of junk mail that comes in on a daily basis. Same senders, same subjects, in most cases several times a day. If my constant deliberate marking messages as junk and not junk is not among the criteria that the algorithm takes into account, then I'm obviously missing something. I'm sure I'll be embarrassed when I find out what it is. If you can point me in the right direction I'd be grateful. </p>",CWTL,false,0,0
