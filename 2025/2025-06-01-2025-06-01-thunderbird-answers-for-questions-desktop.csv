It may well be that the error is in the profile. I do not recommend uninstalling, as the issue is likely elsewhere. Presuming you still have a copy of the old profile, a simple approach would be to copy the addressbook from the old profile to the new installation. Here are tips to do that: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - now, exit thunderbird. you are now in the profile.  - there are two addressbooks:   abook.sqlite and history.sqlite (this one is for collected addresses) - at this point, you can copy/replace the two folders with folders of the same name in the old profile  - then restart thunderbird and you should have the full addresbook. If not, then the addressbook itself is incomplete from the copy. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have deleted the updated version.  However, I will look at it again at some future date and follow your advice. At the moment I will continue with the older version until I have more time to devote to it. </p>",pwheatley27,false,0,0

Do not assume anything - always check it out. </p><p><strong>1. Firewall</strong> Access Firewall - it might be the default supplied with OS or controlled by an Anti-Virus product you installed. Thunderbird must be set up as an allowed program. </p><p>Please confirm you have Thunderbird set up as an allowed program </p><p><strong>2. VPN</strong> Please check your computer for a VPN which has been enabled. Some Anti-Virus packages now offer VPN and in some cases auto enable it. Please switch off any VPN or create split tunnelling and set up it up for Thunderbird to use it because gmail server will not like it as it hides your IP and server will think someone is trying to hack your account, hence block access. </p><p>Please confirm VPN is disable/switched off.  I had some people not realise they even had a VPN let alone one that was enabled.  </p><p><strong>3. Localhost</strong> If you use a program that uses the localhost eg: Apache or Xampp - typically programs used by people who manage websites then you need to switch it off until the oauth token has been set up. You can enable it agin afterwards. </p><p><strong>4. Cookies</strong> In Thunderbird  Check cookies settings are as follows - they must be set up as allowed else it will fail. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li></ul> <p>Web Content </p> <ul><li>     Select 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Accept third party cookies 'Always' </li><li>     Click on 'Exceptions: button </li><li>     Add this: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> </li><li>     Set it to 'Allow' </li><li>     click on 'Save Changes'  </li></ul> <p><strong>5. Passwords</strong> Whilst in Privacy &amp; Storage.... </p> <ul><li> Scroll down to 'Passwords ' section </li><li> Click on 'Saved Passwords' </li><li> If you see any line for gmail/google - mailbox://account... imap://account...smtp://account....oauth://account </li><li> Please remove all mentions of the gmail account.  If something is already set up eg: oauth then it will fail when you try to find settings as an oauth is expected but a password was offered - gmail gets confused, so make sure they are all removed. </li><li> click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p><strong>6. Restart</strong> This ensures all the settings are properly updated to preferences and other files; this is required. </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird now </li><li> Wait a few moments for all background processes to complete. </li><li> Start Thunderbird </li></ul> <p><strong>7 Attempt to create gmail account.</strong> </p> <ul><li> Menu app icon &gt; New Account &gt; Email </li><li> Enter name, full email address, password - the one you use to logon to account </li><li> Select the checkbox to Remember Passwords and click on 'Continue'. </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird by default will try to locate the IMAP configuration settings which are the following: Server Settings: <strong>IMAP</strong> </p> <ul><li>     Server name: <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> </li><li>     Port: 993 </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li>     Authentication Method: Oauth2 </li><li>     Username: full gmail email address  </li></ul> <p><strong>SMTP</strong> </p> <ul><li>     DEscription: full gmail email address </li><li>     Server name: <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> </li><li>     Port: 465 </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li>     Authentication Method: Oauth2 </li><li>     Username: full gmail email address  </li></ul> <p><br> You will get asked by google/gmail pop up window to enter password to logon and then you may get asked to 'Allow' thunderbird access to server which you need to do and then it sets up the oauth token. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
