It may well be that the error is in the profile. I do not recommend uninstalling, as the issue is likely elsewhere. Presuming you still have a copy of the old profile, a simple approach would be to copy the addressbook from the old profile to the new installation. Here are tips to do that: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - now, exit thunderbird. you are now in the profile.  - there are two addressbooks:   abook.sqlite and history.sqlite (this one is for collected addresses) - at this point, you can copy/replace the two folders with folders of the same name in the old profile  - then restart thunderbird and you should have the full addresbook. If not, then the addressbook itself is incomplete from the copy. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Do not assume anything - always check it out. </p><p><strong>1. Firewall</strong> Access Firewall - it might be the default supplied with OS or controlled by an Anti-Virus product you installed. Thunderbird must be set up as an allowed program. </p><p>Please confirm you have Thunderbird set up as an allowed program </p><p><strong>2. VPN</strong> Please check your computer for a VPN which has been enabled. Some Anti-Virus packages now offer VPN and in some cases auto enable it. Please switch off any VPN or create split tunnelling and set up it up for Thunderbird to use it because gmail server will not like it as it hides your IP and server will think someone is trying to hack your account, hence block access. </p><p>Please confirm VPN is disable/switched off.  I had some people not realise they even had a VPN let alone one that was enabled.  </p><p><strong>3. Localhost</strong> If you use a program that uses the localhost eg: Apache or Xampp - typically programs used by people who manage websites then you need to switch it off until the oauth token has been set up. You can enable it agin afterwards. </p><p><strong>4. Cookies</strong> In Thunderbird  Check cookies settings are as follows - they must be set up as allowed else it will fail. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li></ul> <p>Web Content </p> <ul><li>     Select 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Accept third party cookies 'Always' </li><li>     Click on 'Exceptions: button </li><li>     Add this: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> </li><li>     Set it to 'Allow' </li><li>     click on 'Save Changes'  </li></ul> <p><strong>5.

If something is already set up eg: oauth then it will fail when you try to find settings as an oauth is expected but a password was offered - gmail gets confused, so make sure they are all removed. </li><li> click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p><strong>6.

Where in the file system are you installing Thunderbird? </p><p>Do you actually have two internal storage devices (do you have a Mac Pro?) or do you mean two volumes on one storage device? </p><p>In your first post, you were seeking answers that would help you solve a problem that you did not define. People here may be able to help you more if they understand the problem itself better. So ... </p><p>What do you mean that Thunderbird does not like your profiles? How are you connecting Thunderbird to your profiles? What happens when you do? </p><p>In what way did version 115 not work for you? From which computer accounts? Accessing profiles stored where? </p><p>What do you mean when you say that a profile is ""accepted"" and not accepted? Which profiles by which computer accounts? How are you trying to use the profiles? What happens when you do? </p><p>You refer to an admin account and two user accounts. Are you trying to get Thunderbird in each account working with two or three profiles? Now my first question is more relevant: Where is the Thunderbird app? Where are your profiles? Are they all in ~/Library/Application Suppport/Thunderbird/Profiles? </p><p>If the profiles are in the default location in ~/Library/Application Suppport/Thunderbird/Profiles, then the admin account can access all profiles and the non-admin accounts can access only their own profiles. Putting the profiles outside the permissions of the non-admin accounts would explain why Thunderbird works with all profiles from the admin account but not from the non-admin accounts. </p><p>But why multiple accounts and multiple profiles and the desire to access two or more profiles from one account? Do you need this complexity? </p><p>I suspect that the version of Thunderbird is not important here. Your app and profile organization may be important. </p><p>But I am making guesses about the problem, so this line of inquiry may not be helpful.
