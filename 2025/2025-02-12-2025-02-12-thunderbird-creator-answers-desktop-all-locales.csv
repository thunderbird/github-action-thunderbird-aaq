I get a long period of hanging after sending then a message saying password not incorrect. </p><p>This was going on for a couple hours when it was working(able to send messages); </p><p>Then just now just to double check before posting this(see the actual what the actual fail message is saying), </p><p>I can now send messages again - but now it doesn't ask me for a password first, where before I needed one. It will just send the Email. </p><p>This is very strange behavior going on as I didn't do any restarting of the computer - only closing Thunderbird.(which didn't do anything for a couple trys). </p><p>Is it possible there is some background updating going on? Or something else? </p><p>Insights are appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1711441;,jaiy
