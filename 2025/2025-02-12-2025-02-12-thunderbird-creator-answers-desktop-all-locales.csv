I've noticed, that whenever I launch Thunderbird, it takes several minutes (!) where it says ""Connecting to <a href=""http://mail.myserver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.myserver.com</a>"" in status. I'm using my own postfix/dovecot server with imap and I don't have this problem on Thunderbird Windows for instance, where it connects right away on startup. After the initial slow connection, it works just fine, when I manually trigger to scan for new messages (instantly). I tried literally any option within Thunderbird to fix that, without any success. It seems to be some trouble with resolving / dns or probably ip6/ip4, but then again, why would it work normally after the long connection time in the beginning? Any clue what might be the problem here? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1711571;,admin952

To maintain the state I like I then need to delete the now-dead pinning for the taskbar, find thunderbird afresh and leunch it and re-pin. This is not a terribly new behaviour but the grief threshold in my life has just been passed leading me to ask if this is a thunderbird issue or a windows one and if there is some scheme I can use to keep the application pinned pretty well come what may.
