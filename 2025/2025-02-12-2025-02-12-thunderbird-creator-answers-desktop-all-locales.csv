I get a long period of hanging after sending then a message saying password not incorrect. </p><p>This was going on for a couple hours when it was working(able to send messages); </p><p>Then just now just to double check before posting this(see the actual what the actual fail message is saying), </p><p>I can now send messages again - but now it doesn't ask me for a password first, where before I needed one. It will just send the Email. </p><p>This is very strange behavior going on as I didn't do any restarting of the computer - only closing Thunderbird.(which didn't do anything for a couple trys). </p><p>Is it possible there is some background updating going on? Or something else? </p><p>Insights are appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1711441;,jaiy

Everything seemed to go okay until I tried to import my settings from the desktop (Thunderbird 128.7.0esr (64-bit) running on SolydK Linux 12 (Debian Bookworm)). I lined up the QR code (I think) and pressed the Done button, but it just dumped me back to the Getting Started screen without accessing my settings at all. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",peng.thinkblue+mfx

I'm using 128.7 version in Windows 11,"<p>Hi, I've been using Thunderbird for at least two decades. In january (aprox) it kept freezing after using it for a while. It was a pain but I closed it (the hard way because it did not respond) and then reopened it. I managed to use it this way until today. Today it froze at starting it up. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I've tried opening it up without extensions, I've tried installing an older version. Nothing has worked thus far. Please please help me. I have to be able to read my older messages and to see my folders. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,es,"",nadia.t

I've noticed, that whenever I launch Thunderbird, it takes several minutes (!) where it says ""Connecting to <a href=""http://mail.myserver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.myserver.com</a>"" in status. I'm using my own postfix/dovecot server with imap and I don't have this problem on Thunderbird Windows for instance, where it connects right away on startup. After the initial slow connection, it works just fine, when I manually trigger to scan for new messages (instantly). I tried literally any option within Thunderbird to fix that, without any success. It seems to be some trouble with resolving / dns or probably ip6/ip4, but then again, why would it work normally after the long connection time in the beginning? Any clue what might be the problem here? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",admin952
