Just be assured the home of BHP is much larger than my very smokey corner of SA  </p><p>What you proposed there is most certainly not right.  </p><p>To get Thunderbird to place it's ""database"" as you term it onto another drive you have to place the entire profile folder structure and contents into the new location with Thunderbird not running. </p><p>You then create a new profile using the profile manager in the location you have placed to profile folder and restart Thunderbird. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_start-the-profile-manager-when-thunderbird-is-closed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_start-the-profile-manager-when-thunderbird-is-closed</a> Or you can use the About:profiles link in the troubleshooting information to create, switch and manage profiles.  But that has never been documented, although the same principles apply as for the profile manager.  It is also a copy of the same thing in Firefox.   For my images I used the About:profiles approach because I can access it without closing Thunderbird. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-02-05-16-53-04-5895b3.png""> </p><p>Once you have gone through the process of pointing to a folder, do not change the profile ""name"" or the folder selected will change to a new default value. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-02-05-16-57-22-e4108f.png""> </p><p>Here I have set up to create a profile called Whatname in the folder location C:\Users\Matt\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\69njmd8q.doggy </p><p>Once I clicked ""finish"" on that dialog the newly created profile is added to the list of profiles in about:profiles as shown below. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-02-05-16-57-44-ce4584.png""> </p><p>Now you can launch the profile using the Launch profile in new browser button.  It will just open another copy of Thunderbird with that profile (the copy was just a little too exact) </p><p>Now  here is the bit to watch out for,  the new profile will become your default,  so everything is good if when you launch it everything looks good.  If not you will need to use the ""set as default profile"" button under your previous default on the C: drive to essentially undo the change of default profile to launch. </p><p>Regardless,  pressing ⊞Windows key+R to launch the windows run dialog and typing Thunderbird -p in the text area and pressing enter will always launch the profile manager so you can pick another profile is all else fails. </p><p>Changing the account directory will see mail for that account stored in the specified location  but that is all.  I do not see it as a substitute for moving the profile location.  You end up creating a rod for your own back at a future time changing the account directory as it makes migrating the profile to a new machine much harder. You have these absolute pointers to your data for the account now that rarely exist in exactly the same form on the new machine as the point you are installing software, so even once you move your profile you will get Thunderbird up and running with your account and contacts and the accounts will be empty. </p><p>The is also the issue that calendars, contacts the global search database (mine is many GB is size) and all settings remain on the C: drive in the original location when you only change the account directory. </p><p><strong>Now your 2</strong> from the original post. </p><p>Thunderbird has no idea what a PST file is,  it imports mail from the outlook application via what used to be called dynamic data exchange.  That is, Thunderbird asks the Outlook application for say a list of calendars and Outlook offers the requested data.  It all works while both applications or on the same page and has no dependence on, what used to be, the constantly changing format of the underlying data storage file (back when this stuff was first written every new release of MS Office came with new file formats and a slew of file import filters).  Outlook import has not had much in the way of change since Netscape held the reins other than enough new code to fix it when it actually stops functioning. </p><p>So the best approach is to install Thunderbird on a machine with Outlook running as the default mail client and the PST file included as the default in outlook and let the import just do it's thing.  It also eliminates the possible issue that the PST is corrupt in some way as outlook will be able to open it if it is not corrupt.  Even if the import occurs on the wrong computer,  it is far easier to move profiles than it is to try and use third party software you are not familiar with. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
