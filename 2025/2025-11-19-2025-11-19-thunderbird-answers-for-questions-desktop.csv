I see that when I go to the yahoo page that you referenced, when I look at yahoo's instructions, it says: ""<strong>When creating an app password, use a browser that you've used to sign into Yahoo for several days in a row and avoid using Incognito mode.</strong>"" 2. The yahoo e-mail account works fine in Thunderbird on the old desktop.  On the old desktop, using Firefox, I can login to the yahoo e-mail account.  But on the new desktop, neither approach works. 3. I've seen many times that yahoo knows which client and operating system I'm using to access my e-mail account. It seems to me that, logically, what's causing the problem is that I'm trying to access my yahoo e-mail from a client-OS combination that I've never used before. </p><p>How much of a chance does this have of working: 1. I generate the ""app password"" on the old desktop. 2. I shut down the old desktop, crawl around on the floor under the desk and table to switch cables around, and power up the new desktop. 3. On the new desktop, I try to create the yahoo e-mail account using the ""app password"" that was generated on the old desktop. This will take significant time and effort, so I'd like to know it has a good chance of working before I try it. Also, question: does the new ""app password"" go into the password field in the page I use to create the new account, the password table in settings, or both? </p><p>the ""forgot password thing"": I learned the hard way the there is serious vulnerability in saved passwords and password managers; I seriously avoid those.  I'm drowning in passwords that I manually enter.  I'd like to avoid changing my password until a last resort. </p><p>I do not have an ""app password"" for the e-mail account on the old desktop. </p>",mattison_moz,false,0,0

Here’s what you can try: </p><p>Go to your Yahoo account Security settings and enable “Allow apps that use less secure sign-in” (if available). </p><p>If you have 2-step verification enabled, generate an App Password specifically for Thunderbird and use that instead of your regular Yahoo password. </p><p>Make sure Thunderbird is fully updated, and choose OAuth2 as the authentication method when adding your account. </p><p>This approach is similar to how reliable workflows are crucial in other fields — for example, in <a href=""https://myapparelmanufacturer.com/photography-service"" rel=""nofollow"">styled shots for clothing brand</a> , using proper credentials and verified processes ensures smooth and error-free operations. </p>",ryan.mitchell1184,true,0,0

For other e-mail accounts, I did not.  I do not know why it varied from one e-mail coount to another. </p><p>For any yahoo e-mail programmers/managers that might see this, this thread's issue has me seriously concerned.  Not only did I have trouble adding a yahoo account to Thunderbird on a new desktop, I was also blocked logging into my yahoo e-mail in a browser on the new desktop.  If I had only one desktop and no other way of accessing e-mail, and the desktop suddenly failed, I'd get a new desktop.  But then how would I access my yahoo e-mail?  A change in e-mail client or operating system, or even hardware, would totally block me.  Security is very important.  But it can be taken too far. </p><p>Ed: I thank you for your replies.
