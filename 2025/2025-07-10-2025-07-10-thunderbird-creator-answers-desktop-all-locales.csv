Normally, when I double click to open an e-mail saved into the shared folder, the e-mail will open in Thunderbird and I can click reply, forward, etc.  However, since June 17, 2025, whenever I open these e-mails saved in the shared folder, only the subject of the email and two rows of menu bars (i.e., File, Edit, View, Get Messages, Write, Tag, etc.) appear, but the contents of the e-mail do not, including sender information.  I've attached a screenshot so you can see what I mean (ignore the black background which I have set).  Even though I can click ""Messages"" --&gt; ""Reply"" in the menu bar, the composition window that pops up does not show any details of the e-mail I am responding to.  However, if I transfer the e-mail file from the shared folder on the internal server to anywhere in my computer, say, the Desktop, the file will open normally in Thunderbird and display all contents normally.  Would appreciate it if anyone could help me figure out how to solve this problem.  My colleagues and I all need access to these e-mails saved in the shared folder so we can't keep saving them on to our computers.

Running TB 128.12.0esr (32-bit) on a 64-bit Win10 PC. </p><p>Earlier today, Thunderbird stopped sending or receiving via my main account, on an Earthlink-hosted domain that I own. Turned out that I can still send from accounts on two other domains, one a shared-hosting domain that I own; the other is Verizon/AOL. But I cannot seem to download from any of the three domains. </p><p>I checked all the SMTP and POP settings, which worked a few hours ago and have not changed. Restarted Thunderbird several times, inlcusing in safe mode, and rebooted the PC twice. Clicking ""Get Messages"" - globally or by account - does nothing. The thin blue ""working"" bar at lower right keeps scrolling, even if I press the Stop button. </p><p>I would prefer not to mess around with setting up new profiles and all.
