I can’t remember how – and can’t duplicate it.  </p><p>Yes, I know there’s an “extension” to do this, but if I did it only with TB 115.10 – why deal with the paranoia of permissions (must have access to everything)? </p><p>I need to “move” about 4000 emails from an ancient ISP (still used, too) into my TB 115.10 e-client – to then move to ”Folders” and then archive off-line. I can download emails (to my folder) from the ISP only individually as .EML files – and did get one successfully into TB (it reads [looks about the same] as an email “retrieved” by TB). </p><p>I can only “download” individual ISP emails (their rules, programming) so, hoping to set up a macro to “download” about 100 per day. My ISP inbox is almost full every day with new emails that must be deleted or “moved” due to new emails arriving every day. </p><p>Any ideas – or better still step by step suggestions?  </p><p>Responses in Spanish are fine – French or Portuguese workable. </p><p>Dru DruPub@OneImageDru.com </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",DruPub

Normally, when I double click to open an e-mail saved into the shared folder, the e-mail will open in Thunderbird and I can click reply, forward, etc.  However, since June 17, 2025, whenever I open these e-mails saved in the shared folder, only the subject of the email and two rows of menu bars (i.e., File, Edit, View, Get Messages, Write, Tag, etc.) appear, but the contents of the e-mail do not, including sender information.  I've attached a screenshot so you can see what I mean (ignore the black background which I have set).  Even though I can click ""Messages"" --&gt; ""Reply"" in the menu bar, the composition window that pops up does not show any details of the e-mail I am responding to.  However, if I transfer the e-mail file from the shared folder on the internal server to anywhere in my computer, say, the Desktop, the file will open normally in Thunderbird and display all contents normally.  Would appreciate it if anyone could help me figure out how to solve this problem.  My colleagues and I all need access to these e-mails saved in the shared folder so we can't keep saving them on to our computers.  Thanks so much! </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",inmeng.c.wong
