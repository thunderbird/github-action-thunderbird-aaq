Date modified: 7/1/2025 6:54 PM If I press the Skip option the file backup proceeds normally with the remainder of the files in Profile. This started about 3 months ago -- previously all files in Profile  backed up without a hitch. I am concerned that I am not getting a full backup. Please help!!

In synchronization settings, I don't see the ""Spam"" folder of AOL, and in fact when I subscribe or check Synchronization &amp; Storage I don't see the simple ""Spam"" folder that is on AOL.  I don't have ANY filters active in my AOL account in Thunderbird or directly on AOL.    I've been using AOL since its inception, and Thunderbird for as long as I can remember as well.  I'm not sure when the folder structure of my AOL account on Thundbird changed, probably a couple of years ago.  It's not a huge thing, but I'm thinking that if not resolved it could turn into a huge thing. </p><p>I'd like to just have the single SPAM folder under my AOL account in Thunderbird just like it is on AOL.  No need for it to be split into Bulk and Trash. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",miles9
