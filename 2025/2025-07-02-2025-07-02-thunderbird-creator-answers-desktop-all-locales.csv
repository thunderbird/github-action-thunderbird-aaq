In synchronization settings, I don't see the ""Spam"" folder of AOL, and in fact when I subscribe or check Synchronization &amp; Storage I don't see the simple ""Spam"" folder that is on AOL.  I don't have ANY filters active in my AOL account in Thunderbird or directly on AOL.    I've been using AOL since its inception, and Thunderbird for as long as I can remember as well.  I'm not sure when the folder structure of my AOL account on Thundbird changed, probably a couple of years ago.  It's not a huge thing, but I'm thinking that if not resolved it could turn into a huge thing. </p><p>I'd like to just have the single SPAM folder under my AOL account in Thunderbird just like it is on AOL.

I accidentally deleted an old message and I quickly realized my error and went to the account's trash folder to recover it, but the act of opening up the trash folder seemed to trigger an automated deletion of old messages (at least that's what it looked like it was doing - maybe I'm wrong).  In any case, the message is not in the trash folder, so it appears it was just deleted because of the age of the message. I'm wondering if there's some way to have the trash folder not delete messages based solely on their creation date, but also on the date they were moved to the trash folder.  In other words, two conditions must be met.  They must have been deleted x number of days ago, and they must have a certain age (based on the creation date).  This way even a very old message would be available for a certain period. </p><p>I read a couple of articles about how trash deletion is handled, and I'm a little confused.  For each of my three accounts, when I right click the TRASH folder, then click on PROPERTIES, and then click on RETENTION POLICY, ""Use my account settings."" is checked.  That seems fine, but I'm not sure where the retention policy is established for the account.  If I right click on the account name, and then click on SERVER SETTINGS, I see a ""When I delete a message"" heading.  In my case the option checked is ""Move it to this folder"" and the folder is the trash folder.  The MESSAGE STORAGE section has nothing checked.   </p><p>Am I missing something?  Is there a place where I can specify how long something must be kept in trash before it's deleted? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1746171;,tcluster

Almost all of my email goes to the Junk folder, including that from whitelisted senders. All of my individual spam filters and my whitelist are set to act when email is received, but I have to run the whitelist manually to get it to work (sometimes more than once). The only way I can get things into the Trash folder is to put them there manually, as TB apparently has forgotten everything it learned about my email preferences. I did take the opportunity to update my Whitelist (though to no avail), so I guess I'm sort of glad that I was goaded into doing so. But it hasn't helped. </p><p>As of tonight, I can't write or reply to an email or edit an email draft because TB locks up while it is ""Copying messages to Drafts..."" I've had to close TB ten or twelve times, and I've not been given the opportunity to make a bug comment during the closing routine. </p><p>I have emptied the TB cache in hopes that doing so would clear up these issues. Though that works well in Firefox, it didn't help with these problems. </p><p>I also am not too happy about the disappearance of the File Edit ... folder bar and its being replaced with a hamburger drop-down menu at the upper right, but at least it will suffice once I've unlearned almost thirty years of doing things a certain way. </p><p>I really don't want to stop using Thunderbird. I like the program, and I'd hate to have wasted the two solid weeks it took to get Yahoo! Mail to acknowledge its existence and let me connect to their service, which I did under duress.
