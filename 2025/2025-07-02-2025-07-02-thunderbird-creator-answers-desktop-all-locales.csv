I accidentally deleted an old message and I quickly realized my error and went to the account's trash folder to recover it, but the act of opening up the trash folder seemed to trigger an automated deletion of old messages (at least that's what it looked like it was doing - maybe I'm wrong).  In any case, the message is not in the trash folder, so it appears it was just deleted because of the age of the message. I'm wondering if there's some way to have the trash folder not delete messages based solely on their creation date, but also on the date they were moved to the trash folder.  In other words, two conditions must be met.  They must have been deleted x number of days ago, and they must have a certain age (based on the creation date).  This way even a very old message would be available for a certain period. </p><p>I read a couple of articles about how trash deletion is handled, and I'm a little confused.  For each of my three accounts, when I right click the TRASH folder, then click on PROPERTIES, and then click on RETENTION POLICY, ""Use my account settings."" is checked.  That seems fine, but I'm not sure where the retention policy is established for the account.  If I right click on the account name, and then click on SERVER SETTINGS, I see a ""When I delete a message"" heading.  In my case the option checked is ""Move it to this folder"" and the folder is the trash folder.  The MESSAGE STORAGE section has nothing checked.   </p><p>Am I missing something?  Is there a place where I can specify how long something must be kept in trash before it's deleted? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1746171;,tcluster

Almost all of my email goes to the Junk folder, including that from whitelisted senders. All of my individual spam filters and my whitelist are set to act when email is received, but I have to run the whitelist manually to get it to work (sometimes more than once). The only way I can get things into the Trash folder is to put them there manually, as TB apparently has forgotten everything it learned about my email preferences. I did take the opportunity to update my Whitelist (though to no avail), so I guess I'm sort of glad that I was goaded into doing so. But it hasn't helped. </p><p>As of tonight, I can't write or reply to an email or edit an email draft because TB locks up while it is ""Copying messages to Drafts..."" I've had to close TB ten or twelve times, and I've not been given the opportunity to make a bug comment during the closing routine. </p><p>I have emptied the TB cache in hopes that doing so would clear up these issues. Though that works well in Firefox, it didn't help with these problems. </p><p>I also am not too happy about the disappearance of the File Edit ... folder bar and its being replaced with a hamburger drop-down menu at the upper right, but at least it will suffice once I've unlearned almost thirty years of doing things a certain way. </p><p>I really don't want to stop using Thunderbird. I like the program, and I'd hate to have wasted the two solid weeks it took to get Yahoo! Mail to acknowledge its existence and let me connect to their service, which I did under duress.

Yesterday the one account wasn't transferring over from yahoo so I deleted it and then reinitiated it (POP server setting).  I've done this before with another email address I have and it worked, but things must have been set up differently this time as it no longer showed any of my older emails (apparently only showed what was still present at Yahoo's site).  My understanding is that my old emails would still be saved on my computer (Windows 10), and I went through the steps on Thunderbird to get to where the stuff is on my computer but when I open any of what appear to be the stored emails, everything is coded in such a way that it's near impossible to read.  I'm hoping I can somehow transfer them back to Thunderbird somewhere or, if not, open the file so I can at least read them easily.  The Local Folders file that's currently on Thunderbird for some reason has stuff from another email address I have (I believe that one is imap and not POP).  I'm very uncomputer savvy, so any help I can get would be greatly appreciated so I don't mess things up more.

It's widely known that the results are...inconsistent, to put it charitably. Nevertheless... </p><p>I keep vast quantities of messages in local folders. For some of those folders, I manually archive the contents annually, by creating a new folder with the name of the year (""2025""), then dragging messages from the existing folder to the new folder. This sometimes works. More often than not though, it fails in one way or another. Sometimes I drag them across, a handful of them show up in the new folder, but then the rest just sit there in the old folder, in selected state, but with no activity taking place. Sometimes merely selecting smaller 'chunks' of messages to drag across will work. In others, such as last night, even that didn't work. </p><p>I then invoked 'Repair Folder' in a vain attempt at recovery; sometimes that will clear the issue. However, when I did this, what happened is that the chunk of messages that were selected wound up having all their date fields (in the display) reset to near the epoch - January 20, 1970.
