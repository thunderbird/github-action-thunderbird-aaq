Date modified: 7/1/2025 6:54 PM If I press the Skip option the file backup proceeds normally with the remainder of the files in Profile. This started about 3 months ago -- previously all files in Profile  backed up without a hitch. I am concerned that I am not getting a full backup. Please help!!

In synchronization settings, I don't see the ""Spam"" folder of AOL, and in fact when I subscribe or check Synchronization &amp; Storage I don't see the simple ""Spam"" folder that is on AOL.  I don't have ANY filters active in my AOL account in Thunderbird or directly on AOL.    I've been using AOL since its inception, and Thunderbird for as long as I can remember as well.  I'm not sure when the folder structure of my AOL account on Thundbird changed, probably a couple of years ago.  It's not a huge thing, but I'm thinking that if not resolved it could turn into a huge thing. </p><p>I'd like to just have the single SPAM folder under my AOL account in Thunderbird just like it is on AOL.  No need for it to be split into Bulk and Trash. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",miles9

I accidentally deleted an old message and I quickly realized my error and went to the account's trash folder to recover it, but the act of opening up the trash folder seemed to trigger an automated deletion of old messages (at least that's what it looked like it was doing - maybe I'm wrong).  In any case, the message is not in the trash folder, so it appears it was just deleted because of the age of the message. I'm wondering if there's some way to have the trash folder not delete messages based solely on their creation date, but also on the date they were moved to the trash folder.  In other words, two conditions must be met.  They must have been deleted x number of days ago, and they must have a certain age (based on the creation date).  This way even a very old message would be available for a certain period. </p><p>I read a couple of articles about how trash deletion is handled, and I'm a little confused.  For each of my three accounts, when I right click the TRASH folder, then click on PROPERTIES, and then click on RETENTION POLICY, ""Use my account settings."" is checked.  That seems fine, but I'm not sure where the retention policy is established for the account.  If I right click on the account name, and then click on SERVER SETTINGS, I see a ""When I delete a message"" heading.  In my case the option checked is ""Move it to this folder"" and the folder is the trash folder.  The MESSAGE STORAGE section has nothing checked.   </p><p>Am I missing something?  Is there a place where I can specify how long something must be kept in trash before it's deleted? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",tcluster
