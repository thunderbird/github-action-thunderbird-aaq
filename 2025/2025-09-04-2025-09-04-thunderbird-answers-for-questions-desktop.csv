If so, whatever is still on PC may be just remnants (headers without content), as the full messages would be on the now unavailable server. If the old account was POP, all messages can be copied by exiting thunderbird and copying from within profile folder under the Mail\&lt;POPaccount&gt; folder. My guess is that your account was IMAP, in which case you may not be able to salvage all messages due to the server switch. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If an IMAP account attempts to open but the server isn't there, the content on PC is stripped as that is part of syncing to server. That isn't Thunderbird, it's IMAP. If you think some of the folders have content, your only way to salvage is to exit thunderbird and copy with windows file explorer and place in the Mail\Local Folders folder, restart thunderbird and then check for content. Attempting to check from within a nonexistent IMAP account may cause whatever is there to be deleted. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
