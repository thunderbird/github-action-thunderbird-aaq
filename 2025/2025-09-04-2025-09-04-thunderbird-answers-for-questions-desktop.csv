That's unfortunate, but I just tested this after setting up my Android client and you seem to be correct; when I removed a piece of email from my Android Thunderbird client Inbox and synced with the server, the Android client deleted it from the server. That is unfortunate, because it means that I cannot use ""Trash"" as a temporary repository for items that I want to keep while also using it to delete the messages I don't want to keep. It seems much more rational to me to regard deletion from Trash as the trigger for a server deletion, rather than removal from Inbox. </p><p>I'm looking at the Android version and I don't see a way to create a set of user folders. I was hoping to create a user folder for temporary storage of desired emails that would not be deleted from the server, thereby allowing me to clear my Inbox for uncluttered viewing of new incoming emails. My thought was that I could move emails from my Inbox to this temporary folder without deleting them from the server, while eliminating unwanted emails from the server by putting them in Trash. But since there seems to be no way to create a user folder, this option seems unavailable. </p><p>Generally it seems to me that POP3 email clients could very easily provide specific options for exactly when emails should be deleted from the server. But it seems that the makers of almost all clients feel that users have no need of anything other than a vague and general notion that emails do or don't get upon fetching of the email or upon removal from the Inbox; there seems to be no conception that users might be using multiple instances of their clients in situations like mine. </p>",daveziffer,false,0,0

I uninstalled it and let my subscription lapse. </p><p>Let me translate that interesting bit of marketing lies. </p><p>Thunderbird does not trust the self signed encryption certificate used by Norton.   Legitimate server operators pay for a legitimate certificate from a certified CA.  See this Wikipedia article <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority</a> </p><p>Thunderbird uses certificates issued by trusted certifying authorities. Becoming a public Certificate Authority (CA), you must establish a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that meets strict security and policy requirements, including technical infrastructure, physical security, and operational procedures. You will then need to apply to web browser and operating system developers for inclusion in their trusted root store, a process that requires individual applications and adherence to browser-specific programs.  </p><p>Norton have not done that, so users are required to manually suborn the entire trust network created to validate encryption certificate as legitimate and manually add Norton as a certifying authority.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with doing that if you implicitly trust Norton.  But remember that are a company incorporated where? They are co-headquartered in both Prague, Czech Republic (EU) and Tempe, Arizona (USA).   So I guess by implication you are also trusting both governments not to require release of your information as well.  There is much talk about Chinese companies and personal information,  the reality is all national governments can compel companies under their jurisdiction to release just about anything.  It is only a matter of making a law. </p><p>I use windows defender and it does not scan mail thus neatly side stepping the issues of encrypted connections.  But Microsoft can issue their own certificates and do not meddle in mail. This is something I find interesting really, that those that already can don't choose not to, yet those that do not have the authority are seeking ways to do so. </p><p>BTW instead of taking photos on a device that results in something that appear on it's side and is very hard to read you might want to consider using screen shots instead. </p><p>See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem#w_create-a-screenshot-on-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem#w_create-a-screenshot-on-windows</a>  you will need to ignore the Firefox screenshot information,  but the use of the print screen keyboard button is not application specific. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Note:  you can NOT take a screenshot of the popup nor can someone remotely accessing your computer see it.  I know that Norton sometimes makes it impossible to see their popups, which is why a photo taken from a phone is the only way to show the popup to someone.  I spent hours on Norton's tech support and they have currently given this to their senior tech team to  investigate.  I'm waiting for a response.  The ""Resolve"" button does nothing.
