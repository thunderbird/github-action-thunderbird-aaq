Set up Thunderbird program as 'allowed' so nothing gets blocked. Confirm Thunderbird is set up as allowed program. </p><p><strong>VPN:</strong> Check computer for a VPN. Some Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and I have come across some peopl who did not realise one had been enabled. Switch off VPN (or create  split tunnelling and set it up for Thunderbird to use).  Gmail does not like VPN as it atempts to hide your IP address, so gmail decides you might be hacker so it auto blocks access. Confirm VPN is switched off </p><p><strong>Password:</strong> Logon to webmail account via a browser to see emails.
