Actually, in my case, the issue is more noticeable: I normally have TB open in background - sometimes everything's fine, and the battery goes down as normal, while sometimes instead the battery drops quickly, and checking in the Mac activity monitor I can see that the CPU usage of TB is totally abnormal.   3. When this happens, I can actually see the activity bar in TB being live (bottom right corner, as it happens when TB is checking for new mails), but never disappearing. When I notice it, I just reboot TB, and the bar shuts off as normal after a quick mail check.   4. Yes I have a huge mail archive, but the problem is not the standard management of this database: basically it seems that every now and then, TB decides to run some activity which it gets stuck in, and this kills the CPU.

Version number: 140.5.0esr / MacOS 26.1 Screenshot of the bar attached: the blue bar in bottom right corner appears normally only when downloading new email or compacting, but with this issue it stays there. Tools&gt; active manager only shows the last mailboxes that have been checked, but there’s no live activity. If I clear the list, it stays empty until next mailbox check. With blue bar on, the memory used by TB is 1.59GB now. Not sure if this changes over time. Number of messages: around 22.000 spread over 5 accounts, plus roughly 90.000 in a number of archived mailboxes in the local directory. Both live and local mail directories are not in the default location but directly into the home of MacOS.  </p><p>I have the feeling that the issue is triggered by an automatic mailbox compacting action which is somehow unfinished and stays pending for ages. I’ll try to record a performance profile as you asked, but since there’s no obvious way to trigger the issue, I’ll have to catch it. I just relaunched TB now, and everything’s fine so the performance profile would be useless I guess. </p>",maXsc,false,0,0

One of the primary reasons things ""just work"" on Outlook is it opts for minimum security.  Thunderbird opts for maximum, and the inconveniences that6 go along with that. </p><p>This error message you posted to this forum is clear.  You can't use SSL/TLS with this server name because a valid certificate can not be obtained from the server to encrypt the connection.  No amount of ""it works with Outlook"" will change that fact. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-11-29-09-11-56-c4ca42.png""> </p><p>I looked at your providers web site  but found exactly zero relevant details posted.  Google offers settings on the support pages of just about every mail client,  but the provider that determines what settings work does not publish them publicly.  handy for the rest of us,  good thing they have loyal paying customers to support their hubris. </p><p>What I do see from these settings you posted is you are connecting on Port 587. Port 587 is the standard, recommended port for sending email (SMTP submission) because it requires authentication and uses STARTTLS encryption to secure the connection.   However a valid certificate can not be obtained from the server so by definition is can not work.   </p><p>I tried testing the server on that port. <a href=""https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/optimum.net/ympAPJkt/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/optimum.net/ympAPJkt/</a>  The test failed as the server was not accepting connections on that port, or port 465 which is an unencrypted connection. This usually means you live in the USA where providers routinely restrict you to sending mail only if you are connected using their service.  My experience so far with this is this only happens in the USA.  The recent explosion in the popularity of VPNs leads to issues where the mail server refuses to allow you to send mail as you are not connected with the ISP's service,  but with the VPN.  So I am guessing you have a shiny new VPN and your provider is refusing to play. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Windows limits the length of a path to 260 characters approx.  My guess is your folder structures is so deep that the copy fails because the path is just to long.  Especially if you allow for the fact many profiles start somewhere around 80 of those characters from the root of the C: drive. </p><p>The error however can simply mean you do not have write access to the relevant disk area either through file contention(Your anti virus is often a culprit for this problem) or the drive being full so the error is that there is no space to the file and it bubbles up as a file length issue.  This is a relatively generic JavaScript error.  So google can help with ideas as to the cause and I do not mean just as it relates to Thunderbird. </p><p>You might also want to check your new installation does not have the system integration to allow Windows search to search mails allowed as that adds another duplicate layer of mail in lower down the folder tree.
