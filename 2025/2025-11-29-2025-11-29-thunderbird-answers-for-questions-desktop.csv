It leads nowhere... the reply to an attempt to sign in says there's no such thing - ""it's not copacetic""... in other words it doesn't work... -&gt; the notice is fake or redundant - a remnant of the dismissed gmail. So if you have some positive ideas as to how to get rid of this annoyance, please let me know.  I am considering re-installing my Tbird entirely - or finding another email client. (and yes, I can access my gmail account online with no problems!)  I do not want my Tbird account IN my Gmail either! .(..gmail to Tbird is ok, but the reverse is not.) Thanks!

The next page of the authorization flow will show what exactly you are asking Thunderbird to access. </p><p>It is that simple.  Google have set the oAuth protocol to be the authentication method to get mail, contacts and calendars and that screen is requesting you sign into Google to provide authentication to Google for Thunderbird to have access to your data for the purpose of doing it's job.  The next page of the flow indicated exactly what data is to be accessed. </p><p>I would guess you have syncronised contact or calendars if you have removed the email,  but all I can do is guess. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

What others have said in similar situations may be helpful. </p><p>You removed your gmail account, but, as you said, there may be a remnant. Some people have said that the remnant may be your calendar. It may be that you have done what is needed to prevent Thunderbird from dealing with e-mail messages in your gmail account, but another step is needed to remove all gmail access to your calendar. I'm sorry that I don't know what that step is. You may find it by searching this forum.

Interestingly enough, I never used my Gmail calendar... and the page that keeps loading in tbird is not associated with a calendar darn it...   I'm just back from Major Geeks and Timothy doesn't have any idea either.  Eventually I will just uninstall my tbird and reinstall as a new email client. This drop-in doodad isn't so bothersome that I absolutely need to get rid of it... It disappears if I zap it in the tray. My other thought was it might be a trojan/virus, etc... Norton doesn't notice it though... <em><strong>Thank you and christ1 for trying to help me out. </strong></em> Btw - I'm 81... might give you a sense of worth knowing you've been helping out a senior who began on an IBM PC Junior circa 1980's!

Windows limits the length of a path to 260 characters approx.  My guess is your folder structures is so deep that the copy fails because the path is just to long.  Especially if you allow for the fact many profiles start somewhere around 80 of those characters from the root of the C: drive. </p><p>The error however can simply mean you do not have write access to the relevant disk area either through file contention(Your anti virus is often a culprit for this problem) or the drive being full so the error is that there is no space to the file and it bubbles up as a file length issue.  This is a relatively generic JavaScript error.  So google can help with ideas as to the cause and I do not mean just as it relates to Thunderbird. </p><p>You might also want to check your new installation does not have the system integration to allow Windows search to search mails allowed as that adds another duplicate layer of mail in lower down the folder tree.  Mozmsgs folders with mozeml files. Individual file names are based on the email subject and are a prime source of the path becoming to long. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
