One of the primary reasons things ""just work"" on Outlook is it opts for minimum security.  Thunderbird opts for maximum, and the inconveniences that6 go along with that. </p><p>This error message you posted to this forum is clear.  You can't use SSL/TLS with this server name because a valid certificate can not be obtained from the server to encrypt the connection.  No amount of ""it works with Outlook"" will change that fact. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-11-29-09-11-56-c4ca42.png""> </p><p>I looked at your providers web site  but found exactly zero relevant details posted.  Google offers settings on the support pages of just about every mail client,  but the provider that determines what settings work does not publish them publicly.  handy for the rest of us,  good thing they have loyal paying customers to support their hubris. </p><p>What I do see from these settings you posted is you are connecting on Port 587. Port 587 is the standard, recommended port for sending email (SMTP submission) because it requires authentication and uses STARTTLS encryption to secure the connection.   However a valid certificate can not be obtained from the server so by definition is can not work.   </p><p>I tried testing the server on that port. <a href=""https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/optimum.net/ympAPJkt/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/optimum.net/ympAPJkt/</a>  The test failed as the server was not accepting connections on that port, or port 465 which is an unencrypted connection. This usually means you live in the USA where providers routinely restrict you to sending mail only if you are connected using their service.  My experience so far with this is this only happens in the USA.  The recent explosion in the popularity of VPNs leads to issues where the mail server refuses to allow you to send mail as you are not connected with the ISP's service,  but with the VPN.  So I am guessing you have a shiny new VPN and your provider is refusing to play. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Especially if you allow for the fact many profiles start somewhere around 80 of those characters from the root of the C: drive. </p><p>The error however can simply mean you do not have write access to the relevant disk area either through file contention(Your anti virus is often a culprit for this problem) or the drive being full so the error is that there is no space to the file and it bubbles up as a file length issue.  This is a relatively generic JavaScript error.  So google can help with ideas as to the cause and I do not mean just as it relates to Thunderbird. </p><p>You might also want to check your new installation does not have the system integration to allow Windows search to search mails allowed as that adds another duplicate layer of mail in lower down the folder tree.  Mozmsgs folders with mozeml files. Individual file names are based on the email subject and are a prime source of the path becoming to long. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
