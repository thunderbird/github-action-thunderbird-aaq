This has kept happening for a long time now actually, surviving through at least two Mac OS updates, and a huge number of TB updates.   1. Everything's up to date. I tried to follow this: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269944"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269944</a> and this:  2. <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems?_gl=1*86dj4d*_ga*MTkzNzQ0MjA3MS4xNzYyOTY4OTMx*_ga_2VC139B3XV*czE3NjMzMTM3NDckbzIkZzAkdDE3NjMzMTM3NDckajYwJGwwJGgw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems?_gl=1*86dj4d*_ga*MTkzNzQ0MjA3MS4xNzYyOTY4OTMx*_ga_2VC139B3XV*czE3NjMzMTM3NDckbzIkZzAkdDE3NjMzMTM3NDckajYwJGwwJGgw</a> but didn't succeed. Actually, in my case, the issue is more noticeable: I normally have TB open in background - sometimes everything's fine, and the battery goes down as normal, while sometimes instead the battery drops quickly, and checking in the Mac activity monitor I can see that the CPU usage of TB is totally abnormal.   3. When this happens, I can actually see the activity bar in TB being live (bottom right corner, as it happens when TB is checking for new mails), but never disappearing. When I notice it, I just reboot TB, and the bar shuts off as normal after a quick mail check.   4. Yes I have a huge mail archive, but the problem is not the standard management of this database: basically it seems that every now and then, TB decides to run some activity which it gets stuck in, and this kills the CPU.  Thank you in advance for your help! </blockquote> <p>1. Version number please. </p><p>2. Thanks for going through the wiki. But you seem to have missed the last step - a performance profile. </p><p>3. I think you mean the status bar, which has a progress graph or bar?  I've never seen it in the bottom right - can you make a screen shot?  And check Tools &gt; activity manager for what might be happening. Also, how much memory is being used by Thunderbird? </p><p>4. Numbers please rather than words, in this case how many messages in your system? </p><p>Thanks </p>",wsmwk,false,0,0
