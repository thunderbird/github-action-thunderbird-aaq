When you copy/paste into Thunderbird, it's impossible for Thunderbird to have all the necessary code because it is Microsoft specific, so you discover it does not look exactly the same as seen in an Excel document.  It looks ok in 'Outlook' because that is owned by Microsoft. Microsoft are not going to let any other software have complete access to all it's code.  </p><p>If you copy anything even normal text from a Microsoft document it bloats the email with a load of unuseable code.  It's also the same if copying anything from a webpage - it copies more than just the text - it copies all the html formatting as well. This can sometimes be an issue when copy pasting images because they may include remote content. So if copying then you need to use 'Edit' &gt; 'Paste without formatting'.  </p><p>That's why email clients also have the ability to attach files such as the excel file document. This means the recipient can then use Excel on their computer to open and read the document exactly as you intended. Some people do not have Microsoft products installed but use eg: OpenOffice to read those documents. OpenOffice and LibreOffice are pretty good, but are not always a 100% accurate for same reasons - they have to interpret the microsoft code to best ability.  </p><p>Another alternative as good workaround the issue: If you really need the recipient to see what you have created in Excel but they only need to read it -  make the excel document full screen and take a screenshot. Then save it as a jpg image. That image jpeg file can be inserted into an email content inline or attached. REcipient will then see exactly what you see and they will not need any specific software other than any software that displays images. </p><p>Hope this info helps you. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

When I interrogated the provider, Zoho Mail the l;ady did find a disabled box about SENT copies which she enabled and I sent my self an email and it worked. I think I have solved the problem, but I do not have vital email copies since the 24th. Might they be ona TB server? Thanks so much for paying attention. Kind regards,  ianto </p>",ianto7,false,0,0

SMTP refers to the outgoing server. Outgoing servers are all of the same type (SMTP), so there is no need to ask that. POP/IMAP refers to the type of incoming server, which determines how mail for that account is managed by Thunderbird. </p><p>Check the following articles, and see whether that allows you to answer the questions I asked in my previous post, or maybe even figure how to solve the problem by yourself: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/difference-between-imap-and-pop3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/difference-between-imap-and-pop3</a> </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/configuration-options-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/configuration-options-accounts</a> </p>",DavidGG,false,2,0
