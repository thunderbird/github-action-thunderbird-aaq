I'd have to click the Thunderbird menu and quit in order to access the program and my e-mail. </p><p>In any case, the problem was quite clearly related to a conflict in new message notifications, by the fact that: 1) It happened only when the first new message came in after starting Thunderbird 2) The problem did not go away when I turned off notifications for Thunderbird through the Mac system settings (as seen in your screen shot) 3) It stopped happening only when I set display message notifications to false in Thunderbird's configuration editor </p><p>More than the above, I can't comment on, since I am a Mac newbie. </p><p>Fortunately, I don't use a Mac address book, so one less bug to face. </p>",larry171,false,0,0

When you copy/paste into Thunderbird, it's impossible for Thunderbird to have all the necessary code because it is Microsoft specific, so you discover it does not look exactly the same as seen in an Excel document.  It looks ok in 'Outlook' because that is owned by Microsoft. Microsoft are not going to let any other software have complete access to all it's code.  </p><p>If you copy anything even normal text from a Microsoft document it bloats the email with a load of unuseable code.  It's also the same if copying anything from a webpage - it copies more than just the text - it copies all the html formatting as well. This can sometimes be an issue when copy pasting images because they may include remote content. So if copying then you need to use 'Edit' &gt; 'Paste without formatting'.  </p><p>That's why email clients also have the ability to attach files such as the excel file document. This means the recipient can then use Excel on their computer to open and read the document exactly as you intended. Some people do not have Microsoft products installed but use eg: OpenOffice to read those documents. OpenOffice and LibreOffice are pretty good, but are not always a 100% accurate for same reasons - they have to interpret the microsoft code to best ability.  </p><p>Another alternative as good workaround the issue: If you really need the recipient to see what you have created in Excel but they only need to read it -  make the excel document full screen and take a screenshot. Then save it as a jpg image. That image jpeg file can be inserted into an email content inline or attached. REcipient will then see exactly what you see and they will not need any specific software other than any software that displays images. </p><p>Hope this info helps you. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

The first time it happened, I thought it could have been a huge mistake trying the ""symlink"" idea and I'd corrupted my profile. But I exited TBird, restarted it and discovered that everything was restored in the UI. Even the operation I did (message deletion, move, etc.) when the UI seemed to ""lose everything"" had been successfully performed. It seems that after the operation the UI doesn't update successfully and creates a scary, but harmless, result. </p><p>This has only happened 2 or 3 times over the past few days. And each time it's happened everything was restored in the UI by just closing and restarting Tbird, but it's enough of an annoyance that I'll probably abandon using the symlinks. And since this seems to me to be an indication that using symlinks is somehow causing Tbird to act unstable or ""flaky"" leaves me concerned that something more consequential could occur in the future.

My C: (system drive where the AppData directory is located) is an M.2 NVMe SSD. The D: drive where I moved the profile files is a SATA spinner with a much slower transfer rate. Just a wild guess, but maybe it could be a race condition in the code when the compacting operation occurs? </p><p>One thing I'm going to try before switching to doing the ""profile manager"" method is to just move back the ""profile"" directory under AppData\Local -- which apparently wasn't necessary to move in the first place. After that, I'll see if the problem still occurs over the next few days. If that stops the issue, I'm all set. </p><p>I think while I'm changing things anyway, I'm going to make one other modification. I should have created the symlink one level higher in the directory tree. Have ...\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird contain a symlink pointing to a ""Profiles"" directory in D:\. That way if, in the future, any new profiles are created they'll go into the directory on D. The way I did it up to now, I just moved a specific profile directory to D, but any new ones will get created on C. When I first did this, it was just a quickie thing and I didn't spend a lot of time thinking it through. </p><p>If after the changes, I still have the annoyance of the occasional blanking out of the folder contents until I restart Tbird, then I'll just blow away the remaining symlink and try the ""profile manager"" route. </p>",sbear45,false,0,0
