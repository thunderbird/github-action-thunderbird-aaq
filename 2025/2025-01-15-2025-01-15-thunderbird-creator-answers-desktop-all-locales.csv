Even though TB was lightning fast for years before this slowness epidemic started, I decided to fiddle with settings. I tried various things that seemed logical, but had no success until I changed the ""Connection Security"" in ""Server Settings"" for all my accounts from SSL/TLS to STARTTLS. My guess is that the TB devs have changed the way it communicates with mail servers about security and some can't deal with it quickly enough!  </p><p>Your mileage will likely vary, so make a note of your settings before changing anything and only ever change one type of setting at a time in only one account before doing a test. I hope this helps at least some users and reduces their frustration. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Jay.Dear
