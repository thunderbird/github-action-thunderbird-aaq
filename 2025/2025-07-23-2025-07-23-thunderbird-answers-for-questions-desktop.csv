Was that just the exe, or did it include the profile? Where was the profile stored? On the default drive c in the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder?  I ask that because when thunderbird starts, it immediately attempts to open the profiles.ini (text file) in the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder to retrieve the name and location of the default profile. If thunderbird is stating it can't find the profile, what that means is that it either can't find the profiles.ini file or the folder being pointed to has been moved. If thunderbird is finding the profiles.ini, it's easy to edit the file to point to the desired profile.

That is the folder I moved (on the D: drive) into the new folder (on same D: drive). </p><p>Everything was originally loaded up ""as is"", and never altered.  Which leads to your 2nd question, the profile was in it's default location as you mentioned c: drive in the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder, as I have never altered that in any way.  I can see my original ported file there, dated to the day I moved it (in 2023). </p><p>I agree with you it cannot find the profiles.ini that I need it to.  The question for me is, is the profile.ini (the original one I ported over to my new computer), is that the profile that Thunderbird updates that folder over and over, but keeps the modified date as the original port over date? Or should there be a profile with a more current date, like as of yesterday when I was using Thunderbird before I moved the folder, I'm thinking it would have a 7/22/2025 date. </p><p>The current app data profile folder still has that original port date profile; but, I was thinking there should be a more recent profile date (like current day). There was a profile in there from yesterday (I know this because of the time created), but it's the one that was made when I moved the folder, and the one Thunderbird used to start itself, which was the set up menu for un/passwrd/setup.  So I inferred that wasn't right.  I know I need the profile I was using before that 6 pm profile. </p><p>Nothing else has been touched (other than me deleting that one profile that was 10:30 pm yesterday, which I know is junk because I got the set up menu again).  The only thing I did was moved that main Thunderbird folder, to a new folder, on the same drive. </p><p>No changes of profiles in the app data section were touched/moved.  This is what is so puzzling to me.  If the original ported profile file (from 2023) is the correct one, that will get me back to where I was yesterday before I moved the folder, then I'm gold.   </p><p>I just don't want to fiddle with it anymore before I'm sure that's going to solve the issue. </p><p>I hope that makes sense; and again,  I really appreciate you looking at this! </p>",nutbustertwo,false,0,0

POP inbox is synchronized with my IMAP.  I don't remember when I created my 4 POP email accounts in Thunderbird.  It was long time ago.  I have had my domain name &amp; email address since 1997.  I don't remember if creating an IMAP or POP account was a choice back then.   I only recently created the an IMAP account with I got my .gmail account.  That's when I discovered that my POP accounts only have ""Folder Pane"" listings for Inbox and Trash. </p><p>My .gmail Folder Panes list; Inbox|Drafts|Sent|Junk|spam|Trash (and my other IMAP accounts) </p><p>I recently read on a forum somewhere that you cannot have a POP and IMAP account with the same email client (Thunderbird).  I created the IMAP account for my main email account just to see if it would work, and it did.  Thunderbird set it up automatically and you can choose between IMAP and POP.   That's when I started receiving spam (of course deleting them right away).  I never received spam in my main POP account before and there is no Folder Pane for it.   </p><p>This is how it works now:  When I first turn on my computer, Thunderbird automatically checks for email on all my accounts.  When I open my main IMAP account, all the messages automatically go away and move to my POP main account.  Later when Thunderbird downloads more emails they got to my IMAP account <strong>first</strong>.  If I just open the folder and view the message titles, then close the folder - in about 3 minutes all those emails automatically move to my main POP account Inbox.  Even if I go in with the IMAP account and open emails and delete them.  In a few minutes they are posted to my POP main account.  If I delete them there, they are gone. </p><p>In the POP accounts there is a setup choice of ""Leave messages on server"" with choices for a number of days or until I delete them.  That choice is not on an IMAP account. Just trying to understand how this all works.  I like getting emails First on IMAP because it is like 3-5 minutes sooner that the POP account.  I like being able to save messages in the POP accounts. The folder pane issue is just something I discovered and are curious about.   I hope you understand all my rambling.

A PC, Tablet phone etc.  It is ALL syncronised and deleting something from any of the devices will see that deletion syncronised across all connected devices. </p><p>POP was the default until a few years ago for new account.  Now it is IMAP but the defaults mean nothing.  The mail server has to support the protocol for it to work. </p><p>So how about we go back to the beginning where you tried to explain what your issue was and immediately derailed it with something about all folders.   </p><p>I see three images.  which I assume relate to your numbers.  but the description do not appear to relate to the order they appear in the message. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-22-23-42-31-c29a70.png""> </p><p>This appears to be a single account.  Rather meaningless other than to make it clear you have an Google account. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-22-23-24-12-13baa6.png""> This appears to be a fairly standard all mail view of the folder pane.  How that relates to the last image I have no idea.  but based on the appearance of only an inbox and a trash folder I would assume that these are IMAP mail account and you have lost connectivity to the relevant mail account so any server specific folders (all of them really) have been deleted pending synchronization with the server. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-22-23-22-06-66daf6.png""> This image appear to be entirely irrelevant.  Nothing but a red herring. </p><p>So the issue here is not one of viewing anything,  it is one of connecting to the mail server to get the mail.   </p><p>So lets move on to what is the error message you are being presented with when you attempt to get mail? This does not appear in isolation except in extremely rare instances.  There is either some form of error message about not being able to connect,  a login window asking you to reauthenticate (for google and any other oAuth account providers) or a request for a password, or a request for your password which keeps coming back when it is supplied.  Often I find folks these days click around these dialogs and windows get back to where they recognize and fail to understand that everything is waiting for a response from them.  Sometime they complain about popups getting in the way of them getting their mail. </p><p>There is a very high probability the problem here is your antivirus attempting top hack your encrypted connection to the mail server and simply messing it up so you get nothing.  So in addition to the error message what antivirus product are you using? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

IMAP account folders fully synchronise with server to display whatever is on server. So consider it as a mirror image of whatever you see in webmail account. Whilst you can choose to download full copies of emails, you should not consider those imap folders as totally independent copies on your compter as they can only display whatever is on server. But they can be used to create an independent backup. You can create folders and subscribe to see or not see folders on server. Advise you do not subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder as this is merely a complete duplicate of everything in all other folders. If you choose to subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder - Advise you do not delete anything from your imap 'All Mail' folder as this will delete any copy of email off the server and therefore will also get deleted from any other imap folder the email displays in.  </p><p>Gmail stores all your emails, incoming, sent and archived in the 'All Mail' folder. When you delete and put into server Trash then gmail will auto empty trash periodically and auto remove email from the 'All Mail' folder. So please be aware that gmail will auto empty Trash and Spam periodically, so do not be surprised if you see those imap folders suddenly get emptied without any intervention from you. </p><p>Pop accounts get created by Thunderbird with specific set of default folders and you can add more folders to organise emails. None of those folders synchronise with server. Pop accounts connect with server and can download whatever is in the server Inbox to Pop Inbox. </p><p>Pop account folders are totally independent copies on your computer, so it is possible to have different emails on server or even no emails on server and still have emails in the Pop account.  </p><p>The main disadvantages of a Pop account is you cannot see anything the server puts in Spam folder and anything you delete merely removes the label and archives the email in 'All Mail'. This is because Pop accounts cannot put emails into the server Trash folder. So periodically you would need to access webmail and remove old deleted emails from the 'All Mail' folder.  </p><p>If you use more than one device to see emails on server and want to see complete identical folders and emails on more than one devise/computer then IMAP is recommended. If you only use one device then Pop is perfectly ok. It's down to a personal preference. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:Can you tell me if you deleted emails on an IMAP account, are they deleted on the server&nbsp;?</em> Yes they deleted off server. If you delete an email via webmail using a browser, that email will disappear from all imap accounts on all devises that connect to that account. If you delete an email from any Imap account on any devise it will disappear off server and also disappear from all other imap accounts that connect with same account on server. </p><p>Additional info - if you use this delete method using keyboard 'Shift + Del' keys then this Deletes the message bypassing trash (no Undo!)	- in effect Gmail sees this as 'removing' a 'label' not a delete message as the email does not get put in the server Trash. So, email seems to disppear from the imap folder, but it is not deleted from the 'All Mail'. If you have a duplicate email in two imap folders eg: 'Inbox' and 'Important' you can use this method to 'delete' one of them as it only removes the label. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Personal Address Book and Collected Addresses are standard address books.  The entry ""Address Book"" is a ringer and I have no idea where i comes from.  Perhaps it is a syncronised address book with a Google account.  The one I have for Google has that name.  Although other providers have more descriptive names like the name of the provider at least like ""<a href=""http://GMX.COM"" rel=""nofollow"">GMX.COM</a> address book"". </p><p>I suggest you right click the entry in the address book and through properties check what provider it linked to.  Perhaps change the name to something more descriptive while you are there.  </p><p>If you have no synced address book do the following;  </p><p>Open your address book tab Click the add address book icon and select CardDAV from the menu <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-26-17-36-27-92b12a.png""> Enter your gmail username (if it has @gmail heave the location blank and continue. </p> <blockquote>1. Can I change the default address book sync to google? </blockquote> No.  you can only rename it <blockquote> 2. Can I change settings for automatically saved (collected) addresses to save to default address book instead of a separate ""collected"" folder? </blockquote> <p>That is in settings. (I searched on collected) <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-26-17-41-27-f1b3b1.png""> </p> <blockquote> 3. IOW can I just make it all one single address book? </blockquote> <p>No,  synchronization is per address book and you can not synchronize your personal address book. It is for this reason Thunderbird has an ALL address books search folder that just drops everything into a single place. All address books is a virtual book.  It does not exist in a physical file as such and is genersated on the fly on access.  Just as Thunderbird virtual mail folders work.  You can choose not to add anything to the personal address book (PAB), but you can not remove it.  However you say you already have some 14,000 entries in there, so it is probably a but late to do much with it at all. </p> <blockquote> 4. Is there documentation somewhere tells me details about priority/hierarchy of syncing to google i.e. Which side takes precedence? ... </blockquote>  No not really.  But you appear to be assuming you will have edited the same address record both at Google and in Thunderbird in the last 30 minutes since the last sync.  I would think that would be exceedingly rare even doing what you are expressing as your project. <blockquote> 5. Should I start the long process of culling in google contacts, or should I do it in TB? </blockquote> <p>Your choice, but as the TB contacts you currently have are primarily not going to be syncronised  (""address book"" being the only likely one. I would think doing anything in Googlres interface would be very counter productive.  Perhaps start by copying anything you want to keep to yet another address book from the Thunderbird Personal Address Book and then deleting everything in the Thunderbird PAB. That will not help with the duplicates between Google and your local PAB,  or the ""want to keep"" address book. </p><p>You might try looking at your contacts in Thunderbird with the ""all address books selected and also with the address book title showing in the details list  then you could delete one of each shown duplicate pair giving precedence to the Google address book as it is syncronised and deleting from the other local books. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-26-18-22-07-41df8e.png""> </p><p>The little square icon on the far right of the image allows you to customise the hadings shown  so you can add the address book name to the list. </p><p>Note this rather well.  Phone contacts are what phones synchronize to places like google.  They reliably have have phone numbers,  but an email address is not in anyway guaranteed, or even likely in many cases. In the case of my phone contacts anything but a name and phone number is actually quite rare.  So you are probably going to have issues with contacts synchronized from your phone to google that have no email and you will need to edit those to add an email address before you delete the records from Thunderbird address books that contain their email address. </p><p>I am not aware of any reliable way to merge disparate date like phone contacts and email address books that is not a load of manual decision making.  This is a mammoth task you have set yourself. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I can tell you this, if you install the addon signature switch then when used it will put the signature below everything. It has always put signature below and this is a known issue which has been around for a long time.  Using the Troubleshoot mode disables all addon extensions, so it should work as expected in that mode. This you have proved, but it's not the solution to a long term use. If you have a main signature set up in Thunderbird account settings then that will get used as expected providing you do not have 'Signature Switch' overriding. eg: If you use Signature Switch to operate a specific signature for specific email addresses.
