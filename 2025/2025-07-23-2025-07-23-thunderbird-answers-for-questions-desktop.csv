I wanted to add that when I go into the destination folder, there's only one copy of the message and when I check the original folder, the message is no longer there (as is correct). So it seems that the saved search is slow to update.  It shows the message as still existing where it was moved from but also where it has been moved to, at the same time. </p>",ThunderbirdUser23987,false,0,0
