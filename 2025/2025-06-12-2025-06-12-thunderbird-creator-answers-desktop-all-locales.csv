It looks entirely different and created a new profile. I edited the Profiles.ini and replaced the new profile with the old profile. (this worked 2 months ago when I bought a new computer). Now having done the editing to get all my old emails etc, it will not bring up the old profile. How do I get my old profile and the setup from the 139.0.1 look and feel. Thanks..... </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",DRPAT1
