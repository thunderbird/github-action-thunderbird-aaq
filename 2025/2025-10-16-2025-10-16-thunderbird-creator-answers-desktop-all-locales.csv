1541436,2025-10-15 17:00:39 -0700,2025-12-08 09:39:18 -0800,en-US,thunderbird,Unable to send or receive Comcast email as of yesterday (using Thunderbird),true,1772962,"{""username""=>""Don-Peters"", ""display_name""=>""Don Peters"", ""avatar""=>""https://profile.accounts.firefox.com/v1/avatar/d""}",false,1784662,1772508;1772588;1772962;1784662;,send-and-receive-email,thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,Don-Peters,"<p>I've been using Thunderbird to access my Comcast email for two years now, without problems. Except yesterday &amp; today, when I've been unable to send or receive emails, for no apparent reason. Yet, when I connect to my Comcast/Xfinity email via the Comcast browser website, sending and receiving of email works fine. This access problem began yesterday, 10/14/2025. </p><p>Same email address I've been using for about 20 years now, and same password. I made no changes to my Thunderbird or Comcast settings. Sending a test email to myself via the Comcast email website works fine. Clicking on the ""Get Messages"" icon in Thunderbird results in no action whatsoever. Sending a test message to myself in Thunderbird results in about a 40 second delay (usually it's 10 seconds), and then the error message ""Login to server <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> with username don-peters@comcast.net failed."" It then asks if I want to try again, but if I agree, the same error results. But there is also the option of ""Enter new password"". Click on that and the same error results, without even asking for a new password. But my password is OK, as evidenced by my Thunderbird settings and being able to log into Comcast browser email. </p><p>Yes, I've spent hours on the phone with Comcast on this issue, but they were of no help. One agent claimed that the issue was with Thunderbird, not Comcast, as its webmail worked fine. Two years ago, I had a similar problem I spent hours trying to solve. It turned out the problem then was due to Microsoft Outlook on my PC regularly trying to log into Comcast to ALSO download my email - BUT using the wrong password. Comcast interpreted these multiple failed login attempts as scammer attempts, and blocked ALL email logins from my PC. I fixed the problem by shutting down Outlook. But when I just spoke to Comcast they said the current problem was NOT due to my account getting blocked by them. But they couldn't give a reason for the blockage. </p><p>So, I now believe the problem lies with BOTH Thunderbird and Comcast. First of all, Comcast is somehow blocking my Thunderbird access attempts. But Thunderbird is also at fault for not reporting a SPECIFIC email login problem, so that we can address it - and fix it. If Thunderbird can be more specific as to why login attempts are failing, I can get back to them with the evidence - and hopefully solve the problem. </p><p>I've been using Thunderbird for about 30 years now, and I hate to give it up. But if this continues, I'll be forced to abandon Thunderbird. </p>",Don-Peters;MattAuSupport;RimersburgBoro;,false,false,false,";solver_id:1369349;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/141.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/141.0.0.0",4,1,7,,,

If this happens during installation (likely if it takes many many hours) and before I have had chance to back anything up, what is the scenario? will TB just continue where it left off upon reboot? if it has failed and that process corrupted, would anything it had so far downloaded be lost? Would i need to remove account and start again, would i need to reinstall TB? and would those emails still be retrievable from the servers and a new attempt possible with a new account? </p><p>3. if I opt to 'leave on the server' for a few days, in case of the above, would they continue to be deleted after that time, even if the failed account was removed? would it be possible to try again with a new pop3 or imap account within this time? If all was ok, and backed up, then can i uncheck leave on and proceed to get them removed? </p><p>3. are subfolders within the inbox included in a pop3 account? or,after installation can i get the folders still on servers downloaded and backed up by adding to the inbox and opening on TB? </p><p>4. pop3 is often not recommended and Ive read that its more vulnerable to interception and less secure connection, is this true?  </p><p>thanks for any help!
