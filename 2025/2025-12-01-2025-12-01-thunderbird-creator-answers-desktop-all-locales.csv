However, that is just the latest of TB behaving bizarrely over the last few days: filters not working, TB repeatedly re-downloading whole folders and now this is the last straw.  Same sort of short pause then total lockup in troubleshoot mode too.   </p><p>I have to have an Emailer I am not constantly fighting and debugging.  My sense now is that the main database structures of my TB have somehow been corrupted.  </p><p>I think this may go back to [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1541906|https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1541906"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1541906</a>].  That problem transferred to a different folder when I changed my filter to redirect the routine messages to that different filter so it wasn't the folder, I didn't have time to sleuth it further and as it only affected those messages, which were not important, I ignored it and TB worked fine for other things.  Then it even stopped happening with new ones of those messages but still if I opened one of the old ones, TB would lock.  Again, I didn't really need the old ones so I ignored this.  </p><p>Disconcertingly, Firefox, my main browser, has today become afflicted with something similar: launches, OK for about a minute, then locks, no different in troubleshoot.  I will report that and come back and add the link here but perhaps some mix of Mozilla and KDE and or Ubuntu recent changes are behind this but the TB problem above was there on Ubuntu and has been brewing all week so a shared Firefox/TB issue is not the whole story. </p><p>I am not sure how much longer I can persist with TB given the frequency with which I have had really nasty problems with it in recent years.  However, I feel a loyalty (I am a financial contributor) and I know that rebuilding my filters in another Emailer will take probably a full day (and I don't know what I'd swap to, using Kmail/Kontact for now so I'm not Emailless).  So I would like to have one last go and my wish is to create a clean install and then I hope, rescue my address books and filters from the dying version and see if one last go can resuscitate things.  So my questions, as I think the correct answers to this have varied a lot over recent years.  I would like answers known to work for TB is 140.5.0esr (64 bit) on Kubuntu 25.10 if possible but Ubuntu 25.10 is obviously close. </p> <ul><li> How do I best save and transfer the address books? </li><li> Ditto all my filters (a lot!) </li></ul> <p>TIA, Chris </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,1783192;,ce_mozilla

In both levels of subfolders, Thunderbird has spontaneously started disordering both newly created subfolders, and folders which I move from one subfolder to another using right click 'Move To' </p><p>Up until ten days ago, all folders whether new or moved, were listed alphabetically.  Now, day by day, the disordering is getting worse and as someone with ongoing conversations with hundreds of clients, it is becoming impossible to work when I have to give so much time to slowly scanning through every folder looking for the relevant subfolder. </p><p>I don't know why I can't update this version, but I tried installing the newest version available (145) and used the 'reset folder option' which did not work either. </p><p>Also, setting up a whole new account instead of upgrading my existing account is a colossal faff and I'd rather not have to! </p><p>Aside from manually reordering (also a colossal faff), can anyone suggest something I might be missing in stopping this happening? </p><p>Thunderbird says I'm on an esr channel, if that helps </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",adele7
