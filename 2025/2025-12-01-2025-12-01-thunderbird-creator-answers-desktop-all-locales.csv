They will waste hours of your time. Experts will tell you that you’re an idiot and it’s really simple. But they can’t describe how to simply start from scratch and add an Outlook account. They just assume it works naturally for everybody because it worked for them. Maybe it does work 60% of the time. Good luck plan to spend a frustrating evening and then think about something other than Microsoft and Mozilla. </p>,thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,1783175;,305dds

The focus just cycles through other UI elements (buttons, dots at the bottom right, etc.), but **never stays inside the input field**, so I can’t type anything. Clicking into the field does not help — the focus immediately jumps away again. </p><p>This only happens in: </p> <ul><li> Thunderbird 128.12.0 ESR (32-bit) on Windows 10 </li><li> Firefox (same behavior) </li></ul> <p>But Edge and Chrome work normally. </p><p>What I already tried (no success): </p><p>- Removing OAuth tokens and clearing authentication files in Thunderbird - Disabling Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox - Disabling browser extensions (ad-blockers, NoScript, Privacy tools) - Checking and modifying Firefox `about:config` privacy settings - Clearing and re-authorizing the app under Microsoft Account permissions - Restarting in Firefox Troubleshooting Mode - Switching temporarily between OAuth2 and Normal Password authentication - Testing on fresh login windows after restarting Thunderbird - Maximizing the popup, using tab/keyboard navigation tricks - Turning off Windows Security controlled folder access - Testing with different networks </p><p>None of the above solved the issue. </p><p>Additional notes / clues: </p> <ul><li> Problem affects only **Thunderbird + Firefox**, not Chromium browsers </li><li> Windows 10 system </li><li> Thunderbird is running **32-bit ESR**, so it uses Gecko/Firefox ESR 115 engine </li><li> This looks like a **focus bug in the Microsoft OAuth WebView implementation** on Gecko-based apps </li><li> I can't complete the OAuth login, so I’m stuck without access to the account </li></ul> <p>What I’m asking the community: </p> <ul><li> Is this a **known ESR bug** with Microsoft OAuth? </li><li> Is there a workaround or patch for Gecko WebView secure input fields? </li><li> Any configuration that I may have missed? </li></ul> <p>Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
