The interesting thing, which I just noticed, is that these folders appear to be just folders that don't have any dates.  But I know the 'bridgetown' ones at the bottom (in the attached image) are from October 2023 and the top two are from yesterday. All were created by Thunderbird for some strange reason.

Something interrupted the file writes hence the oddball numbers on the end.  You need an exception in your antivirus program for the Thunderbird profile folders. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p><p>This is a bit of open heart surgery,  so please make a copy of your Thunderbird profile folders and contents before you take any actions. </p><p>Go to the troubleshooting information on the help menu.  Click on the show profile button in the first block of information (it is about 3/4 of the way does the visible page usually) Close Thunderbird. Backup the folder that was opened in the windows file manager and it's sub folders.  If something goes wrong there will then be a way back. </p><p>Open the mail folder and then the ""local folder"" folder Under that you will see the trash and the two X and Z folder will be in that folder with files of the names shown in the trash folder of Thunderbird.  So you may see for example xxz.sdb xxz.msf or xxz with no file extension. all are valid for different stated of the folder or the folder having sub folders.  What is important here is to delete them.  Everything in the trash folder can be deleted, I would think as you do not mention the folder having anything in it you need to keep. But you can delete individual file/folder sets if that makes you more comfortable. </p><p>Restart Thunderbird and I hope everything is gone, if not close Thunderbird, open the profile folder again and  delete the file foldertree and restart Thunderbird. That will force a full rebuild of the folder pane in Thunderbird.  It should happen automatically after the files are deleted, but I have heard stories of it having to be deleted as well to show the change.  But please get your self that exception setup.  It will greatly reduce the issues going forward in my opinion. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So why are you trying to add it again?  and why are you changing your password?  what was the prompt for that.  Both are valid questions as changing of a password is not something that has anything to do with Thunderbird,  but many folk do that when they experience an issue because they get some dialog about wanting a password so it is easier to ask than assume. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
