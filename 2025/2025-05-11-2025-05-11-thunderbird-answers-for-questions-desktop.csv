Something interrupted the file writes hence the oddball numbers on the end.  You need an exception in your antivirus program for the Thunderbird profile folders. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p><p>This is a bit of open heart surgery,  so please make a copy of your Thunderbird profile folders and contents before you take any actions. </p><p>Go to the troubleshooting information on the help menu.  Click on the show profile button in the first block of information (it is about 3/4 of the way does the visible page usually) Close Thunderbird. Backup the folder that was opened in the windows file manager and it's sub folders.  If something goes wrong there will then be a way back. </p><p>Open the mail folder and then the ""local folder"" folder Under that you will see the trash and the two X and Z folder will be in that folder with files of the names shown in the trash folder of Thunderbird.  So you may see for example xxz.sdb xxz.msf or xxz with no file extension. all are valid for different stated of the folder or the folder having sub folders.  What is important here is to delete them.  Everything in the trash folder can be deleted, I would think as you do not mention the folder having anything in it you need to keep. But you can delete individual file/folder sets if that makes you more comfortable. </p><p>Restart Thunderbird and I hope everything is gone, if not close Thunderbird, open the profile folder again and  delete the file foldertree and restart Thunderbird. That will force a full rebuild of the folder pane in Thunderbird.  It should happen automatically after the files are deleted, but I have heard stories of it having to be deleted as well to show the change.  But please get your self that exception setup.  It will greatly reduce the issues going forward in my opinion. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

What I am asking is that this functionality be incorporated into the base version of T-bird as an officially supported function and not an add-on.   There is no indication on the MeMeller version as to compatibility making it a trial-and-see option, and the MeMeller version is not found from within the T-bird search for add-ons, making it a feature available only to those with special knowledge and a more-than-average technical ability.   I am appreciative of the MeMeller work, fearful that it will disappear with the next update to T-bird.   I'm ok for now, but leary of future developments.
