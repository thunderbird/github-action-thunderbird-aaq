My only problem is that the option to open with a blank page is not working despite leaving the checkbox unchecked. I've tried checking and unchecking but it makes no difference, it always opens with the full setup options displayed. Is there another way to have TB open with a blank page? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1745756;1745761;,nmrn2012
