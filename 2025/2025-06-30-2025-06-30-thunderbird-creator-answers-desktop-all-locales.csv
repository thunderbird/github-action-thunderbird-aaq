My only problem is that the option to open with a blank page is not working despite leaving the checkbox unchecked. I've tried checking and unchecking but it makes no difference, it always opens with the full setup options displayed. Is there another way to have TB open with a blank page? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1745756;1745761;1745779;1745786;,nmrn2012

I set up the first one a few weeks ago and works fine.  I has all the subfolders that are also in Outlook --- Sent, Deleted, Drafts, Junk, etc.  I may have had to set these up in Account Settings - Copies &amp; Folders settings. I set up my second Outlook email account (not alias) in Thunderbird, but it only shows an Inbox subfolder.   Sent emails from this second outlook account are going to Local - Sent subfolder.  I can't set up a Sent folder.  When viewing on Outlook, all subfolders are showing and Sent emails are being placed in the Sent folder under this second email account.    Each outlook account has its own password. </p><p>What do I need to do to get the second outlook account in Thunderbird work with its own subfolders (Sent, Deleted, Drafts, etc) instead of using the Local subfolders? </p><p>Thank you </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",rjameson1
