In particular, filters and searches. After typing the first character, the program becomes unresponsive for 6-10 seconds, and this continues this behavior after typing each character. At the same time, the screen will compress to the left, and then go back to normal size. The application becomes unresponsive, but there is no category in the performance monitor that is at 100% (CPU, RAM, SSD, Network, GPU). Thunderbird doesn't use more than about 20% of CPU capacity, and I have 24GB of RAM free, but still becomes unresponsive. </p><p>Do you have any suggestions? </p><p>My computer has NVME SSDs and 32GB of ram, so I don't think it should be a performance issue. I am running Windows 10 Pro. </p><p>Thanks </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",hijohnperez

Perhaps I asked under the wrong heading. I'm not the sharpest tack in the box when it comes to these things. Over the holidays I prepared many emails to send afterwards. I created sub-folders in my drafts folder. I sent the emails OK, but then I couldn't delete the folders I created in the drafts folder. Not only that but the folder icons in  Drafts turned from yellow to purple and they did that in all four of my email accounts, even though my storage of emails was all in one single account. When I right click on the folders I don't get the option to delete and the folders won't allow being dragged to trash. Also one of the folders suddenly disappeared with all of the prepared email in it. Can you help me correct this condition? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;needsinfo;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1704258;,martypa

I figured out how to create a new calendar; however, I do not know how to make it blank so that I can start adding my to-do lists.

Since updating to the latest version, there has been a problem with forwarding messages encrypted using the S/MIME protocol and signed by the internal certification authority. The issue occurs when: the message is signed and encrypted, as well as when the message is only signed(without encryption). Is this issue related to security measures or is it a bug?

I tried to fix it with the available button, but after 8 hours it was still stuck at the very first step (don't know if there are more, really).  also I searched online and found some interesting solutions, among which ne pointed at removing the panacea.dat e global-messages-db.sqlite files in order to force Thunderbird and rebuild its index. I am running v 115 though and there's no panacea.dat here. I wonder if there is any new procedure to get the same result... or else, whatever viable solution that could make me recover the former folders structure.  of course, the first thing I would do after recovering would be to simplify the structure and/or reorganise in order for the folders to be less heavy, according to any suggestions of yours... that would be more than welcome&nbsp;:) thanks, kind regards </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",autofab
