In particular, filters and searches. After typing the first character, the program becomes unresponsive for 6-10 seconds, and this continues this behavior after typing each character. At the same time, the screen will compress to the left, and then go back to normal size. The application becomes unresponsive, but there is no category in the performance monitor that is at 100% (CPU, RAM, SSD, Network, GPU). Thunderbird doesn't use more than about 20% of CPU capacity, and I have 24GB of RAM free, but still becomes unresponsive. </p><p>Do you have any suggestions? </p><p>My computer has NVME SSDs and 32GB of ram, so I don't think it should be a performance issue.

I tried to fix it with the available button, but after 8 hours it was still stuck at the very first step (don't know if there are more, really).  also I searched online and found some interesting solutions, among which ne pointed at removing the panacea.dat e global-messages-db.sqlite files in order to force Thunderbird and rebuild its index. I am running v 115 though and there's no panacea.dat here. I wonder if there is any new procedure to get the same result... or else, whatever viable solution that could make me recover the former folders structure.  of course, the first thing I would do after recovering would be to simplify the structure and/or reorganise in order for the folders to be less heavy, according to any suggestions of yours... that would be more than welcome&nbsp;:) thanks, kind regards </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",autofab
