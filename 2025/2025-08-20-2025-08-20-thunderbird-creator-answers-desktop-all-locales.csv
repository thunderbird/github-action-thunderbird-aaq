We are facing an issue: emails sent to addresses ending with @gmail.com do not reach the recipients. However, we can successfully receive emails from @gmail.com addresses. </p><p>Could you please advise how we can resolve this issue and what settings in Thunderbird should be checked to ensure correct email delivery? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",yanara01

A month back, I installed it on my Android, then used the desktop ""Export for Mobile"" option to recreate all my emails (I have several) on my phone. The setup worked and I receive emails. But realized last week that no one receives emails I send from my phone from my domain emails. </p><p>No error messages, no bounces, and email ends up in Sent folder. Plus, bcc'ing myself, I receive them. I double-checked outgoing servers. These match what is on the desktop Tbird. </p><p>However, emailing from my gmail account in Tbird on Android works--email received. Just the emails from my domain don't go through.  </p><p>versions: TB for Android 10.1,  Verizon (samsung) android (v 15) set to cellular (vs wifi) for internet, I have emails via my domain on shared hosting service. </p><p>See attached image. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",mozi3
