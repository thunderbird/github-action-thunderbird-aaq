I am using a RHEL10 based distro (Almalinux10). Everything is working fine with received email. I need to manually process the received mail folder with an automation utility I had written in the past that was based on a Maildir folder structure. </p><p>I read through the article: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird</a> - and noticed that it was around 6 years old and could not find any updated articles re. the current status of Maildir and Thunderbird. </p><p>My question(s): I noticed that the Thunderbird Maildir structure under the email profile does not seem to have a folder named 'new', it only has 'cur' and 'tmp'. This does kind of make sense, as from what I understand, the 'new' folder is intended for messages that have been delivered, but not seen by any email applications. I am guessing Thunderbird has the email received in its user inbox, so it belongs in the 'cur' directory as it has been 'seen' by Thunderbird? </p><p>I was just wanting to confirm that it is that case that all email received by Thunderbird using a Maildir directory structure will always appear in the 'cur' folder. For reference, in my previous setup, fetchmail was retrieving email from a remote email server and as a result all email received appeared in the 'new' directory. My automation application processed all email in the the 'new' folder and archived them once processed. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",sjlebas
