I am using a RHEL10 based distro (Almalinux10). Everything is working fine with received email. I need to manually process the received mail folder with an automation utility I had written in the past that was based on a Maildir folder structure. </p><p>I read through the article: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird</a> - and noticed that it was around 6 years old and could not find any updated articles re. the current status of Maildir and Thunderbird. </p><p>My question(s): I noticed that the Thunderbird Maildir structure under the email profile does not seem to have a folder named 'new', it only has 'cur' and 'tmp'. This does kind of make sense, as from what I understand, the 'new' folder is intended for messages that have been delivered, but not seen by any email applications. I am guessing Thunderbird has the email received in its user inbox, so it belongs in the 'cur' directory as it has been 'seen' by Thunderbird? </p><p>I was just wanting to confirm that it is that case that all email received by Thunderbird using a Maildir directory structure will always appear in the 'cur' folder. For reference, in my previous setup, fetchmail was retrieving email from a remote email server and as a result all email received appeared in the 'new' directory. My automation application processed all email in the the 'new' folder and archived them once processed. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",sjlebas

Problem occurred for the first time today (08/20/25). I opened thunderbird on my Windows 10 PC. All updates and thunderbird are current. I can create and send emails fine, but I can not download new mail. I can see 20 new emails on my phone but can not download to my PC. I called AT&amp;T support.  My email is sbcglobal domain. They tried to help. Went into server settings and the AUTHORIZATION TYPE was OATH2. There were 4 other options. I tried them all. (Normal PW, Encrypted PW and 2 others). Nothing worked. And now, OATH2 is not one of the available options. No idea how it was originally set. AT&amp;T said that was a Microsoft Authorization type, so I contacted MS support (chat). They were no help. They immediately said “Thunderbird is a 3rd party client, we don’t support it”. I told him it might have been the most recent Windows update that caused the problem. He said “Contact  Mozilla”.  </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Another question I have is, if I were to delete the Thunderbird application and re-download it. Would I lose all my emails and folders? That would be life-changing in a bad, bad way. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1758312;,mrkenbob
