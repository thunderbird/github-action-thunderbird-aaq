Filtering by a domain is only useful if the spammer owns the domain and the domain is included in the From email address, but that's not always the case.  </p><p>There are specific programs that can 'filter' emails such as Mailwasher - mentioned by david - they can also 'filter' a load of emails prior to emails being passed onto Thunderbird. Some people find them very effective.  </p><p>In Thunderbird you can set up 'Message Filters' which auto filter on incoming mail that arrives in the 'Inbox'. You can set up a filter that searches on 'domain' and set it up to 'mark as Junk' and put into the relevant account Junk/Spam folder.  You can also set up Thunderbird to auto empty the Junk/Spam or do it manually OR as many servers auto empty the Spam periodically, you just forget about it. A single filter can have several conditions and you can set it up if ANY of those conditions applies then do the action.

The best way to deal with the majority of junk is to enable and train the built in Junk Control filter to recognise any email in address book is good/whitelist and mark as junk specific emails or blocks of emails so it learns. I've done this and it works very well. After the first couple of weeks, it was doing a grand job. Barely any real junk or spam land in my Inbox making life so much easier. If you have not set up your Junk Controls nor trained them it might explain why you are getting so much rubblish in the Inbox.   </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a> </li></ul> <p>I only have a couple of filters that pick up a few specific variants of junk because I also get spammers and scammers falsely setting up the 'from' as if from myself as I have a website. You can see in the headers that it did not originate from my address or server, but the part seen in the From in the Message List says it's me.
