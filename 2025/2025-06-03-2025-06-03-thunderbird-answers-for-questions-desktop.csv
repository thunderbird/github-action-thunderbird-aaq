Thus, I think it may be that the e-mails for the daily report aren't moving over because I had already moved them over manually and then moved them back to test the remade filter.

Filtering by a domain is only useful if the spammer owns the domain and the domain is included in the From email address, but that's not always the case.  </p><p>There are specific programs that can 'filter' emails such as Mailwasher - mentioned by david - they can also 'filter' a load of emails prior to emails being passed onto Thunderbird. Some people find them very effective.  </p><p>In Thunderbird you can set up 'Message Filters' which auto filter on incoming mail that arrives in the 'Inbox'. You can set up a filter that searches on 'domain' and set it up to 'mark as Junk' and put into the relevant account Junk/Spam folder.  You can also set up Thunderbird to auto empty the Junk/Spam or do it manually OR as many servers auto empty the Spam periodically, you just forget about it. A single filter can have several conditions and you can set it up if ANY of those conditions applies then do the action. You can then add a condition to that filter as required. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:  Many of us get thousands of emails a month that are spam.  Are you really going to spend so much time making up filtering rules to block the domain for each email message? </em>  </p><p>No, as stated above - once filter is created you can easily add additional conditions, but seriously that is still a bit cumbersome . </p><p><em>re: But if we could just highlight the messages all together and click a "" Block Sender's Domain"" that would be done fast.  We could do a whole page at a time easily. </em> </p><p>I use that type of method already - it's been in Thunderbird for ages.   </p> <ul><li> Right click on a batch of Highlighted emails and choose 'Mark' &gt; 'as Junk'   </li></ul> <p>That's why Thunderbird has it's own built in filter using a  Bayes algorithm plus training data supplied by your actions.  The best way to deal with the majority of junk is to enable and train the built in Junk Control filter to recognise any email in address book is good/whitelist and mark as junk specific emails or blocks of emails so it learns. I've done this and it works very well. After the first couple of weeks, it was doing a grand job. Barely any real junk or spam land in my Inbox making life so much easier. If you have not set up your Junk Controls nor trained them it might explain why you are getting so much rubblish in the Inbox.   </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a> </li></ul> <p>I only have a couple of filters that pick up a few specific variants of junk because I also get spammers and scammers falsely setting up the 'from' as if from myself as I have a website. You can see in the headers that it did not originate from my address or server, but the part seen in the From in the Message List says it's me. Now, for obvious reasons, I do not want to label those as spam, so I search on a specific content and just delete - send to TRash rather than 'mark as junk' or put in 'Junk/Spam'.  </p><p>Bare in mind that there is a huge different between those who are acting fraudulently- aka scammers and those who are just sending unwanted mail aka spammers chucking out a load of constant nuisance mail and genuine people just touting for business but not of interest to yourself.  </p><p>Remember - some nefarious people abuse other peoples email addresses and send emails pretending to be from a real good sender email. I would ask you to never set those as junk because the real owner could end up being blocked from using their own account - not funny.

But hey, they all waste our time.  Of course some you can unsubscribe from but is anyone ever going to unsubscribe from thousands of emails individually?  Probably not!  We only do that from legit sources because we know it will work.  And remember, tomorrow they may send out even more because by unsubscribing me you have proven to them it arrived and was read.
