BUT, the setting of a constant font size, fixed/variable width and  Body Text/Paragraph is imo irrational, verging on stupid. </p><p>All of the above change at random while typing an email.   Mindful this is a free email client for which i am thankful, what sadist developer(s) thought not having a simple procedure to set font, font size and format, like any other email client i have used, is not a sensible thing to do. </p><p>I am of the understanding that Thunderbird is influenced by the settings the receiver uses or the settings of the senders email. I don't care what settings they have or use. If they don't like the looks of my email, bad luck. All i want to do is type an email as efficiently as possible and send it. I sometimes spend more time changing back the format of the text i type than typing the content. </p><p>I have read solutions such as typing the email in notepad and then pasting it into Thunderbird.  Really&nbsp;!  OMG </p><p>Looking for help on the www, the so called fixes are so old, the instructions are either not relevant or difficult to follow as the current Thunderbird has changed and things are different places and/or named differently. All this smack of Microsoft mentality where i am convinced things are changed for the sake of change or (cynically on my part) to mess with users. </p><p>Maybe Thunderbird can have 2 methods of setting up fonts, sizing etc etc. One a simple 'normal' way like other email clients, and the other as it currently is to accommodate what ever idealistic vision they have. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",foxy_dude
