Before the last update to TB 140.0.1esr, I was using the version 128.11.1esr on my computers without any issue. But, following the installation of TB 140.0.1esr on one of my computers running MacOS 10.15.7, I notice a strange behavior of the application: (1) the application was running slower than the previous version, (2) when I try to close the application, I receive the system message that this ""application quit unexpectedly"", (3) the diagnostic test of my system shows that the CPU time is used at about 35% by the TB application. I had to completely remove the TB 140.0.1esr and painfully reinstall the previous version (128.11.1esr), due to the corrupted user profile! Now the TB 128.11.1esr runs normally and required about 0.3% of CPU time. So it will be imperative to look upon the compatibility of TB 140.0.1esr with MacOS 10.15.7.
