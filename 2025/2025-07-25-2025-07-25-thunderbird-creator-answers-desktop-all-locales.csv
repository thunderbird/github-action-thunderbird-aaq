Mindful this is a free email client for which i am thankful, what sadist developer(s) thought not having a simple procedure to set font, font size and format, like any other email client i have used, is not a sensible thing to do. </p><p>I am of the understanding that Thunderbird is influenced by the settings the receiver uses or the settings of the senders email. I don't care what settings they have or use. If they don't like the looks of my email, bad luck. All i want to do is type an email as efficiently as possible and send it. I sometimes spend more time changing back the format of the text i type than typing the content. </p><p>I have read solutions such as typing the email in notepad and then pasting it into Thunderbird.  Really&nbsp;!  OMG </p><p>Looking for help on the www, the so called fixes are so old, the instructions are either not relevant or difficult to follow as the current Thunderbird has changed and things are different places and/or named differently. All this smack of Microsoft mentality where i am convinced things are changed for the sake of change or (cynically on my part) to mess with users. </p><p>Maybe Thunderbird can have 2 methods of setting up fonts, sizing etc etc. One a simple 'normal' way like other email clients, and the other as it currently is to accommodate what ever idealistic vision they have. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1751527;1751566;1751569;,foxy_dude

Before the last update to TB 140.0.1esr, I was using the version 128.11.1esr on my computers without any issue. But, following the installation of TB 140.0.1esr on one of my computers running MacOS 10.15.7, I notice a strange behavior of the application: (1) the application was running slower than the previous version, (2) when I try to close the application, I receive the system message that this ""application quit unexpectedly"", (3) the diagnostic test of my system shows that the CPU time is used at about 35% by the TB application. I had to completely remove the TB 140.0.1esr and painfully reinstall the previous version (128.11.1esr), due to the corrupted user profile! Now the TB 128.11.1esr runs normally and required about 0.3% of CPU time. So it will be imperative to look upon the compatibility of TB 140.0.1esr with MacOS 10.15.7. I did not try to install this update to my Mac M2 machines, following my issues with Mac intel machines.
