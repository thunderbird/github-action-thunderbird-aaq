So I have two POP accounts containing messages that I need to move to IMAP accounts on my new computer.   </p><p>When I open the profile folder on my current computer it has a MAIL folder and a ImapMail folder.  The MAIL folder contains a Local Folder and a <a href=""http://pop.1and1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.1and1.com</a> folder.  Each of these subfolders contains the Inbox, Sent, Trash etc. folders that contain the email messages to be moved to the new computer. </p><p>I see lots of information on moving the profile but that doesn't address the POP to IMAP conversion issue or the fact there are three different accounts involved. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Bob117

Since a few weeks (or even months) by now, it is hanging all the time. Meanwhile it is totally impossible to use it properly.

Thunderbid z niewiadomych przyczyn losowo miesza treść odebranych wiadomości i przyporządkowuje je do innych wiadomości. W załączniku przesyłam print screen jak to wygląda. Jak widać odebrałem wiadomość z adresu: j.cichecka@.......pl o tytule Faktura VAT - sprzedaży nr. 7/03/2025/WYN. Po podświetleniu tej wiadomości w treści maila poniżej widzę niewłaściwą treść z innego maila od T-Mobile otrzymanego z adresu twoja_f@.......pl natomiast tytuł maila jest z wiadomości otrzymanej z adresu j.cichecka@.......pl (taki jak widać w liście Tematów wyżej). W ten sposób ginie mi mnóstwo wiadomości, których treści nie mogę odczytać bo znajduje się tam treść maili z innych wiadomości. Czy ktoś spotkał się z podobnym problemem i zna rozwiązanie jak to naprawić? Dziękuję Pozdrawiam Marcin </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",marcin.trybura

Quando chiudo Thunderbird, la sera quando esco dall'ufficio, ricevo i messaggi mail sul mio iphone. Da ieri, nonostante abbia chiuso il client i messaggi arrivano sull'iphone ma restano lì per qualche minuto, dopo di che spariscono. Quando la mattina vado ad aprire il client trovo tutti i messaggi della notte già scaricati. Vorrei tornare alla situazione precedente (scarico dei messaggi sul telefono quando il client è chiuso) ma non so come fare. Mi potete aiutare? Grazie. Cordiali saluti.
