Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",avocat3

I need to move these accounts to a new Windows 11 computer.  I want all of the accounts on the new computer to be IMAP.  So I have two POP accounts containing messages that I need to move to IMAP accounts on my new computer.   </p><p>When I open the profile folder on my current computer it has a MAIL folder and a ImapMail folder.  The MAIL folder contains a Local Folder and a <a href=""http://pop.1and1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.1and1.com</a> folder.  Each of these subfolders contains the Inbox, Sent, Trash etc. folders that contain the email messages to be moved to the new computer. </p><p>I see lots of information on moving the profile but that doesn't address the POP to IMAP conversion issue or the fact there are three different accounts involved. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Bob117
