It used to be somewhat instinctive to use in comparison to the current version. That's about 20 years ago. It now seems to have a minuscule amount of instinctual usability.  My question / statement is where is the Tutorial. Like many products including Microsoft, make what they think are brilliant ""improvements,"" and what they primarily do is cause confusion, frustration, greater difficulty in using the product and for many a wish they fervently pray for: ""I I want my old thingamajg back."" </p><p>I hadn't used Thunderbird since February of 2024 - LAST YEAR. Currently it is unrecognizable from then. I had  been hospitalized with 3 stents, a pacemaker and heart valve, I'm back functioning and love life. However - It would have been simple to make a dozen short tutorials on enough things to easily do the basics. Pleading for donations and not making it simpler to use the product doesn't attract new users &amp; make current users happier. I would be grateful if anyone can point me to some simple tutorial.  </p><p>In my opinion what Thunderbird offers is too cryptic for me to process, I hope my post is noticed by a ""Solver"" Don't misunderstand me. I liked using Thunderbird for these many years because it was incredibly flexible, usable, and partially simple &amp; instinctive. Today few people have the will or time to spend hours poring through help sheets that are a challenge and confusing to use. </p><p>Would appreciate your help. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,1726396;1726956;1726957;1726995;1727832;,Cyborg119

A few weeks ago, Thunderbird on two of my computers, (a Win10 laptop and a Win11 desktop) stopped receiving email, but were still able to send it. After a couple of days, normality resumed and both computers were able to receive email again, without any corrective measures taken by me. However, about 5 days ago the same thing has happened again, but this time, the desktop has resumed normal function but the laptop has not. The error (both times of failure) is shown in the image. TB on the Win10 laptop is configured POP3. On the Win11 desktop IMAP. </p><p>Email works perfectly from web interface, and so I'm very reluctant to change the password on the server in case I get locked out of the web interface, but perhaps this might be the step to take? I uninstalled TB using RevoUninstaller to completely wipe TB from the computer, including any registry entries. Installed TB version 137.0.2. Still the issue persists. I'm certain that the account settings are correct, so the issue is a complete mystery to me as to what is going on here. I would very much appreciate any help to resolve this issue please. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1726565;1726799;1726805;1726979;,lee124
