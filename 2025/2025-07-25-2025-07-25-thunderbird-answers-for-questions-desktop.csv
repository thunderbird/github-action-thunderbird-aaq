For testing TB 140.0.1esr in a<strong> new profile</strong> proceed as follows:  • install version TB 140.0.1esr on your Desktop and not in the applications folder  • in a Finder window open the user library and rename the folder ""Thunderbird"" to ""Thunderbird-work' • now start TB 140.0.1esr which will create a new folder ""thunderbird"" in your user-library and a new virgin profile xxxxxxxx.default-release. Set up one of your accounts, preferably an IMAP account • test v140.0.1esr whether or not there is the same abundant CPU consumption including TB  ""quitting unexpectedly""   • if TB 140.0.1esr works flawlessly in its own new profile we conclude that there is something in your old TB 128-esr profile which is incompatible with TB 140.0.1esr.  </p><p>When you want to return to work with v128 in your usual profile, quit TB 140.0.1esr, open your user-library, rename ""thunderbird"" to ""thunderbird-140"" and ""Thunderbird-work"" back to ""Thunderbird"".
