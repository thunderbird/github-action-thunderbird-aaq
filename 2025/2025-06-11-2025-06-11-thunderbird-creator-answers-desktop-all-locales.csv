I use the Advanced Image Editor and select the HTML Attributes tab. I select ""border"" from the Attributes dropdown menu and then add ""6px red"" as the value. This generates a 6px black border, but does not accept the color (or other) value. </p><p>How do I modify other values of the border? Is there a tutorial somewhere on using the Advanced Image Editor? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",DonK

I get a bunch of status messages at the bottom left of the screen: looking up server, connecting, checking server capabilities, etc, then everything just stops.  No downloads.  If I access this account via webmail, there *are* emails there that Tbird just won't download.  No error messages of any kind, just those status messages in that bar along the bottom of the window.  All appears well... but no messages.  </p><p>On the sending sider, I can't send anything from the account either (image attached.)  So there appears to be both a connection error (sending) and NO connection error (receiving.)  Got me chasing my own tail in circles - - tried a couple of different email apps and they're all working as they should, same settings, both send and receive.  I've never used anything other than Thunderbird and REALLY don't want to change, but if it isn't working, looks like I'll have to, like it or not.  Any ideas gratefully received! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",kharrisma
