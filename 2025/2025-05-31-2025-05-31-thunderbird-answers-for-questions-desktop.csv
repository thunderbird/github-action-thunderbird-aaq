This sounds related to my issue. </p><p>For months, I have been chasing down an issue where sometimes the Activity Indicator would stay active for a very, very long time, sometimes until I closed TB. Upon opening the Tools &gt; Activity Monitor I would see it stuck on Downloading messages from one of several folders. After going down other rabbit holes, I came to realize that the folders that are hanging appear to be ones I have a Retention Policy that doesn't ""Use My Account Settings"". I saw this when looking at Activity Monitor I would see ""Deleted x messages from [Folder]"" and they were the same ones that were hanging. These folders, and sub-folders, have less than 500 messages and they were folders in several of my active accounts and from several different email servers. I have tried rebuilding the indexes, and other suggestion found online dealing with email issues in TB. </p><p>Could there be some kind of issue with the Retention Policy? I sure would like to solve this. I am pretty good with debugging. Is there data I could capture? </p>",DoctorBashir,false,0,0

Looking at your history of posts over a number of years, what I am seeing there are topic after topic that has more to do with intrusive antivirus/Firewall/VPN activities than any other probable cause.   <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/user/thorsak/questions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/user/thorsak/questions</a> </p><p>You had odd outcomes with oauth2.0 Authentication.

But Yahoo have been fairly stable in their requirement for oauth and their acceptance of same. </p><p>I have heard of this happening a number of times to folks in the last 10 years,  I think it was some abortive forced addon from Trend the last time I heard of it.  No sign of anything in Thunderbird as the antivirus injected it's addon into the running Thunderbird instance and everything fell on it's head when Thunderbird updated and the addon was not compatible but still force injected.
