If you have a profile that was created from a prior installation, that can be used. Did you save just the profile, or the Thunderbird folder that contains additional information? When thunderbird starts, it prompts to create an account ONLY if it did not find an existing password. You can click tools&gt;import&gt;import from a thunderbird installation and then click 'import a profile folder' and select your saved profile.  </p><p>When responding, use the email you receive, as that as a REPLY button, as you cannot reply directly to the email.  </p><p>Regarding the password issue,  The account password isn't going to work no matter when you enter it.
