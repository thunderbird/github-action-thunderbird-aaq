So when you reinstall it picks up all the same data. </p><p>As a heads up, please do not use text shorthand as it can be ambiguous. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:There are a qty of folders in the mail folder with similarr names.</em> </p><p>It would be useful if you uploaded an image which shows all the Folder Pane folders so we know what you are talking about. </p><p>Are you using an imap or pop mail account&nbsp;? Pop accounts have the following default folders: Inbox, Drafts, Templates, Sent, Archives, Junk, Deleted. Some of these folders may appear when you first use them eg: Sent folder may appear after you send an email for the first time. </p><p>Imap accounts will have a similar set of default folders but the naming of folders depends upon the server. Imap folders should follow the same identical name as the server uses. As an example, sent emails may be in a 'Sent', or 'Sent Mail' or similar named folder. Some servers use a 'Trash' folder and others call it 'Bin'. Generally servers use a 'Spam' folder, but there has been a recent bug which for some reason is renaming imap 'Spam' or 'Bulk' as 'Junk' - no doubt it will be fixed soon. </p><p>It would be useful if you could say what server you are talking about and perhaps upload an image of the folders you see in the webmail account. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;: Also have 5 TBird Local plus subfolders in my main mallboxo - how do I remove those?</em> </p><p>First check to see if you have enabled 'Unified folders'. What is Unified folders&nbsp;? All the default folders get a 'Unified' status. So, you will see a 'Unified' Inbox which displays all the emails that are in all the various 'Inboxes' for all the accounts. It's a virtual view and the Inbox will have subfolders that look like account names/email addresses - each of them is actually the Inbox only for that account. If you normally have some subfolders in an accounts Inbox, then they will also display as subfolders to each accounts Inbox. </p><p>I suggest you switch it off if it is complicating the view. via 'Menu bar' or 'Menu app icon'  &gt;  View &gt; Folders &gt; make sure the 'All Folders' option is selected and uncheck the 'Unified Folder' option. </p><p>You should have 'Local Folders' account usually it displays at the bottom and it contains the 'Outbox' which is used by all accounts when you use the 'Send Later' option.  The 'Local Folders' account can also be used when people want to use several POP accounts but they do not wish to see all those listed in the Folder Pane - they want to combine them - set them up as deferred accounts using a Global Inbox. The 'Local Folders' account is also used in general for mail storage or by those who have IMAP account but need to get emails off the server to regain quota space. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1

I have discovered more about the problem though. It seems to be the case that there are two different problems which have collided to produce a bigger issue. </p><p>1. My internet is provided by BT and my native email address is @btinternet.com. However I have a personalised domain name which is parked with namesco, and I use this as a personalised email address. The email for the domain is set up to forward everything to the @btinternet.com address. Mostly this works fine and has been more or less working fine for many years. But. </p><p>2. What I did not realise is that BT itself flags emails it doesn't like as spam. These emails should, I believe, go straight to the recipient's spam folder, but this is not happening in Thunderbird. Instead of going to a spam folder they simply vanish. This has always been the case but I didn't realise until yesterday. This seems to be the crux of my problem with Thunderbird. I'm not receving emails that BT has marked as spam. </p><p>3. I have the BT Mail app on my phone. This was only installed about six months ago and I haven't paid a lot of attention to it. However, I discovered yesterday that the emails BT has marked as spam ARE going to the spam folder in that. (This is regardless of whether they were originally sent to @btinternet.com directly, or forwarded from namesco.) </p><p>I trawled through that spam box, which only holds a month's emails, and found a number of genuine emails - including the one advising me about your reply. I marked these as not-spam and white-listed the domains, and at that point they all appeared in my Thunderbird inbox. As a work-round this is helpful, but I'd really like to fix it properly. </p><p>4. The crux of the problem, I now realise, is that BT has been flagging a lot of genuine emails as spam when they have been forwarded from namesco, but not flagging the same emails when they have come into @btinternet directly. The result of this was that it appeared that emails from certain accounts (mainly large companies like Amazon, inevitably) were vanishing when sent to my personalised address, but coming through correctly when sent directly to @btinternet.com. This is the half of the problem that I need to pursue with BT. </p><p>The issue with Thunderbird is that the emails BT seems to be trying to send straight to my spam folder are not being received by Thunderbird. I did try at one point to reset the parameters for the Thunderbird spam folders but it didn't make any difference. The advice I need is what to do to Thunderbird so that it gets the emails BT thinks are spam. </p><p>(Someone suggested that the emails were being deleted from the server when the phone received them, so that they weren't getting to Thunderbird, but this can't be the explanation. The BT Mail app has only been on my phone since December, and the issue has being going on for years, with accounts becoming affected one at a time, presumably as the BT servers took against them. It started to happen before I even possessed a smartphone.) </p><p>Thank you for any light you can shed on this. </p>",Morag2,false,0,0

They are probably described in the email as JPEG file but there is no such thing as binary data in an email it is all text. the email is composed of text using Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) it is a standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs.  &lt;/blockquote&gt; I have even had the paperclip icon you show in the image disappear when the message is selected to open.  Not all email are fully compliant in the way attachments are described resulting in some inline images appearing in lists as attachments until the actual body text is finally parsed to display the content. </p><p>I am guessing you probably want the attachment extractor addon despite your assertion you do not have attachments.  <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/attachment-extractor/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/attachment-extractor/?src=ss</a> </p><p><br> </p> <blockquote>Hi, I'm trying to save several msgs that have .jpg files within them (not attached)  I save one by opening it, pressing M + H + Enter + A (to Save).  </blockquote> <p>ALT+ M is the message menu.
