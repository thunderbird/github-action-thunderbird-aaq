So when you reinstall it picks up all the same data. </p><p>As a heads up, please do not use text shorthand as it can be ambiguous. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:There are a qty of folders in the mail folder with similarr names.</em> </p><p>It would be useful if you uploaded an image which shows all the Folder Pane folders so we know what you are talking about. </p><p>Are you using an imap or pop mail account&nbsp;? Pop accounts have the following default folders: Inbox, Drafts, Templates, Sent, Archives, Junk, Deleted. Some of these folders may appear when you first use them eg: Sent folder may appear after you send an email for the first time. </p><p>Imap accounts will have a similar set of default folders but the naming of folders depends upon the server. Imap folders should follow the same identical name as the server uses. As an example, sent emails may be in a 'Sent', or 'Sent Mail' or similar named folder. Some servers use a 'Trash' folder and others call it 'Bin'. Generally servers use a 'Spam' folder, but there has been a recent bug which for some reason is renaming imap 'Spam' or 'Bulk' as 'Junk' - no doubt it will be fixed soon. </p><p>It would be useful if you could say what server you are talking about and perhaps upload an image of the folders you see in the webmail account. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;: Also have 5 TBird Local plus subfolders in my main mallboxo - how do I remove those?</em> </p><p>First check to see if you have enabled 'Unified folders'. What is Unified folders&nbsp;? All the default folders get a 'Unified' status. So, you will see a 'Unified' Inbox which displays all the emails that are in all the various 'Inboxes' for all the accounts. It's a virtual view and the Inbox will have subfolders that look like account names/email addresses - each of them is actually the Inbox only for that account. If you normally have some subfolders in an accounts Inbox, then they will also display as subfolders to each accounts Inbox. </p><p>I suggest you switch it off if it is complicating the view. via 'Menu bar' or 'Menu app icon'  &gt;  View &gt; Folders &gt; make sure the 'All Folders' option is selected and uncheck the 'Unified Folder' option. </p><p>You should have 'Local Folders' account usually it displays at the bottom and it contains the 'Outbox' which is used by all accounts when you use the 'Send Later' option.  The 'Local Folders' account can also be used when people want to use several POP accounts but they do not wish to see all those listed in the Folder Pane - they want to combine them - set them up as deferred accounts using a Global Inbox. The 'Local Folders' account is also used in general for mail storage or by those who have IMAP account but need to get emails off the server to regain quota space. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1

At this point I'm not sure what you have actually got in those folders - so please post an image and make sure I can see the directory so I understand what is where.  </p><p>Usually when you want to move storage to D drive you use this process: </p> <ul><li> In D: Drive you would create a 'TBIRD' folder  </li><li> Exit Thunderbird if it was running </li><li> Access C://Users/Username/Appdata/Roaming/'Thunderbird' folder </li><li> Copy the 'Profiles' folder which contains all the 'profile name' folders and paste it into the D Drive 'TBird'   (profile name folders contain all preferences etc and pop accounts and Local Folders in a 'Mail' folder and imap accounts in an 'ImapMail' folder) </li><li> Then either - access the C://Users/Username/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird folder - open the 'profiles.ini' file and edit it to point to D:// TBird/Profiles/profile name folder </li><li> OR start Thunderbird and create a new Profile name and point it to use the profile name folder on the D: drive and set it up as the default. </li></ul> <p>Finally check the Account Settings &gt; Server Settings -   'Local directory: is pointing to the new location and do the same for the 'Local Folders' account. </p><p>So basically you still use the same structure but the Profiles are now on the D: drive. However, I'm not so sure sure you did the above - so can you post images that show me what is in: </p> <ul><li> D: drive 'TBird Local Mail' folder -  </li><li> D: drive 'TBird Mail' folder - please make sure the full directory of location is visible </li></ul> <p>Please make sure the full directory of location is visible and that the contents display viewing 'Details' which show column headers 'Modified date', 'Type', 'Size' - I'm looking for folder and file names as a list not images of folders. </p> <ul><li> Access C://Users/Username/Appdata/Roaming/'Thunderbird' folder </li><li> Open the 'profiles.ini' file using Notepad </li><li>  post an image showing contents. </li></ul> <ul><li> Access C://Users/Username/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/'Profiles' folder </li><li> Post an image showing all the 'profile name' folders </li></ul> <ul><li> Access  'Account Settings' &gt; 'Server Settings' for mail account  </li><li> Please post images of  'Local directory: directory data'  </li><li> And 'Local Folders' - 'Local directory: directory data' </li></ul> <p>Then I know what is pointing where. </p><p>RE: TBird Local It looks like you have attempted to delete that folder several times.  This is unlikely to work as the Local Folders account will always get recreated because it's a special account albeit at the moment it's in the wrong location. </p><p>As you already know, the 'Local Folders' account should appear as if another mail account and not within a mail account. </p><p>I notice you also have 'Unsent messages' in your main account and usually the 'Outbox' resides within the 'Local Folders' account. so, it looks like you have a duplicate of that as well. </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Are you using a Pop or IMAP mail account? I need to know because it effects how to deal with issue.  An IMAP mail account stores everything on the server and can only display a mirror copy of whatever is on the server. In other words, if this is an imap account - to not see 'TBird Local' you would need to unsubscribe from seeing it and then logon to webmail account via a browser and remove/delete, but only if required. </p><p>What I cannot see is if the Folder Pane has another correctly named  'Local Folders' account below the 'Trash' folders. Does it exist or not&nbsp;? </p><p>Regarding the 'TBird Local(1)' which has many folders eg: 'A Followups' etc Do you have any emails in any of those folders in that 'TBird Local(1)' account - or are all those folders completely empty at the moment? </p><p>If you are talking about a Pop account, then once I understand all the current set up and exactly where everything is located, I can advise you on what to move and to where. It may be possible to move the entire lot in one go and preserve all the folder names. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The crux of the problem, I now realise, is that BT has been flagging a lot of genuine emails as spam when they have been forwarded from namesco, but not flagging the same emails when they have come into @btinternet directly.

That is the action you need to do when it comes to instructing the server, so that emails are correctly put into the correct folder in the first place.

After all, even if you do use IMAP and see the SPAM folder, you do not want to keep having to move emails out of that folder. </p><p>When you stated those emails were 'good', they got put into the server 'Inbox' and therefore all emails could be downloaded to Thunderbird.

Thunderbird uses the Mozilla one. </p><p>My guess is your antivirus has placed a copy of their self signed encryption certificate in the Windows store so Outlook works.  It can not programmatically hack the chain of trust in the Mozilla store and you need to add it manually or disable the scanning that is causing the issue.  Just a guess based on Outlook working and Thunderbird not. </p><p>As there is an extension to that error that refers to excessive failed authentication attempts you might also want to ensure that the server is set in SMTP settings to require a normal password.  Most issuers result from folks that do not know their password changing that to none.  It does not work but it does give them a new message to work on.  No helpful,  but new to them </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Is this something I'd have to do in my anti-virus (McAfee)? </p><p>Another bit of info I just now thought to check.  I actually have two emails set up in T-Bird.  In addition to the Comcast account that is giving the problem, I also have a Gmail account.  It still works flawlessly.  Comparing the SMTP settings, I see that the Gmail has ""Authentication Method: OAuth2"", while the Comcast is set for ""Normal password"".  As a test, I changed that to OAuth2, but the result was the same, so I set it back to normal password. </p>",edstevens,false,0,0

Starting to poke around in McAfee for anything related to ""encryption certifiates"" I remembered that it also has a VPN, which I use when away from home.  Without changing anything in T-Bird, I turned on the VPN, then tested again.  This time sending the email works.  I'm not sure what it reveals, but seems like an important clue. </p>",edstevens,false,0,0

This time, instead of the ""server not available"", it prompted for a password.  I manually copied the pswd out of  my password keeper (BitWarden), pasted it into the prompt, and everything went through just fine. </p><p>So now T-bird is working again, but as I described in an earlier message, I also had problems with the Gmail client on my Android phone - only on the Comcast account.  Trying a test email there, the message went into the Outbox folder, with a status of 'pending'.  Then I noticed there was a background alter, prompting for a password.  Again, just like in T-bird on my laptop, I copied and pasted the password, and everything went through just fine.  On both platforms, subsequent tests were seamless, no errors, no password prompts. </p><p>Based on all this, I'd say the problem was at Comcast's end. However: 1) they had denied there was any issue on their end 2) Using Outlook had no problems </p><p>I'd love to discuss this on a broader forum - one that's not focused on problems in a single product.  I'm not sure where that would be.  In 2021 I retired from a 40-year career in IT, and it was not uncommon to have to get experts from multiple areas (app developer, network admin, database admin, OS admin) to work out a problem. </p>",edstevens,false,0,0
