For example, did you do it while Thunderbird was running? If so, that may have caused the profile copy to be corrupted and omit folders from the copy. If this is a windows computer, would you be able to restart the old computer and copy the profile again? Here are the basic steps for a successful transfer from one windows pc to another: </p><p>here is the info in brief steps:  </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is NOT running on old machine </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li><li> ensure thunderbird is installed on second computer and NOT running  </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there. This may prompt to overwrite an existing folder of same name. allow it </li><li> start thunderbird and all should be there </li></ol> <p>If doing that is not possible, can you create a screenshot of the profile folder that you copied to place on new computer? That would be very useful. If you are unsure how to do a screenshot to upload, let me know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So I doubt that is the issue. I would prefer to open PDF's directly in Thunderbird and not use an external app. </p>",moz42,false,0,0
