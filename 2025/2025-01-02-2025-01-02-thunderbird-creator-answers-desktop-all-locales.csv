Thunderbird version 115.14.0 64 bit.   </p><p>She claims she accidentally deleted the draft and now it can not be found.  I looked at her computer and it's not in the draft folder nor in the Trash.  Can anyone suggest where the file might be or if it's recoverable.   I see there are many different types of files used in Thunderbird, but, I don't know where her info might be.  </p><p>If possible, please help.

Specifically, when Yahoo users send me emails with embedded images (using ""Insert Image"" in Yahoo Mail), I only see the placeholder text ""Inline Image"" in the email body, while the actual images are moved to the bottom of the email as attachments. </p><p>When I tested receiving emails with embedded images from other email services (e.g., Thunderbird-to-Thunderbird), the images display correctly inline in the email body as intended. This issue seems specific to emails sent from Yahoo Mail. </p><p>I have already tried the following without success: </p><p>Ensuring that the ""mail.strictly_mime"" setting in Thunderbird is set to true. Testing different Yahoo Mail formatting options (e.g., HTML). Confirming that the Yahoo user is embedding images using ""Insert Image"" and not attaching them. Allowing remote content in Thunderbird settings. Is there any way to resolve this issue so that images sent by Yahoo Mail users appear inline in the email body, rather than as attachments at the bottom? </p><p>Thank you for your assistance. Please let me know if you need additional information or logs to investigate this issue further. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1699563;,naomiyangwork233
