There is no need to compact it.  When TB does compacting it fails on the LocalFolder, reporting not being able to compact files.lst. How can I restrict compacting to the mail folders proper only? Since moving emails and reading the archived works flawlessly with LocalFolder, the problem could be related to the owner of the compacting process.

Onlangs heb ik het wachtwoord van mijn Gmail-account moeten wijzigen. Nadien lukte het uiteraard niet meer om nieuwe mails op deze account binnen te krijgen, aangezien Thunderbird nog het oude wachtwoord gebruikte. Daarom heb ik mijn Gmail account verwijderd uit Thunderbird en nu wil ik het opnieuw installeren, maar dat lukt niet. Ik krijg elke keer weer een foutmelding (400) nadat ik de nieuwe account wil aanmaken. Ondertussen heb ik gevonden waar de wachtwoorden binnen Thunderbird worden bewaard. Daar heb ik de Gmail account ook verwijderd, zodat dit niet interfereert met de nieuwe installatie. Maar desondanks blijft er een foutmelding komen wanneer ik mijn Gmail wil installeren. Enig idee wat er gaande is? Of kan ik best Thunderbird in zijn geheel verwijderen en opnieuw installeren op mijn laptop? Dankjewel voor jullie hulp!
