When I try to get new messages, it seems to connect to my optusnet email account, then it will say Downloading message 1 of 27 and after about a minute it just disappears. Then it says no messages to download. The little blue progress bar also disappears.   I have checked the server settings. I am using Pop Mail Server, server name is <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a>, user name is my email address, Port is 995, Connection is SSL/TLS and Authentication is Normal password. I have tried turning off Firewall and Antivirus and still not coming through. Its like it connects and it can see the emails but it cant pull them across.  I am not a computer person. I dont know how to check any more than this. Please can someone help me. I have been using Thunderbird for many years and this issue has happened in the past but always resolved itself.

For the past few days, I'm told that emails are downloading but nothing shows up in my inbox. I can still view my latest emails via webmail but not with thunderbird. I've contacted my provider and they believe the problem lies with thunderbird and not optus. I've also unistalled and then reinstalled thunderbird and the same problem remains. Can you please help? thanks, Rosetta </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rmanasz

I now otherwise have to press ESC to stop this.   Before, I could ignore the pop-up modal and just keep typing -- that is what we expect in other apps, and this seems to be the case in Firefox (which I'm using now, and it works fine).    This suggests there may be some change or difference in TB that is causing this unwanted behavior. </p><p>I do not see that there are any settings to change this -- but before I dig too deeply, I want to understand why this change was made and whether I have a choice or setting I can fix this -- or if it's a bug. </p><p><br> Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",forrie1
