So, why not just use Thunderbird to do all of that, since it is easier (in my opinion) than using a web interface?

It will take me a very long time to sift through/organize/delete the messages I have, and I need to be able to receive new mail as soon as possible.  So being able to download and store the messages I have in a local mail client to free up the online Yahoo account to receive new mail is most important right now, unless there is another solution to that will allow me to free up the Yahoo account without having to purchase additional storage through Yahoo. </p>",jbchylln,false,0,0

Set the interval to 10 min. instead of 1 min. and see if it helps.  If the account is IMAP and the server supports instant notifications, mail will be downloaded anyway as soon as it arrives at the server. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
