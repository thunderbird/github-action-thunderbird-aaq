Some of the suggestions refer to settings that are no longer there compared to earlier versions. For example, Settings &gt; General &gt; Language and Fonts has no format options. I have also used the config editor while TB was not running and added <strong>ntl.date_time.pattern_override.date_short</strong> and <strong>ntl.date_time.pattern_override.time_short</strong>, without any effect. Dates in the calendar still always appear in the illogical American <em>month-day-year</em> format. This is confusing, to say the least&nbsp;!

Per comodità ho sempre tenuto la cartella Mail in altra posizione su altro volume, ma mai avuto problemi a indicarla a thunderbird nelle impostazioni server e a far leggere i messaggi. La particolarità è che appena installate e indicate le cartelle, mi da il conto esatto del numero di email e Mb occupati per ogni cartella ma cliccando su una cartella, per esempio ""posta in arrivo"" ,o altre, il conto si azzera e non risultano messaggi. differenze sostanziali sono: da processore intel a M1, da sequioa a Tahoe, per il resto non mi sembra ci siano grosse differenze. Ho disistallato e reistallato un paio di volte thunderbird per aggiornarlo, ma niente. Il problema è importare i messaggi perché il programma funziona perfettamente (scarica e invia i messaggi). grazie </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,it,1770998;,info13110
