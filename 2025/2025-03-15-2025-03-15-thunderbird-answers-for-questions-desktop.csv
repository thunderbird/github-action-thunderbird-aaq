I'm not a technical guru, but part of the challenge is that thunderbird does not release its hold on files, causing a backup done while thunderbird is running to be incomplete or corrupt. My personal approach is to run a daily backup at a time when I know thunderbird is not running. I also run a standalone backup weekly for safety.

I did as you advised and whilst I was asked for the pin, the pin button was 'greyed out'. I understand the pin can be reset by going to Settings, Accounts then Sign in Options but there was nothing under Account Actions to allow me to do this. Again from the Tool Bar, I tried Account Settings but again there was no sign in option then I tried Account Actions underneath but again no sign in option. </p><p>Thank you again and I hope that you can shed some light on what I may be missing as I only have the forums to ask for help from. </p><p>Kind Regards Sharon </p>",sharon68,false,0,0

In settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, the letters PIN are grey, but you should be able to enter your PC sign in code. However, if you are having errors in signing in, the password stored in thunderbird is no help, as that is the password being rejected. Retrieving it may just be going down a rabbithole. Another possibility is that there may be an error in the account setting. For example, if you changed the email address on account from his to yours, that would explain a password error. Are you able to log onto the account online? Browsers often retain the password that last worked. You might check the saved passwords in your browser or your husband's to see if the password is there. Do look there. Steps to do that vary by browser. If that fails, contacting the email provider's support line may do what you want. They may need some proof of account, and that varies by email provider. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
