The safe way to do a backup is to backup the entire profile all at once when thunderbird is not running. That is the best assurance that a restore will work flawlessly. I routinely see posts here where a proprietary backup could not be properly restored and had to be done piecemeal. I'm not a technical guru, but part of the challenge is that thunderbird does not release its hold on files, causing a backup done while thunderbird is running to be incomplete or corrupt. My personal approach is to run a daily backup at a time when I know thunderbird is not running. I also run a standalone backup weekly for safety. I share here my technique:  </p><p>here is the info in brief steps:  </p><p><strong>BACKUP</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is not running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol> <p><strong>RESTORE</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is installed and NOT running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there.
