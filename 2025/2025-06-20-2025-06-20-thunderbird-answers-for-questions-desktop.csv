Eleven is a POS which is why I want to finally move off M$ altogether.

Thanks for your assistance. </blockquote> <p>A mail client;  such as Thunderbird,Outlook or even others such as the venerable Eudora can only connect to the sever using the settings configured and published by the mail administrator for the server you are connecting to.  Anything else you are told by the script readers at OPTUS is rubbish.  They set the connection parameters and ALL mail clients have to use them, not just Thunderbird. </p><p>There are some serious irregularities with Optus,  they specify ports to use currently that the rest of the world abandoned as obsolete some 25 years ago.  That was about the time I closed my Optus account,  than would have been 1997.  But Optus publish those setting as the correct ones, selected and promoted by them. </p><p>SO please do check your settings against those Optus publish.  Paying particular attention to the type of account you have.   </p><p>You need to also be aware that many antivirus programs other than Windows Defender scan email by hacking the encryption certificates used.  This requires a manual self signed certificate to be added to Thunderbird to allow this hacking to occur.  It is common in my experience that those with Optus also tend to use Norton product and these are well known for having issues with Certificates.  The bluemail email program has a support document advising how to change Avast and Norton to fix that issue. <a href=""https://bluemail.me/help/windows-antivirus/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bluemail.me/help/windows-antivirus/</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I was already using OAuth2 and always using <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>. There isn't option to set Incoming Outgoing separately.  I followed your suggestion to remove those two other OAuth entries in Password list relating to Gmail access. I restarted TB and it opened the Google access window which I OKed TB to read and access my mail. The app went back into TB app so it appears I'm still able to download emails.  I then did a test to send new e-mail. it opened the Google access window (again) which I OKed TB to read and access my mail. Then it gave me that same window of those 3 options ""Retry, Enter New Password or Cancel"". ....until I eventually get the time out window: Sending of the message failed. Unable to authenticate to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a>. Please check the password and verify the 'Authentication method' in 'Account Settings | Outgoing server (SMTP)'. </p><p>I'm using IMAP so not sure why the error message is saying SMTP. I now have two OAuth entries in Passwords. I can receive e-mail but cannot send.  </p><p>Thanks. </p>",dannychung99,false,0,0

The outgoing server uses the same oauth:// token as the incoming, as long as you have the account sending on the correct smtp (select the account in the left pane of Account Settings, set the server in the Outgoing Server (SMTP) dropdown in the right pane). </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I noticed the error message had an extra m in ...@gmail.comm. I found this in the Outgoing Server email name (which I swear I never touched this field today during password change). I removed the extra m and I'm now able to send out emails. Never actually asked me for the new password. </p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>,dannychung99,false,0,0
