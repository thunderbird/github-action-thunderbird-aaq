I deleted my session.json in case it was corrupt. But I verified that, when I close Thunderbird, it creates a new session.json that only contains information for the main window, and not the additional windows.  How do I get Thunderbird to store my ENTIRE session, including all the open windows, in session.json? </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1768042;,rmqjones
