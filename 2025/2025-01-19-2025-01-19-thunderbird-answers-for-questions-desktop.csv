Now when I create a third account, it works well but when I disconnect I loose the account and have to recreate it again.  How come? </blockquote> <p>In every instance of that sort of issue the cause has been Thunderbird being unable to write the updated prefs.js file to disk when it is closed.  In Windows this is most usually caused by software blocking Thunderbird (read usually antivirus) but as this is a contention issue it can have many causes&gt;  Some examples are the profile being stored on a remote drive or some sort of home brew cloud synchronization that does not really work, only looks like it, or in extreme cases the disk has errors and the operating system can not overwrite the existing file.  On  non windows system antivirus is less of an issue,  but on those folk do things like run Thunderbird in a temp folder and it is deleted on every startup. </p><p>So first check in the troubleshooting information on the help menu that your newly added account is truly no longer in the saved settings (look at ""Mail and News accounts"") then start looking for the cause of the contention.   </p><p>The exception to the above is adding a POP mail account with the use of the global inbox which will not see the account appear in the folder list as mail will go to local folders. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I do not need to qualify myself with regard to experience using Thunderbird, however l have been using MT for 15 years plus, so as a Moderator don't assume l have just come over from POP to IMAP. You would be very wrong. Nevertheless l again thank you for your time. May l ask that you re-read my request and look at the attached screen shots. Your quote, ""<em>The only thing I change is not immediately marking messages as read.""</em> is presumptuous because l cannot, repeat...cannot change that setting. Maybe l did not explain that problem clearly in the beginning, if so, my bad, however if l could deselect that option then we would not be having this discussion. Obviously that is the first and most obvious thing to do. So may l ask you Wayne, can you explain then, why l cannot uncheck ''<em>""Mark all messages as being read""</em>? That is my main problem at the moment. Cheers  </p><p>PS: With regard to your Item #1...trust me, there are quite a few 128 users becoming frustrated with the same issue as l am having.

Is this something that is relatively new? I have not used TB in about 1 year. </blockquote> <p>No, it's not new. It's how all Imap accounts work no matter what third party email client you use. All Imap accounts can only display whatever is on server.  That is their purpose, emails are stored on server and Imap accounts gets access to server and all folders on the server. Imap accounts synchronise with server. Because all Imap accounts are designed to only display whatever is on server, you should never consider anything to be an independent copy on your computer. The benefit of Imap accounts means you can see identical emails via browser accessing webmail account and any other including multiple devices that use imap eg: Desktop, Laptop, phone that use imap to access emails.  </p><p>Pop accounts are different. Pop accounts can only access the server Inbox and download emails from that folder. They cannot access any other folder on server. Pop accounts store emails on your computer. They do not synchronise with server. Deleting emails off server has no effect on emails fully downloaded into a Pop mail account. Pop accounts are considered an independent copy on your computer. Pop accounts are best used when you only access via one computer.  </p><p>If you use Imap and need to keep a separate copy of emails so originals can be deleted off server, then fully download them and then get 'Copy' into a suitable fiolder in 'Local Folders' account. Emails stored in 'Local Folders' account are an independent copy and do not synchronise with server. Once you have a good copy you can remove emails off the server. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
