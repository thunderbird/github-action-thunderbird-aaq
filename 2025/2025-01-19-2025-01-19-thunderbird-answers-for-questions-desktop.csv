I'm not sure of your location, but FWIW l'm in Australia, Sunday @ 11.12pm, replying via my phone, so l will keep this msg as short as possible. With respect Wayne, l find your reply somewhat defensive and condescending. I do not need to qualify myself with regard to experience using Thunderbird, however l have been using MT for 15 years plus, so as a Moderator don't assume l have just come over from POP to IMAP. You would be very wrong. Nevertheless l again thank you for your time. May l ask that you re-read my request and look at the attached screen shots. Your quote, ""<em>The only thing I change is not immediately marking messages as read.""</em> is presumptuous because l cannot, repeat...cannot change that setting. Maybe l did not explain that problem clearly in the beginning, if so, my bad, however if l could deselect that option then we would not be having this discussion. Obviously that is the first and most obvious thing to do. So may l ask you Wayne, can you explain then, why l cannot uncheck ''<em>""Mark all messages as being read""</em>? That is my main problem at the moment. Cheers  </p><p>PS: With regard to your Item #1...trust me, there are quite a few 128 users becoming frustrated with the same issue as l am having.

Is this something that is relatively new? I have not used TB in about 1 year. </blockquote> <p>No, it's not new. It's how all Imap accounts work no matter what third party email client you use. All Imap accounts can only display whatever is on server.  That is their purpose, emails are stored on server and Imap accounts gets access to server and all folders on the server. Imap accounts synchronise with server. Because all Imap accounts are designed to only display whatever is on server, you should never consider anything to be an independent copy on your computer. The benefit of Imap accounts means you can see identical emails via browser accessing webmail account and any other including multiple devices that use imap eg: Desktop, Laptop, phone that use imap to access emails.  </p><p>Pop accounts are different. Pop accounts can only access the server Inbox and download emails from that folder. They cannot access any other folder on server. Pop accounts store emails on your computer. They do not synchronise with server. Deleting emails off server has no effect on emails fully downloaded into a Pop mail account. Pop accounts are considered an independent copy on your computer. Pop accounts are best used when you only access via one computer.  </p><p>If you use Imap and need to keep a separate copy of emails so originals can be deleted off server, then fully download them and then get 'Copy' into a suitable fiolder in 'Local Folders' account. Emails stored in 'Local Folders' account are an independent copy and do not synchronise with server. Once you have a good copy you can remove emails off the server. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
