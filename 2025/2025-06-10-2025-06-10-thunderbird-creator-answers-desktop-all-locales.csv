The email appears in the destination folder, but it never actually gets deleted from the source account's server. </p><p>If I click on the inbox of the source account again, Thunderbird just re-syncs with the server and downloads the same email all over again. In my mind, when I ""move"" something, it should be gone from the original location. It feels more like a ""copy and then forget to delete"" situation. </p><p>I'm trying to figure out how to make the ""move"" action permanent. I want the email to be completely removed from the source account when I move it, not just hidden on my local client until the next sync. </p><p>Is there a setting I'm missing, or is this just how Thunderbird handles moving emails between accounts? It's making it a real headache to keep my inboxes organized. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",thunderbird;account-management;,thunderbird,account-management,en-US,"",smithktrevor
