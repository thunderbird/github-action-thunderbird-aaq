Obviously after a couple of years they're meaningless and anything important I might've needed, I've dealt with. Is there a way to delete the rest of these unwanted-unneeded emails other than just clicking away as I've been doing. Also....this has caused a problem with compacting my Inbox emails. Any help out there would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Thank you, Michael.... </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1741010;1741043;,MKS1

Since I installed the client from the Microsoft Store, will it get automatically updated to the previous channel or will I have to do it manually? If I am not mistaken, to move between channels you need to do it yourself. How will this work with the Store version? </p><p>Thank you for your time. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1740913;,iliaskslr
