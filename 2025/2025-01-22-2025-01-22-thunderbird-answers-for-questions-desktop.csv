I have looked at the thread: For this step...(Select account 1 in the left pane of Account Settings, then click the Outgoing Server (SMTP) drop-down so smtp1 is selected. Select account 2 in the left pane of Account Settings, then click the Outgoing Server (SMTP) drop-down so smtp2 is selected. Same for 3 and 4)...the drop down only shows Charter Communications. It doesn't show smtp1. Also this Outgoing Server option is only available when I click on the primary email account. It's not shown on the 2nd &amp; 3rd. </p>",cgreen82,false,0,0

You can then associate each of those SMTP servers with a different account / identity. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Where would I see/add the smtp1, smtp2 and so on? Would it be better to delete the 2nd &amp; 3rd accounts and start over? I don't remember seeing an option to add additional servers when I added those accounts. </p>",cgreen82,false,0,0

Is that what you're missing now or do you mean something else? </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Look at the Outgoing Server (SMTP) settings window shown in the following article. That's what you have to use to add more SMTP server settings: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cannot-send-messages</a> </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

It says <em>""Google - 400 That's an error. The server cannot process the request because it is malformed.  It should not be retried.  That's all we know.""</em> I can't do anything else with it but exit from it.  And then the message pops up again. I don't know why after all these years Google is asking me to sign in.   I would like to disable the message for the Google sign in on my home computer using Windows 10.  I do not use Thunderbird on my mobile phone - it's not necessary. </p>",renemcdonnell,false,0,0

Something you may try is going to your Google (not Gmail) account settings and check your Security settings there. Thunderbird should appear in the list of connections to third-party apps and services. Maybe you can see something there that sheds some light on this. Deleting that connection and re-authorising Thunderbird again would be an option to consider… </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
