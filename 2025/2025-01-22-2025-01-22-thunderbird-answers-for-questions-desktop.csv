I have looked at the thread: For this step...(Select account 1 in the left pane of Account Settings, then click the Outgoing Server (SMTP) drop-down so smtp1 is selected. Select account 2 in the left pane of Account Settings, then click the Outgoing Server (SMTP) drop-down so smtp2 is selected. Same for 3 and 4)...the drop down only shows Charter Communications. It doesn't show smtp1. Also this Outgoing Server option is only available when I click on the primary email account. It's not shown on the 2nd &amp; 3rd. </p>",cgreen82,false,0,0

You can then associate each of those SMTP servers with a different account / identity. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

Something you may try is going to your Google (not Gmail) account settings and check your Security settings there. Thunderbird should appear in the list of connections to third-party apps and services. Maybe you can see something there that sheds some light on this.
