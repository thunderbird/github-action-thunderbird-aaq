It does certainly qualify as a bug and there is a particular reason for it. </p><p>Folders in Thunderbird correspond to files in mbox format within the user profile folder. When you tell Thunderbird to change the name of a folder, you're telling it to change the name of the corresponding mbox file in the filesystem. Now, filesystems can be case sensitive or insensitive, meaning filenames that vary only in case may be considered to be different or not. So my guess is that before renaming the mbox file, Thunderbird checks whether a file with the new name already exists in that location, and if the filesystem is case insensitive, the result will be that yes, a file with the new name already exists, namely the very file it's trying to rename…&nbsp;:) </p><p>Fortunately, this has an easy workaround.
