When I start Thunderbird I can view my calendar as usual, and it is all in place.

My various calendars are listed, but all appear empty, and Tasks are similarly empty. When on my email, the Tasks bar is still working. </p><p>I can see a similar question on the forum, to which the solution was to delete calendar add-ons. I have tbSync and its dependency installed; I tried deleting them (by moving the relevant folders out of .thunderbird and restarting) and this did not help.
