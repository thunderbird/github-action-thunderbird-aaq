1512967,2025-05-20 22:25:16 -0700,2025-05-20 22:49:25 -0700,Thunderbird local folders disappeared,"<p>After years of using Thunderbird (PC) as a POP email client without issues, one day my client discovered the body text of his emails wouldn't display: not in the preview pane, nor when the email was opened into a separate tab. I tried the recommendations I found online (repair the folders, rebuild them by deleting the associated .msf files, relaunch in Troubleshoot Mode) but none fixed the problem. I decided to create a new Thunderbird profile to see if the problem persisted—but the password I had for the account didn't work, so I wasn't able to finish the test. I reassigned the original profile as the default, exited Thunderbird and relaunched it. But when it came back up in the original profile, none of my client's custom folders, containing years worth of carefully organized emails, appeared. Only the Inbox, Trash, etc., with the same problem of not displaying the body text.  </p><p>So my first objective is to get my client's custom folders to display as they had before I created the second profile; my next objective is to try to get the body text to display in his messages. Any suggestions welcome! The profile folder is located on a file server, and is fully accessible by the PC, with full permissions.
