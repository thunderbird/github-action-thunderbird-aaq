Others had suggested in other threads to hit enter and that would get a new field, but all that did was take me to the subject field. I tried your suggestion again just now, and it did work. I'm pretty sure the issue was between the keyboard and the chair earlier, so thanks for getting me to test it again!&nbsp;:)  Scuter </p>",scuter,false,0,0

So that did not help at all.  I would not ask but I think that might be critical here, as it sounds like someone promoting something that has nothing to do with either Thunderbird or Proton so they probably left out something important from the instructions. </p><p>Eventually I got to this https://realitycheck.radio/digitalid-au/  which to all intents and purposes is some sort of money making scheme stating the obvious with a good sized sprinkling of fear mongering from a couple of antivaxers.  As they want my information to begin to share the very special information they have to offer I stopped at the front door to the website.

Yes ""The Digital ID Resist Kit"" is put out by NZ Media but promoted by ACA Aligned Council of Australia because of the Australian introduction of the Under 16 Social Media Ban in Dec 2025. It should be easily available on the Internet. The instructions did not all follow as set out but mainly was helpful.  </p><p>I paid a 2 year subscription of A$306.96 on December 29 and went about transferring 3 Gmail accounts and 1 Hotmail account into the Thunderbird and its provider account Proton.  </p><p>As of this morning everything was in and coming into both the Thunderbird and Proton and under the names of 4 emails and seemed useful and easy to manage. Today the Thunderbird info has disappeared and I can only access the Proton account. One Gmail didn't seem to complete its transfer yesterday and I now I am on the merry-go-round of being asked by Microsoft to login and complete the their password to allow Proton to access their accounts.You mention ""bridge"" and I did try to download it but got the response Page not found and Not availala </p><p><br> Sent with Proton Mail secure email. </p>",bglenrae,false,0,0
