So how is is possible to copy folders from one to the other? If the main Thunderbird folders are the same, where placement of them may or may not be self evident. This isn't going to be quite that simple in as much as I will likely use the same hardware - meaning I will have  to save images of the current set up. Then after installing Linux, I would have to use the images to source the windows setup. I have several large drives, including a large external Drobo backup system. This is all speculative, as I need to learn and determine whether of not this would be feasible. Thanks anyways, Gerald </p>",gshantz,false,0,0

When you try to read emails on your laptop Gmail will send a request to your phone saying a new device is trying to connect to Gmail. You must answer the question on your phone telling that is you trying to connect using a new device. Gmail will then let your laptop read and have access to your Gmail account. This stops people who don't have your phone from reading your emails because on another device. They can't answer the question with out your phone to tell Gmail it is you trying to connect with a new device. I think this is the same with all email systems. So leave your phone on when you connect with a new device so you can tell Gmail it is you trying to connect. It's a pain in the rear end.  Hope this works for you because I had the same problem.
