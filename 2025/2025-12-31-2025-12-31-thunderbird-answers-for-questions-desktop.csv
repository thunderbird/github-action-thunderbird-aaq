No sign of the three Gmail emails and a fourth, a hotmail account cannot be verified for Proton as it relies on verification for the three Gmail emails now cancelled. I downloaded Thunderbird last week and my Gmail emails were downloaded to it and up until 3 days ago they were there and accessible.  I was advised to create a Proton account as my provider which I did. No password was made available for Thunderbird but the one for Proton is [edited]@proton.me - I paid a 2 year subscription. Proton informed me by email my Account was paused. Since then I have no access to Thunderbird and my only other account [edited]@hotmail.com cannot be verified because the three Gmail accounts were its contacts and now are not available for confirmation.

When you try to read emails on your laptop Gmail will send a request to your phone saying a new device is trying to connect to Gmail. You must answer the question on your phone telling that is you trying to connect using a new device. Gmail will then let your laptop read and have access to your Gmail account. This stops people who don't have your phone from reading your emails because on another device. They can't answer the question with out your phone to tell Gmail it is you trying to connect with a new device. I think this is the same with all email systems. So leave your phone on when you connect with a new device so you can tell Gmail it is you trying to connect. It's a pain in the rear end.  Hope this works for you because I had the same problem.
