It also looks like I'm the only one reporting the slowness, adding to the unlikeliness anything will be done. </p><p>I have persuaded three people, non-Thunderbird users, to install Thunderbird 137.0.1 using POP3 so I could have some feedback. All three reported the noticeable slowness. They then installed TB 115.18.0 and the slowness was not there. Two of them have three email accounts and one has four. Far cry lower than my now eleven. In my opinion this negates anything to do with my system or accounts. </p><p>My decision is to roll back to TB 102.15.1 since it was by far the most reliable client. I have had zero issues with it. Others may have had issues but I haven't. I would stay with 115.18.0 but is has a few bugs that I don't care for. These bugs have been fixed in a later 128 release. </p><p>I'm also testing a different client but that's not for here. </p><p>Thank you for everything and I wish a great future for Thunderbird. </p>",gmx2k9,false,7,0
