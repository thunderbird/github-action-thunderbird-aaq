I have had copies of Thunderbird both on my Windows 11 desktop and on my Windows 11 laptop.  When I am at home I use the desktop and when I travel I use the laptop.  When I leave home I copy the entire Profile directory from Appdata /Roaming  directory to the Laptop and then reverse when I return home. Last week I returned home and no matter what I tried I couldn't get the Desktop to use the Profile transferred from the Laptop.  It poped up a message that the version was wrong.  Upon checking the Thunderbird version on the Laptop I saw it was newer than Desktop.   So I uninstalled Thunderbird and reinstalled only to find out that downloaded version was still behind the Laptop.  So today I finally was able to install the newest version on the Desktop but now I get the popup titled Profile missing with the following message ""Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."" </p><p>Any help appreciated getting Thunderbird working on my Desktop. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1710066;,gbechthold

Sometimes Thunderbird just stops receiving e-mails. We can send messages but they can be saved only in local folder. In browser e-mails arrive and we can send them without any problems so it has to be some problem with Thunderbird. We were trying a lot of solutions, but only one works - creating new profile. It is very time-consuming solution, because we have to copy all e-mails, contacts, user settings, etc and we have to create a new profile couple times in a month... We were trying to off our antyvirus, forget password, etc. Probably there is some problem with certificates, but we do not know how to fix it. We use IMAP.

I can go to Xfinity and use the same login info and check my mail there and it works.

I know it probably has to do with the way I set up Thunderbird when I installed it. </p><p>I have tried every fix I found online but the check box to delete that email account remains greyed out and the login prompt keeps popping up followed by the message saying that login to that email has failed. Over and over.

I could uninstall Thunderbird and re-enter just the working emails I want to monitor but I am afraid that I will lose a lot of info and I don't want that, or worse the new install will use all the same data again. </p><p>If the email was tied in somehow to the framework of Thunderbird upon installation is there a way to get that ""remove account"" not be greyed out? </p><p>Any thoughts are appreciated.

Recently I have been having certain e-mails not being able to send through Microsoft Exchange. I have OWL support for both of them to work correctly. It is usually an e-mail over 8mb of attachments or some time it has been an e-mail with a lot of wording in the body, like lots of replies I have had to delete most of the info in the body to get it to send. If I send it through my G-Mail account it goes no problem. The Message it gives me is ""Sending of the Message failed. The server had an internal error. This is always a problem of the server and not of you or your application."" I tried to go online through <a href=""http://office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">office.com</a> to send it that way, and it worked. My internet guy thinks it is Thunderbird but doesn't use it and really doesn't know anything about Thunderbird. Most of my guys that work on my business computers don't know anything about Thunderbird. My office manager has Thunderbird and is not having this problem. I am not the best with internet or mail configurations. This is getting frustrating. I am hoping someone know what the problem is and it is an easy fix. Please let me know if you have any ideas, I don't like outlook and some of the other apps for mail.

A few days ago, my hard drive died.  I had it replaced, and I've used my data backup to recover much.  I did NOT have programs/apps backed up. I need VERY SPECIFIC steps to download and reinstall Thunderbird so that it uses my old profile.  Should I first delete EVERYTHING having to do with Thunderbird and start anew?  I did download it today and then went to the C:Users/Owner/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird folder.  In that folder, I deleted the ""new"" profile file (I think!).  Then I moved my backed up folder called Profiles into that directory.  I tried to get Thunderbird to use that profile, but no luck. I'm reasonably intelligent (I've been told!), but I can't figure how to do this, and I truly need a step-by-step blueprint. Do I download Thunderbird first?  If so, what do I then do to make it find the old profile.  I'm running Windows 11 Home on a PC. Right now, I'm going for a long walk to clear my brain.  In the interim, if one of you really smart, nice experts could give me instructions on how to do this, I'd be eternally grateful.  I have numerous folders, and some really important old emails in that old profile.  I also would like to be able to retrieve my address book and calendars ... which I ASSUME are part of the old profile. Thanks in advance for ANY assistance!
