I have had copies of Thunderbird both on my Windows 11 desktop and on my Windows 11 laptop.  When I am at home I use the desktop and when I travel I use the laptop.  When I leave home I copy the entire Profile directory from Appdata /Roaming  directory to the Laptop and then reverse when I return home. Last week I returned home and no matter what I tried I couldn't get the Desktop to use the Profile transferred from the Laptop.  It poped up a message that the version was wrong.  Upon checking the Thunderbird version on the Laptop I saw it was newer than Desktop.   So I uninstalled Thunderbird and reinstalled only to find out that downloaded version was still behind the Laptop.  So today I finally was able to install the newest version on the Desktop but now I get the popup titled Profile missing with the following message ""Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."" </p><p>Any help appreciated getting Thunderbird working on my Desktop. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,"",gbechthold
