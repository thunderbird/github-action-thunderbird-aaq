It's much better to ask your own question because your query is being sent to the person who asked this question in the first place. They may not appreciate responses that are not relevant.  When you create a question add some additional info like what OS you use, what version of Thunderbird, whether this is an imap or pop account, what Anti-Virus you use. But first check this - please access Anti-Virus and create an exception to not scan your Thunderbird profile folder because any file that opened is being scanned (used by AV) before Thunderbird can access it to write incoming mail etc.  You might want to also switch off scanning incoming/outgoing mail to see if it improves things.

Ik ben niet heel bekend met alle details maar ook als ik de mappen daar verwijder dan komen ze weer terug. Zie de bijlage van de bestandsnamen. Als ik b.v. de map 2000&amp;AAk-Canada.msf verwijder (dit is de map die minder zwart en cursief in Thunderbird getoond wordt) en ik start Thunderbird weer opnieuw op dan komt de map gewoon weer terug. Wat ik ook probeer ik krijg de map niet weg. Het lijkt erop dat het toch ergens van de server van de provider vandaan moet komen maar het vreemde is dat ik deze mappen in webmail en ook op mijn iPhone niet zie. </p>",aad3,false,0,0

Als je het .msf-bestand verwijdert, dan wordt bij opnieuw starten van Thunderbird een nieuw .msf-bestand aangemaakt. Deze truc gebruiken we wel eens als een map corrupt is geraakt. Maar hier lijkt het andersom te gaan en dat is niet logisch. Om een map ‘2000&amp;AAk-Canada’ te tonen verwacht ik ook een bestand met die naam in de profielmap. Kan het zijn dat niet alle bestanden en mappen zichtbaar zijn in Windows? Klik daarvoor op ‘Weergave’ en dan ‘Verborgen items’. </p>",Mozilla-assistent,false,0,0
