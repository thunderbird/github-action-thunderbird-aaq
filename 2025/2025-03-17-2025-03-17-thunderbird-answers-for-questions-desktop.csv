I don't think the screenshots reveal anything untoward as they function perfectly well in the existing setup on the laptop. </p><p>I am not at the PC at the moment to get a screen shot of the error message but its a timeout error message that is appearing. I had gone into the configuration in the Thunderbird settings and extended the time out from 100 to 300 but to no avail. I am trying to resolve the problem an want to be sure that there is nothing in Thunderbird itself which may be the issue before assessing any firewall or anti virus software issues. </p>",info12757,false,0,0
