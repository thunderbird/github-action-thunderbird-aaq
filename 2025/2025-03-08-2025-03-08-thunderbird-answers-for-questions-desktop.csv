To answer your questions, I think my version of Thunderbird is 128.7.2 and version of NVDA is 2024.4.2. The bug you linked to isn't related at all to what I'm asking about, but it did get me to the point where I can file a new bug report, which I will do in a bit.

I see no point in moving to a less tested environment and having more issues. ESR releases are plagued with xxx.X.1 and xxx.X.2 point releases because the standards being applied are seeing serious defects in release software. Perhaps the delay in getting these new half baked features will be a godsend because once you install Monthly, there is no going back to your ESR version with you existing profile without pain.

You can drag and drop contact within an address book to a mailing list and they will appear there but the base record will still appear in the address book.v  It also makes it possible for the same contact to be in multiple mailing lists,  like congregation, deacons and Youth Club in a religious type context.

I can drag a contact, or multiple contacts (so long as I make sure what I'm dragging doesn't include the target mailing list itself), from an address book to a mailing list *within that address book* but I'm afraid that doesn't help, or at least I can't see how it helps. I have a bunch of addresses, and I want to avoid the tedious, and error-prone, process of having to scroll through, find, and select each individual contact to drag them to the mailing list in which I need them to be.  </p><p>The existing mailing lists are all within one address book. I could import the new addresses into that address book, but then they'd just be mixed in with all the existing addresses there and I'd be back to tedious and error prone. And I can import them into a new address book, where they'll be separate like I need them initially, and put them into a mailing list in that address book, but then I can't drag them from either that address book or that mailing list into a mailing list in another address book - back to the tedious again.  </p><p>I get the idea of a mailing list being a view into an address book, rather than a separate set of contacts, and speaking as a coder, I might kinda like it - if I weren't having so much trouble with it as a user. But it seems very reasonable to want to import such a view from an outside file, and to be able to drag those views between address books, so long as the contacts in the view exist in the target address book. I can't be the only person who needs to verify and confirm batches of new addresses before adding them to existing mailing lists. </p>",samarak,false,0,0

With the restrictions most of the mail providers are bringing in with regards to volues of mail almost everyone with serious mailing list needs has moved to mailhouses.  Even the Thunderbird project uses one. List I checked the project used the services of <a href=""https://mailchimp.com/?currency=AUD"" rel=""nofollow"">mailchimp </a> </p><p>But for the purposes of verifying folk for inclusion, I would tend to use something like <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/mail-merge/"" rel=""nofollow"">mailmerge </a>for most of my group mailing needs and it works with the CSV file as well as address books and mailing lists.  It also obviates the risks associated with the necessity placing the list in BCC instead of CC or to and breaching the European privacy laws by accident.  But I have been using mail merge in one form or another since Word V2 for Windows and AmiPro came across my desk, in the 1980s I guess it was, to create personalized correspondence. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Many of these are people who signed up on paper at an event, so there's a considerable chance of transcription error by the time I get the address. And a few will have reconsidered and decided they don't want to hear from us after all. Mail merge may let me do that, but how does it help me get those addresses into the existing mailing list once they've been verified in a single mass operation - not one by one? (I've used mail merge in other software - Word, Excel, etc. - but not TB.) </p><p>We're trying to avoid the expense associated with the mailhouses - *small* non-profit. We send a couple of dozen emails a year.  </p><p>It seems crazy that there's no way to create a mailing list from a CSV file in a selected address book, and that there's no way to merge a mailing list into another in a different address book.
