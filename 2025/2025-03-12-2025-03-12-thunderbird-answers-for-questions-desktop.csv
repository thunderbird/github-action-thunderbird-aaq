Hopefully you have no tread enough to know that nothing in Thunderbird has regard to the senders address in filtering junk.  Something you made quite a bit about in your initial posting.. </p><p>You should have also come away with the knowledge that Thunderbird is only one leg of a three legged stool when it comes to junk filtering and personally I doubt your issue has anything to do with Thunderbird. </p> <blockquote> It has a note that says, ""You should frequently... check your Junk folder for good messages wrongly marked as Junk."" No;  </blockquote>   <p>That is generic good advice for everyone at all times with any mail client or webmail.  Checking the junk filter for incorrectly filtered mail is something everyone should be doing frequently.  Especially with providers like Yahoo and Google that auto delete junk after a week or two. Don't do it and they will not only misclassify your mail,  but will delete it as well. </p> <blockquote> if I have to look at every message that the filter thinks is junk, the filter does nothing useful, and I might as well turn it off. </blockquote> <p>I strongly encourage you to do exactly that. Right now  </p><p>Then if the issue stops we will know the issue is in Thunderbird junk filter and if it does not stop the issue lies elsewhere.   </p> <blockquote> Whitelisting is not an effective filtering strategy. I need to be able to <em>blacklist</em> senders by clicking a message's Junk button or something like it. Thunderbird does not appear to have a blacklist. The term does not appear in the document you linked. </blockquote> <p>There is no blacklist.  You did not see one listed because it does not exist.  Perhaps apply the information under the heading ""Other ways of blocking unwanted messages"" to obtain your aims.   </p><p>Perhaps consult with your elected representatives if you have issues with persistent junk.  I do not have issues in my jurisdiction, getting perhaps 10 unwanted unsolicited commercial email a week.  Other countries with poorer regulation / laws with regard to unsolicited email  apparently have more issues.  I regularly see folk in this forum from the USA complaining about hundreds of such things each day, I can only put the difference down to the legislative branch of government as it is not my experience. </p> <blockquote> I see one possible solution: <em>if</em> clicking the Junk button actually adds the sender to a blacklist,  </blockquote> <p>As the support document says ""Thunderbird's adaptive junk filter is not an absolute barrier against messages from a specific address or specific types of messages.

Nothing will confuse a tool that uses the content of a message to determine is is is spam than having every bit of text manually classified as spam. </p><p>Perhaps you should delete the files  </p> <blockquote> I haven't tried that because I can't figure out exactly what clicking Junk does, or how adaptive filtering works. The document you linked does not explain those things. If that's not a solution I need a different one, and I hope you can help me find it. </blockquote> <p>The article I linked to states ""Thunderbird's adaptive filter uses a Bayes algorithm plus training data you have collected to determine which messages it will automatically set as junk""  Wikipedia can add to how that works as Bayesian algebra and it's application to spam scoring. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Spam_filtering"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Spam_filtering</a> It is a mathematical process which I do not pretend to understand. </p><p>The source code for Thunderbird junk filter is here, if Wikipedia's generic explanation of Bayesian filtering does not satisfy your quest for knowledge on exactly how the thing works. <a href=""https://searchfox.org/comm-central/source/mailnews/extensions/bayesian-spam-filter/nsBayesianFilter.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://searchfox.org/comm-central/source/mailnews/extensions/bayesian-spam-filter/nsBayesianFilter.cpp</a> </p><p>From a practical perspective all I know is the email is scored out of 100 as to the likelihood of it being junk and email that scores over 90 gets classified as spam. (Customizable via the <a href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=config+editor"" class=""new"" title=""Page does not exist."" rel=""nofollow"">config editor</a> with hidden preference mail.adaptivefilters.junk_threshold )  But changing that is not going to do anything with your issue except probably make things worse. </p><p>As I said turn off the junk filtering, it does not do any blacklisting at all. It never has and probably never will as, that is contrary to the whole concept of analyzing the message content.  That is why the article you claim to have read suggests the use of manual filters to build a blacklist.  I wrote the initial draft of the manual filtering article,  but to be brutally honest I wrote it to shut people up,  not because I think it does anything long term. Manual junk filtering is a self defeating process. v where you will be busy blocking the address used yesterday while the spammer as moved on to two or three new ones in the interim. </p><p>Perhaps the best thing to do is delete the training.dat file from your Thunderbird <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">profile folder</a> (close Thunderbird before attempting to do that) and start the training all over again in the awareness that there is no blacklist and the origin of the email is entirely irrelevant to the analysis.  So clicking junk on mail based on origin is almost guaranteed to reduce the effectiveness of the analysis as it is the content of the email that is used to build the database,  not the sender or sender domain. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

Maybe open an issue for a feature request or question on the quickFilters Github to discus a quick workflow: </p><p><a href=""https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues</a> </p><p>Underlying idea of quickFilters: </p> <ul><li> The user can activate a filter assistant mode, in which quickFilters monitors all file operations and tags instigated by the user.  </li><li> Then quickFilters helps building a filter that replicates the user’s action, (which often involves moving a file deep in the folder hierarchy and may be cumbersome to create manually) to automate it. </li><li> if a filter already exists (in the mail account) that does this action (move to folders X) it will suggest merging the rule into it rather than creating a new filter. So you could have a filter called blacklist senders that marks junk as based on sender - maybe also tags it with a special tag you know it wasn’t done by Thunderbird’s adaptive junk control - that you can extend through the assistant. </li></ul> <p>Currently quickFilters implements a folder listener and a tag listener, which monitor changes. I am not sure whether it also is triggered by just marking as junk or whether you would have to move the mail to junk to trigger the assistant. </p>",realraven,false,1,0

Check Firewall</strong> Exit Thunderbird Access Firewall Thunderbird program must be set up as an allowed program. </p><p><strong>2. Check for a VPN</strong> Please check to see if you have a VPN enabled. Servers do not like VPN and may block access to server. </p><p><strong>3. Check - localhost</strong> If you have anything using localhost  such as Apache Xampp (people use it when managing websites) then you must switch it off until oauth is set up. </p><p><strong>4. 2FA and app generated password</strong> In gmail - Switch off 2FA and do not use an app specific password you may have generated. The password when requested is the normal one you use to access webmail. </p><p><strong>5. Check cookies are enabled</strong> You must have the following&nbsp;: Thunderbird  </p> <ul><li>     Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security  </li></ul> <p>Web Content </p> <ul><li>     Select 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Accept third party cookies 'Always </li><li>     click on 'Exceptions' </li><li>     Add this as an 'allowed' exception&nbsp;: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> </li><li>     click on 'Save Changes'  </li></ul> <p>Whilst in that area make sure to delete any passwords that have been previously saved for that gmail account. You do not want any to get used whilst setting up account. Otherwise gmail may expect eg: an oauth password so will reject the normal password when setting up account OR if an app generated password has been saved, it will also confuse gmail - so check - remove all saved passwords for that gmail account. </p> <ul><li>     Scroll down to Passwords section </li><li>     click on 'Saved Passwords' </li><li>     Click on 'Show Passwords'  </li></ul> <p>If you get a  'Windows Security' window asking for password - enter the same password you enter when you start computer and logon to User Account to see desktop etc. It's not talking about a mail account password. </p> <ul><li> Completely remove any password to do with that gmail account - imap:// or smtp:// or oauth:// </li><li> click on 'Close' </li></ul> <p>Then restart Thunderbird. Create a new mail account. </p> <ul><li> New &gt; Existing mail account </li><li> Enter name, email address and normal password (same password you use to access gmail webmail account) </li><li> Click on Continue </li></ul> <p>Server settings should be auto located - imap will get chosen by default and set up to use OAuth2. </p><p>When you click on Done You should be prompted by gmail to allow Thunderbird access which you need to complete. </p><p>Please report back on results. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,2,0

I tried for the last 3 days to add on 2 new accounts with no success. The resolution that I found that worked was to go into Settings &gt; Privacy and click to allow Cookies from websites. Save that and go back to the main screen. Setup the account using the New Account setup. I am using IMAP on the default server. Prior to that, every attempt would give me a failed to connect to server message. Once the account is setup, you can shut off Cookies again with no other issues. Again, I am using the Linux version: EndeavourOS Linux x86_64 using Kernel version 6.12.17-1-lts. </p>",scarecrow333,false,0,0

I looked up other's that have issues getting the authentication, and it looks like there can be issues with the OAuth in advanced settings being setup wrong initially, not a user fault. So it may not be pulling in the right setup for POP3 or IMAP for you in auto setup. I saw where someone had to change it so that incoming was set to OAuth and outgoing is set to OAuth2. You might try going into advanced setup, and manually have it map the connection. There is a button that will let you map the server connection. With cookies on, it should in theory give you the Google account authentication screen on your PC. If you have a firewall running, it may be blocking the port needed for that connection. I would also click cookies on and off, just to make sure it recognizing the option. Best of luck! </p>",scarecrow333,false,0,0
