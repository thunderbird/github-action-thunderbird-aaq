There are still some, I understand, that force scam and spam modules into Thunderbird,  they don't even have setting in Thunderbird for these modules, just on off switches in the antivirus tool. </p><p>You might also want to consider what spam filtering your mail provider is applying.  I am not aware of much specifically,   but I understand there are options in say Yahoo to mark all new mail that is not in the Yahoo address book as spam.  </p><p>I think in this instance that the source of the problem will not be Thunderbird, it might be, but my money os on an onside influence. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I haven't tried that because I can't figure out exactly what clicking Junk does, or how adaptive filtering works. The document you linked does not explain those things.

I looked up other's that have issues getting the authentication, and it looks like there can be issues with the OAuth in advanced settings being setup wrong initially, not a user fault. So it may not be pulling in the right setup for POP3 or IMAP for you in auto setup. I saw where someone had to change it so that incoming was set to OAuth and outgoing is set to OAuth2. You might try going into advanced setup, and manually have it map the connection. There is a button that will let you map the server connection. With cookies on, it should in theory give you the Google account authentication screen on your PC. If you have a firewall running, it may be blocking the port needed for that connection.
