Previously, when creating filter rules for junk emails, I used the option to create an action rule to delete the message from the server. The sequence was ""Set Junk Status to: Junk"" &gt; ""Delete Message From Server"" &gt; ""Delete Message."" This way I didn't have to manage the emails on the server. I want to continue this, but I don't find the Delete Message from Server option any longer. After reading other articles saying IMAP was a prerequisite for this action rule, I tried to set up a second account using IMAP but TBird told me the existing account was already set to IMAP for incoming mail. Confusing. But the bottom line is I need to know how to access this action rule going forward. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Hanasazi

I could try to add the OUTLOOK account on GMAIL via POP, but I want IMAP and GMAIL only allow for POP. </p><p>So, the feature request would be for ThunderMail to act not only as an email server/client as GMAIL, but also as a full email client with IMAP/POP, with special attention to the IMAP case which would take ThunderMail truly beyond GMAIL. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,pt-BR,"",gersonjferreira
