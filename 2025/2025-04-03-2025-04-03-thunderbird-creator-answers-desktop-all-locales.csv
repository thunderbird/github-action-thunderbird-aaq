When I close and exit the email, it will stay <strong>bolded</strong> in the Inbox, as if it's a new email that hasn't been read yet.  The only way to get it to ""un-bold"" to show it's been read already, is to right click on it and select ""mark as read"".  Is there a setting I am missing to show opened emails as read? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ktsmom
