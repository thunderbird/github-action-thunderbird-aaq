Previously, when creating filter rules for junk emails, I used the option to create an action rule to delete the message from the server.

I want to continue this, but I don't find the Delete Message from Server option any longer. After reading other articles saying IMAP was a prerequisite for this action rule, I tried to set up a second account using IMAP but TBird told me the existing account was already set to IMAP for incoming mail.
