In Thunderbird, in the Folder Pane, you normally have a 'Local Folders' account. It is a special account designed to help with storing emails.  Some people use Imap acounts and may need to get emails off server in order to increase their server quota - the 'Local Folders' account is the perfect location for storing mail you have to get off the server but do not want to delete. Some people just use it anyway for storing emails. </p><p>Is that what you mean by 'Local Folders'&nbsp;?
