Is there a way to toggle the light background for the message pane in Thunderbird? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",NoSyu,false,0,0

All this does is delete the index, which may be corrupt, and then creates a new index. You will then see what is actually in the folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Then start Thunderbird. If all works ok then you know it was probably the AV interfering. </p><p>However, regardless of whether you can perform that test or not, it is advised that you access your Anti-Virus product and set up an exception to not scan your Thunderbird profile folder. After all, you do not want any AV trying to fix anything in your profile as it's likely to result in loss of email. AV's do not understand that one single mbox text file may contain alot of emails. You do not want any AV doing anything with your profile folders and any file etc it contains. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Then you can create subgroups known as 'Mailing Lists' which can be used to select a number of contacts in the select address book to send one email to several contacts. An address book can have several Mailing Lists and a contact can be in more than one Mailng List. </p><p>The manual method is select the folder/subfolder select email to see contents. In the header click on the 'From' email address and it gets added to Personal address book, click on Edit  Then you can select the desired address book to use or click on 'Edit Details' to access the address book contact information. </p><p>If you were collecting all email address you were 'sending' emails then you can choose to collect them in any address book, but the default is 'Collected Addresses' address book. Have you ever sent any emails to those people - the particular group of clients? Maybe you already have collected the contacts email addresses, but are not aware of it&nbsp;? </p><p>There is an addon extension you can try&nbsp;: It says ""Collects email addresses (sender, recipients, reply to, or all together) of all messages in a folder (and subfolders) and saves them in a new address book.

Generally this is not required unless you share your computer and computer user account with other people and you do not want then having access to stored passwords.  If the answer is yes - you set a primary password then Thunderbird will prompt for the 'primary password'  once per session. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0
