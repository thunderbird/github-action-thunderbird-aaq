I had several folders of different programs in that drive.  I was basically trying to clean up those folders, so I made a folder called programs, and was dragging program files into that folder. </p><p>I dragged the whole Thunderbird folder into that new folder.  That was where my issue started.  After that, the desktop shortcut I had for it wouldn't work.  Ok, easy, I went to the Thunderbird folder, found its .exe and voila, made new shortcut. </p><p>When I opened that up, it was basically like a new install, asking me to set up username/password pop/smtp etc.  I'm decently ok at this, and I know that your Thunderbird profile can just be put in and it will pull everything back up the way it was, only, it's not.   </p><p>When I looked in the AppData profile area for Thunderbird, it had a profile that was listed at 6:53, 7/22/2025 the exact time I moved the whole folder, and created the new shortcut... </p><p>So, my question is, how screwed am I?  When I built my PC, I imported the Thunderbird profile over from the old computer to the new one.  This was on 12/31/2023.  So now, I see no other profiles but from 2023, and from the screwup date, today 7/22/2025.  </p><p>I should also mention I tried messing with Thunderbird again later this evening, and it made another profile, 10:30 7/22/2025.  I knew this wasn't right, and deleted it.  So now, when I click on the Thunderbird shortcut, it says profile cannot load Thunderbird, profile is missing / inaccessible.  So, Thunderbird won't even load up. </p><p>I'm wary of doing a fresh install, as I'm thinking there should be a profile dated between 12/31/2023 and today 7/22/2025, and I don't want a new install to wipe everything if the correct profile is hiding in there somewhere.   </p><p>If I somehow figure out how to get the main program working again, please tell me the current data from Thunderbird before moving the folder  is stored on that original 12/31/2023 profile.  I really really really hope the correct and current profile wasn't wiped out when I moved the folder. </p><p>Is there a way to do a Windows restore to get it back if it is truly gone?  If it is not truly gone, is it still the 12/31/2023 profile (Thunderbird just updates that original profile and keeps the original date that was transferred to the new computer)? If not, how can I find the current one I had before moving the folder?  And how can I get Thunderbird to load using that profile? </p><p>Thank you for taking time to read this, and if you can help me get my Thunderbird back, you are a God among mortals! </p>",nutbustertwo;davidsk;,false,false,false,";solver_id:6895098;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/138.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",3,0,0,,,
