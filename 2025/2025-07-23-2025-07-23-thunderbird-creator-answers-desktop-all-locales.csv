It shows all unread messages across all my folders.  It's by far the folder I use the most often.  I often scroll through it and sort the messages into other folders. But when I move a message, I often end-up with 2 copies:  one stays in the original folder and a second appears in the folder I moved the message to.  (I'm not using COPY, just MOVE).  Any idea what's going on or how to fix it? </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,en-US,1750963;,ThunderbirdUser23987

Someone could be trying to impersonate the server "".  As a result I am not receiving any emails through Thunderbird, but I can go to the Morris Broadband website to colllect them.   I have used Thunderbird for many years without a problem.  I don't understand what that notification means.  I don't even know what a certificate is!  So, in short, I don't have a clue how to fix this issue.  Can someone please give me a clue as I'm clueless. Also, I turned off my antivirus program (Malwarebytes) and that didn't help at all.  I appreciate your help! </p>",thunderbird;encryption;,thunderbird,encryption,en-US,"",billybob716
