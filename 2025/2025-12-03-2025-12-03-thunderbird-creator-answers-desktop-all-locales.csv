Circa un mese fa ho scaricato un add on suggerito da Thunderbird per inoltrare automaticamente le mail di una banca all'indirizzo dell'amministrazione, perché la banca prevede un solo indirizzo di riferimento. In buona fede credevo che quel servizio funzionasse solo da quel momento in poi, invece ha cominciato ad inoltrare mail anche di oltre 1 anno fa, ancora residenti nella mia casella. Dopo diverse lamentele ho dapprima cercato di bloccare l'inoltro poi, visto che non ci riuscivo, ho proprio rimosso l'add on (non ricordo il nome), sperando che così finisse l'inconveniente. L'ho cancellato da oltre 10 giorni, ma l'amministrazione continua a ricevere numerosissimi inoltri, per cui si sono fortemente lamentati con me. Non so più cosa fare, se non riuscirete a darmi un consiglio efficace con mio immenso dispiacere sarò costretto ad eliminare Thunderbird dal mio pc, sperando che così il problema si risolva. Confidando con tutto il cuore che riuscirete a risolvermi il problema, vi auguro una buona giornata. giorgio riela </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,it,1783536;1783538;,grg0401
