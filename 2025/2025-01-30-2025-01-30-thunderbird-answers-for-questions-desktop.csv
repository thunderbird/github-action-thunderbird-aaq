I think you will find a similar issue for most folk in the open source world,  that really do not have much association with Microsoft proprietary technologies.  Yes, oauth is open source.  Modern Authentication is not and it comes with scopes and other Microsoft special features.  Then they change it all the time in the hope folk like you will give up. </p><p>The simple answer is it works for me on my old hotmail accounts without issue and it will work without issue for most folks that do not use a third party antivirus or a VPN just as well as it work for me.  I do however have to use an SMTP server other the the one Microsoft publishes (<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>).   </p><p>Those that have antivirus products that block connections, privacy tools that turn of cookies and VPNs which Microsoft tends to block because the endpoint is a long way from where the phone you use with the same Microsoft account is located dfo have issues caused by their software,  not Thunderbird.   </p><p>Those that have a managed office365 account where there is an admin allowed to specify an almost unlimited number of settings, including what software and what versions of that software are allowed to use Modern Authentication are frequently going to have issue.  Bottom line with this one is the admin needs to be in a position to offer user support if they are changing the defaults.  That is not something that can be done by anyone but the organization offering oauth as no one else knows what requirements they have made. </p><p>Now do you actually have a question about your Thunderbird setup?

Here is an updated summary of all of these things that began happening suddenly actually when what seems to be the day Thunderbird automatically updated 2 weeks ago: </p><p>(Please note that I verified absolutely nothing is wrong with my servers, including 1 Gmail and 2 from my private domain.) </p><p>Problem #1: Upon opening Thunderbird, my main email (among 3 I have coming into Thunderbird) recently began showing a window saying ""The account (undisclosed e-mail address) is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages."" After I click okay, the inbox eventually re-populates (which it should never do, and never has done this before -- it normally stays populated as soon as I open T-bird), but then Thunderbird ends up setting my Inbox view to all default settings changing the whole layout of my inbox everytime -- i.e. thread, priority, etc., where I would have to re-select and re-organize the layout everytime I open the program). Thunderbird basically seems to keep ""re-assembling"" that one inbox every time I open the account. </p><p>Problem #2: Then, related to problem #1 on this same account, it also begins downloading, saying ""downloading 1 of 45 messages"" (for example), and then it either aborts downloading the messages after the first message, or it will keep trying and will only keep re-downloading the 1st message. (Meanwhile my 2nd e-mail account with the same domain on the same exact server is functioning totally fine, and I have changed no settings on those accounts, and their server still uses the same ports it always has. I already confirmed with my host that nothing has changed there.) </p><p>Problem #3: At the same time that all of this strangeness began, Thunderbird also began to only check for new messages (for all 3 accounts) when I open it, and will not check for messages again until I close Thunderbird and then re-open it. Pushing the ""get messages"" button does nothing currently, when it used to do something. Meanwhile my internet is working fine. I browse fine, etc. </p><p>Thank you for any feedback! </p>",nrzenguitar,false,0,0

Absolutely nothing was wrong with the client - the problem was with the email. I went online, looked at the email to make sure it was nothing I needed and then deleted it. The emails downloaded normally. This happened from time to time and I had to conclude that there was problem scripting in the email that was causing the problem.

Is it still ticked to retrieve email periodically? If it is, switch it off, exit TB, re-open TB and re-tick it, choosing a slightly different time period. Works for a multiplicity of programs and is the go to method for the Windows OS when it loses a setting. </p>",frisée,false,0,0

The 2 most important things turn out to be what I wrote within #3: ""Pushing the ""get messages"" button does nothing currently, when it used to do something,"" and problem #1, particularly regarding the constant repeated automatic defaulting / reorganizing of my inbox layout done by Thunderbird. </p><p>And guess what -- today, at the exact same time that button (which affects all 3 e-mail accounts on 2 separate servers) began working, and the inbox in 1 of the accounts stopped repeatedly and defaultingly reorganizing, every single other problem above went back to normal too -- simultaneously. I didn't change a thing. Today, I simply opened Thunderbird, and suddenly everything was working normally, and any problems associated with any of the 3 separate accounts on 2 separate servers have stopped -- simultaneously. During these problems prior, the ""Get Messages"" was doing absolutely nothing every time I touched it, meaning I wasn't even getting status verbiage that we normally should get in the lower left letting the user know that it is downloading messages, etc., despite messages being able to be downloaded on 2 separate server e-mails of the 3 upon startup only (usually). When the problems were happening, that verbiage would only exist when I opened the program. </p><p>This all makes me certainly think that Thunderbird was having some kind of problem. </p><p>However, I will keep in mind your tips if I ever encounter any of those problems in the future if they are occurring individually / isolated. </p><p>Much appreciated, and have yourself a great day! </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>The next question to Mozilla is: Why did this happen in your software? </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul>",nrzenguitar,false,0,0

If yes,  As Pop accounts are unable to access and use the server Trash folder, it means even if anything is deleted manually in pop account, it does not get properly deleted off server, because at best, only the 'Inbox' label might be removed meaning all of those emails are still stored in the server 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Gmail has a quota for storage and if person is using Pop they may have more emails on server than they realise. I've come across this sort of thig before when gmail has been known to start being awkward if there are a lot of emails still stored on the server. Gmail expects people who use POP at some point to logon to webmail and remove a load of old emails because they have already downloaded a copy. Pop accounts do not synch with server folders, so whatever they get downloaded to Pop account in Thunderbird is a true independently stored copy. If you have too many still on server and it gets full, then you end up with server not able to receive or send emails. A situation you need to avoid. </p><p>I would suggest you logon to webmail account and delete a load of old emails (those previously downloaded). You should find them possibly in the Inbox, but definity in the 'All Mail' folder. In 'All Mail' - if any do not have any labels then it's possible those were emails previously deleted -  gmail has just deleted the Inbox label not the email itself. </p><p>Deleting emails off server seems to make gmail 'happy' and has been known to improve the situation. So this is worth trying. </p><p>Then - after deleting a load of emails off server via webmail - in Thunderbird, select account and use 'Get Messages' and see if the download improves. </p><p>Please report back on what you found in webmail account and whether doing the mass delete off server suddenly started to improve the download. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I cannot get the interface on Thunderbird remove the emails from my outlook account after applying the correct settings </blockquote> <p>That statement actually makes no sense at all.  What is abundantly clear is no one can answer your questions because the answer depends on the protocol used to fetch mail and we are still waiting on that answer.  Is it IMAP or POP. In the interests of moving this forward, I will guess that it will be IMAP as that is the default.  IMAP is syncronised with the mail server, so there is no remove from server settings to find. </p> <blockquote> Number 1 makes number 3 not possible - I think. </blockquote> <p>A lack of information from you makes commenting on that nothing but a guess. </p> <blockquote> The first images display folder issues where it keeps multiplying my outlook account.

Most of which I have never subscribed to. </blockquote> <p>I am sorry,  but I really do not understand the relevance of this figure.  Have you logged into the account using your web browser and actually has a look at how many emails are in the account?  For instance I have some 9000 email in a folder called pop from a time when hotmail decided deleting the mail on download meant some form of archiving.  I have never bothered fixing it.  But the account in Thunderbird does not show that folder so the numbers vary radically between Thunderbird and the web site.   </p> <blockquote> The more I look at the information offered in the help section, makes me think I would be better off removing and reinstalling the program and start from scratch. </blockquote> <p>Reinstalling works for Microsoft software and that is about it.  Reinstalling for Thunderbird is mostly an exercise in futility as all of your settings and data are unchanged by the process. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

That account Inbox is at the top of the Folder PAne with all other folders immediately below. The 'Local Folders' account is below the Pop account. </p><p>Both the POP hotmail and Local Folders accounts store downloaded emails on your computer and nothing is synhronised with the server folders because it is a POP account. So they are independent copies of emails. </p><p>Then below them is 'Unified Folders' - maybe this is part where you think something is multipied...not multipied - you have just opted to display everything twice. </p><p>I do not know why you want to use 'Unified Folders' because you only have one mail account. That option is designed to display a 'Unified' set of eg: Inbox folders for people who have several mail accounts and want to see all incoming mail for all accounts in one virtual view of 'Inbox'. The 'Unified Fodlers' section means all the default folders get a 'Unified' view option and any other folder you created will be displayed at the bottom under relevant account name. </p><p>I would suggest you stop using the 'Unified Folders' option as it seems to be causing some confusion and is just replicating what you can already see in the actual Pop mail account. </p><p>Do this: </p> <ul><li> View &gt; Folders </li><li> 'All Folders' option should be selected. </li><li> Uncheck the 'Unified Folders' option. </li></ul> <p>That will tidy up the Folder Pane.  </p><p>When you delete or move emails from a folder eg: Inbox, those emails get  'marked as deleted' and 'hidden', so whilst you cannot see them in 'Inbox' they are still in original file. After deleting or moving a load of emails from eg: Inbox to another suitable folder: You need to make sure all the 'marked as deleted' and 'hidden' emails in the 'Inbox' are properly removed from the Inbox mbox file that stores emails and this is achieved by compacting the Inbox folder. </p><p>Do this: </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Inbox' folder in POP account and select 'Compact'. </li></ul> <p>As you have done quite a bit of moving etc this may take a short while, but not that long. During that time, do not select to read etc anything in Inbox and do not exit Thunderbird. Be patient. It should not take that long and it should offer information in the bottom Status bar. </p><p>Once compacting is finished... </p> <ul><li> Logon to webmail account via a browser and check the hotmail acount. </li></ul> <p>Do you see emails you have deleted still on server&nbsp;? </p><p><strong>ESET</strong> On ESET forum there are people complaining that download gets interupted or very slow if the disabling real-time protection is enabled. When they disabled it all started to work much better. If using ESET then disable the real-time protection. </p><p><br> <strong>General advice:</strong> I would also advise that you do not store all your emails in just one folder. In reality, all those emails are stored in one simple text document, one after the other, so if you have all your emails in one file, it increases the risk - basically you have all your eggs in one basket. Strongly advise you create some folders in the pop account to help organise your storage and move emails into appropriately named folders. eg: Folders for 'Family, Friends, Online Orders, Bills, etc </p><p>Once you have completed that task - remember to compact the 'Inbox' again as you have 'moved' a load of emails. The net result means the 'Inbox' mbox file is now a lot smaller, tidy and less prone to problems. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
