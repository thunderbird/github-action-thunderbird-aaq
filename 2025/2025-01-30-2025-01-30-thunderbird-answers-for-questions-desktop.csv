Here is an updated summary of all of these things that began happening suddenly actually when what seems to be the day Thunderbird automatically updated 2 weeks ago: </p><p>(Please note that I verified absolutely nothing is wrong with my servers, including 1 Gmail and 2 from my private domain.) </p><p>Problem #1: Upon opening Thunderbird, my main email (among 3 I have coming into Thunderbird) recently began showing a window saying ""The account (undisclosed e-mail address) is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages."" After I click okay, the inbox eventually re-populates (which it should never do, and never has done this before -- it normally stays populated as soon as I open T-bird), but then Thunderbird ends up setting my Inbox view to all default settings changing the whole layout of my inbox everytime -- i.e. thread, priority, etc., where I would have to re-select and re-organize the layout everytime I open the program). Thunderbird basically seems to keep ""re-assembling"" that one inbox every time I open the account. </p><p>Problem #2: Then, related to problem #1 on this same account, it also begins downloading, saying ""downloading 1 of 45 messages"" (for example), and then it either aborts downloading the messages after the first message, or it will keep trying and will only keep re-downloading the 1st message. (Meanwhile my 2nd e-mail account with the same domain on the same exact server is functioning totally fine, and I have changed no settings on those accounts, and their server still uses the same ports it always has. I already confirmed with my host that nothing has changed there.) </p><p>Problem #3: At the same time that all of this strangeness began, Thunderbird also began to only check for new messages (for all 3 accounts) when I open it, and will not check for messages again until I close Thunderbird and then re-open it. Pushing the ""get messages"" button does nothing currently, when it used to do something. Meanwhile my internet is working fine. I browse fine, etc. </p><p>Thank you for any feedback! </p>",nrzenguitar,false,0,0

Absolutely nothing was wrong with the client - the problem was with the email. I went online, looked at the email to make sure it was nothing I needed and then deleted it.

If yes,  As Pop accounts are unable to access and use the server Trash folder, it means even if anything is deleted manually in pop account, it does not get properly deleted off server, because at best, only the 'Inbox' label might be removed meaning all of those emails are still stored in the server 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Gmail has a quota for storage and if person is using Pop they may have more emails on server than they realise. I've come across this sort of thig before when gmail has been known to start being awkward if there are a lot of emails still stored on the server. Gmail expects people who use POP at some point to logon to webmail and remove a load of old emails because they have already downloaded a copy. Pop accounts do not synch with server folders, so whatever they get downloaded to Pop account in Thunderbird is a true independently stored copy. If you have too many still on server and it gets full, then you end up with server not able to receive or send emails. A situation you need to avoid. </p><p>I would suggest you logon to webmail account and delete a load of old emails (those previously downloaded). You should find them possibly in the Inbox, but definity in the 'All Mail' folder. In 'All Mail' - if any do not have any labels then it's possible those were emails previously deleted -  gmail has just deleted the Inbox label not the email itself. </p><p>Deleting emails off server seems to make gmail 'happy' and has been known to improve the situation. So this is worth trying. </p><p>Then - after deleting a load of emails off server via webmail - in Thunderbird, select account and use 'Get Messages' and see if the download improves. </p><p>Please report back on what you found in webmail account and whether doing the mass delete off server suddenly started to improve the download. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

There are two ways that can be done. One requires installing an add-on (extension) to be able to explicitly see and change the folder flags. The other way is make a couple changes to the account settings to indirectly cause the flag to be removed. </p><p>The add-on can be found here: </p><p><a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/</a> </p><p>After <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">installing</a> it, in Thunderbird right-click on the folder that has the problem, choose <b>Properties</b>, select the <b>Flags</b> tab, uncheck <b>Drafts</b>, then click OK. </p><p>Alternatively, you may also fix the problem as follows. There is no need to do this if you've already fixed the problem with the add-on. This is only in case you're not curious about the flag and just want to fix the problem without having to install an add-on: </p> <ol><li> Open the account <b>Copies &amp; Folders</b> settings. </li><li> Under <b>Drafts and Templates</b>, choose <b>Other</b>, then, as strange as it may sound, select the folder that has the problem. </li><li> Change the Drafts folder setting back to what it was. This is where having selected the right folder in the previous step matters, because it's when the folder that had been chosen to store drafts stops having that role that the flag is removed. </li></ol> <p>Closing and reopening the account settings pane between steps 2 and 3, to make sure the changes are applied, doesn't seem to be necessary. </p>",DavidGG,false,1,0
