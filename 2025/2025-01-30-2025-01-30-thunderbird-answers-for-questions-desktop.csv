You make no mention of what you have installed in that regard so I suggest to reset everything when you entry troubleshooting mode.  If that does not work look at what your antivirus is doing.

I think you will find a similar issue for most folk in the open source world,  that really do not have much association with Microsoft proprietary technologies.  Yes, oauth is open source.  Modern Authentication is not and it comes with scopes and other Microsoft special features.  Then they change it all the time in the hope folk like you will give up. </p><p>The simple answer is it works for me on my old hotmail accounts without issue and it will work without issue for most folks that do not use a third party antivirus or a VPN just as well as it work for me.  I do however have to use an SMTP server other the the one Microsoft publishes (<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>).   </p><p>Those that have antivirus products that block connections, privacy tools that turn of cookies and VPNs which Microsoft tends to block because the endpoint is a long way from where the phone you use with the same Microsoft account is located dfo have issues caused by their software,  not Thunderbird.   </p><p>Those that have a managed office365 account where there is an admin allowed to specify an almost unlimited number of settings, including what software and what versions of that software are allowed to use Modern Authentication are frequently going to have issue.  Bottom line with this one is the admin needs to be in a position to offer user support if they are changing the defaults.  That is not something that can be done by anyone but the organization offering oauth as no one else knows what requirements they have made. </p><p>Now do you actually have a question about your Thunderbird setup?

Here is an updated summary of all of these things that began happening suddenly actually when what seems to be the day Thunderbird automatically updated 2 weeks ago: </p><p>(Please note that I verified absolutely nothing is wrong with my servers, including 1 Gmail and 2 from my private domain.) </p><p>Problem #1: Upon opening Thunderbird, my main email (among 3 I have coming into Thunderbird) recently began showing a window saying ""The account (undisclosed e-mail address) is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages."" After I click okay, the inbox eventually re-populates (which it should never do, and never has done this before -- it normally stays populated as soon as I open T-bird), but then Thunderbird ends up setting my Inbox view to all default settings changing the whole layout of my inbox everytime -- i.e. thread, priority, etc., where I would have to re-select and re-organize the layout everytime I open the program). Thunderbird basically seems to keep ""re-assembling"" that one inbox every time I open the account. </p><p>Problem #2: Then, related to problem #1 on this same account, it also begins downloading, saying ""downloading 1 of 45 messages"" (for example), and then it either aborts downloading the messages after the first message, or it will keep trying and will only keep re-downloading the 1st message. (Meanwhile my 2nd e-mail account with the same domain on the same exact server is functioning totally fine, and I have changed no settings on those accounts, and their server still uses the same ports it always has. I already confirmed with my host that nothing has changed there.) </p><p>Problem #3: At the same time that all of this strangeness began, Thunderbird also began to only check for new messages (for all 3 accounts) when I open it, and will not check for messages again until I close Thunderbird and then re-open it. Pushing the ""get messages"" button does nothing currently, when it used to do something. Meanwhile my internet is working fine. I browse fine, etc. </p><p>Thank you for any feedback! </p>",nrzenguitar,false,0,0

Absolutely nothing was wrong with the client - the problem was with the email. I went online, looked at the email to make sure it was nothing I needed and then deleted it. The emails downloaded normally. This happened from time to time and I had to conclude that there was problem scripting in the email that was causing the problem.
