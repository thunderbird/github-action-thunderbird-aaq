The problem usually occurs if the cursor freezes for a second as often happens when spinning up a hard drive.

I think you will find a similar issue for most folk in the open source world,  that really do not have much association with Microsoft proprietary technologies.  Yes, oauth is open source.  Modern Authentication is not and it comes with scopes and other Microsoft special features.

Here is an updated summary of all of these things that began happening suddenly actually when what seems to be the day Thunderbird automatically updated 2 weeks ago: </p><p>(Please note that I verified absolutely nothing is wrong with my servers, including 1 Gmail and 2 from my private domain.) </p><p>Problem #1: Upon opening Thunderbird, my main email (among 3 I have coming into Thunderbird) recently began showing a window saying ""The account (undisclosed e-mail address) is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages."" After I click okay, the inbox eventually re-populates (which it should never do, and never has done this before -- it normally stays populated as soon as I open T-bird), but then Thunderbird ends up setting my Inbox view to all default settings changing the whole layout of my inbox everytime -- i.e. thread, priority, etc., where I would have to re-select and re-organize the layout everytime I open the program). Thunderbird basically seems to keep ""re-assembling"" that one inbox every time I open the account. </p><p>Problem #2: Then, related to problem #1 on this same account, it also begins downloading, saying ""downloading 1 of 45 messages"" (for example), and then it either aborts downloading the messages after the first message, or it will keep trying and will only keep re-downloading the 1st message. (Meanwhile my 2nd e-mail account with the same domain on the same exact server is functioning totally fine, and I have changed no settings on those accounts, and their server still uses the same ports it always has. I already confirmed with my host that nothing has changed there.) </p><p>Problem #3: At the same time that all of this strangeness began, Thunderbird also began to only check for new messages (for all 3 accounts) when I open it, and will not check for messages again until I close Thunderbird and then re-open it. Pushing the ""get messages"" button does nothing currently, when it used to do something. Meanwhile my internet is working fine. I browse fine, etc. </p><p>Thank you for any feedback! </p>",nrzenguitar,false,0,0

Absolutely nothing was wrong with the client - the problem was with the email. I went online, looked at the email to make sure it was nothing I needed and then deleted it.

The 2 most important things turn out to be what I wrote within #3: ""Pushing the ""get messages"" button does nothing currently, when it used to do something,"" and problem #1, particularly regarding the constant repeated automatic defaulting / reorganizing of my inbox layout done by Thunderbird. </p><p>And guess what -- today, at the exact same time that button (which affects all 3 e-mail accounts on 2 separate servers) began working, and the inbox in 1 of the accounts stopped repeatedly and defaultingly reorganizing, every single other problem above went back to normal too -- simultaneously. I didn't change a thing. Today, I simply opened Thunderbird, and suddenly everything was working normally, and any problems associated with any of the 3 separate accounts on 2 separate servers have stopped -- simultaneously. During these problems prior, the ""Get Messages"" was doing absolutely nothing every time I touched it, meaning I wasn't even getting status verbiage that we normally should get in the lower left letting the user know that it is downloading messages, etc., despite messages being able to be downloaded on 2 separate server e-mails of the 3 upon startup only (usually). When the problems were happening, that verbiage would only exist when I opened the program. </p><p>This all makes me certainly think that Thunderbird was having some kind of problem. </p><p>However, I will keep in mind your tips if I ever encounter any of those problems in the future if they are occurring individually / isolated. </p><p>Much appreciated, and have yourself a great day! </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>The next question to Mozilla is: Why did this happen in your software? </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul>",nrzenguitar,false,0,0

If yes,  As Pop accounts are unable to access and use the server Trash folder, it means even if anything is deleted manually in pop account, it does not get properly deleted off server, because at best, only the 'Inbox' label might be removed meaning all of those emails are still stored in the server 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Gmail has a quota for storage and if person is using Pop they may have more emails on server than they realise. I've come across this sort of thig before when gmail has been known to start being awkward if there are a lot of emails still stored on the server. Gmail expects people who use POP at some point to logon to webmail and remove a load of old emails because they have already downloaded a copy. Pop accounts do not synch with server folders, so whatever they get downloaded to Pop account in Thunderbird is a true independently stored copy. If you have too many still on server and it gets full, then you end up with server not able to receive or send emails. A situation you need to avoid. </p><p>I would suggest you logon to webmail account and delete a load of old emails (those previously downloaded). You should find them possibly in the Inbox, but definity in the 'All Mail' folder. In 'All Mail' - if any do not have any labels then it's possible those were emails previously deleted -  gmail has just deleted the Inbox label not the email itself. </p><p>Deleting emails off server seems to make gmail 'happy' and has been known to improve the situation. So this is worth trying. </p><p>Then - after deleting a load of emails off server via webmail - in Thunderbird, select account and use 'Get Messages' and see if the download improves. </p><p>Please report back on what you found in webmail account and whether doing the mass delete off server suddenly started to improve the download. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Have you logged into the account using your web browser and actually has a look at how many emails are in the account?  For instance I have some 9000 email in a folder called pop from a time when hotmail decided deleting the mail on download meant some form of archiving.  I have never bothered fixing it.  But the account in Thunderbird does not show that folder so the numbers vary radically between Thunderbird and the web site.   </p> <blockquote> The more I look at the information offered in the help section, makes me think I would be better off removing and reinstalling the program and start from scratch. </blockquote> <p>Reinstalling works for Microsoft software and that is about it.

In reality, all those emails are stored in one simple text document, one after the other, so if you have all your emails in one file, it increases the risk - basically you have all your eggs in one basket. Strongly advise you create some folders in the pop account to help organise your storage and move emails into appropriately named folders. eg: Folders for 'Family, Friends, Online Orders, Bills, etc </p><p>Once you have completed that task - remember to compact the 'Inbox' again as you have 'moved' a load of emails. The net result means the 'Inbox' mbox file is now a lot smaller, tidy and less prone to problems. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The fact that I still cannot change the settings on my account at MS to allow TB to delete the downloaded emails after the downloaded emails are moved to the POP folder. Also, MS allows anyone to added me to any email list via subscription and half I cannot remove w/o some ridiculous path of removal. I will eventually ditch this and move away from my hotmail account to another provider that doesn't make me have to click 6 different buttons to log in. Screw 2 factor.  The best login I had ever seen was on Nexon's MapleStory where you had your in game name, email account and p/w. You used your in game name to access the login screen where you entered your email account and p/w. The way it was done is that no one ever saw your email account. because when your email account is public with your user/gamer name, you are half hacked at the start. Then brute force is a cake walk. </p><p><strong>Lastly, I would like to thank everyone for their precious time in helping me through this nightmare. Thank you.</strong> </p><p>Toad-Hall, I did do everything you suggested without ever realizing you had responded on the 6th. What really helped the most was letting the program run overnight, while occasionally checking both sides - MS pop folder and TB inbox - deleting the content of the POP account, then moving the downloaded emails in TB from the Inbox to the respective year group folders, then closing TB, followed by reopening TB in order to Compact the Inbox in TB. I am not sure what the hangup was with this error ""The folder 'Inbox on *email*@hotmail.com' cannot be compacted because another operation is in progress."" Never found this ""other operation"". About ESET, I do not use their firewall, only NOD32 anti-virus. I use GlassWire firewall which gives me more  visibility with the programs I allow or block from the internet. The firewall was never appeared to be an issue, as I was using it to watch connectivity and data flow. </p>",mallenhall,false,0,0
