I think you will find a similar issue for most folk in the open source world,  that really do not have much association with Microsoft proprietary technologies.  Yes, oauth is open source.  Modern Authentication is not and it comes with scopes and other Microsoft special features.

Bottom line with this one is the admin needs to be in a position to offer user support if they are changing the defaults.  That is not something that can be done by anyone but the organization offering oauth as no one else knows what requirements they have made. </p><p>Now do you actually have a question about your Thunderbird setup?

Here is an updated summary of all of these things that began happening suddenly actually when what seems to be the day Thunderbird automatically updated 2 weeks ago: </p><p>(Please note that I verified absolutely nothing is wrong with my servers, including 1 Gmail and 2 from my private domain.) </p><p>Problem #1: Upon opening Thunderbird, my main email (among 3 I have coming into Thunderbird) recently began showing a window saying ""The account (undisclosed e-mail address) is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages."" After I click okay, the inbox eventually re-populates (which it should never do, and never has done this before -- it normally stays populated as soon as I open T-bird), but then Thunderbird ends up setting my Inbox view to all default settings changing the whole layout of my inbox everytime -- i.e. thread, priority, etc., where I would have to re-select and re-organize the layout everytime I open the program). Thunderbird basically seems to keep ""re-assembling"" that one inbox every time I open the account. </p><p>Problem #2: Then, related to problem #1 on this same account, it also begins downloading, saying ""downloading 1 of 45 messages"" (for example), and then it either aborts downloading the messages after the first message, or it will keep trying and will only keep re-downloading the 1st message. (Meanwhile my 2nd e-mail account with the same domain on the same exact server is functioning totally fine, and I have changed no settings on those accounts, and their server still uses the same ports it always has. I already confirmed with my host that nothing has changed there.) </p><p>Problem #3: At the same time that all of this strangeness began, Thunderbird also began to only check for new messages (for all 3 accounts) when I open it, and will not check for messages again until I close Thunderbird and then re-open it. Pushing the ""get messages"" button does nothing currently, when it used to do something. Meanwhile my internet is working fine. I browse fine, etc. </p><p>Thank you for any feedback! </p>",nrzenguitar,false,0,0

There are two ways that can be done. One requires installing an add-on (extension) to be able to explicitly see and change the folder flags. The other way is make a couple changes to the account settings to indirectly cause the flag to be removed. </p><p>The add-on can be found here: </p><p><a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/</a> </p><p>After <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">installing</a> it, in Thunderbird right-click on the folder that has the problem, choose <b>Properties</b>, select the <b>Flags</b> tab, uncheck <b>Drafts</b>, then click OK. </p><p>Alternatively, you may also fix the problem as follows. There is no need to do this if you've already fixed the problem with the add-on. This is only in case you're not curious about the flag and just want to fix the problem without having to install an add-on: </p> <ol><li> Open the account <b>Copies &amp; Folders</b> settings. </li><li> Under <b>Drafts and Templates</b>, choose <b>Other</b>, then, as strange as it may sound, select the folder that has the problem. </li><li> Change the Drafts folder setting back to what it was. This is where having selected the right folder in the previous step matters, because it's when the folder that had been chosen to store drafts stops having that role that the flag is removed. </li></ol> <p>Closing and reopening the account settings pane between steps 2 and 3, to make sure the changes are applied, doesn't seem to be necessary. </p>",DavidGG,false,1,0

What are your expectations? That is, if a POP account, the messages on PC have been normally removed from the online server during the download. So, after deleting from PC, they are gone completely. With more information, I may be able to say more. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
