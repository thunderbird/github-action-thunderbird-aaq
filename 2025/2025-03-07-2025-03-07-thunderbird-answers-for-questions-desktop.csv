That looks? like an IPV6 internet address which is ""unknown"" in DNS in so much as it has no name ""unknown"".  But it is the port that is truly weird. 51018 </p><p>The IP address appears to resolve to a city of Ville in France.  But I have no idea what could be using Port 51018 as it is not assigned to any ""normal"" protocol.  It is a dynamic port that I would guess could be used for a VPN internally,  or a proxy in a public wifi situation. </p><p>My guess is you are trying to send mail from an IP address your service provider does not allow for that purpose. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You can easily test this by  - exiting thunerbird  - copying the imapmail\&lt;account&gt; to your cloud folder that has a drive allocation  - start thunderbird, click account settings and on 'serversettings'  pane, change the link to account folder to the cloud folder - thunderbird will close and restart. check and see if all is ok . if so, you can remove the folder on hard drive. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
