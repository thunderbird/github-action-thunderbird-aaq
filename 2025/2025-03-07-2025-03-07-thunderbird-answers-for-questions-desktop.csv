It does not.  Providers are very careful with their webmail,  they have convinced more than 80% of their customers to use these services and usually get a load of advertising at the same time.  For the remaining 20% the server used to send mail is rarely if ever the same one used to send mail from the website.  This is compounded by many having completely different rules about mail volumes and sizes for SMTP V's Webmail.  With the SMTP rout always having the most restrictive offerings and rules. </p><p>To reiterate,  this is coming from the SMTP server.  I have no information that would indicate if you are using even the correct SMTP server.  I often see folk trying to send email using a Gmail SMTP server for an email address that has nothing to do with gmail or Google.  They have weird issues as well. </p><p>To quote the message ""the mail server said""  that actually says the message originated with the server you have connected to. By the very nature of the message it is not coming from Thunderbird,  despite it being the delivery mechanism.  Ask your provider what the problem is,  and when they say you can send from webmail so everything is Ok disagree with them and insist they support their SMTP server messages. </p><p>I did do a google search on the actual error badmailFrom list and that would indicate that the email address of mail server is marked as sending spam by the recipient server.   That is the server at <a href=""http://abv.bg"" rel=""nofollow"">abv.bg</a> is refusing delivery.  But irrespective if it is your mail provider of your recipients,  that does not change the fact that it is not an error that Thunderbird is issuing,  it is one it to being given to deliver. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If you are getting multiple profiles from your backup there is one folder for each one - I have only ever had 1 profiles.ini. running linux.  Can you locate your current profiles.ini file on your computer?  I know tbird auto-creates a brand new profile on upgrades and makes it the default without so much as a neveryourmind leaving your old one in place.  You may want to do your own editing of the .ini file on your computer using notepad.  AFAIK all your profiles will show in one .ini file .  The structure is awkward but fairly well documented on line.  Do you know which profile folder is last known good one?  Its important to get that name and save it.  Each profile has its own folder bearing the profile name within the folder holding the .ini.  It can be confusing at first but may give you insights into the issue.  If you get to this point you may delete the unneeded and keep your own.

Here's what I think has happened:   </p><p>Google has been making a transition away from allowing anyone to access a <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> account using an IMAP password-based connection.  Since the beginning of 2025 they require use of the Oauth2 password-free protocol. </p><p>Here's the catch:  Setting up an Oauth2 connection now requires having a Google Workspace Account. I say ""now"" because when I set up the gmail account on my desktop PC for use with Word's mailmerge-via-Outlook, there was a loophole for folks like me who don't have (or want) a Google Workspace Account.  I was able to jump through the hoops to set up a Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook (GWSMO) without actually having an account. </p><p>But in the new year, when I tried to set up the same connection on my laptop, that door was closed. </p><p>Sorry to put you through the effort to answer my original question, but your answers did in fact help me narrow down where the problem is.

This is because THunderbird updates and changes the environment sometimes and it does that on the first version of each release. So, for you, there are many releases between 45 and 136 (or 127). The textbook approach would be to install the 0.1. version of each release in sequence, as that will update your profile appropriately.
