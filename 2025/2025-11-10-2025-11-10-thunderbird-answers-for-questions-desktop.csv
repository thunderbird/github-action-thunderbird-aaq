Thunderbird (the ""client"") on your local computer will ""talk"" to your mail service (Gmail, Exchange, AOL, Yahoo, etc. - the ""server"") and present to you any emails it finds there. It will also let you compose emails locally and send them on to your email service to be sent to the recipient. You do need to have an account at an email service with credentials (user name and password) to use Thunderbird. Thunderbird is not an email service - it's a program that interacts with an email service. </p><p>If you have an account set up for one ISP and you leave it, that account it will simply stop functioning (probably with some error messages.) You can set up multiple accounts, so if you sign up with another email service/ISP you can add the new one. Once you are done with the old one, you can delete it - but you probably want to save any emails you have downloaded from there to a local folder for archive purposes. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

If you leave the ISP, then the email client can't work. It serves the function of storing addressbook of contacts, alllows filtering of messages if desired, and stores messages in folders as requested. It's a tool, nothing more. If you have an email account and want those services on your computer and not on a website, then you need to use an email client. It's a simple client-server- relationship. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Remember to compact folders after performing a deletion as this will completely clean up files in Thunderbird profile. </p><p>When coping everything back onto the new gmail email address...I would consider whether that is a real necessity. It will use up a load of your gmail quota. But useful if you need to see years of emails in another IMAP account on another computer or phone that accesses server.  You will find that using imap to upload emails back onto a server has limits on how much is allowed, so you may find it takes a while. Upload with Imap has a 500mb per day <a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en</a> </p><p>All emails in the 'Local Folders' are still visible and accessible. They are also now only stored on your computer, so it's easy to backup.  Maybe you only need to upload recent mail, but not all. Basically keeping emails in 'Local Folders' like an Archive.  But if you pt emails back onto server - I would advise you only 'Copy to' imap folder, so keeping the 'Local Folders' account as an independent copy of all your emails. Again if something goes wrong then you can retry. If you choose to no upload everything, it means your new gmail account will only have all new incoming mail.  Anything in an imap account cannot be truelly regarded as independent copy of server. After all an imap account can only show what is on server and all imap folders synchronise with server.  </p><p>Hope this info helps. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
