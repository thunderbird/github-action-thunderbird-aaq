I have cleaned the cache, opened task manager and closed every tbird open link, I have removed all xfinity emails on the original email server (also xfinity). Nothing removes the problem message. Is there a way to remove it without removing the whole tbird program (and then reinstalling)? It was such a pain to do this last time around.
