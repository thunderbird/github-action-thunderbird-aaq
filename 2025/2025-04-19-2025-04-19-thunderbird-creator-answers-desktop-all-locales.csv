An email from xfinity that includes a link to my xfinity account attaches itself to my tbird program in such a way that no new emails can be received. I have cleaned the cache, opened task manager and closed every tbird open link, I have removed all xfinity emails on the original email server (also xfinity). Nothing removes the problem message. Is there a way to remove it without removing the whole tbird program (and then reinstalling)? It was such a pain to do this last time around. When you do a normal clean out it doesn't actually remove every element. Going in to find every little thing causes me a lot of effort and stress. This one faulty message is making me give up on tbird altogether. Thanks for your help!
