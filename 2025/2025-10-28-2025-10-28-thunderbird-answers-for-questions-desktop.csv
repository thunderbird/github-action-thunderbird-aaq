This is because Thunderbird needs a root location. If you click 'account settings' and scroll down left column to Local Folders and look at bottom line, you will see the 'Local Directory' pointer.

For it to be receiving mail in different profiles would require that you switch between the two. My inference is that one profile is active and there are older messages in the other one. To resolve this, first confirm the active one. You can do that by clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, locate 'Profiles' in left column and then click 'about:profiles' - this will show the name of the active profile, and the inactive profile.  </p> At this point, exit thunderbird and, using windows file explorer, COPY (not move) the folders with missing content from the inactive folder to the active folder &lt;POPaat Mail\Local Folders   IMAP accounts are not affected, but if you use POP, the POP account in inactive folder will be at Mail\&lt;POPaccount&gt; folder.  Be sure to only copy to Mail\Local Folders for active profile . If ANY copy will overlay an existing folder, RENAME prior to copying.  Now, restart thunderbird and you should see the missing data. If desired, you can now copy from these copied folders to their normal folder.   TIP: We recommend always using the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder to copy to new PCs, as that guarantees not experiencing the problem you had.  Here are the normal steps:    &lt;strong&gt;BACKUP  <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is not running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol>  <strong>RESTORE</strong>  <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is installed and NOT running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there. This may prompt to overwrite an existing folder of same name. allow it </li><li> start thunderbird and all should be there </li></ol> ",davidsk,false,1,0
