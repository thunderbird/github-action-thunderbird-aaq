For it to be receiving mail in different profiles would require that you switch between the two. My inference is that one profile is active and there are older messages in the other one. To resolve this, first confirm the active one. You can do that by clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, locate 'Profiles' in left column and then click 'about:profiles' - this will show the name of the active profile, and the inactive profile.  </p> At this point, exit thunderbird and, using windows file explorer, COPY (not move) the folders with missing content from the inactive folder to the active folder &lt;POPaat Mail\Local Folders   IMAP accounts are not affected, but if you use POP, the POP account in inactive folder will be at Mail\&lt;POPaccount&gt; folder.  Be sure to only copy to Mail\Local Folders for active profile . If ANY copy will overlay an existing folder, RENAME prior to copying.  Now, restart thunderbird and you should see the missing data. If desired, you can now copy from these copied folders to their normal folder.   TIP: We recommend always using the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder to copy to new PCs, as that guarantees not experiencing the problem you had.  Here are the normal steps:    &lt;strong&gt;BACKUP  <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is not running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol>  <strong>RESTORE</strong>  <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is installed and NOT running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there.

Yes, this did appear and was set up.  </blockquote> <p>What caused this disappearance of your accounts etc in the main window is a corruption of the central file prefs.js in the Thunderbird profile. When this happens TB renames the damaged prefs.js file in prefs-1.js (sometimes invalidprefs.js) and creates a new virgin prefs.js file with a size of 5 to 7 kB which doesn't contain any account informations. So TB starts like after a first installation and asks to set up an email account.  This not very rare issue is most times provoked by TB crashes, PC crashes or power failure.  I have seen (and treated) this issue a few dozen times in forums but have never experienced it myself.  </p><p>Do you have a backup copy of your Thunderbird profile folder? In this case you could copy the prefs.js from the backup and - Thunderbird closed - paste it in your wife's actual profile folder.  Did your wife use POP accounts? This would explain why after recreating the account only new messages are downloaded. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

Are you using a different OS on each bootable partition&nbsp;? eg: Windows 11 on one and a Linux OS on the other&nbsp;? Are you using a different version of Thunderbird on each partition? eg: Current Release on one and Current Beta on another&nbsp;? </p><p>Problem when using different versions of Thunderbird: Since version 68 or something like that...there was a change to use dedicated profile per installation. Senario: If one TB version is 128* and it uses profile 'A'  and then at a later time another version of TB 144* uses 'A', this now means profile 'A' cannot so easily be used by TB version 128* because it's not automatically backwards compatible. </p><p>Therefore, both versions of Thunderbird must always be identical in order to access the same profile.   </p><p>A different senario occurs when each bootable partition is using a different OS. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:IMAP but I assume this will allow for messages already downloaded by the first instance and then subsequently downloaded by the second be flagged as unread. This seems trivial but a moderate inconvenience</em> </p><p>No. You assume incorrectly. If you have read the email in IMAP 'A' then server will state it is read, so another IMAP 'B' will say what it says on server - it's read - it will not be marked as unread. </p><p>The point of IMAP accounts is that you can have as many IMAP accounts as you like accessing same email account but set up on various computers and as all data is stored on server and assuming you have subscribed to see same folders, the IMAP accounts can only display whatever is on server.  If you set a star in one imap account, then when you view via another imap account, after the usual synchronisation you will see same email with a star.  If you have read an email, then it is marked on server as read, so however you view that email, it will be the same. There is a continual synchronisation of folders when it comes to IMAP accounts.  </p><p>I would advise you never assume you have an  truelly independent copy on your computer and that's because all folders synchronise with same folders on server to show a view of whatever is on server. Anything you do - move, delete, mark, etc is updated to server and when you start Thunderbird, the first thing it does is to synchronise with server. If you delete emails in one IMAP account, then view same account in another IMAP account, it will update and you will see those emails you deleted disappear.  Assuming you are downloading full copies of emails, then you can use the Thunderbird copy to create a backup. But do not assume you have a backup just because the imap account is on another drive or computer.  </p><p>IMAP accounts do not have to be copy pasted, you can newly create it. The only file you may have to copy paste after creating the account is the 'msgFilerRules.dat' file - it's the file that contains all your 'Message Filters' assuming you may have set some up. But, if you have a lot of IMAP accounts then yes, it's probably quicker to copy paste the entire contents of a 'profile name' folder into another 'profile name' folder. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

I do have all my IMAP accounts set to keep copies on the server for 30 days even though that's not an issue for me as my only mail readers (these two instances on TB) are sharing the same profile and message storage location. </p>",trashacct_14,false,0,0

(The Description text box expands to use space in the overall pop window as it is expanded.) </p><p>Let's focus just on the New Event/Edit Event window.  In the attached screenshot, I've expanded that window via css.  No problem there.  But the rectangle that allows editing of the Description text doesn't change height or width.  I don't need anything fancy -- just the ability to get that text-entry rectangle to change size (whether via css or some other trick). </p>",saleslogistix,false,0,0

The window called 'Edit Event Test' is clearly a lot larger in width and height, but it's  not being used by the content.  The toolbar showing 'Save and Close'......'Delete' is chopping off all the options in menu  and is badly restricted. The Calendar, Title, Location etc is all restricted in width and should by default fill the width of window. Near the bottom where you have 'Descripion' - that text are is also very restricted.  'Notify attendees' etc options by default wouldbe located at the bottom. </p><p>By default in the natural design without any userChrome.css code - all the above expands with window in both height and width. The height and width can be manually expanded by hovering over the bottom right corner to see the cursor change to double headed arrow and using the left click on corner and drag to expand to whatever is required. </p><p>I can only assume that you have created code which is messing it up. </p><p>I assume the intention is to force the current window to auto open in a larger window than the current default, so you do not have to manually enlarge as described above. </p><p>AS far as I can tell the code for items in that window is all set to flex. So you only need to alter the size of the window when it opens. </p><p>I used the following and now I can force the Task and Event window to open by default in a larger window and all contents are auto flex to fit anyway, so no need to alter that code.  </p> <hr> <pre>#calendar-event-window, #calendar-task-window {   min-width: 63em&nbsp;!important;   min-height: 81em&nbsp;!important; } </pre> <hr>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
