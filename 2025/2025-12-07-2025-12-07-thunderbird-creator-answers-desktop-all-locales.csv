This is the only account where Thunderbird refuses to create or recognize a Junk/Spam folder, and the option to assign one is disabled. </p><p>I am not looking for general explanations about IMAP, Gmail, filters, server policies, or Thunderbird’s junk logic. I need a concrete, step-by-step procedure that results in: </p><p>A visible, usable Junk/Spam folder for max@dantanas.com </p><p>inside Thunderbird. </p><p>Thunderbird recognizing that folder as the Junk folder. </p><p>The Junk settings becoming available so the account can move spam to that folder like all my other accounts do. </p><p>To be clear: </p><p>All my other accounts in Thunderbird already have functional Junk/Spam folders. </p><p>The problem is isolated to this one account. </p><p>I need an exact sequence of steps that I can follow to fix it, not abstract descriptions or background information. </p><p>Please provide a direct, step-by-step set of actions that will enable Thunderbird to create or use a Junk/Spam folder for this account. </p><p>Thank you, Max Makowski max@cape<a href=""http://-co.co"" rel=""nofollow"">-co.co</a> max@luck.fish </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,1784346;1784347;1784348;1784349;1784353;1784354;1784355;1784360;,max115

For personal email, it appears I can only connect via imap instead of MS’s protocol, which limits its ability to sync calendar. I’m wondering if there’s a way to login personal ms email similar to exchange to sync calendar etc.? </p><p>Thx in advance for ur help&nbsp;:-) </p>",thunderbird;calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1784357;,WilliamPan30

I've been through every possible setting, and still can't find the filters. Where are they? They've obviously been moved to somewhere obscure since I last used them (many versions ago, and they still run, I just can't locate them). </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1784362;,Beadmaster
