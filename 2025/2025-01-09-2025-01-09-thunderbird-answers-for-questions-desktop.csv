If you click on the 3 dots to the right of +New Message and select 'Show Folder Size', you will be able to see the size of each data file relating to the folder.

It is possible that I don't really understand the situation, but this is totally different that TB has acted for me in the past. Whenever I have emptied the Trash it has always taken a few moments to accomplish that. Then when I select Compact, it will take a few moments and show me the space recovered. Then when I go to the In Box and select Compact it takes a long time to work its way through my large file.  So the recent behavior of instant emptying of Trash and no compaction, but getting compaction from my small Junk folder, does not make sense to me. Thanks. </p>",russg2,false,0,0

That opens up MY name to accusations of spam, scams, and lots of other stuff. </blockquote> <p>That someone is YOU!  Not some nebulous ""other"". You want to manage your mail in Thunderbird, I assume that is why you installed it.  When you decide to delete an email you want it deleted. Without giving the TOOL (Thunderbird) you have chosen to use the ability to delete it can not.  The same goes for all of the other ""permissions"" which you think are some sort of loss of privacy or control or something.  </p> <blockquote> And if I don't agree and don't sign, I can't use Thunderbird any more?  </blockquote> <p>That is essentially correct as you have chosen not to allow Thunderbird access to your email. Thunderbird can not authenticate with gmail to get your mail and do its job, there would be no point.  It is not you can not use Thunderbird.  You have chosen not to. </p> <blockquote> Its no wonder that we have so many problems. </blockquote> <p>I simply do not understand that statement at all.  The choice is yours. All that is changing is your authentication method.  Thunderbird could as your agent always send mail etc. using your user name and password.  Now you are being told that the actions you undertake in Thunderbird will affect your gmail data and being asked to explicitly allow what has been going on for 20 years. </p> <blockquote> Is there no way around it? </blockquote> <p>Of course not.  Google /Alphabet have decided oauth is the authentication method they will allow for the accessing of gmail accounts, contacts and calendars.  Personally I see absolutely no reason to even try and get around it as it is actually more secure than two factor authentication. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Yet I can continue using Gmail in my browser with no problems. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Not in any way related. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Op andere computers krijg ik van Thunderbird bij zenden een bericht dat het wachtwoord niet klopt en dat ik het daar kan invullen, en eventueel ook laten opslaan. Op deze computer krijg ik bij zenden alleen het bericht dat er niet geauthentiseerd kan worden. Zonder enige aanwijzing voor het oplossen van het probleem. Daarom was ik aan het zoeken op alle plekken waar serverinstellingen bereikbaar zijn. Zonder resultaat. Toevallig kreeg ik vandaag eindelijk van Thunderbird de mogelijkheid om het wachtwoord in te voeren bij zenden. Het probleem is dus opgelost. Het blijft mij een raadsel waarom het tot gisteren niet lukte, en hoe het komt dat Thunderbird zich vandaag wel correct gedroeg. </p>",jeanpierre.kent,false,0,0
