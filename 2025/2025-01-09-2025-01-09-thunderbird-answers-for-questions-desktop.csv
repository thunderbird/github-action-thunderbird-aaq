To change your username, you would need to contact your Email provider. There may also be a setting in 'dodgyname@gmail.com' that will forward all your email to another Email account - in which case you would need to make another Gmail account and, eventually, get TB to access this account for email retrieval. </p><p>Or why not delete 'dodgyname@gmail.com' and make a single new Gmail account? </p>",frisée,false,0,0

I have often had this error and have waited for my ISP to get their act together as it has always been a problem with the SMTP server. Have you contacted your Email Provider or ISP? However, I've accessed your error message by searching in the window at the top left of this screen and note that many have advised that there could be a change in any Third Party anti-virus software that's being used. </p>",frisée,false,0,0

When an email is moved from one folder to another, it leaves behind blank space that cumulatively adds up. Compacting removes all this 'space'. If you click on the 3 dots to the right of +New Message and select 'Show Folder Size', you will be able to see the size of each data file relating to the folder. As you move files away from these, the size doesn't reduce because it crates 'blank space'. Compacting removes this. </p>",frisée,false,0,0
