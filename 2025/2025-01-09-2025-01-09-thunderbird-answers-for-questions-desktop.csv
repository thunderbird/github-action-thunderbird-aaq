If you click on the 3 dots to the right of +New Message and select 'Show Folder Size', you will be able to see the size of each data file relating to the folder.

It is possible that I don't really understand the situation, but this is totally different that TB has acted for me in the past. Whenever I have emptied the Trash it has always taken a few moments to accomplish that. Then when I select Compact, it will take a few moments and show me the space recovered. Then when I go to the In Box and select Compact it takes a long time to work its way through my large file.  So the recent behavior of instant emptying of Trash and no compaction, but getting compaction from my small Junk folder, does not make sense to me. Thanks. </p>",russg2,false,0,0

Ma questo sistema oggi funziona male, un mittente non lo trova mai, mentre per altri trova solo alcuni messaggi e non tutti. La versione di thunderbird è Thunderbird Desktop Version 128.6.0esr | Released January 8, 2025 (vedo che si è aggiornato ieri e rilevo i problemi da oggi). Per il filtro globale allego schermata, non funziona esegui filtri sulla cartella selezionata. C'è un ""cerca"" in alto nella barra che trovo scomodissimo perchè non dà l'anteprima del messaggio come prima. Forse sbaglio qualcosa? </p>",boergroup.it,false,0,0

This made no change in that delay for anything to happen once Junk (Unified) is right-clicked, but the delay time is now a consistent 5 seconds, which certainly is tolerable, though baffling.
