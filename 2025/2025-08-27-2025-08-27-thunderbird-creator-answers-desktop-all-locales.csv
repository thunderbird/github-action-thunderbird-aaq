Is it possible that I will be able to continue using Thunderbird with Microsoft and Windows 10, even though Windows 10 will not be revised?  Is it possible for the same Thunderbird software to be driven by software other than Microsoft and Windows 10?  If so, which software? </p><pre>      Thank you.
