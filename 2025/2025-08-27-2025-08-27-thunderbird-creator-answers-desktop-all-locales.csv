Then after a while it stops sending and receiving email. Eventually I am forced to remove the accounts and begin the cycle again. I can't for the life of me work it out.  </p><p>So far: I have updated the program. Set up the account from scratch numerous times Updated and changed the windstream email password. Scrubbed the program and all related folders numerous times. Checked for any obvious interference from security apps (currently only windows defender running) Checked for any internet connectivity problems (there were none) Changed around the IMAP settings to use any other combination of settings that would work (there were none) Read all the Mozilla Thunderbird posts on this forum related to Windstream numerous times. Scoured the internet for any other help. So now I'm actually posting about it. </p><p>Once again, initially the settings below work just fine, there is nothing but green lights and check marks and everything seems to be fine.....until its not and the cycle repeats over and over. I would welcome any assistance from anyone with experience using windsteam email on mozilla thunderbird or a moderator or administrator if any review these forums.

They suggested creating a default account.  I already had a default account, but changed it in hopes that it would help.  However, it didn't. - I deleted the global-messages-db.sqlite file to try to rebuild the profile (this was also suggested online).  The rebuild was successful, but I still could not receive emails. </p><p>Can you help me?
