This has kept happening for a long time now actually, surviving through at least two Mac OS updates, and a huge number of TB updates.  Everything's up to date. I tried to follow this: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269944"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269944</a> and this: <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems?_gl=1*86dj4d*_ga*MTkzNzQ0MjA3MS4xNzYyOTY4OTMx*_ga_2VC139B3XV*czE3NjMzMTM3NDckbzIkZzAkdDE3NjMzMTM3NDckajYwJGwwJGgw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems?_gl=1*86dj4d*_ga*MTkzNzQ0MjA3MS4xNzYyOTY4OTMx*_ga_2VC139B3XV*czE3NjMzMTM3NDckbzIkZzAkdDE3NjMzMTM3NDckajYwJGwwJGgw</a> but didn't succeed. Actually, in my case, the issue is more noticeable: I normally have TB open in background - sometimes everything's fine, and the battery goes down as normal, while sometimes instead the battery drops quickly, and checking in the Mac activity monitor I can see that the CPU usage of TB is totally abnormal. When this happens, I can actually see the activity bar in TB being live (bottom right corner, as it happens when TB is checking for new mails), but never disappearing. When I notice it, I just reboot TB, and the bar shuts off as normal after a quick mail check.  Moreover, checking the 24hr energy usage by app, TB is often on top with nonsense values. </p><p>I tried multiple times to rebuild the database, and do most of the tricks suggested, but didn't fix. Yes I have a huge mail archive, but the problem is not the standard management of this database: basically it seems that every now and then, TB decides to run some activity which it gets stuck in, and this kills the CPU. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help! </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",maXsc

But that's not what I want. I would just like to see a counter at the top of the icon showing the unread messages.

Of course for Multiple Occurrence Events, you would still first ask if the Edit is for 'Current' or 'All'.   </p><p>3. I don't get the 'ESR' &amp; 'Release' business. I have the 'ESR' version which, I believe, means I will only get updates once a year. Why&nbsp;? </p><p>Seems like a hassle to convert to the 'Release' version. I don't think I will bother.
