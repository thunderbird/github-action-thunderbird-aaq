In earlier versions, this was available as the “Message Preview Text” column, but in Supernova neither Table View nor Cards View currently display snippets. </p><p>For many users (myself included), having a one‑line preview of the message body is an important part of quickly scanning the inbox — it’s a feature Outlook and other clients provide, and it makes Thunderbird much more efficient to use. </p><p>Could you confirm if this feature is planned to return in a future release? If so, is there an estimated timeline? Even a rough idea would help us understand whether to wait for it or look for alternatives. </p><p>Thank you for all your work on Thunderbird — it’s a great project, and I appreciate the effort that goes into keeping it modern and usable. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1782287;1782465;1783102;1783103;,pyz01

I'm referring in particular to folders shared by other users within my organization. Now you have to create a sort of link to the folder which appears in My files. Previously I used the odrive client to sync all my cloud accounts (OneDrive, Dropbox and Google Drive). Because of the changes, those shared folders cannot be synced by odrive anymore and I had to switch to the official Microsoft OneDrive client. With that, I can now sync the folders on my local drive but I cannot attach files from those folders to a Thunderbird message. While the folders appears as a link in the root OneDrive folder when I browse it with Explorer, when I click on the folder I see the files are local copies synced in my filesystem. Yet, Thunderbird cannot access them and gives the attached following Send Message Error: <em>Sending of the message failed. </em> There was an error attaching kickoff_novembre2025_6slide_V2.pptx. Please check that you have access to the file.<em> </em> Obviously I could make a local copy and attach that, but it is not convenient at all.

I tried to find answers online and w/ISP. ISP said it was email problem. 2. Every year or 2, my email stops. When I call, the say it is thunderbird until I ask to verify ports. They come up with different ports. They say I need to use map instead of pop. I used pop as they first stated to use and then they wanted me to use imap. After trying ports they choose, it was ok for a while. I started out w/ assurance, name change to <a href=""http://domain.com"" rel=""nofollow"">domain.com</a>, then <a href=""http://web.com"" rel=""nofollow"">web.com</a> and now NS. They could not find my email in th past and then stated it was on a different server.  Which I think means there was a missing link. I am a user, not a programmer. I created 450 web pages with DW and was amazed they all passed online, still do. Now, with NS, email is stopped. They want me to use web mail and I do no. They stated to use outlook. I prefer thunderbird because I was told decades ago that thunderbird and Netscape were the best because they keep it simple W/O excessive links cluttering up the home. So, now my email shows that there is email commit I need the trailer on bottom of page but it does not show up. So, I did get a message earlier  Wed that thunderbird rejected ""imap"". ISP said not their problem.  I am 83, disabled vet and have tried evey combination of ports, pop, imap for days and hours with no avail.  So you are right. I am an idiot. My bank, cell phone co,, utilities and others recognize me by my email. I have many directories of frequent contacts from people I have deal with. I also save trash because it is a source of records.  When it works, it is great. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1782325;1783100;1783101;,j81

Because I have vision problems. So I run everything under Windows' ""High Contrast""  mode, which changes all displayed colors and backgrounds.   </p><pre>Given that is how my system is set,  Windows ""flips"" your new Dark Mode into a light and low contrast image that I cannot easily read.  </pre> <p>SO For users like me who must depend on Windows  High Contrast settings, everything is fine as long as Thunderbird retains the option to TURN OFF DARK MODE.

At the moment remote content (pictures, etc) only downloads when I view a message.  Naturally, remote content is allowed for everything in the setttings. What I'd like is to pre-download everything, so that, say, I could download the latest messages, board a flight, and work in transit without needing access to the Internet.

There is nothing wrong with either (the folder is fine) - I'm just testing out TB's functionality as I'm moving to it. </p><p>The settings are set to always download everything and always keep everything. It's TB version 143. The reason I know the files get deleted is - if I disconnect the Internet connection and click Repair Folder, then go into the profile directory, the mbox file is just gone, while the .msf is sitting at 0Kb waiting for the connection to re-establish.  Only the connection is back, TB re-downloads both the index and then ALL the messages in the account...! This is, obviously, highly problematic. </p><p>My question is two-fold: - is the expected behavior of the ""Repair Folder"" button to work offline? Should folder repair be possible even in offline mode? - has anyone else encountered this?  I reported this on Bugzilla, along with another fellow who has encountered the same: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1997845"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1997845</a> But it appears the developers have a hard time believing it's actually happening... </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1782956;,mym482
