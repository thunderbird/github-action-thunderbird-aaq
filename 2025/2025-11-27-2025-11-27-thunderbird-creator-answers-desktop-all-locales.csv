In earlier versions, this was available as the “Message Preview Text” column, but in Supernova neither Table View nor Cards View currently display snippets. </p><p>For many users (myself included), having a one‑line preview of the message body is an important part of quickly scanning the inbox — it’s a feature Outlook and other clients provide, and it makes Thunderbird much more efficient to use. </p><p>Could you confirm if this feature is planned to return in a future release? If so, is there an estimated timeline? Even a rough idea would help us understand whether to wait for it or look for alternatives. </p><p>Thank you for all your work on Thunderbird — it’s a great project, and I appreciate the effort that goes into keeping it modern and usable. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1782287;,pyz01

I'm referring in particular to folders shared by other users within my organization. Now you have to create a sort of link to the folder which appears in My files. Previously I used the odrive client to sync all my cloud accounts (OneDrive, Dropbox and Google Drive). Because of the changes, those shared folders cannot be synced by odrive anymore and I had to switch to the official Microsoft OneDrive client. With that, I can now sync the folders on my local drive but I cannot attach files from those folders to a Thunderbird message. While the folders appears as a link in the root OneDrive folder when I browse it with Explorer, when I click on the folder I see the files are local copies synced in my filesystem. Yet, Thunderbird cannot access them and gives the attached following Send Message Error: <em>Sending of the message failed. </em> There was an error attaching kickoff_novembre2025_6slide_V2.pptx. Please check that you have access to the file.<em> </em> Obviously I could make a local copy and attach that, but it is not convenient at all. Any fixes available? </p>",thunderbird;attachments;,thunderbird,attachments,en-US,"",gwaedin
