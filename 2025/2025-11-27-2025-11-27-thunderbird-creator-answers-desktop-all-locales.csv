Because of the changes, those shared folders cannot be synced by odrive anymore and I had to switch to the official Microsoft OneDrive client. With that, I can now sync the folders on my local drive but I cannot attach files from those folders to a Thunderbird message. While the folders appears as a link in the root OneDrive folder when I browse it with Explorer, when I click on the folder I see the files are local copies synced in my filesystem. Yet, Thunderbird cannot access them and gives the attached following Send Message Error: <em>Sending of the message failed. </em> There was an error attaching kickoff_novembre2025_6slide_V2.pptx.

A year ago after decades of thunderbird, I was required to sign into email everytime I went to or back to email. I tried to find answers online and w/ISP. ISP said it was email problem. 2. Every year or 2, my email stops. When I call, the say it is thunderbird until I ask to verify ports. They come up with different ports. They say I need to use map instead of pop. I used pop as they first stated to use and then they wanted me to use imap. After trying ports they choose, it was ok for a while. I started out w/ assurance, name change to <a href=""http://domain.com"" rel=""nofollow"">domain.com</a>, then <a href=""http://web.com"" rel=""nofollow"">web.com</a> and now NS. They could not find my email in th past and then stated it was on a different server.  Which I think means there was a missing link. I am a user, not a programmer. I created 450 web pages with DW and was amazed they all passed online, still do. Now, with NS, email is stopped. They want me to use web mail and I do no. They stated to use outlook. I prefer thunderbird because I was told decades ago that thunderbird and Netscape were the best because they keep it simple W/O excessive links cluttering up the home. So, now my email shows that there is email commit I need the trailer on bottom of page but it does not show up. So, I did get a message earlier  Wed that thunderbird rejected ""imap"". ISP said not their problem.  I am 83, disabled vet and have tried evey combination of ports, pop, imap for days and hours with no avail.  So you are right. I am an idiot. My bank, cell phone co,, utilities and others recognize me by my email. I have many directories of frequent contacts from people I have deal with. I also save trash because it is a source of records.
