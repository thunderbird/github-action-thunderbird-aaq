In earlier versions, this was available as the “Message Preview Text” column, but in Supernova neither Table View nor Cards View currently display snippets. </p><p>For many users (myself included), having a one‑line preview of the message body is an important part of quickly scanning the inbox — it’s a feature Outlook and other clients provide, and it makes Thunderbird much more efficient to use. </p><p>Could you confirm if this feature is planned to return in a future release? If so, is there an estimated timeline? Even a rough idea would help us understand whether to wait for it or look for alternatives. </p><p>Thank you for all your work on Thunderbird — it’s a great project, and I appreciate the effort that goes into keeping it modern and usable. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1782287;,pyz01
