How can I now provide Thunderbird today with a user name and a Password that does not exist?","<p>I think that I have been using Thunderbird as an email client for many many years from the early 2000's. And due to my ignorance  I never provided a password for the servers in my Pop 3  I left the box blank ,  and the same on my Imap account. I note that it always said that the password was insecure,which is not surprising as there was no password. Now this year I updated my Ubuntu LTS  to the latest LTS 2404. And something went wrong as I lost the Dual Boot facility and Windows 10. Which I had had for many years. And as of about March this year I no longer have thunderbird send to my computer  any copy of emails that I send and that are sent to me.  I have no doubt that it is my fault. . I have purchased a Laptop from Holland with only Ubuntu on it and that as of July this year also does not send to it this new Laptop any copies of emails that I send or that are sent to me. I was with NTLworld from the early 2000's and am now with <a href=""http://Virginmedia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Virginmedia.com</a>. And they have recently merged with O2, and I have a new sign in Password and Identity . And I am unable to find the old password that I used to sign in to Virginmedia.  I understand that due to cost cutting they might in future do away with providing emails for their clients in the first instance. I would really like to be able to restore Thunderbird if possible.But at 81 yrs old my comprehension is no longer what it was Regards Cliff Edwards. my <a href=""http://Ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ntlworld.com</a> email is cm.edwards1@ntlwold.com. </p>",thunderbird;save-passwords;,thunderbird,save-passwords,en-US,"",cm.edwards1
