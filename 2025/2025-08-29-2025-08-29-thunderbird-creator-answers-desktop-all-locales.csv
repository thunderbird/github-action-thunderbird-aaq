And due to my ignorance  I never provided a password for the servers in my Pop 3  I left the box blank ,  and the same on my Imap account. I note that it always said that the password was insecure,which is not surprising as there was no password. Now this year I updated my Ubuntu LTS  to the latest LTS 2404. And something went wrong as I lost the Dual Boot facility and Windows 10. Which I had had for many years. And as of about March this year I no longer have thunderbird send to my computer  any copy of emails that I send and that are sent to me.  I have no doubt that it is my fault. . I have purchased a Laptop from Holland with only Ubuntu on it and that as of July this year also does not send to it this new Laptop any copies of emails that I send or that are sent to me. I was with NTLworld from the early 2000's and am now with <a href=""http://Virginmedia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Virginmedia.com</a>. And they have recently merged with O2, and I have a new sign in Password and Identity . And I am unable to find the old password that I used to sign in to Virginmedia.  I understand that due to cost cutting they might in future do away with providing emails for their clients in the first instance.

My father will be 101 years old next month. He has been a user of Thunderbird for many years and loved it. Unfortunately, his health has declined and is currently under Hospice care. For several months, he has not used thunderbird  and will never be able to use it again. That being said, he continues to receive a charge from Thunderbird monthly in the amount of $21.40. I have tried to figure out how to stop his account for a couple of months with no success.  I would appreciate it if someone could help me to stop his account and negate any future charges. His email account is len.beers@cfl.rr.com.  I can be reached at 321-474-3967 or my email beers.charley@gmail.com. I hope I have given you enough information to help me. Please contact me at any time.
