I regularly put about 50 emails in my outbox using the mail merge add on and then send them in one go. I have done this very successfully for a long time using my Fastmail email account. Now after sending about 10 of the emails, Thunderbird hangs and I have to restart it to send the next 10. If I send them via my Gmail account it still works fine. I am trying to understand if this is a Fastmail or Thunderbird issue. I would have liked to try it on my new computer but with version 115.10 but cannot do this as it seems that the Profile is different. </p><p>Any advice gratefully received. </p><p>Thanks Bob </p>",thunderbird;app-crash;,thunderbird,app-crash,en-US,"",bob.sillitoe
