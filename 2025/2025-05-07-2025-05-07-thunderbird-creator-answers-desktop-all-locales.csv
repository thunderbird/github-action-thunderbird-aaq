To achieve this, I previously configured: 	•	Settings → General → Fonts &amp; Colors → Colors 	•	Set Text to black and Background to white 	•	Enabled “Override the colors specified by the content with my selections above:” and set it to “Only with High Contrast themes” </p><p>However, since this update, this setting no longer works. Now, the only workaround is to manually click the “Turn dark mode off” button for each email, which does work. But it’s inconvenient to do this every time. </p><p>Is there a way to disable dark mode for all email bodies by default, so I don’t need to click the button each time? </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>Yours, </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1730619;,NoSyu

However, I cannot reply to emails, getting an error message stating that the sending failed because the SMTP server timed out. This happens even if I type just one letter as a reply and hit send. I have been using Thunderbird for a couple of years on my other recalcitrant PC, and have never had this problem. I have checked and all settings are exactly the same on both computers, same security programs, everything. Some internet articles say that it could be the security system, I disabled that, but the problem persists. What is going on? So naturally, if I need to reply to you, I will have to use the other computer, which randomly shuts down at inopportune times.

Recently (since 138?) Thunderbird is failing to handle multiple calendar accounts. </p><p>Anonymized description of the situation: </p> <ul><li> Let's say that our baïkal caldav server resides at <a href=""https://abc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://abc.com</a> </li><li> There are two user accounts at this baïkal server: user1@abc.com and user2@def.org </li></ul> <p>(notice that these two users have different domains and tld's) </p> <ul><li> Of late, only the first caldav account (user1@abc.com) is handled. The second caldav account (user2@def.org) ran out of sync. </li><li> On the mobile phones, using davx5, all calendar accounts sync perfectly. So nothing is off with the baïkal server. </li><li> After removing the calendar(s) associated with user2@def.org from Thunderbird, it is not possible to add these again. After entering the e-mail address (user2@def.org) and the correct url of the caldav server, it looks like the user is overriden by user1@abc.com. There is also no dialogue asking for the password of user2@def.org. </li></ul> <p>My guesses: </p> <ul><li> Either TB 138 - silently - insists in caldav user accounts having the same domain.tld as the server  </li><li> Or TB 138 somehow overrides/overwrites an alternative e-mail address with the one already present, hence the missing password dialogue </li></ul> <p>Anyone else experiencing this? </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,nl,"",stephan35
