To achieve this, I previously configured: 	•	Settings → General → Fonts &amp; Colors → Colors 	•	Set Text to black and Background to white 	•	Enabled “Override the colors specified by the content with my selections above:” and set it to “Only with High Contrast themes” </p><p>However, since this update, this setting no longer works. Now, the only workaround is to manually click the “Turn dark mode off” button for each email, which does work. But it’s inconvenient to do this every time. </p><p>Is there a way to disable dark mode for all email bodies by default, so I don’t need to click the button each time? </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>Yours, </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1730619;,NoSyu
