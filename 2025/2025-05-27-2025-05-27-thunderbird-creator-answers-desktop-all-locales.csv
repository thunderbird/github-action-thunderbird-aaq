I had a copy of my profile (Joe) on a backup drive.  In the old versions of TB I would just copy the files (.mozmsgs, .msf and .sbd) in ""Joe"" to the new directory.  That no longer works as far as I can tell.  The import function does not work either.  The strange thing is when TB opens, I can see all the folders for a split second before they disappear. I'd really like to get back all my saved emails.  And no, they are not on the server as these are from multiple old email accounts.
