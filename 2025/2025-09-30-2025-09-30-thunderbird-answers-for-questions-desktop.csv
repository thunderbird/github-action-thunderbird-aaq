It was never intended to be treated as other email folders and the general recommendation is to NOT subscribe to that folder. It is a duplicate of all other messages, it doubles resource use when sending or retrieving, and it doubles disc space on your PC. If a message is still in another folder, such as inbox, or sent, then it cannot be removed from allmail. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I had a poke around and found the ""Enable adaptive junk mail controls for this account"" has been ticked.  I removed the tick and hope this will do the trick.
