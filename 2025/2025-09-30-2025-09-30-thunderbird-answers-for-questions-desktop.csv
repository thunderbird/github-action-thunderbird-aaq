A Dat file is a completely non application and non format specific file format. </p><p>I did a google search and that indicates that em client stores contact in a custom SQLITE database.

As I pointed out in my request for help, I have all the DATA files stored on my pen drive, but since eM Client has moved from ver9 to ver 10, it will not read my DATA files, which are in ver 9 form. Even 30 pages of help from Chat GPT did not give a solution, because eM Client will not allow me to download a workable ver 9 or 10. I have wasted 2 months of Chat GPT's and my time trying to fix what Chat GPT calls eM Client's ""brittle"" data storage system. I could spend approx. $300 to rent a program to extract and restore my data, so that it could be read by Thunderbird. I'm 81, on a small pension and cannot afford to get ""eM Client data into a usable format"".  Plus, it should be up to eM Client to make its data files transferable, when it crashes. </p><p>Anyway, more importantly, Thunderbird has decided to hide all the new ""Local folders"" that I so carefully set up last night. I right clicked on ""Local folders"", then on ""new folder"" to set up each of my storage folders for ""fishing club"" ""boat"", ""friends"" etc and filled each one with the applicable email. I then opened each labled folder, to check that I had done things correctly. Each opened perfectly. Closed down Thunderbird last night, but on opening TB tonight all 12 ""Local folders"" have disappeared. </p><p>I use an SSD for working and a HDD for all my data, music, photos. One bit of good news is, somehow most of my contacts have been imported from my C: drive to my E: drive, but, as with my local folders, TB has also hidden them. Forget about the loss of 10 years of emails and my large ""contacts"" folder, can you just help me ""show hidden folders"" in TB please </p>",johntc9,false,0,0

I followed your instructions, found the web page, downloaded the program that I've used successfully a number of times before and hit ""install"". Unlike the many installs before, this one took 3 mins and eventually told me that it had failed to install. This just confirmed that whatever I do, I will never restore all my emails etc.  Chat GPT said it was a lost cause, because eM Client has  a ""brittle"" data recovery system and I have accepted that, although I would have used a different description of its ""recovery system"", After 2 months of working on this problem, I have decided that life is too  short (at least for me, at 81) to use up valuable time on a failed cause. Let's forget about eM Client (its very name now causes me grief) and concentrate on trying to stop TB from following its example. All I want is for TB to give me back my "" Local Folders"" (please refer to my previous post). A hint or two on importing my ""contacts"" folder, would also cheer me up.

The prior group have myriad issues with everything from line wraps when they print to a different printer too poor results from a paste. </p><p>Next issue is that the style information would normally come with the paste from the likes of LibreOffice writer, looking into this with some experiments. I found the following </p><p>If LibreOffice writer is set to ""Default Paragraph style"" when the copy is initiated then the HTML that is placed in the clipboard for Thunderbird to get contains this definition. </p><pre>p style=""line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"" </pre> <p>ie The blocked text is a styled paragraph. </p><p>If the style in LibreWriter is set to ""body Text"" there is no style information passed to the clipboard about how the paragraph should be formatted  </p><p>In both instances however the text is explicitly delivered as a paragraph, not plain text. Browsers will by default place a blank line before and after See <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp</a>  The use of a paragraph will see the style of text shown in the toolbar to be paragraph.

Despite the Style being set to body,  it is changed to Paragraph by the paste and unless you have already placed some returns in the body of the email before you paste it will set the entire email to paragraph </p><p>Personally I do not recommend any form of composing of emails in a word processor because what you see is not what you get.. Compose in Thunderbird will be far more likely to be read and seen by your recipient as you typed it,  you pasted text might look good to you on your machine and a absolute layout disaster when Someone get it on their iphone or Android tablet with 3.5 inch display. </p><p>Personally I think you may not have actually pasted without formatting (Ctrl+Shift+V)  so right click in the body of an email and select paste without formatting and see if your result differs. </p><p>Have you tried selecting all the information that you have pasted into Thunderbird (ctrl+A) and explicitly setting the style to body text in the toolbar. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> Then there is what I consider to be a Thunderbird bug </p><p><br> </p><p>So when the information </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
