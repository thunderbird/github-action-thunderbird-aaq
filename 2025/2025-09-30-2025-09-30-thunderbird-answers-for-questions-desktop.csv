It was never intended to be treated as other email folders and the general recommendation is to NOT subscribe to that folder. It is a duplicate of all other messages, it doubles resource use when sending or retrieving, and it doubles disc space on your PC. If a message is still in another folder, such as inbox, or sent, then it cannot be removed from allmail. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Then I changed my mind and went back to ""Don't delete any messages.""  (I basically panicked, lol.)  I then checked folders containing  messages I wanted to save, and they were still there---but my Trash had deleted everything older than 6 months.   </p><p>So, maybe Thunderbird just needs to change the wording to state clearly that this option (to delete messages of a certain age) is just for the Trash folder? </p><p>Would it have made a difference if I disconnected from WIFI first?  Or do you think the same messages would have been deleted from my Trash, whether connected to WiFi or not?   Also, does anyone know how much GRACE period you have, after you click on ""Delete messages more than XX"", before you increase the number from the Default 30 to something greater?  </p><p>Other option:  To be safe, ARCHIVE tickets and other important messages!

For your purposes, I recommend it. highlight the trash folder, rightclick, select properties, select retention period, UNTICK account settings and click the desired option. This is clear, unambiguous, and should do what you wish. I regret any confusion. To my knowledge, there is no grace period: thunderbird acts on the fly. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
