I suggest you look at profile in windows file explorer, as you may see multiple copies of the prefs file, such as prefs-1, prefs-2, etc.  (And, there may be other files in similar status. You haven't upgraded in several years, some minor cleanup may be desirable.)  For the prefs, if duplicates are found, my suggestion is to delete all but the one with highest number, and rename that one to prefs.js (with thunderbird not running) and restart. For the bigger question on why your problem is happening, I have no idea. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

That is, the setting is in a file for the account, popstate.dat, and it is not being updated at closure. Which means that thunderbird keeps retrieving the same message.
