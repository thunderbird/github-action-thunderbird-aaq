Most issues with IMAP copying come down to timing and the frequency of the updates.

Hotmail simply used to ignore requests to connect at intervals of less than 15 minutes and the results you get on shorter time frames are often quite odd as it takes time for the downloads, and on consumer internet connections usually up to 4 times longer, for the uploads involved in synchronization.  Add in a useless antivirus scan or four.  Once to get the mail,  once again to write it to disk and them a third to send the update back to the server that you have seen the message and another when the temp file is written to view the message and sometimes another scan because the read status has changed from unread to read.  All in about 2 seconds usually,  but I have had simple deletions take more than 10 minutes to be processed on the Hotmail servers (Hotmail, MSN, live and outlook as well of office365 are all interchangeable names for the Microsoft implementation of Exchange server they have on the web.  It is all the same infrastructure,  only different mappings depending on how much money you have handed over.  Now slow things down with a VPN to confuse the routing of messages and it is a recipe for failure. </p><p>I have personally seen the Hotmail servers take more than 10 minutes to process a simple delete request via the POP protocol,  which they chose to ignore and move the mail into a sub folder of the deleted mail folder.  SO waiting to get your full new mail request a little longer will pay dividends as Microsoft tend to oversubscribe/overload their service.  There is no profit in idle machines or factories. </p><p>To be clear here consumer internet plans are rarely symmetrical (business plans often are) and advertise download speeds because they are almost always much faster that uploads.  Consumer internet being aimed at content consumption,  not content creation.  For example. Starlink advertise upload speeds between 5 and 25mbps and downloads of 30 - 100 mbps so when updates to things like IMAP require a lot of data transfer to the server things tend to happen much more slowly then folk anticipate, being used to streaming downloads the fair fly along. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Since I have two computers currently, the faster one is using Windows 11 and Thunderbird is not having this problem.  2. Even on the faster computer, it isn't Hotmail that seems slow, but rather the ISP e-mail accounts, which they must be throttling somehow, since even accounts that have no new activity, zero, will indicate 10-15 minutes processing time, but this is actually in the Microsoft Outlook program that I see that, Thunderbird really doesn't have a feedback like that in the Activity monitor popup.  3. I did set the automatic check time to 30 minutes, but honestly I don't really leave the program open for hours on end, it is usually opened, and then after it processes all the new messages, closed. But I have been waiting a while to close it thinking it needs to update something to fix this problem of not recording that it has already downloaded all the messages from 4/16 forward (this being an issue in the Inbox only, not the other folders.)  4. Today I decided to reset the Inbox folder and let it download all of the messages fresh. I'm old enough to remember slow internet going all the way back to dial-up, but with DSL now I can just let the program stay open until if finishes downloading all the messages and it won't take forever. The folder is 7gb in size. But it does take longer to download than it would take to download say a single program.exe file of the same size. </p>",tk21,false,0,0

We have never grouped things by thread, so that is turned off in the ""select columns to display"" and when I go to View/Threads on the menu, everything is greyed out. I then activated 'Threads' and it showed that 'All' was ticked. But the point about the quick filter settings did make a difference. For some reason on one of the three inboxes the 'show only messages with attachments' button had been activated, and when I deactivated it eight messages appeared that had all arrived this morning.  The missing older messages did not arrive.  In the other two inboxes none of the buttons in the quick filter had been activated, but deactivating that one on the first inbox nonetheless seems to have solved the problem: eleven messages popped into inbox 2 (dated 7 April to today), and when I sent a test message to all three inboxes from my Gmail account, it appeared in all of them. So I am tentatively saying 'This solved the problem'.  Renewed thanks! </p>",Janet1593,false,0,0

It allows people to view a particular profile,if they have more than one and it also create a new one, but I doubt that is the case with you. </p><p>The part that says --allow-downgrade  means if you had uninstalled Thunderbird and wanted to go back to a previous version, it should allow this to occur.
