We have never grouped things by thread, so that is turned off in the ""select columns to display"" and when I go to View/Threads on the menu, everything is greyed out. I then activated 'Threads' and it showed that 'All' was ticked. But the point about the quick filter settings did make a difference. For some reason on one of the three inboxes the 'show only messages with attachments' button had been activated, and when I deactivated it eight messages appeared that had all arrived this morning.  The missing older messages did not arrive.  In the other two inboxes none of the buttons in the quick filter had been activated, but deactivating that one on the first inbox nonetheless seems to have solved the problem: eleven messages popped into inbox 2 (dated 7 April to today), and when I sent a test message to all three inboxes from my Gmail account, it appeared in all of them.

Just allow them in Thunderbird. </p><p>If the failure occurs after you allow the access then the issue is Thunderbird is not receiving the message on localhost.  IP address 127.0.0.1.   In this instance you generally get the email from google saying Thunderbird is authorized to access your email,  just not a working account in Thunderbird. </p><p>Generally these issues arise because other software is monitoring the localhost and consuming messages.  Development tools, web hosting applications like Apache and sometimes security software (Antivirus/Firewall) are the usual issue.
