I suggest you look at profile in windows file explorer, as you may see multiple copies of the prefs file, such as prefs-1, prefs-2, etc.  (And, there may be other files in similar status. You haven't upgraded in several years, some minor cleanup may be desirable.)  For the prefs, if duplicates are found, my suggestion is to delete all but the one with highest number, and rename that one to prefs.js (with thunderbird not running) and restart. For the bigger question on why your problem is happening, I have no idea. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If your backups include the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder, fixing the issue may be quick, but if just the profile itself, a bit more work. If you have the thunderbird folder, just replace the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder with your backup.  Otherwise, I suggest placing the backed up profile in the  users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles folder and then follow steps here for starting profile manager with thunderbird closed:  </p><pre><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_starting-the-profile-manager"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_starting-the-profile-manager</a> </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0
