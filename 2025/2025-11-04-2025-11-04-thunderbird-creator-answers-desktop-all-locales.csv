Not the same email into separate folder accounts, rather 8 to 10 duplicates from whomever into the account it was sent to. </p><p>After restarting Thunderbird error box stated - ""Thunderbird is already running, but not responding.  The old Thunderbird process must be closed to open a new window."" </p><p>After reviewing in Task Manager, no instance was running nor in the background. </p><p>I made a copies of these files onto a separate drive: </p><p>1)  AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles </p><pre>     and profiles.ini </pre> <p>2)  AppData\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles </p> <h1 id=""w_"">=</h1> <p>I uninstalled Thunderbird (v 140.4.0) and did a new install, this was v 140.4.0esr </p><p>Thunderbird did open with the new install. </p><p>However it will only display the Email Account Folders and Not any of the previous emails. </p><p>It was looking into the appropriate folder, but not loading the data. </p><p>On one account I changed the location to read the profile containing the emails with no change via: Account Settings/Server/Local Settings. </p><p>I can tell by the size of the folder in the default profile, it does contain the email data, I just need it to load it. </p><p>I don't think uninstalling Thunderbird 140.4.0esr and re-installing v 140.4.0 would make any difference?? </p><p>Very Interesting - any thoughts to remedy? </p><p>Thanks - Drew </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",reg51

I find the background colors of the Message List Pane and the Message Pane almost the same as background of the Header pane. I would like to change the background color of the Header Pane so that it stands out more. I looked on the internet and found some solutions to most other Header Pane features but not the background color. Most of those solutions were additions to the userChrome.css file that appear not to work on V144. </p><p>I would appreciate some help with this. </p>,thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1776864;,fhutt
