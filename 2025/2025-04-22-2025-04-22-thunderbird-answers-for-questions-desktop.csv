Ale přišel jsem na zvláštní věc, v místních složkách mám podsložku s názvem ""firemní"" a v této složce uložené emaily jsou vidět pouze řádkový výpis ale nelze je číst ani otevřít příloha pokud je připojena. Když jsem tuto podsložku přejmenoval např. ""aaa"" nebo ""bbb"" nebo ""pokus"" tak se emaily zaktivní a je vidět text a lze otevřít i příloha. Po přejmenování zpět na ""firemní"" se to vrátí do původního stavu a je vidět pouze řádkový soupis emailů, ale neukáže se text ani příloha. </p><p>Děkuji Pavel </p>",trochpavel,false,0,0

To guarantee accessibility, exporting each message to EML may be best, but mbox format is more convenient as that contains all messages in a folder. One way to be sure of your backups is to use a free mbox viewer, such as the one at <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/mbox-viewer/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceforge.net/projects/mbox-viewer/</a>  - It just unzips, not install. Some of the messages are clumsy, but it lets you see all messages outside of Thunderbird dependency. There are several free viewers, and here is a slightly fancier one:  <a href=""https://www.freeviewer.org/mbox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freeviewer.org/mbox/</a>  The mbox files with thunderbird usually have an accompanying file with msf suffix. You can ignore those, as they are just indexes.  </p><p>On that, I always do backups with the intent of being able to easily move to another PC or do a full reinstall. To do that with Thunderbird, here are steps that do work:  </p><p><br> <strong>BACKUP</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is not running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li></ol> <p><strong>RESTORE</strong> </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is installed and NOT running </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there. This may prompt to overwrite an existing folder of same name. allow it </li><li> start thunderbird and all should be there </li></ol> <p>This backs up the data, and also all the settings for thunderbird and accounts for a much easier move between computers. For me, this has never failed. And I do it every couple of weeks to avoid total loss. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
