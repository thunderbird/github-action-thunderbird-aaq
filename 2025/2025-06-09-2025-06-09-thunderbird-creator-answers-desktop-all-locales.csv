I have installed thunderbird again but unable to access my emails and calander which i really need access to. The email address i use we have had forever and when the company i started up with sold i was able to keep using my email address through The Messaging Company (Australia) by paying a yearly subscription.  Can someone help me access my account please.  Also am not very tech savvy so hopefully nothing too complicated would be very much appreciated.
