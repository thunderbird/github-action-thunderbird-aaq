E.g. is the visual in my Editor often in Arial but when i send the mail, then i see in my sended mails that the font switched back to calibri. I thought the ""Paste Text without format"" option will delet the format of the inserted Text and using the default mail format which i defined in my settings? </p><p>Its annoing cause i always produce Mails with different styles in it.
