I've done several tests and it seems like my account might be corrupted. When I try to move or delete a folder in Thunderbird, it doesn’t work — the folder name appears in italics. </blockquote> <p>Folder names in Italics means the folder has been given a <strong>no-select</strong> status. That means those folders  can contain other folders but cannot contain any emails itself.  I use a gmail account and can easily create them on the server, so I can use them as no-select folders in imap account. Useful if you just want a header folder for a bunch of folders that you actually use to store emails. It seems, you have managed to perform the same by renaming. Handy to know about this MS quirk. </p><p>If you have an imap account then folders will match whatever is on server. Folders are synchronised with folders on server, so a change in name might cause an issue if it does not exist on server. Microsoft Accounts are not always so user friendly. Advise, you unsubscribe from folders then they get removed from the view in Folder Pane. Then via the Microsoft Account webmail account, you can then delete them or rename them. Later you can subscribe again to see the renamed folder. </p> <blockquote>  I also tried moving a folder directly on the Exchange server. But when I reopened Thunderbird, the folder didn’t appear in its new location. Instead, it stayed in the same place, showed up in italics, and the emails inside were missing. Fortunately, the emails weren’t deleted — they’re still in the folder, but only visible from the Exchange server. </blockquote> <p>Try this: In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li> Right click on the account name folder and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> Click on 'Refresh' </li><li> Reselect the correct folders and click on 'Subscribe' </li><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul> <blockquote> Here are the anomalies I’ve noticed: - There are two profile folders in the data directory - I have two trash folders: one labeled ""Deleted Items"" and another local folder called ""Corbeille"" - I see multiple ghost folders with no emails inside but only in thunderbird app in the laptop, I've got no problem in android app.   And here are the screenshots </blockquote> <p><em>re&nbsp;:There are two profile folders in the data directory</em> Having more than one profile is not necessarilly an anomaly.  The one ending <strong>.default</strong> is an original profile probably quite old, but was last used a month ago and according to your profiles.ini, it looks like you have selected it as the default.  So I would have expected you to be using it.  But it looks like  you are not using the .default profile  because the image of Account Settings &gt; Local Folders says it's using 'Local Directory in the .default-release profile.  </p><p>You need to check where the  imap account is looking to see folders because it should be using the same .default-release' profile name. Then you need to check whether you have the correct profile set up as default so it matches where you are pointing all your accounts to use. You should not be using the profile called 'default if you are not using that location to store emails - it could mess up all sorts of thigs. </p><p>In 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Server Settings' for  imap account look bottom right for Local directory...' Does it also point to using .default-release? eg&nbsp;:  </p> <ul><li> C:\Users\paola\Appdata\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\<strong>lbe1qvoi.default-release</strong>\ImapMail\MS account name folder </li></ul> <p>The one ending .default-release would have been created after the .default, The install reference number I'm not sure which one that was but it could be as far back as version 78* </p><p>The best place to check what profile you are using as default is to look here: </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Under Application Basics' - near the bottom is 'Profiles' - click on 'about:profiles' </li><li> It opens in a new tab - What do you see&nbsp;? </li><li> The one that says 'Default Profile: yes' is the one set up as default. </li></ul> <p>I suggest you make sure the 'Profile: default-release'  is set as default. If not set up as default then there should a button below it - click on 'Set as default profile' </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:I have two trash folders: one labeled ""Deleted Items"" and another local folder called ""Corbeille""</em> </p><p>You should have a Trash for the Imap account. It's usually called the same name as whatever is used on server. So it could called 'Trash', 'Bin', 'Deleted Items'  You should also have a Trash folder in the 'Local Folders' account. In image, I notice the 'Local Folders' account is using the French language, so maybe Corbeille is the Trash folder for the Local Folders account. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Basically, there should be a load of mbox and .msf files for all your folders. It is displaying the .sbd folders which would also contain mbox and .msf files. You have altered something so Windows is not displaying the content of those folders.
