I have created many folders in Thunderbird, to store many of my incoming emails in. Recently, I had to purchase a new computer with Windows 11 installed, as I had used Windows 10 for many years on my old, now outdated computer. Is there a way to retrieve my folders from Thunderbird, so that I can have them on my new computer, or are they lost forever? I have my hard drive from my old computer, so would they be on that hard drive somewhere? Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1774912;,psacardkev

Non sono sparite a random ma da un certo punto in poi dall'albero delle cartelle. Questo è successo con l'aggiornamento 144.0.1 (64 bit). Ho provato ad reinstallare Thunderbird caricando l'ultimo backup ma il problema persiste. Ho usato la modalità risoluzione dei problemi senza risolvere la problematica. Il Backup caricato secondo me ha le mail al proprio interno ma no si riesce a visualizzarle.

Se qualcuno può aiutarmi per il recupero vi sarei grato anche perchè usando la ricerca non riesco a trovare le mail all'interno delle cartelle.

What happens, a lot, is that after checking a message via filter from months ago, the filter is released, the full list appears briefly, I select the top message if I'm quick, and then it re-selects the message from months ago.
