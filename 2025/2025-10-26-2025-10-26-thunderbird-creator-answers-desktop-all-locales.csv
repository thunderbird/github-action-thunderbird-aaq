1543208,2025-10-25 19:08:52 -0700,2025-10-25 20:04:01 -0700,Thunderbird keeps timing out when downloading my IMAP email but only from one account usa.net,"<p>Just what it says.  Using the latest version of Thunderbird on Windows 11 Pro.   </p><p>I have had my <a href=""http://usa.net"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.net</a> account use the same IMAP settings forever; I double-checked my settings and they are correct. </p><p>Now, I get a LOT of email on that account -- I typically download it when I hit 10K messages.  This usually isn't a problem. </p><p>I tried moving all of my current Inbox (already in TBird) to my archives.  I was then able to download about 1K messages and then it stalled downloading.  Said I either didn't have write access to the disk or had a file permission.  I'm not seeing anything on the web interface for <a href=""http://usa.net"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.net</a> on this.   </p><p>Now, I have 3 other IMAP accounts on T-bird -- 1 is never used (default from my ISP), a 2nd is very light traffic (mostly I stick with that email provider because they are small and still have private shell accounts) and the 3rd is my business vanity domain--high traffic but not the same as <a href=""http://usa.net"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.net</a> (where I get ALL my receipts for any online purchases, daily newsletters, help forums, etc). </p><p>Any idea what may be going on?  Please be kind; I am not a programmer, just a more tech-savvy than the average bear (as in if IT is busy at work people ask me for regular stuff).   </p><p>If any more info/filedump stuff is needed to see what's going on, please do let me know and I will tag it up asap. </p><p>Thanks again, community! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1774875;1774877;,Threemoons
