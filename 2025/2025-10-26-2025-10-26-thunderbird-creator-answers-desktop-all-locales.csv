Using the latest version of Thunderbird on Windows 11 Pro.   </p><p>I have had my <a href=""http://usa.net"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.net</a> account use the same IMAP settings forever; I double-checked my settings and they are correct. </p><p>Now, I get a LOT of email on that account -- I typically download it when I hit 10K messages.  This usually isn't a problem. </p><p>I tried moving all of my current Inbox (already in TBird) to my archives.  I was then able to download about 1K messages and then it stalled downloading.  Said I either didn't have write access to the disk or had a file permission.  I'm not seeing anything on the web interface for <a href=""http://usa.net"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.net</a> on this.   </p><p>Now, I have 3 other IMAP accounts on T-bird -- 1 is never used (default from my ISP), a 2nd is very light traffic (mostly I stick with that email provider because they are small and still have private shell accounts) and the 3rd is my business vanity domain--high traffic but not the same as <a href=""http://usa.net"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.net</a> (where I get ALL my receipts for any online purchases, daily newsletters, help forums, etc). </p><p>Any idea what may be going on?  Please be kind; I am not a programmer, just a more tech-savvy than the average bear (as in if IT is busy at work people ask me for regular stuff).   </p><p>If any more info/filedump stuff is needed to see what's going on, please do let me know and I will tag it up asap. </p><p>Thanks again, community! </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1774875;1774877;1774883;,Threemoons

I have created many folders in Thunderbird, to store many of my incoming emails in. Recently, I had to purchase a new computer with Windows 11 installed, as I had used Windows 10 for many years on my old, now outdated computer. Is there a way to retrieve my folders from Thunderbird, so that I can have them on my new computer, or are they lost forever? I have my hard drive from my old computer, so would they be on that hard drive somewhere? Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-email;,thunderbird,import-and-export-email,en-US,1774912;,psacardkev

Mainly on filtering. I discovered that when clicking in the ""quick"" filter bar a couple of new important buttons appear. Because I am already typing I didn't see them.. </p><p>Still a problem is that the all those buttons have a blue line appearing which I don't see on my screen. I see a little bit more dark grey but I really have to compare to see the difference. I will ask this question on the Ubuntu/Xubuntu-forum. </p><p>THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS BETTER. </p>",thunderbird;search;,thunderbird,search,nl,1774905;1774927;,Linuxrules

Non sono sparite a random ma da un certo punto in poi dall'albero delle cartelle. Questo è successo con l'aggiornamento 144.0.1 (64 bit). Ho provato ad reinstallare Thunderbird caricando l'ultimo backup ma il problema persiste. Ho usato la modalità risoluzione dei problemi senza risolvere la problematica. Il Backup caricato secondo me ha le mail al proprio interno ma no si riesce a visualizzarle.                                                        La cartella del backup come da indirizzo ""C:\Users\NomePc\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\2bslcy6n.default\Mail\Local Folders\DOCUMENTI PERSONALI.sbd"" è la cartella che contiene tutte le cartelle create ma il client ne visualizzasolo una parte. Se qualcuno può aiutarmi per il recupero vi sarei grato anche perchè usando la ricerca non riesco a trovare le mail all'interno delle cartelle.   Grazie infinite per la vs. attenzione </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,it,1774906;,denis3742
