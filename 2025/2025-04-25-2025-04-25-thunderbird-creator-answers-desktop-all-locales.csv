Late in 2024, the bank with which I have my bank accounts here, recommend that I cease using the Zimbra suite and transfer all my dealing with them to a Gmail account as they feared that I would probably be hacked.  I have done that but problems remain with it. </p><p>A few weeks ago this got worse and I got over 200 emails for LIME's (now named FLOW) Billpay system advising of overdue accounts, none of which were mine.  I have reported this to FLOW but that have given me no assistance.  I understand that they intend phasing out use of the Zimbra suite. </p><p>Currently, both the Zimbra and Gmail accounts are integrated into Thunderbird on my system. </p><p>My question is, can I remove the Zimbra suite completely and incorporate this into my Gmail account? </p><p>Can you please assist on this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728134;1728139;1728154;1728156;,dforrest
