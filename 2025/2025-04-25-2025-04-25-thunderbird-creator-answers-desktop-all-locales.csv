I used this with “Thunderbird” until recently basically without any problems.  However, during 2024 I started to get many scam email problems.  Late in 2024, the bank with which I have my bank accounts here, recommend that I cease using the Zimbra suite and transfer all my dealing with them to a Gmail account as they feared that I would probably be hacked.  I have done that but problems remain with it. </p><p>A few weeks ago this got worse and I got over 200 emails for LIME's (now named FLOW) Billpay system advising of overdue accounts, none of which were mine.  I have reported this to FLOW but that have given me no assistance.  I understand that they intend phasing out use of the Zimbra suite. </p><p>Currently, both the Zimbra and Gmail accounts are integrated into Thunderbird on my system. </p><p>My question is, can I remove the Zimbra suite completely and incorporate this into my Gmail account? </p><p>Can you please assist on this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728134;1728139;1728154;1728156;1728174;1728175;1728180;,dforrest

But Thunderbird doesn't allow saving in RTFD format, only .txt text and .eml email formats. Only Apple Mail allows saving on RTFD format. How can I save emails in both RTFD format and .EML format in Thunderbird in Mac OS? I'm running a 2012 Macbook Pro with Catalina 10.15 just for the Rogers email account, because if I switch to another Mac, I lose access to the AppleMail client for my <a href=""http://Rogers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Rogers.com</a> account. I'm mainly using a 2023 Mac Mini M2 8-512 running Mac OS Sonoma 14.5.  </p><p>Switch my email and login from dave.stuhl@rogers.com to dave.stuhl05@gmail.com, as I switched to GMail last November. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728389;,dave.stuhl6

(It was very difficult, including creating a new `https` setting and hand-editing the profile's `handlers.json` file.) So now I can finally open links in emails like I could in TB 102 before upgrading to 128. Since I have ""Always ask"" set, I get a dialog with a choice of which web browser to use. All good. </p><p>Problem is that the browser dialog pops up a minimum of once per hour whether TB is open (not minimized/iconified) or not.  (I leave TB running at all times, often for months at a time.) This is annoying, particularly because the URLs are to internal TB infrastructure, usually but not always <a href=""https://notifications.thunderbird.net/2.0/notifications.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://notifications.thunderbird.net/2.0/notifications.json</a>. </p><p>What should I do with these JSON links? Many don't even have a filename in the URL, so I can't save them in my profile folder even if I wanted to. If TB wants them as updates shouldn't it know where/what to do with them, and do it? I suppose I could turn off ""Always ask"", which I don't want to do -- would TB handle the URLs correctly then? Or would it just open the link in the default browser and I'd be worse off than I am now? (I usually just ""Cancel"" the dialog and don't go to the URL.) </p><p>It would be even better if I could completely turn off all notifications, period. I always have ""Check for new messages every ... minutes"" turned off and manually check my POP/IMAP messages when I want to. I'll update TB when my Linux distro has a new version. In fact I've always noticed  that TB runs continuously as a background process, adding a small percentage to a CPU core's usage. Is there any way to turn this off, too, so that TB is completely quiescent until un-mininized and ""Get Messages"" or ""New Message"", etc. is clicked? </p><p>Any help appreciated. I've used Thunderbird exclusively as my email client for over 20 years, and IMO these kinds of new features and the breakages they cause have made things continuously worse since the days when I used TB 68 and 78. BTW, I've tried all the above in 115 and 137 with the same problems. </p>",thunderbird;settings;linux;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1728178;,thanks4opensource
