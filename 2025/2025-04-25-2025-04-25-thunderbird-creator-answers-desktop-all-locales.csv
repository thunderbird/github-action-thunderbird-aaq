If I reply to a message using Thunderbird, both Thunderbird and OWA recognize that the message has been answered and they both add an arrow icon to the message.

I used this with “Thunderbird” until recently basically without any problems.  However, during 2024 I started to get many scam email problems.  Late in 2024, the bank with which I have my bank accounts here, recommend that I cease using the Zimbra suite and transfer all my dealing with them to a Gmail account as they feared that I would probably be hacked.  I have done that but problems remain with it. </p><p>A few weeks ago this got worse and I got over 200 emails for LIME's (now named FLOW) Billpay system advising of overdue accounts, none of which were mine.  I have reported this to FLOW but that have given me no assistance.  I understand that they intend phasing out use of the Zimbra suite. </p><p>Currently, both the Zimbra and Gmail accounts are integrated into Thunderbird on my system. </p><p>My question is, can I remove the Zimbra suite completely and incorporate this into my Gmail account? </p><p>Can you please assist on this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1728134;1728139;,dforrest

Every account was using 2FA so I had to enter new verification code each time. When I was adding 3rd or 4th account and was entering Google verification code into the form it suggested one of the codes I used before. Codes had same first two numbers so I guess I know why this form suggested one of the old codes but where does Thunderbird store these codes?  I've deleted search history and cache in Thunderbird and attempted adding another gmail account but this time when I was asked for 2FA code I started with older verification codes and this form remembered all of them.
