If I reply to a message using Thunderbird, both Thunderbird and OWA recognize that the message has been answered and they both add an arrow icon to the message. However, if I reply to a message using OWA, Thunderbird does not recognize that the message has been answered. Is that normal? Shouldn't it see the \Answered flag on the IMAP server? </p><p>I'm using IMAP on an Exchange server, and this happens with Thunderbird Beta 138.0b4 and Daily 139.0a1 (2025-04-23) under Windows. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",robert.funnell
