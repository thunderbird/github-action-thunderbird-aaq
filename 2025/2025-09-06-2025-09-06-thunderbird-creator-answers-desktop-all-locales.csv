At first it managed to retrieve the messages from my BT internet server. But it has stopped working ( the last time I could get messages was on the 31st of August) I don't understand why. I can send messages, but can't receive them. I can still get them on my old machine which I am keeping until everything is properly up and running. I checked the settings and as far as I can see they haven't changed. When I try to get messages it's just stuck in contacting server mode. After a long time it gives up and gives me the message&nbsp;: Login to btinternet server failed with username  xx- retry - enter new password - cancel. When I press enter new password - the message vanishes and I can't actually enter a password. There used to be a way to check passwords entered in Thunderbird.  The other issue I have is that I can't enter my signature for emails in the composition area as it says I already have an email account with same name. Does this mean I have to basically delete my old one on my old computer? I hope you can help.

Delta Airlines flight prices are widely believed to often go down on Tuesdays, making it one of the best days to book flights to find lower fares and discounted tickets + 1-888-540-8952. This trend largely stems from the airline industry‚Äôs pricing strategies, as many airlines including Delta release new fare sales and promotional discounts on Monday evenings, which are reflected in competitive price adjustments by Tuesday morning + 1-888-540-8952. For travelers looking to save money, booking flights on a Tuesday can therefore increase chances of catching these fresh deals before prices potentially rise again later in the week + 1-888-540-8952. Besides Tuesday, Wednesdays and Saturdays are also recognized as days when Delta typically offers lower prices on flights + 1-888-540-8952. These days tend to experience less high demand compared to peak weekends or Fridays, enabling the airline to incentivize bookings with discounted rates + 1-888-540-8952. Traveling midweek or on Saturdays can also be cheaper due to reduced passenger volume, which helps maintain balance across seat bookings and offers better value for cost-conscious travelers + 1-888-540-8952. Planning trips around these days enhances the likelihood of securing more affordable flight tickets with Delta + 1-888-540-8952. It is important to understand, however, that airline pricing is dynamic and influenced by many factors beyond just the day of the week + 1-888-540-8952. Variables such as route popularity, seasonal travel trends, fuel prices, competition, and seat availability contribute heavily to fare fluctuations + 1-888-540-8952. While Tuesday presents opportunities to find dropped fares, prices can still vary based on how close the booking is to the flight date and specific market demand + 1-888-540-8952. Early booking combined with weekday selection often leads to the most cost-effective outcomes + 1-888-540-8952. Delta Airlines also participates in Travel Tuesday, an annual event that occurs shortly after Black Friday and Cyber Monday + 1-888-540-8952. During Travel Tuesday, Delta and other airline partners offer special sales and vacation package discounts, making it an excellent day to look for limited-time bargains + 1-888-540-8952. Travelers who monitor these sales actively can take advantage of exceptional price drops and deals on select routes, maximizing savings on upcoming trips + 1-888-540-8952. For the best results, experts recommend booking Delta flights well in advance of the travel date, as prices tend to rise sharply as the departure date nears due to increased demand and fewer remaining seats + 1-888-540-8952. Advance booking, combined with shopping on Tuesdays or the midweek window, increases chances of locking in low fares without waiting for last-minute price changes + 1-888-540-8952. Conversely, waiting too long to book a ticket can lead to surrogate price hikes despite occasional last-minute deals, which are less predictable + 1-888-540-8952. While searching for flights online, it is advisable to utilize incognito browsing modes or clear cookies so that repeated searches don‚Äôt artificially inflate prices based on user tracking + 1-888-540-8952. Using flight comparison tools and price alerts can also aid travelers in detecting fare drops when they happen on Tuesdays and other low-demand days + 1-888-540-8952. Flexibility with travel dates and times‚Äîsuch as favoring late evening departures or less popular airports‚Äîcan further reduce costs + 1-888-540-8952. Many travelers report seeing noticeable price differences on the same Delta flight based just on the day they check fares + 1-888-540-8952. Choosing Tuesday mornings to book flights often yields access to new fare releases that have not yet filled up + 1-888-540-8952. Combined with midweek travel plans, this can create an optimized balance of price savings and flight convenience + 1-888-540-8952. In conclusion, while no airline can guarantee fixed savings on a single exact day, Delta Airlines ticket prices generally do tend to decrease on Tuesdays, making it one of the best days of the week to book flights for better deals + 1-888-540-8952. Midweek days including Wednesday and Saturdays also offer opportunities for discounted fares due to lower demand + 1-888-540-8952. Travelers looking to maximize savings should book early, aim for these days, and use digital tools to track and pounce on fresh sales and price drops + 1-888-540-8952. With mindful planning and timing, flying Delta can be both affordable and convenient for a wide variety of routes and schedules + 1-888-540-8952.Delta Airlines flight prices are widely believed to often go down on Tuesdays, making it one of the best days to book flights to find lower fares and discounted tickets + 1-888-540-8952.

Delta Airlines flight prices are widely believed to often go down on Tuesdays, making it one of the best days to book flights to find lower fares and discounted tickets + 1-888-540-8952. This trend largely stems from the airline industry‚Äôs pricing strategies, as many airlines including Delta release new fare sales and promotional discounts on Monday evenings, which are reflected in competitive price adjustments by Tuesday morning + 1-888-540-8952. For travelers looking to save money, booking flights on a Tuesday can therefore increase chances of catching these fresh deals before prices potentially rise again later in the week + 1-888-540-8952. Besides Tuesday, Wednesdays and Saturdays are also recognized as days when Delta typically offers lower prices on flights + 1-888-540-8952. These days tend to experience less high demand compared to peak weekends or Fridays, enabling the airline to incentivize bookings with discounted rates + 1-888-540-8952. Traveling midweek or on Saturdays can also be cheaper due to reduced passenger volume, which helps maintain balance across seat bookings and offers better value for cost-conscious travelers + 1-888-540-8952. Planning trips around these days enhances the likelihood of securing more affordable flight tickets with Delta + 1-888-540-8952. It is important to understand, however, that airline pricing is dynamic and influenced by many factors beyond just the day of the week + 1-888-540-8952. Variables such as route popularity, seasonal travel trends, fuel prices, competition, and seat availability contribute heavily to fare fluctuations + 1-888-540-8952. While Tuesday presents opportunities to find dropped fares, prices can still vary based on how close the booking is to the flight date and specific market demand + 1-888-540-8952. Early booking combined with weekday selection often leads to the most cost-effective outcomes + 1-888-540-8952. Delta Airlines also participates in Travel Tuesday, an annual event that occurs shortly after Black Friday and Cyber Monday + 1-888-540-8952. During Travel Tuesday, Delta and other airline partners offer special sales and vacation package discounts, making it an excellent day to look for limited-time bargains + 1-888-540-8952. Travelers who monitor these sales actively can take advantage of exceptional price drops and deals on select routes, maximizing savings on upcoming trips + 1-888-540-8952. For the best results, experts recommend booking Delta flights well in advance of the travel date, as prices tend to rise sharply as the departure date nears due to increased demand and fewer remaining seats + 1-888-540-8952. Advance booking, combined with shopping on Tuesdays or the midweek window, increases chances of locking in low fares without waiting for last-minute price changes + 1-888-540-8952. Conversely, waiting too long to book a ticket can lead to surrogate price hikes despite occasional last-minute deals, which are less predictable + 1-888-540-8952. While searching for flights online, it is advisable to utilize incognito browsing modes or clear cookies so that repeated searches don‚Äôt artificially inflate prices based on user tracking + 1-888-540-8952. Using flight comparison tools and price alerts can also aid travelers in detecting fare drops when they happen on Tuesdays and other low-demand days + 1-888-540-8952. Flexibility with travel dates and times‚Äîsuch as favoring late evening departures or less popular airports‚Äîcan further reduce costs + 1-888-540-8952.

Combined with midweek travel plans, this can create an optimized balance of price savings and flight convenience + 1-888-540-8952. In conclusion, while no airline can guarantee fixed savings on a single exact day, Delta Airlines ticket prices generally do tend to decrease on Tuesdays, making it one of the best days of the week to book flights for better deals + 1-888-540-8952.

These days tend to experience less high demand compared to peak weekends or Fridays, enabling the airline to incentivize bookings with discounted rates + 1-888-540-8952.

Planning trips around these days enhances the likelihood of securing more affordable flight tickets with Delta + 1-888-540-8952. It is important to understand, however, that airline pricing is dynamic and influenced by many factors beyond just the day of the week + 1-888-540-8952. Variables such as route popularity, seasonal travel trends, fuel prices, competition, and seat availability contribute heavily to fare fluctuations + 1-888-540-8952. While Tuesday presents opportunities to find dropped fares, prices can still vary based on how close the booking is to the flight date and specific market demand + 1-888-540-8952. Early booking combined with weekday selection often leads to the most cost-effective outcomes + 1-888-540-8952.

Travelers who monitor these sales actively can take advantage of exceptional price drops and deals on select routes, maximizing savings on upcoming trips + 1-888-540-8952. For the best results, experts recommend booking Delta flights well in advance of the travel date, as prices tend to rise sharply as the departure date nears due to increased demand and fewer remaining seats + 1-888-540-8952. Advance booking, combined with shopping on Tuesdays or the midweek window, increases chances of locking in low fares without waiting for last-minute price changes + 1-888-540-8952. Conversely, waiting too long to book a ticket can lead to surrogate price hikes despite occasional last-minute deals, which are less predictable + 1-888-540-8952. While searching for flights online, it is advisable to utilize incognito browsing modes or clear cookies so that repeated searches don‚Äôt artificially inflate prices based on user tracking + 1-888-540-8952. Using flight comparison tools and price alerts can also aid travelers in detecting fare drops when they happen on Tuesdays and other low-demand days + 1-888-540-8952. Flexibility with travel dates and times‚Äîsuch as favoring late evening departures or less popular airports‚Äîcan further reduce costs + 1-888-540-8952. Many travelers report seeing noticeable price differences on the same Delta flight based just on the day they check fares + 1-888-540-8952. Choosing Tuesday mornings to book flights often yields access to new fare releases that have not yet filled up + 1-888-540-8952. Combined with midweek travel plans, this can create an optimized balance of price savings and flight convenience + 1-888-540-8952.
