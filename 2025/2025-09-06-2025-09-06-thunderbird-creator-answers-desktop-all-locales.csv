At first it managed to retrieve the messages from my BT internet server. But it has stopped working ( the last time I could get messages was on the 31st of August) I don't understand why. I can send messages, but can't receive them. I can still get them on my old machine which I am keeping until everything is properly up and running. I checked the settings and as far as I can see they haven't changed. When I try to get messages it's just stuck in contacting server mode. After a long time it gives up and gives me the message&nbsp;: Login to btinternet server failed with username  xx- retry - enter new password - cancel. When I press enter new password - the message vanishes and I can't actually enter a password. There used to be a way to check passwords entered in Thunderbird.  The other issue I have is that I can't enter my signature for emails in the composition area as it says I already have an email account with same name. Does this mean I have to basically delete my old one on my old computer? I hope you can help. The first issue started after the 31st of August. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",hkaut
