What I found in the above link was: </p><p>Open Thunderbird, Go to Settings-General; at the bottom of that section you'll find a button for Config editor; click on that and search for this line: widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style; click on the edit button on the far right of that line and change the 0 to something like 28 and hit the enter key on your keyboard. The change should become instantaneous, but you may need to close and re-open Thunderbird. 28 seems to be a fairly decent size, but you can adjust it as necessary to suit your needs. </p><p>I tried that, but it had absolutely no effect on my scrollbar width, even with a setting of 50 instead of the 28 referenced. I found another reference to making the scrollbars always visible, which I also found and checked, and then restarted Thunderbird. But the changes did not take effect.

Firefox ESR updates had originally ended but Mozilla decided to add at least 6 more months of updates Firefox ESR 115.28 through 115.33. The question is if something similar either HAD happened or WAS going to happen with T-bird ESR 115.18.  </p><p>Apparently you are as in the dark as I am about the possibility.
