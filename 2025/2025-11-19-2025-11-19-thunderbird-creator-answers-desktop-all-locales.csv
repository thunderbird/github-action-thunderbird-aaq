As a result I am not receiving any emails through Thunderbird, but I can go to email host site to view them. </p><p>I logged in my computer tonight and clicked here and clicked there and the error message: ""The certificate for <a href=""http://mail.homebizmall.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.homebizmall.net</a> is not valid for that server. Someone could be trying to impersonate the server. Create an exception but this could mean that someone has stolen your certificate and may be able to impersonate you."" </p><p>So it seems the POP server and the SMTP server certificates were only valid for 3 months and I was FORCED to create the exception for both servers. Now I am worried the security has been breached. </p><p>By clicking here and clicking there, I stumbled on a few people who seem to have this problem, but each with their own limitations. My operating System is Windows 10 without the option to upgrade. I have not extended the security updates because I don't understand if it is just the operating system uploading to the cloud or everything on my computer and I am not prepared to do the latter. </p><p>Is it safe to leave the band aid on that I have used for the moment? Can I create an exception for the phone? Or is there a glitch that someone needs to walk me through fixing? </p><p>Thanking you in advance </p><p>Clinton </p>",thunderbird;encryption;,thunderbird,encryption,en-US,1781059;,manager22
