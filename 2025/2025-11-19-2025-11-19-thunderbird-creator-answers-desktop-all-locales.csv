The standard advice says to hold down Ctrl or Shift and select e-mails, then right click, and choose rubbish bin symbol to delete. The advice says you will get a confirmation message, but that doesn't happen. Only the e-mail right clicked on actually deletes; all the rest stay put.  </p><p>I have tried deleting the trash file to force it to recreate. I have tried updating Thunderbird, but I'm already on version 145.0. I use gmail.  </p><p>Does anyone know of a working method for doing multiple deletions? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",gmoody02

After entering it, yahoo says ""Something went wrong"", and gives no other indication of what the problem is. </p><p>If I instead ""Configure manually""... I tried both the default hostnames and ""<a href=""http://export.imap.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">export.imap.mail.yahoo.com</a>"" for the outgoing  server. I tried both ""Normal Password"" and ""OAuth2"" authentication methods. </p><p>In all the above cases, I get ""Unable to log in at server.

I never had a problem with it. However, this afternoon, just out of the blue Thunderbird cannot download my emails, the following message popped up: ""Login to server <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> with username xxxxxxx failed."" Then Thunderbird asks for a new password. When I enter the still correct password, it displays the same error message. I did not change anything in the settings before this error message popped up. I tried ChatGPT to get some answers, but whatever I changed it had no effect. I am attaching a screenshot of the server settings (I have of course removed my username). I would be grateful for any advice as to how to fix the issue. Thanking you. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",krudygimi
