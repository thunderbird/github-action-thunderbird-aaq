I have unmarked that,  but unless you want to add something that might make the posting relevant to Thunderbird I think it is off topic.

Fundamentally your government is responsible for making and enforcing regulations that work.

I don't include Yahoo, because they were a failure with spam 25years ago anything they did would have been an improvement. </p><p>However I do not have a website sending me email that does not have enough protections against SPAM in the contact us parts of it and I suspect that is your issue,  and that includes the video calls. </p><p>Does your website use some form of Capatcha to verify you have a human?
