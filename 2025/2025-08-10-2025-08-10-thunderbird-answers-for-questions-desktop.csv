That is, if there is no need to move the messages, the act of doing so seems to defeat the intent of lowering resource use. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have unmarked that,  but unless you want to add something that might make the posting relevant to Thunderbird I think it is off topic.  It is not SPAM,  but I really do not see anything related to Thunderbird in the content which is somewhat a requirement for posting in the Thunderbird forum. </p><p>Marking repeated posts about AI and SPAM is not going to change anything.  Fundamentally your government is responsible for making and enforcing regulations that work.  Mine in Australia appears to have generally managed that as I see perhaps 10 SPAM emails a month with Gmail and GMX accounts.  I don't include Yahoo, because they were a failure with spam 25years ago anything they did would have been an improvement. </p><p>However I do not have a website sending me email that does not have enough protections against SPAM in the contact us parts of it and I suspect that is your issue,  and that includes the video calls. </p><p>Does your website use some form of Capatcha to verify you have a human?   This is a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/security/products/recaptcha"" rel=""nofollow"">link </a>to Google offering in that space rather than trying to explain something I really do not understand. There are many providers of Capatcha solutions and I have no position on what might or might not be a good product.   </p><p>I did learn today however that CAPTCHA is an acronym meaning Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) so I understand a little more than I did. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
