So that problem has now been sorted. </p><p><strong>1st image - 'Server Settings' for the pop account</strong> You have obviously altered them as was expecting them to be using the yahoo server settings which I posted some time back. You do not have a vaild name for the 'Server name'. It's incorrect. </p><p>In the begining you used the <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a> server - so lets try that first before attempting to use the yahoo server. </p> <ul><li> Account Settings  </li><li> Select 'Server Settings' </li><li> On the right it says 'Server Name:' and currently it says <strong><a href=""http://inbound.att-3.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att-3.net</a>.</strong> </li><li> It needs to say: <strong><a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a></strong> - No numbers and do not put a full stop period punctuation at the end </li></ul> <p>Then I need you to do the following in Thunderbird </p> <ul><li>     Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li>     Scroll down to Passwords section </li><li>     click on 'Saved Passwords' </li></ul> <p>There will be lines for each mail account. Pop accounts incoming will start with the line&nbsp;: 'mailbox://account... the outgoing smtp will start with 'smtp://account... You only have one pop mail account, so there should be only one mailbox:// line and one smtp:// line please select each line in turn and click on 'Remove' If you have more lines - Remove them because we do not want any confusion. We need to be sure all the old data has gone - so when this area is empty - click on 'Close' </p><p>Then Exit Thunderbird. </p><p>Your normal password should get you access to your webmail account access via a browser. But you have to use what At&amp;T call a  'secure mail key' when prompted for password in Thunderbird. You said you had created a 'secure mail key' It would be a 16 digit key  and it should last unless AT&amp;T blocked your account. </p><p>So assuming you really did copy it correctly - check it has 16 digits.  I've known people copy and paste things but do not do it correctly. If it does not have 16 digits then you got something wrong, so will need to create another. </p><p>You mentioned difficulty in gaining access to webmail account via browser. You need to be certain you can get access and it has not been blocked. The following link has information on creating a 'secure mail key' to use in Thunderbird' BUT Importantly - The following link also contains the correct link to get access to the Logon to webmail, so please go to the following link </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://www.att.com/support/article/email-support/KM1240308/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.att.com/support/article/email-support/KM1240308/</a> </li><li> Scroll down to 'Create a secure mail key' </li><li> 1. Go to your <strong>myAT&amp;T</strong> Profile.   </li></ul> <p>At the link webpage that piece of <strong>myAT&amp;T</strong> text is a link to login to correct site - please use your normal password at the prompt to check you have access to webmail. Whilst in webmail account - please delete all your very old emails and clear the Junk/Spam folder. </p><p>If you got access to webmail then you are not blocked so the 'secure mail key' should work. If you think it's incorrect as you only have eg: 15 digits - You must follow the instructions to create a 16 digit secure mail key. </p><p>Once you have access using the info and links above.... Start Thunderbird </p><p>It will prompt for a password Enter the 16 digit secure mail key - be careful  - do not add a space at the start or at the end and do not add any full stops - it must be entered correctly. Then select the checkbox to 'Remember password' click on 'OK' </p><p>REport back on results. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It means all your incoming settings are correct and working. So that's another part fixed. </p><p>Do not post the password as this is a public forum and anyone can see it only part is visible because the window is not wide enough - if you want to see all of it: Hover over the bottom right corner of window until you the cursor change to a double headed arrow - then left click and hold down and drag cursor to the right to reveal more of window. </p><p>Or you can right click on the line and select 'Edit Password' and it should show what is. </p><p>However, as the incoming is now working, I would expect the smtp outgoing to have the same password as both get set up, so I do not think this is a Password issue.
