The default POP setup is to download and delete, and my guess is that is what you did. You can change settings to download and keep. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To do that,  - click 'account settings'  - click the account name in left sidebar -  now, on bottom line in right side of screen, click the 'edit SMTP server' button - on next screen, verify that the email account is correct, and not for one of your other accounts - if it is for another account, go back to prior screen and click the drop-down menu for outgoing SMTP server and set to the right server.  </p><p>The above may not be relevant, but it is a common problem when a user has multiple accounts with same provider. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
