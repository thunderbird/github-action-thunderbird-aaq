The default POP setup is to download and delete, and my guess is that is what you did. You can change settings to download and keep. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To do that,  - click 'account settings'  - click the account name in left sidebar -  now, on bottom line in right side of screen, click the 'edit SMTP server' button - on next screen, verify that the email account is correct, and not for one of your other accounts - if it is for another account, go back to prior screen and click the drop-down menu for outgoing SMTP server and set to the right server.  </p><p>The above may not be relevant, but it is a common problem when a user has multiple accounts with same provider. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My composition settings are set correctly, in fact they are set to the default settings (font Luciana Grande, text size 11pt), however while creating/typing the email the font that is appearing on my screen is the equivalent of 8pt font size and the only way that I can fix this is on a per email basis to go into the Zoom In menu option and increase the font size on my own screen.  I cannot figure out why, or how to permanently correct/adjust the size of the font that is appearing while I am typing an email.  Once I send the email and it is received by the recipient (I tested this myself on other emails that I have), the font is the correct size. If you have any other ideas/ suggestions, I would appreciate it. </p>",rkovacs,false,0,0
