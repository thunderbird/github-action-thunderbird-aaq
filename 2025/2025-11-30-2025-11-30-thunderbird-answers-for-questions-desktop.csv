I use it to access GMAIL via POP and use the settings ""After the email gets downloaded to my computer, delete the GMAIL copy"" (Settings attached).   My usage pattern which changed recently: Earlier, I will always download emails using Thunderbird every day and it was working perfectly. Recently I have to travel for few days and during those days I will access my GMAIL via my android mobile primarily and I download all the emails after my return.   Current Issue: Now after I return, all the mails gets downloaded, but it does not get deleted at GMail side (online). From the time I started using Thunderbird after my return, the newer emails from that time are getting downloaded and deleted but the old emails stay in GMail. Current inconvenience is it takes time to validate if all the important emails are downloaded and I cleanup the GMAIL manually and then we are all in sync. This continues until my next travel. I tried resetting the GMAIL POP settings and there is no improvement.  Any pointers or suggestions to resolve will be gladly appreciated. Thanks in advance! </blockquote> <p>I deleted the account setting and setup the account again and moved my emails. Everything is working fine now. THanks! </p>",pethiraj,false,0,0

My composition settings are set correctly, in fact they are set to the default settings (font Luciana Grande, text size 11pt), however while creating/typing the email the font that is appearing on my screen is the equivalent of 8pt font size and the only way that I can fix this is on a per email basis to go into the Zoom In menu option and increase the font size on my own screen.  I cannot figure out why, or how to permanently correct/adjust the size of the font that is appearing while I am typing an email.

The font size you see on screen is for you. If sent without font size - or as plain text - the recipient's email client sets the size.

It did changed to optimum-mail about two years ago. Did you had data stuff in that account , is there a map of this email program , is it still on that pc of you? Did you had something of that email program on that pc of you?  Do you have login names and passwords for these accounts from suddenlink? Do you like to have suddenlink or optimum on that pc of you?🎅 Do you want to use that software? </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-to-make-screenshots"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-to-make-screenshots</a> Sent us that screenshot of all error related pop ups. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

If you don't know it, you must re-set it and get a new one. You cannot change an account password in Thunderbird. You must do it through you e-mail service provider. After you have a new password with Optimum, you will enter it into Thunderbird when Thunderbird asks you for it. </p><p><br> <strong>Second</strong>, the next most simple explanation: </p><p>Since you can receive but not send messages, there is a problem with your settings. I suggest that you call Optimum and ask for the SMTP settings for suddenlink accounts. Make sure that you get: server name, port, user name, authentication method, and type of connection security. Then go into account settings in Thunderbird, select ""Outgoing Server"" in the left pane, select the SMTP server in the right pane, and make sure that the right information is entered. </p><p>On the Web, I found: </p><p>Server name: <a href=""http://smtp.suddenlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.suddenlink.net</a> User name: full e-mail address Port: 465 Connection security: SSL </p><p>I have not found the authentication method. At a minimum, make sure that it is something other than insecure transmission of password. Ask Optimum what it should be. </p><p>While you're talking with Optimum, have them confirm your incoming mail settings too. In Thunderbird, they are in account settings &gt; server settings. </p><p><br> <strong>Third</strong>, the least likely explanation: </p><p>I don't know how PayPal would know that someone is trying to access your mail. Maybe they are getting tracking information when messages from them are opened by a hacker from a different IP address. </p><p>If the PayPal people are correct, then these two symptoms may be related. The first thing that a hacker would do is change your account password to lock you out of your account. </p><p>In your place, I would ask Optimum for help. They can probably help explain what is happening, and they can help you re-set your password and re-gain control of your account. </p><p>This explanation makes no sense to me if you are able to receive messages. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
