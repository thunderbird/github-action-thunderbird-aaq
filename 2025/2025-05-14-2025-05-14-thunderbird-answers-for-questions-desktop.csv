I suppose that if I deleted the entire mail content and re drew it down that may help provided I did what you say before the draw down?? </p><p>Brett </p>",thebellmobers,false,0,0

It does not provide new email addresses.  </p><p>Email addresses can be provided by your Internet Service Provider or maybe you have a domain and website which also provides email addresses or maybe you  have paid for an email address or obtained a free one from eg: gmail. </p><p>If you already have an existing email address, you can create a mail account in Thunderbird to access the server which receives your emails. It means you do not have to logon via webmail using a browser to see emails. If you have more than one email address with same or different servers then you can create several mail accounts and therefore be able to see all emails from all email accounts in one view. You can create Pop and/or Imap mail accounts.  Using Thunderbird, you can read and send emails and it also has a built in calendar. You can also link up to other calendars eg: google/gmail. It has Address Books and many features etc. You can also create and link to feed accounts, chat accounts and newsgroup acounts. </p><p>After installing Thunderbird you can create a mail account for an exisiting email address. The first time you run Thunderbird, it usually prompts you to set up a mail account, but if you did not do it at that a time you can clickon the 'Menu app icon (3 lines)' select 'New Account' and select 'Email' Follow instructions. Please note: Some servers require additional measures to set connection. Some servers do not acept normal password and require you to create a 'secure app password'/'app generated password', others will need you to set up 'Authentication Method 'Oauth' eg: gmail, so you may need to ask what additional steps should be taken to ensure a proper connection. Xfinity requires you to logon to webmail and make sure you have set up the account to allow third party access.  </p><p>You will need to provide a lot more information about the server you want to connect to because I could go on guessing forever and that's a waste both of our time. </p><p>There are many Help Articles which you can use, but sometimes you might find they are bit out date as Thunderbird has undergone alot of recent changes. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
