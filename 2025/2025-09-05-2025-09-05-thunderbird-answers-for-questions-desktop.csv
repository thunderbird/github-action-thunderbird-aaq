Just tell me if I wander off into gibberish  this is that sort of topic. </p><p>Lets start with  <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-09-05-23-51-30-d6f8cf.png""> </p><p>It is not especially illuminating ,  except to the point that apparently whomever set up the address books decided they would have one address book for every address.  Then they have prefixed those address books with a number to force sort their list of address books, or thousands of address books instead of using mailing lists.  I really can not make heads of tails of it, but if it is mailing lists,  you will probably see lots and lots of duplicate contacts without any idea which are the current details and which are decades old.  So I would have to agree it is a mess.  It might even be to the point the contacts needing to be exported as you first suggested., but understanding the structure that was used has to feature in here or you will spend the next six months wading through over 7000 contacts attempting to decipher which are duplicate and which details are current.  But I have to ask when you select one of these address book,  what contacts are listed other than the single contact shown in the address book name.  Are they being used as mailing list or does each address book have only a single contact. </p><p>What is the end game here I think is probably what I am missing.  You will have to export the address books one at a time. You used to be able to select the all address books and it would export them one after the other,  but I have no idea when that went away.  I just tried it an it no longer worked </p><p>I think you probably should use the CSV format as that will allow you to import them to a spreadsheet and sort the data into email address order so you can spend months removing duplicates.  I really think a significant proportion of the 7000 addresses in the address book wil be duplicated, triplicated and so on.  I think you might find some addresses are in every single address book. </p><p>To move on to  <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-09-05-23-52-12-2abe4b.png""> </p><p>The location of folder in an IMAP account is controls by the server and it is quite common for them to place all folders under the inbox.  In account settings &gt; server settings for the account there is an advanced button which gives access to a setting for the server directory.  This is generally left blank,  in this case the server directory will be inbox, or Inbox or perhaps INBOX, but most probably Inbox as that is the case Thunderbird is using to display the folder name.I assume the display is verbatim.  Case is important in UNIX/Linux file names and mail servers almost invariably run on one or the other.  You could ask the server admin just what the server directory should be,  but I think one of my guesses will correct the view to something you are more familiar with. </p><p>With your address books, I really have not a lot to say that I have not already. </p><p>The all address book  is a virtual address book.  It exists only in the context of the list you screen you showed.  It is generated on the fly for all the other address books. </p><p>The collected address book is a collection of email addresses used to send mail that are not in the other address books at the time mail is sent.  I doubt it will contain much of use in this case because of the complex and fastidious use of address books. </p><p>This is an example of a address book in the address book list with a distribution/mailing list in it. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-09-06-17-45-27-196293.png""> </p><p>I do not see any use of distribution lists at all (the double head icon) so whatever you are sorting was set up is a truly bizarre manner.  I am assuming address books were use instead of any form of distribution list. </p><p>The underlying structure of Thunderbird's address book is a separate SQLite database for each book.  So member of a book can be also in a distribution list in that book, using the underlying email contact record,  but each book is discreet.  For example the information in the collected address book can not be used to add the person to a list in say the Doctors book.  They first have to exist as a discreet contact in the book. </p><p>for processing mail for address details you might want to look at this addon <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mail-extractor/?src=cb-dl-recentlyadded"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mail-extractor/?src=cb-dl-recentlyadded</a> </p><p>I do wonder if some of this address book madness may originate from the use of this addon <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/collectaddresses/?src=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/collectaddresses/?src=search</a>  in which case most of these address books would be rubbish that can be deleted as a new book can be created from a folder of mail at anytime. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
