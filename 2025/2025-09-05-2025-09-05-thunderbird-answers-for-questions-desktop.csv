I want to gather all these info file and sort the address into well-defined distribution list that can be used for their customers and business partners.  For example, take all the Dr's email and put them in a physician distribution one medical and other chiropractic.  </p><p>I'm trying to reorganize the address book where it makes more sense. </p><p>There something else When you click on a person email It seems like they are from multiple distribution list.  Is there a way to see where distribution list is being used? Let say I have a distribution called family in my address book. I send it and the names of my family show up in the list which make sense. But email never shows me which distribution alias was used. I'm using the BCC so the members are NOT seen by other members. It be nice to look at a sent folders and understand what email alias or distribution that was used. </p><p>The other problem is there are FOLDERS inside Inbox Folders. Sent FOLDERS just an example that is really ridiculous that needs to be short out within those 12 emails accounts that are in thunderbird. I know of one of them is for certain using IMAP.

My concern isn't THunderbird, as that can be readily downloaded; the issue is whether your profile was safely transferred. if you don't want to repeat the transfer, look at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to see if there is a thunderbird folder.  You can download and install thunderbird from <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> - be sure to pick the desired version. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The wizard is to set up an email account, not install thunderbird. can you create a screenshot of what you have? That will probably help resolve your concerns. thank you </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

All the important data is in the Roaming profile. I have copied that many times to new setups and has always worked for me. I have never used the built-in Import feature (I've been told it can't deal with profiles larger than 2 GB) Here's my method: </p><p>- Assuming that Thunderbird is already installed on the new computer... On the old computer or on the backup disk, with Thunderbird closed, copy the entire profile I mentioned above to the equivalent Profiles directory on the new computer. Make a note of your profile folder's name. </p><p>- With Thunderbird closed on the new computer, press &lt;WindowsKey&gt;+R to bring up the Run box. In the slot, type ""thunderbird -profilemanager"" (no quotes). This brings up the Profile Manager where you can Create, Rename, and Delete profiles. </p><p>- Choose Create..., then where it says ""begin creating your profile, click Next... </p><p>- The new profile name can be anything you want. Click Choose Folder and select your backup folder that you just placed there. When you choose OK, you will find yourself back at the Profile Manager. You can choose your newly created profile and also choose to go immediately there when you next start Thunderbird. Choose ""Start Thunderbird"" and things should be pretty much back to normal. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

That's why I'm worried that the backup folder I've been saving is incomplete or the wrong contents.  It contains folders called '$Archive', 'Cache2', 'Safebrowsing' and 'StartupCache'.  Does that sound right?  If not, I fear the only hope is to attempt data recovery from the dead disc drive. </p>",steve469,false,0,0
