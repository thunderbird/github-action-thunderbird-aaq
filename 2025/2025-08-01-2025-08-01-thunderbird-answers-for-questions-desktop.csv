What you see on the IMAP account folders are messages that are on the server and downloaded to your PC ONLY for your viewing. So, POP messages are no longer tied to the server and deleting the POP account does not affect folders and messages on the server. If you delete messages appearing on your PC of the IMAP account, the copy on PC is deleted and also the copy on server. So, on your question, deleting the POP account does not affect messages on the server. BUT, messages MOVED from IMAP account to LOCAL FOLDERS are still part of the IMAP account. Your post makes it unclear on what messages are moved from where to where. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I will try again. </p><p>My biggest concern is losing any of the emails in the sub folders of my ‚ÄòMain‚Äô account.  I realize that those folders are ‚Äòon my computer‚Äô and not on the server.   I am concerned because when I have deleted (right-click &gt; delete) other folders I get the message, ‚ÄúDeleting this folder is not undoable and will delete all of the messages it contains, and its sub-folders.  Are you sure you still want to delete the folder&nbsp;? ‚Äú I know you can‚Äôt delete a main email (shown in bold typeface) by right clicking on it.  You would have to go to Account Settings and click on the account name you want to delete and then click on the red colored box with ‚ÄòDelete‚Äô displayed. </p><p>Now to explain my coping problem: I created the attached photo showing 5 of my email accounts (2-POP &amp; 3-IMAP) as they are shown in Thunderbird (TB).  I erased (white out) anything I didn‚Äôt think I should post. </p><p>Listed first is ‚ÄúMain@Main.com‚Äù account.  That is my domain name account. My overall goal is to have ALL the sub folders listed under the ‚ÄúMain@Main.com‚Äù  POP Account copied (saved) to the ‚ÄúMain@Main.com‚Äù IMAP account  (listed 3rd in the display - First IMAP account). </p><p>I have been moving (copying) sub folders for the past 2 days from the 1st POP &amp; 2nd POP account to the 1st IMAP ‚ÄòMain‚Äô account.  Not shown is the 22 sub folders I moved from the ‚ÄòArchives‚Äô folder in the 2nd POP account to the ‚ÄòArchives‚Äô folder in the 1st IMAP ‚ÄòMain‚Äô account.  I still have 6 sub folders to go from the 2nd POP account in ‚ÄòArchives‚Äô.  There is over 17000 posts in these 6 sub folders.  The very first sub folder I moved (several days ago) had 5363 posts and the transfer worked just fine. </p><p>I still have 17 sub folders from the 1st listed ‚ÄòMain POP‚Äô account to be moved to the ‚ÄòMain IMAP‚Äô account. </p><p>For some unknown reason, TB refuses to copy any more of the sub folders from the 2 POP accounts to my ‚ÄòMain‚Äô IMAP account.  I try to drag and drop the sub folders and TB says it is creating the folder at the bottom of the display and starts to copy the 1st message and then nothing happens, the display line just goes blank.  I have even gone into ‚ÄòSafe Mode‚Äô and managed to copy a couple of the large sub folders but now it will not move or copy and of the remaining sub folders. </p><p>I have tried the drag and drop method and the right-click on a sub folder and subsequently click on sub folder names until I get to the right location and this doesn‚Äôt work anymore.  (Worked a couple of times). </p><p>Any help on how I can get the rest of my sub folders moved (copied) would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>I hope I made myself clear this time.

It is a gardening project, done little by little. thunderbird is not 'doing' anything, but is acting as a conductor, directing internet server to upload a message at a time and the server is also serving thousands of other users while doing that.  if you want to be rid of the POP account, you could create a new Local Folder called OLDPOP. Then, exit thunderbird, and in profile folder, locate the POP account in the Mail folder, such as Mail\&lt;POPaccountname&gt; and COPY the entire contents and save in the Mail\Local Folders\OLDPOP folder.

I've never had a reason to contact my 'online account'.  The person I use, ""Jim"", hosts 62 websites and he also hosts my domain name.  I have been with him over 13 years.  I make contact with him through email in Thunderbird (TB).  I update my website through CORE FTP and cPanel (Jim helps me with cPanel).  I will contact him and see if he can offer any help in this little saga of mine&nbsp;:) </p><p>I did learn that my oldest email (an AOL account) can be accessed at their (AOL) website.  I can go in and delete **SPAM** emails that come to that account.  This is a POP account created in TB when I started using TB.  I have NEVER received a **SPAM** email on that account (listed as Local Folders) on my TB display. </p><p>In my recently created IMAP accounts (3).  I get and can delete **SPAM** and JUNK emails.  I never used to get those emails when they were POP accounts. </p><p>I do think I understand how you wanted me to use the newly created old___@___.com POP account to copy everything from my current main POP account BEFORE I delete it.   I knew where the mail files are stored on my desktop by going to C: Users &gt; XPS &gt; AppData &gt;Roaming &gt; Thunderbird &gt; Profiles. I also like how you showed me to get to that folder quickly in TB:  email &gt; Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; click on &gt; Open Folder. </p><p>I looked into those files under Mail and I believe I found the two files that I need to work with.  I found the current POP folder I need to copy from and the newly created blank 'old' folder, that I need to copy to. </p><p>I attached photos of each of those filenames. </p><p>So, at this point, I would (using Explorer) copy all of the files from the current POP folder to the newly created 'old' folder&nbsp;? </p><p>I am willing to try if you think that will work. </p><p>I will back up the complete Profiles folder before I try. </p><p>Please let me know what you think. </p><p>I will still try and contact my provider. </p><p>Thanks Very Much for your valuable time and informative help. </p>",jmallard,false,0,0
