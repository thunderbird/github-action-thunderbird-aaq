I was hoping to keep it in the account it is in, as the high level name makes it very clear what it contains (note that it is a VERY old email account and even goes back to a time my wife didn't want her own email account so she used mine on occasion, so she has emails in there she may want to reference).

Comparing to my old computer I determined they were in fact in the profile.  I have a theory on this and that is related to my original question in this post. </p><p>When I installed thunderbird, it created a new default profile for me:  </p><p>C:\Users\{my name}\AppData\Roaming\thunderbird\Profiles\{new profile}.default-release </p><p>I copied over the old profile and contents from the old PC: </p><p>C:\Users\{my name}\AppData\Roaming\thunderbird\Profiles\{old profile}.default </p><p>and changed every account to point to the ""old"" profile.  I am guessing that even though every account plus Local Folders all refer to the old profile, there is something somewhere at the Thunderbird level that is referring to the new profile, and that is where it is going for the address books.  I somewhat confirmed this by shutting down thunderbird and renaming (adding a suffix to) the new profile then trying to restart Thunderbird.  It would not start.  I exited, removed the suffix and restarted no problem. </p><p>So now I have two questions: </p><p>1) Given my current situation: </p><pre>  a) Is it possible to make a change somewhere in Thunderbird so that it no longer knows about the new profile (I can rename it and then, after a confirmation restart, delete it)?   b) If it isn't possible, do I just copy abook.sqlite and history.sqlite under the new profile or do I need the sqlite-shm and sqlite-wal files too?  OR??? </pre> <p>2) For the future, if I am doing a fresh install, is there some way to point Thunderbird to the transferred profile before startup so that no new profile is created and will doing this automatically configure all the accounts that existed on the previous computer (I do regularly back up my profile folder and contents and I am now thinking everything that I needed was in there somewhere just begging to be used, LOL)? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",dgillesp220,false,0,0

You can verify the profile by clicking it in Windows File Explorer. There, you should see the abook.sqlite file and an imapmail folder, a mail folder, among other. Seeing those confirms that you have located the folder.  To use that on a desktop,  - copy that profile folder to external media - be sure you install thunderbird from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> - start thunderbird and click tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbird installation - on next screen, click 'choose a profile folder'  - select the one from the profile folder and you're done.

Yes, if in Local Folders, they are thunderbird folders. if you want an exact copy of what was on old computer, you can copy the entire profile, which includes messages at the time of last use.  </p><p>Here is the link for moving a profile in Windows when installed in default location:  </p><pre><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a> </pre> <p>here is the info in brief steps:  </p> <ol><li> ensure thunderbird is NOT running on old machine </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder </li><li> highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media  </li><li> ensure thunderbird is installed on second computer and NOT running  </li><li> enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key </li><li> you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there.

One question first: Will doing this wipe out all the messages I've received and sent in the week since I started using the new computer and Thunderbird on it? </p><p>Court </p>,cslewis379,false,0,0

Since you've been using it for a week, it's not worth doing now. SO, the approach to just copy what you need. Locate the old profile, and then the Mail\Local Folders folder with Windows FIle Explorer. Ignore the msf files and copy the others and place them in the Mail\Local Folders folder of the new PC. The old messages in a POP inbox and sent folders could also be retrieved from the Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; folder, also copied into the Mail\Local folders folder. If desired, you could then merge the saved inbox and sent folders with the new inbox and sent folders, but that's many more steps that I will share if desired, and after you achieve your initial objective. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Ignore the msf files"" allow that? It sounds like that's where I would find the Eudora folder. Would I do this while in the old computer, or after transferring the Thunderbird folder to the new computer? And can I copy just individual messages (folder items) to the flash drive, in large batches? Just drag &amp; drop, or how? </p>",cslewis379,false,0,0
