Comparing to my old computer I determined they were in fact in the profile.  I have a theory on this and that is related to my original question in this post. </p><p>When I installed thunderbird, it created a new default profile for me:  </p><p>C:\Users\{my name}\AppData\Roaming\thunderbird\Profiles\{new profile}.default-release </p><p>I copied over the old profile and contents from the old PC: </p><p>C:\Users\{my name}\AppData\Roaming\thunderbird\Profiles\{old profile}.default </p><p>and changed every account to point to the ""old"" profile.  I am guessing that even though every account plus Local Folders all refer to the old profile, there is something somewhere at the Thunderbird level that is referring to the new profile, and that is where it is going for the address books.  I somewhat confirmed this by shutting down thunderbird and renaming (adding a suffix to) the new profile then trying to restart Thunderbird.  It would not start.  I exited, removed the suffix and restarted no problem. </p><p>So now I have two questions: </p><p>1) Given my current situation: </p><pre>  a) Is it possible to make a change somewhere in Thunderbird so that it no longer knows about the new profile (I can rename it and then, after a confirmation restart, delete it)?   b) If it isn't possible, do I just copy abook.sqlite and history.sqlite under the new profile or do I need the sqlite-shm and sqlite-wal files too?  OR??? </pre> <p>2) For the future, if I am doing a fresh install, is there some way to point Thunderbird to the transferred profile before startup so that no new profile is created and will doing this automatically configure all the accounts that existed on the previous computer (I do regularly back up my profile folder and contents and I am now thinking everything that I needed was in there somewhere just begging to be used, LOL)? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",dgillesp220,false,0,0

You can verify the profile by clicking it in Windows File Explorer. There, you should see the abook.sqlite file and an imapmail folder, a mail folder, among other. Seeing those confirms that you have located the folder.  To use that on a desktop,  - copy that profile folder to external media - be sure you install thunderbird from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> - start thunderbird and click tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbird installation - on next screen, click 'choose a profile folder'  - select the one from the profile folder and you're done.

What you call the Address Book actually says ""Contact"" with a little blue toggle light.  This seems to be saying ""Contact"" or ""Contact"", further defined by the little toggle light.  But the toggle doesn't correlate with the text (which doesn't change with the state).  Perhaps I need to study this more.  Regardless, it's a continuous challenge! The Unread button, for example, always shows the same messages, either ""Unread"" or ""Unread"" regardless of the state. 24 hours later I can't recall which state I'm seeing - either ""Unread"" or was it ""Unread""?  It used to be in the old days that unread mail was <em><strong>bold</strong></em> type, and read mail was normal type.  The rest were just buttons that could be ignored.  Simple.  Idiot-proof.

I guess it's messages that senders mark as important. They are all dupes of messages in my inbox. I would like to jettison them all, but I think if I do, they will also be removed from my inbox.
