This CardBook add-on at <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/cardbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/cardbook/</a> </p><p>CardBook is able to, very quickly and easily, search all contacts' phone numbers. Including any phone number text formatting. For example: </p><p>Mobile 1: 111.456.2222 </p><p>Mobile 2: (222) 456-2222 </p><p>Mobile 3: 333-456-2222 </p><p>Mobile 4: 4444562222 </p><p>Using CardBook, when I searched for 2222. I get the 4 results listed above. For the same contact. Success and joy. </p><p>It is unfortunate the Thunderbird built-in Address Book is not presently able to search all phone numbers of any formats. This is a both required and frequently use feature for us. When possible, I prefer contributing to the core Thunderbird. Meanwhile, the add-on successfully resolved this challenge CardBook. </p><p>If my creating a ticket for thunderbird is successful, I'll share the link here for those interested to contribute </p>",F8a,false,0,0

Another suspicious event to add to my fast-growing pile of suspicious events.

Not just <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org</a> For example, but not limited to, any rate I post my legit, not spammy, peaceful and lawful comments, other forums, direct email messages, phone calls, voicemails, SMS, instant messages.

Since around 2014 till now. So more than 10 years now. Since 2022 a huge increase in those challenges. And growing. </p><p>Maybe there are Good-AI and Evil-AI? Maybe people with Evil behaviors are covertly controlling an AI (Evil-AI). In turn, this could be the root cause of all those challenges? This is just a theory and speculations.  </p><p>At work, when the infrastructure team dig very deep on any of those challenge listed above, it often turned out that the AI is directly or indirectly (proxy) controlled by Google, Microsoft, or ""anonymous"" owners. For example, but not limited to, the very popular ""Virus Total"" SPAM detection is control by Google. In my personal experience, based on the very long history of past results, both Google's and Microsoft's AI are by far the worst for false positive spam.
