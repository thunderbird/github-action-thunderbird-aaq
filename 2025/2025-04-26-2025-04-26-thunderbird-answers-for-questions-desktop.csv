Add two cell/mobile numbers for this same contact. Let's call those: </p><p>____Mobile 1: 123.456.1111 </p><p>____Mobile 2: 123.456.2222 </p><p>2. Using ""Advanced Address Book Search"" search for ""123.456.2222"". No result are return. This is the challenge. I only get one result if I search for ""123.456"". Somehow ""123.456.2222"" is not included in the search results. </p><p>3. The needed end result is to search all Phone Number fields for all contacts.

For example, but not limited to, ""Mobile Number 1"", ""Mobile Number 2"", ""Work Number 1"", ""Work Number 2"", etc. </p>",F8a,false,0,0
