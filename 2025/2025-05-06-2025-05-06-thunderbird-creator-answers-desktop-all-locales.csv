Not once did any box pop up warning me this would happen if I continued. I had only just moved to Thunderbird as mu partner recommended it as I was getting fed up with BT and Outlook. Whenever I have deleted things in the past on over sites a message always pops up to warn or ask if you're sure you want to delete these messages as they will be permanently deleted. It seems strange that the folders are all there but all their contents have been deleted. The folders were dragged and dropped into the deleted box. I've tried various ways to try and find them and retrieve them but to no avail.  Going forward it would be good to have a warning message to pop up to warn you. I guess these emails are now gone for good? </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",j.woodgate49
