See my first screenshot. This page is blank, so I there's nothing I can do with it. It is blank even after I start my Macintosh in safe mode and then start Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode. </p><p>So I made a back-up copy of my profile, deleted my Fastmail account in Thunderbird, and tried to set up my account again. See my second screenshot. Thunderbird hangs while looking up the configuration, and there is no way apparent way to set up the account manually. </p><p>So I am stuck. How can I either re-authorize Thunderbird (obviously, the preferred outcome) or re-create my account in Thunderbird? </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1730382;1730383;1730388;,mozilla98

Maybe it is the time difference? (I'm in Australia) </p><p>My original question was: </p><p>I can read my emails but I can't delete or action my emails. They're just piling up in the inbox.

It doesn't work for me now. </p><p>I give a monthly donation to Thunderbird to support the work being done, but if I can't use my emails, I'll need to change from Mozilla to another email system. </p><p>I'd appreciate help, and, also appreciate some advice about how I find a response that is sent to me when I go back to Support to answer it.
