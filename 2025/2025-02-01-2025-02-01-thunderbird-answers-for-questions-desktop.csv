I presume you mean you want to store your mail <i>locally</i> on your computer using Thunderbird. </p><p>You may create local folders in Thunderbird to store and organise your mail there however you wish, but removing it from Gmail is tricky because Gmail doesn't work like a normal IMAP server would, and one of its many particularities is that Gmail keeps all messages in a special folder called <i>All Mail</i> even when you remove them from other folders (labels in Gmail), and there is no way for mail clients such as Thunderbird to directly remove the messages from there. </p><p>The only way to remove a message from Gmail's <i>All Mail</i> with Thunderbird (or any other mail client) is <i>indirectly</i> by moving the message to <i>Bin/Trash</i> first (has to be the same <i>Bin/Trash</i> as the one used by Gmail for this to work), and then remove the message from there or just let Gmail automatically do that after 30 days. </p><p>So, in order to accomplish what you want using Thunderbird alone, you'd need to <i>copy</i> the messages you want to keep in Thunderbird to a local folder first, then move the original messages to <i>Bin/Trash</i> in order for them to be eventually removed from Gmail server. </p><p>Alternatively, you may simply move the messages where you want to store them in Thunderbird, and every now and then log into your Gmail account using webmail to delete your messages from <i>All Mail</i> there. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,1

IONOS is one of the options I considered, but discarded precisely because it didn't seem to allow having multiple email addresses under a single mail account, so I very much doubt you'll be able to accomplish what you want with them. You may have to create different account settings (different username) for each email address you want to have there, and maybe even for both the incoming and the outgoing server. </p><p>Doing that for the incoming server settings may be tedious but should be straightforward. Getting things right for the outgoing server settings is going to be trickier, though, because of the confusing way in which Thunderbird handles this situation. </p><p>When you setup a new account, Thunderbird <i>reuses</i> existing outgoing server settings that may already exist as a result of having previously created another account for the same server (but different username / email address), without telling you those settings are being shared across multiple accounts nor giving you the option to create new separate outgoing server settings specific for this account during the account setup process. </p><p>Thunderbird lets you create and manage multiple outgoing server settings for the same server, though, just not from within the main account settings. You have to do that from a separate <b>Outgoing Server (SMTP)</b> settings pane you may open by selecting the corresponding option at the bottom of the list of accounts in Account Settings.

I have not changed them since the initial install (if it ain't broke, don't fix it). I will add that email comes from a Verizon server while I can only view Web-mail on AOL. When TB stopped working, I assumed Verizon had dropped their (third party app) password to force a password update. I did the AOL gyrations to get the new third party password and now need TB to ask me for it. But with stored passwords, it would not. That's why I deleted the stored passwords assuming (I know) that TB would ask for a new password. </p><p>I have tried running Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode (Disabled all add-ons and Reset toolbars and controls) with the same result. </p><p>Interesting: When I start Windoz 11 in ""Safe Mode with Networking"" and try to open TB, a pop-up says: ""TB is already running, but is not responding. The old TB process must be closed to open a new window."" Close the pop-up and use task manager, there is no TB (or Mozilla) process running. When I open TB, the open process shows on task manager, after a brief pause, followed by a second task for the TB pop-up error.  </p><p>Interestinger: After restarting Windoz (Safe Mode off), now when I try to open TB, I get the same pop-up that says: ""TB is already running, but is not responding. The old TB process must be closed to open a new window."" If I close it, it reopens after a brief pause. This cycle continues. I have to select ""Cancel"" to get it to stop all TB tasks.  </p><p>Now, I cannot access my account Server Settings &gt; Server Name nor my passwords in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security.  </p><p>Seems I have taken one step back. </p>",brucewolfe1,false,0,0
