I don't know what you mean by 'Thunderbird server' - TB is not an Email provider and does not have a server. It is also good housekeeping to back up your Profile at least once a week to safeguard against data loss. </p>,frisée,false,0,0

It seems from your post that you are referring to an email on an Email account but I don't know why that would need to be 'removed'. </p><p>Please also include a screenshot of any errors that you have received to help us understand the problem. </p><p>There is only one question that you have submitted here so no one has suggested any action for you to take. </p>,frisée,false,0,0
