I presume you mean you want to store your mail <i>locally</i> on your computer using Thunderbird. </p><p>You may create local folders in Thunderbird to store and organise your mail there however you wish, but removing it from Gmail is tricky because Gmail doesn't work like a normal IMAP server would, and one of its many particularities is that Gmail keeps all messages in a special folder called <i>All Mail</i> even when you remove them from other folders (labels in Gmail), and there is no way for mail clients such as Thunderbird to directly remove the messages from there. </p><p>The only way to remove a message from Gmail's <i>All Mail</i> with Thunderbird (or any other mail client) is <i>indirectly</i> by moving the message to <i>Bin/Trash</i> first (has to be the same <i>Bin/Trash</i> as the one used by Gmail for this to work), and then remove the message from there or just let Gmail automatically do that after 30 days. </p><p>So, in order to accomplish what you want using Thunderbird alone, you'd need to <i>copy</i> the messages you want to keep in Thunderbird to a local folder first, then move the original messages to <i>Bin/Trash</i> in order for them to be eventually removed from Gmail server. </p><p>Alternatively, you may simply move the messages where you want to store them in Thunderbird, and every now and then log into your Gmail account using webmail to delete your messages from <i>All Mail</i> there. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0

IONOS is one of the options I considered, but discarded precisely because it didn't seem to allow having multiple email addresses under a single mail account, so I very much doubt you'll be able to accomplish what you want with them. You may have to create different account settings (different username) for each email address you want to have there, and maybe even for both the incoming and the outgoing server. </p><p>Doing that for the incoming server settings may be tedious but should be straightforward. Getting things right for the outgoing server settings is going to be trickier, though, because of the confusing way in which Thunderbird handles this situation. </p><p>When you setup a new account, Thunderbird <i>reuses</i> existing outgoing server settings that may already exist as a result of having previously created another account for the same server (but different username / email address), without telling you those settings are being shared across multiple accounts nor giving you the option to create new separate outgoing server settings specific for this account during the account setup process. </p><p>Thunderbird lets you create and manage multiple outgoing server settings for the same server, though, just not from within the main account settings.
