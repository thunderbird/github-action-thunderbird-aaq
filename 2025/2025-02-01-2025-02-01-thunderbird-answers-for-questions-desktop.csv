I'll do that, but I have a feeling that updating the ConfirmBeforeDelete extension (or creating a new, similar extension) may happen sooner. </p><p>As for Ctrl-Z (also Edit -&gt; Undo from the menus), I've had inconsistent results doing that.  I think sometimes that has un-done an earlier action, not the most recent one.  Also, I will have to test whether it works properly for my example (where I had a search window with 20 messages highlighted and hit the delete key). </p><p>I just tested deleting a single message (not in a search window) and doing Edit-&gt;Undo Delete. While Thunderbird did restore the message, it left the original where it was in the mbox file (with an X-Mozilla-Status marker for 'has been deleted'), and created a new copy at the end of the mbox file (with a timestamp in the ""From -"" line giving the time I did the undelete).  It is sometimes important to me to retain the original ""From-"" timestamp (showing when Thunderbird originally fetched the message). </p>",David_C,false,0,0

I don't know what you mean by 'Thunderbird server' - TB is not an Email provider and does not have a server. It is also good housekeeping to back up your Profile at least once a week to safeguard against data loss. </p>,frisée,false,0,0

I presume you mean you want to store your mail <i>locally</i> on your computer using Thunderbird. </p><p>You may create local folders in Thunderbird to store and organise your mail there however you wish, but removing it from Gmail is tricky because Gmail doesn't work like a normal IMAP server would, and one of its many particularities is that Gmail keeps all messages in a special folder called <i>All Mail</i> even when you remove them from other folders (labels in Gmail), and there is no way for mail clients such as Thunderbird to directly remove the messages from there. </p><p>The only way to remove a message from Gmail's <i>All Mail</i> with Thunderbird (or any other mail client) is <i>indirectly</i> by moving the message to <i>Bin/Trash</i> first (has to be the same <i>Bin/Trash</i> as the one used by Gmail for this to work), and then remove the message from there or just let Gmail automatically do that after 30 days. </p><p>So, in order to accomplish what you want using Thunderbird alone, you'd need to <i>copy</i> the messages you want to keep in Thunderbird to a local folder first, then move the original messages to <i>Bin/Trash</i> in order for them to be eventually removed from Gmail server. </p><p>Alternatively, you may simply move the messages where you want to store them in Thunderbird, and every now and then log into your Gmail account using webmail to delete your messages from <i>All Mail</i> there. </p>",DavidGG,false,0,0
