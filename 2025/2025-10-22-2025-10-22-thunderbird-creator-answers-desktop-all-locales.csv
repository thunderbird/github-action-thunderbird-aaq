I followed the instructions here:  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a> </p><p>I installed Thunderbird 140.4.0 esr, which is the latest version. Both laptops now have that version installed. </p><p>But when I open TB on the Linux computer, and close the Account Setup window, and go to the Troubleshooting screen, next to ""Profile Directory"" it says ""Open Directory"", but when I click on that, nothing happens. So how can I paste my TB profile? Do I have to start a new profile first, and then copy over that? </p><p>I installed TB from the ""Software"" area, which I believe is a Flatpak. I'm very new to Linux, so just fumbling around here. There were 3 options of Thunderbird. I installed the one that had the most information and seemed most up to date. That was confusing.  </p><p>I would LOVE some help on this. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;import-and-export-settings;,thunderbird,import-and-export-settings,en-US,1773814;,DD46
