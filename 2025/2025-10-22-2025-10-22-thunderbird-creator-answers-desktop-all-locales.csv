Ho verificato e la lingua impostata è ancora l'italiano, non ho altre lingue alternative, ma non riesco né a ripristinare i nomi in italiano né a rinominare le cartelle. Ho provato ad inserire la stringa ""user_pref(""mail.folder.localizedNames"", true);"" su ""prefs.js"", su suggerimento di copilot, ma nulla è cambiato. Per me non è un grande problema, ma siccomee thunderbird lo usa anche mia madre di 91 anni, tutti i giorni e più volte al giorno, mi sta facendo impazzire perché rivuole le cartelle in italiano, ma io non so più cosa fare...
