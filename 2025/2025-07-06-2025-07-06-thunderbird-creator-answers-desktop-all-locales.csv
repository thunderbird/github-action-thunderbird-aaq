Thunderbird will advise that there are, say, 6 emails to download but it wont down load them. I can access them from my Android tablet and see them on my email server). An initial check online suggested there might be a space problem on my laptop. There was, and I cleaned up the contents of my laptop. Problem disappeared. Today the problem reappeared. Thinking there could still be a space problem, I cleaned out my considerable archive in Thunderbird. Restarted Thunderbird - no luck. There were a dozen or so emails on the server, and I could read them on my Android tablet. I rebooted the laptop. A message that it was downloading new emails, but nothing downloaded although they were still on the server. I uninstalled Thunderbird and downloaded the latest version. I could email from the laptop to the Android and reverse but nothing else. I deleted all my emails on the server. Any suggestions about how I should proceed?
