Thunderbird will advise that there are, say, 6 emails to download but it wont down load them. I can access them from my Android tablet and see them on my email server). An initial check online suggested there might be a space problem on my laptop. There was, and I cleaned up the contents of my laptop. Problem disappeared. Today the problem reappeared. Thinking there could still be a space problem, I cleaned out my considerable archive in Thunderbird. Restarted Thunderbird - no luck. There were a dozen or so emails on the server, and I could read them on my Android tablet. I rebooted the laptop. A message that it was downloading new emails, but nothing downloaded although they were still on the server. I uninstalled Thunderbird and downloaded the latest version. I could email from the laptop to the Android and reverse but nothing else. I deleted all my emails on the server. Any suggestions about how I should proceed?

Specifically, it seems that when moving a message from an IMAP folder, such as an Inbox, to a folder of a different email account or a Local Folder, the message disappears from Thunderbird but doesn't immediately get deleted from the server (I am checking by logging in through a browser to the email's web interface). Depending on the email provider, it may be marked or flagged as ""deleted"" or in some cases it just remains in the inbox (in outlook's web interface, for example, I can't tell if a message has been marked as deleted or not).  Only later, after right-clicking on the respective inbox in Thunderbird and choosing ""Compact"" it deletes the message from the server.   </p><p>I'm a bit confused now: All of my accounts are using maildir (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird</a>) as storage format, which I selected prior to adding any account. According to the information here (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders</a>), ""Compact does not apply to accounts using the maildir storage format"".  So for maildir accounts, why do I have a ""compact"" option at all and how come it doesn't delete messages immediately? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding either what compact means or maildir or (probably) both?  Is there a way to have Thunderbird simply delete (not just ""mark as deleted"") moved messages instantly?    </p><p>I was under the impression that since maildir stores essentially one file per email message, that it would function like file management on a computer, so when moving a message from folder A to folder B the file/message would disappear from folder A, not that it would keep a copy ""marked as deleted"" in folder A. If anybody could explain this I would be most grateful. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jdhauck
