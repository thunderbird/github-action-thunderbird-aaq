Some weird things are taking place now. </p><p>This afternoon when initiating Thunderbird by selecting Thunderbird icon on the task bar as always do, Thunderbird began going directly to my profile, not bringing up the 'Thunderbird - Choose User Profile' window.  This has happened previously and I got instruction on the forum how to resolve, so I did that resolution again. </p><p>I ran Thunderbird.exe -p in the RUN box   . </p><p>It bought up the 'choose user profile' window so I UNCHECKED the box 'use the selected profile without asking at startup.'  I guess somehow it got inadvertently checked.  I expected this to resolve the problem.  Note: When the box came up the first time I did NOT notice the names of the profiles offered, ours or the default ones mentioned below.  </p><p>Now, when I initiate Thunderbird by selecting the icon in the task bar or selecting the icon on the desktop or selecting Thunderbird in the START list of apps -- it still goes directly to my profile not bringing up the 'Choose User Profile' window.  HOWEVER, when I enter in the RUN box either thunderbird.exe or thunderbird.exe -p it brings up the 'Choose User Profile' window. </p><p>BUT -- the profiles offered are default and default.esr.  They are not our two profiles we have been running for years.  Our two profiles are still in the Thunderbird Profiles directory as seen with File Explorer.  Hovering over default and default.esr shows their respective paths to the Thunderbird Profiles directory.  (Cannot edit these paths.)  But using File Explorer, these two profiles (default and default.esr) are NOT seen in the Profiles directory at all. </p><p>Question:  1. How do I get Thunderbird to function correctly.  That is, when selecting the Thunderbird icon it brings up the 'Choose User Profile' showing our two profiles, and when I RUN Thunderbird.exe in the RUN window it ALSO shows our two profiles in the 'Choose User Profile' window, and NOT that default and default.esr profiles which I don't even see in the Profiles directory. </p><p>One more thing -- I have been thinking of switching over and installing the Thunderbird Release Channel -- If I installed it, would these problems carryover or would they be resolved?  Thank you. </p><p>Added this note:  In the past when the box 'use the selected profile without asking at startup' got inadvertently check and I resolved the problem by running thunderbird.exe -p, I was not running the Thunderbird version I am running now.  It was back on 9/22/24 and I forgot what version it was but I don't think it was the ESR version back then.  Maybe that is why running this command worked back on 9/22/24, but getting weird results now with the current esr version running.  Thank you again. </p>",thunderbird;profiles;,thunderbird,profiles,en-US,1750367;,jpwvols

With this update (2025/07/19) my display is divided into three columns.  The left column is still a hierarchy of folders.  The center column is a list of messages.  The right column is the text of the currently-selected message.  This is awkward: I must choose between making the center column too thin to show all the message metadata (subject, size, from, date) or making the right column too thin to easily read the message text. How do I restore the text-below-messages layout that I want? Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1750336;,franklinccoleman

I have tried the repair folder option and it mostly works but not always - for example I couldn't copy or move messages from a sub-folder on one email account to a sub-sub-folder on another. It finally worked when I moved the messages to the folder above the one I wanted, and then moved them down, which was very time-consuming.
