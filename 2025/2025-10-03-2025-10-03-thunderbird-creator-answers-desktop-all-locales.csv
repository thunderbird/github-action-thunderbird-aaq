Below that message there are 3 options;  ""Retry"" ""Enter New Password"" ""Cancel"". Retry doesn´t work and when I click on ""Enter New Password"" I get a frame with the following message: ""Enter your password fpr santamonica@telia.com on <a href=""http://mailin.telia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mailin.telia.com</a>"". I enter my password but it still doesn´t work, I only get the initial error message again. </p><p>I have talked to the mail provider and they say that they can´t help with this since the fault is with Thunderbird. </p><p>Does anyone have a clue as to what could be wrong, and what I could do to correct this matter? </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",santamonica1
