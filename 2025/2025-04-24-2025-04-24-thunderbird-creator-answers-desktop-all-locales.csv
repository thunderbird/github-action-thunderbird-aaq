I have been able to set up Thunderbird on a new laptop under Windows 11 (not really happy about it but you have to do what you have to do).   </p><p>I am wondering what would be the best way to move the personal folders off of the Dell and onto the new Lenovo?  </p><p>I have thought about copying the Dell’s profile over to the Lenovo in a temporary area like C:\Temp and then cutting everything under the old profile over to the new one replacing all files (after backing up the new profile first of course).  I’m thinking this would migrate the address books as well.   </p><p>Once I have the folders and address books moved across, I will delete them from the old Dell. </p><p>Not sure if this is the best way.  Any and all help/ideas/comments would be most appreciated.   </p><p>Thanks and have a great day, Brocky </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1727871;,jmbrocky
