I've checked my server settings and all seems correct so not sure why it stopped at July? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1769008;1769012;1769013;1769014;1769015;,dcmichael

I hope not. I used it for my email and love love love it. I donate $ to it every month. </p>,thunderbird;undefined;,thunderbird,undefined,en-US,1769028;,RobinClaire

When its Pop 3 download ability stopped working, I started looking for another email program that could read my Windows Mail emails on my computer while continuing to download more recent emails to save on my computer. Thunderbird seemed like it might be the answer.  Unfortunately, much to my horror, Thunderbird is in the process of re-downloading everything from my online server back to 1998. I had to close Thunderbird to avoid needless duplication of the emails I already have on my computer. I'm using Thunderbird's IMAP, but  after reading various help online articles, it sounds as though the POP3 has the same problem, that you can't configure either Thunderbird protocol to restrict its download to a few months in history without either deleting all of the old emails on the online server, downloading just the headers without the body of the email for past and future email downloads, or restrict the length of time an email remains in either the computer or online systems. I'm very confused by all of these articles, rendering me unable to make a move-- I can't afford to lose almost 3 decades of emails on my online server. </p><p>All I want to do is find a program that will pick up where Windows Mail left off, something that downloads the current emails to my computer while leaving the online emails unaltered. Is there anyway I can get Thunderbird to do this? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1769031;,dangheno
