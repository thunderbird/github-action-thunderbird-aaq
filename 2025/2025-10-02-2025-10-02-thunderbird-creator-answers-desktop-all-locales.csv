When its Pop 3 download ability stopped working, I started looking for another email program that could read my Windows Mail emails on my computer while continuing to download more recent emails to save on my computer. Thunderbird seemed like it might be the answer.  Unfortunately, much to my horror, Thunderbird is in the process of re-downloading everything from my online server back to 1998. I had to close Thunderbird to avoid needless duplication of the emails I already have on my computer. I'm using Thunderbird's IMAP, but  after reading various help online articles, it sounds as though the POP3 has the same problem, that you can't configure either Thunderbird protocol to restrict its download to a few months in history without either deleting all of the old emails on the online server, downloading just the headers without the body of the email for past and future email downloads, or restrict the length of time an email remains in either the computer or online systems. I'm very confused by all of these articles, rendering me unable to make a move-- I can't afford to lose almost 3 decades of emails on my online server. </p><p>All I want to do is find a program that will pick up where Windows Mail left off, something that downloads the current emails to my computer while leaving the online emails unaltered. Is there anyway I can get Thunderbird to do this? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,1769031;,dangheno

[rather a long story sorry] I have been using Thunderbird for a long time and was working OK until last week, then suddenly I can no longer log in, after a lot of hours on telstra help[which was no help] except to say that my <a href=""http://bigpond.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bigpond.com</a> was linked to my ex-partners account which was opened probably 20 yrs ago, i never remember having a password, and T/B was asking for that, in the end I went to a Telstra Shop and got my ex to be there as well as they couldn't do anything without him being there.  Everything seemed to be going fine and got the bigpond account in my name with a new password, I even got them to help me install a mail program on my phone through gmail.....all good got some emails. On arriving home very relieved switched on my computer and downloaded some mail, then wanted to download TB on my phone which I did and tried to set it up, but couldn't get it to work......now I'm not sure what's wrong but read about having to have the correct server address and port number as I wanted to be able to sync from mobile to desktop and vice versa......so now I don't know which server and port number are correct.....so to cut the long story short I'm hoping someone can help with setup and server and Port numbers for old bigpond accounts and if they are are same on Mobile and Computer.
