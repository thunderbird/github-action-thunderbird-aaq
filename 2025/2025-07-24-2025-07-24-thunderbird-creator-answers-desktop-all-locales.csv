Never had a problem.   Then on July 10th just one of them stopped opening and a message window appeared saying that authentication was OK but it wasn't able to connect.  The other two continue to open as before.  Any idea on how to rectify this, please. </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",johnsweetensen
