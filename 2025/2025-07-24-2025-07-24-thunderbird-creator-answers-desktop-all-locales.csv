I have three email accounts on Thunderbird, and all of them have exactly the same specifications.    They are all @hotmail.com.  They have the same server name (<a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>), same port number, same connection security, same authentication method (0Auth2) and same Imap default release code.  Never had a problem.   Then on July 10th just one of them stopped opening and a message window appeared saying that authentication was OK but it wasn't able to connect.  The other two continue to open as before.  Any idea on how to rectify this, please. </p>",thunderbird;connectivity;,thunderbird,connectivity,en-US,"",johnsweetensen
