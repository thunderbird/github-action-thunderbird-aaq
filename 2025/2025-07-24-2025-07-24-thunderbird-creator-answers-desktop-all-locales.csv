Now the program shows that the 10.0 GB limit has been reached, I eliminated a large amount of my emails recently but that action did not make any difference in the Quota Warnings.  I was still able to send and receive mail, so I put the Quota Warning into a filter that would automatically send it to the trash folder. Now, after apparently reaching the full 10.0 GB limit, I have lost a vast number of emails I had in various folders. So, I downloaded and installed your newest version and hoped that the problem was solved.  I still got the red percentage bar in the lower right hand corner of the pane, indicating the 10.0 GB limit had been reached.   So, I went into my Inbox and deleted about 150 messages in there.  Now the red warning is not showing in the lower right corner. Was my deletion of the messages in my Inbox effective in affecting this change? Why were my other archived and stored email messages deleted?  The fact that they are gone did not, apparently have any bearing on the 10.0 GB limitation.  Only the volume of messages in the Inbox has any bearing upon the limitation.   Is the IMAP selection rather than the POP3 selection in the settings the place where the 10.0 GB limitation can be eliminated? It would be nice to know the answers to these questions along with a little explanation about why the limitation warning is so vague.   Losing mail that you have tried to segregate and preserve is disturbing.   Just trying to be nice.
