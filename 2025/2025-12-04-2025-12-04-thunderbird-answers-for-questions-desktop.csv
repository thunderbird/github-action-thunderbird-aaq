The path is denoted under &gt;User -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Server settings  -&gt;Local Directory,  which is a path to everything I want. </p><p>(I did state this in my original post) </p><p>That is what suddenly is working. That path is being seen, so the files are now being seen. </p><p><br> I think (??????) the one that did it was under the path given in Local Directory as shown above, I erased that line, and chose the Browse button to the right, and input it again in that way. </p><p>Could that have fixed it all? Is it possible that /Users/.... has a path to the old disk which we don't see? How could using ""browse"" impact that? </p><p>Altho it is true that I made a lot of changes to the Profile section, none made a difference, including keeping/nuking old builds of profiles. </p><p>Anyway, thanks to everyone who were helping. Sorry for belaboring this reply, but it may happen to someone else, so I wanted to add to the knowledge base. </p><p>Thanks again. </p>",minusetopii,false,0,0

You don't mention what version of Thunderbird you're using, but recent versions have a new feature called ""Account Hub"" which is classified as ""experimental"". Some people have had problems with it, though it's worked well for me. I have a feeling it works best with common email services like GMail, less so with more obscure ones.
