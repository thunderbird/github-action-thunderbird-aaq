In these older Thunderbird installations it was allowed to share the same profile by default.

Contrary to more than 400 prefs-(nnn).js files in a French Mozilla forum user's Thunderbird profile I have never seen more then one xulstore.json file in one profile.

On restart you will have a rather strange view of the Thunderbird main window and its different panes since all height and width settings will be default and not your usual customisation. That's why you should not delete your xulstore.json file as a first step, so you can always go back. </p><p>Now customise the choice of your thread pane columns to be displayed and their respective width, quit and restart TB and verify if columns and widths have been memorised.  </p><p>You can also install the ""DefaultColumns"" add-on <a href=""https://www.ggbs.de/extensions/DefaultColumns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ggbs.de/extensions/DefaultColumns.html</a> which permits to save your columns customisation ""as default"", so they will b applied in all other folders (image) </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

I don't recall having to involve anything like that and my Gmail account works as expected. You don't mention what version of Thunderbird you're using, but recent versions have a new feature called ""Account Hub"" which is classified as ""experimental"". Some people have had problems with it, though it's worked well for me. I have a feeling it works best with common email services like GMail, less so with more obscure ones.
