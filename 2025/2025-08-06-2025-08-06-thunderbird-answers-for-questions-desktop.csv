And there is this problem of apparent overeating since the fans start ventilating after 1 minute of TB use...and the fans stop as soon as I close TB down. As for creating a new profile, I think I already did that twice: once to revert to version ""esr"" of 141.0, and a second time to try a former version (128) . I would very much like to have just one profile, the one I had before the update to version 141.0 (not the esr one) . But I updated my version (140.0??) because  TB sent me a message to update and I chose the Release (monthly update) version because the message said it was recommended.  I would also very much like to recover my local folders (stored on my Mac) which at the moment do not appear in TB. I join a screenshot (image 1) of the 2 profiles I found in my Mac (Librar/yThunderbird/Profiles),the 0225vg86...one is saved separately on a USB key.

So do not take this as a ‘thank you but’ but as a message to make it simple and hopefully workable. In answer to my problem about local folders, I managed via the “Import” button in TB to select what I guessed was the last and correct profile (in my Library/TB/profiles folder) to reinstall the local folders…It took a bit of time (some 2700 messages) but they are all there. So now: when I open TB (141 release channel) , I first go to my Activity Monitor to kill the secondary ‘thunderbird’ process. By doing so , I prevent the CPU overload and when I quit , TB quits nicely. Fine… But now I noticed my Mac has lost about 20 Go of storage capacity…I suppose that by recovering the Local Folders I doubled the space occupied by TB! When I look at the state of the TB profiles, the whole lot is some 26 Go in size, but the useful profile (containing the local folders) is only 12.8 Go! To make things a little more confusing (for me at least), I just received notification that the new Eclipse 140 version (esr) is now available. Now, before the latest ‘release’ update (141) I was working with an ‘esr’ version (140 I think) . My question: is it a good idea to revert to esr with Eclipse and get rid of the other versions (I have the 141.0, plus the 140.1.1 esr which I don’t open). In that case, I will rebuild a new profile with the Eclipse, with the folders on the main server (my provider’s) + I will (IF THIS IS POSSIBLE) import ONLY the Local Folders contained in the current profile I use at the moment. Does this sound crazy&nbsp;? </p>",Jean.Chuquet,false,0,0

If you have a VPN make sure Thunderbird is exempted from the VPN when connecting to the server.

It is easy to click reply on a mail and have a different outgoing server for that identity selected. </p><p>Finally access the Thunderbird password manager and remove all SMTP passwords stored there for Comcast so you can be sure everything is fresh. </p><p>It is a support cop out from your ISP that if they are able to keep their website up that any issues you have with mail protocols is your problem. Their stuff is working.  That is akin to telling you you have electricity so any issues with your phone are your end.  Vaguely related as both use electricity but that is about where it ends.
