I have both, Unified Folders and All Folders visible in the sidebar.  For drafts, sent, junk, trash, templates, etc. I prefer to use the respective folders under each email account shown All Folders. But I very much like the Unified Inbox.

So I thought of creating a new custom Saved Search and include all the Inboxes. But unfortunately that seems only possible as subfolders of specific accounts. So I tried and created a Saved Search with all inboxes and IMAP search on under Local Folders.  But I can't move it to the top of the list. And it also is not expandable to show individual inboxes as under Unified Folders.
