In Spam folder - enable the 'Spam' column header, so you have a specific column for 'Spam'. It will then show a 'flame' icon for each email in list.

Some do it once a week, others once a month. You might want to set up your own to delete junk older than x, but since good mail could end up in junk/spam, personally I would advise you do not select that option and instead empty the Junk manually via a right click on Junk folder and selct 'Empty Junk' after you have checked it. Then please remember to Right click on Junk and select 'compact' to remove all traces of old emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
