So local folders does what you originally set out to do, relieves the storage requirements on the mail server. </p><p>You can even set a local path for the local folders account that is separate from the main profile folder but having the whole profile together in a location is preferable from a support perspective as nothing is accidentally get left behind when you move a profile, say to a new machine. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
