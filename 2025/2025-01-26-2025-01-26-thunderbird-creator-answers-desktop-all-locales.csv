All messages I send come back with an end of message error and SMTP blocked (see attached). This happened a few weeks ago and my email sourse gave me some new settings using port 587 and it worked ok until a few days ago then exactly the same again. They have checked and everyting works ok for them.  I then checked with BitDefender to see if they could assist and everything was as expected so I did a complete computr scan with it and it came back with 3 trojan errors all of which were in Thunderbird. So I decided to do a complete delete and reinstall. No matter what I do or what I deleteincluding shutdown after every delete, when I reinstall it comes back with the total and Faulty Thunderbird So I can't start with a clean sheet.

So I've been using Thunderbird on my laptop (currently Win10) for about ten years (latest version is installed). Over time, the folder in AppData\Roaming has been growing quite a lot, until it reached about 46 GB. Since I always had enough space on my hard drive, this never concerned me. At some point, however, it started to strike me as unnormal how much data has accumulated, since while I have indeed a lot of emails saved locally (the server type is POP, my email provider deletes the emails from the server after some time, but they are saved on my computer), most of them should only amount to a few KB.  </p><p>I found out, then, that the automatic compression was not activated, so I manually compressed all my folders. This helped: The Thunderbird folder shrunk from 46 to 30 GB. It's not as much as I hoped, however. Even 30 GB seems wildly exaggerated.  </p><p>So does anyone have ideas what I could do to reduce it further? I have analyzed the folder structure using WizTree and can see that by far the biggest files are the inbox files (I am using several profiles at the same time, the biggest inbox amounts to almost 8 GB, then there is another one with 3 GB). </p><p>What confuses me additionally (and might be part of the problem) is that there are more subfolders in th ""profiles"" folder than accounts that I'm using. Could it be that Thunderbird has created redundant folders (or there has been a problem over the years causing this)? And how can I find out which folders I still need? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1706692;1706696;1706713;1706736;,robin.waldenburg

I changed the passwords in Thunderbird for IMAP and SMTP, but it still will not connect. If I do an auto populate attempt, the server actually responds with the correct setting so I know I am reaching the server. After five days trying to resolve the issue with Spectrum I was told this is a know issue with Thunderbird and it is not the server but the third party application. It is bad enough they reconfigure things like this without disclosing it. It baffles me that the changes they claim were made in November 2024 only make themselves known when the service stops working nearly three months after the change and only when I changed the web site password.
