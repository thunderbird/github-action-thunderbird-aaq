But there is a caveat. Mail servers are not made for mass transaction, and email providers tend to limit the amount of data which can be transferred within a certain time. So you should transfer messages from the IMAP server to your Local Folders account in smaller batches, and not all at once. Depending on the no. of messages on the server this might be a somewhat tedious thing to do. </p><p>Also do <strong>not move</strong> messages, use <strong>copy</strong> instead. If something goes wrong, messages would still be available on the IMAP server. Select a batch of messages to be transferred on the server -&gt; right-click a selected message -&gt; Copy To. Select 'Local Folders' - &lt;desired destination folder&gt; from the drop-down menu. </p> <blockquote> if I keep the account in Thunderbird but he cancels it with <a href=""http://orange.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">orange.fr</a>, he could always access his emails in Thunderbird in the local folder&nbsp;? </blockquote> <p>Once the messages have been transferred to your 'Local Folders' account they will always be accessible, regardless of the existence of the IMAP account. Once the IMAP account with <a href=""http://orange.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">orange.fr</a> has been canceled, you'd probably want to delete it in Thunderbird as well. Otherwise you'd get constant error pop-ups due to failed connection attempts. </p><p>Also make sure to backup the Thunderbird profile on a regular basis, accidents can happen at any time.  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile</a> </p>",christ1,false,0,0

None of those interferred with g-mail five days ago. </blockquote> <p>I is common for folk to think as you do. It used to work. It does not work now. So Thunderbird is the problem!  Unfortunately that is very rarely the case.  I would actually sometimes be happier of it was Thunderbird because we could do something about the issue,  but as I said it is rarely the case. </p><p>Support folk like me banging on about third party products just makes those that have assumed they know the problem application frustrated so we use all sorts of ways of leading people to the conclusion that they have installed another application that is the problem. The standard diagnostics used to be to ask folk to restart their device in safe mode with networking.  That excludes the third party applications, antivirus products other than defender as well as VPN products.  The later two have significant issues working with email at the best of times and failures can most usually be ticked off to one or the other. Sadly safe mode with networking is totally unavailable to those that do not have the option to use a wired internet connection.  These days that describes the vast majority of the internet users in the USA where infrastructure actually approaches third world standards and WiFi is the de jure standard. </p><p>So what to do;  </p> <ul><li> Remove any third party antivirus.  You are using windows 10 or 11 so removing third party antivirus will means windows defender started up to protect you,  so it is only a minor risk to diagnose the problem. </li><li> Disable any VPN.  Google in particular of mail providers is quikck to assume you have been hacked when a VPN is used.  Your phone which almost always has some sort of google account tie in says you are not where the VPN says you are therefore the attempted access is a hack.  In this instance it is unlikely to be the issue as the packet is according to google malformed, not misdirected </li><li>Tell Thunderbird to use a full useragent string instead of an abbreviated one.   use the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">config editor</a> config editor to change the preference ""mailnews.headers.useMinimalUserAgent"" to false.  Please report the results of this change.  I lost an argument when the change was suggested that it would improve privacy when I said we had no real idea what any provider actually did with that information.  So if the change makes it work, we really need to know. </li><li>Tell Thunderbird to connect as an imposter reporting it is Firefox.  Some folk had had success with that but I have no idea why.  Perhaps their antivirus got out of the way once it was a browser and not a mail program.  I have no idea. This time use the  <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">config editor</a> config editor to change the preference general.useragent.compatMode.firefox = True and try again as with the last one.

But  it means there are a lot of folk quite upset about the poor support they receive because support does not fix Thunderbird as is required for them to get mail.

That can change dependant on your settings, folder subscription etc.  But each and every folder in the IMAP account in Thunderbird is fully syncronised with the mail server copies of the relevant email, so even if you choose to not download the actual email,  of local index what allows the user interface to populate list of emails per folder will still be generated.  There will be ""some"" local copies of some data in the cache should you choose to not download an mail locally,  but from looking at the Thunderbird user interface you will have no idea if there is aa local copy of the messages body, or only a local copy of the metadata about the email. </p><p>Any action to move or copy mail from the IMAP account to local folders ends any concept of synchronization of those emails,  they are now static local copies of mail that was previously syncronised with the server.  If you have a filter moving mails as you indicate then the ""moved mails"" are no longer synchronized  they are static copies of the mail in the server folder as at the time the copy was made.  Thunderbird makes no attempt to record audiut information regarding movement of mail from folder to folder or account to account.  So while you have a snapshot there is no reference as to when that was created.   </p><p>No changes to the email in question such as the editing of the email subject or notations about replies or modifications of the record like the addition or removal of tags will be reflected in your local copy.  Nor will your local copy be deleted when the server copy is deleted.  It is entirely stand alone. </p><p>So management of duplicates from the filter will be your issue, along with a host of other issues like I mentioned about deletions and modifications you will have issues with ""latest copy""  more so that duplicates.   </p><p>Essentially you are attempting to do something that is not going to work as your copy you are acting upon is not in any way synchronized. It is a static copy. </p><p>You may be able to manage some duplicate mail by adding tags to mail in the filter when it copies them and exuding mail that has that tag in the filter criteria.   </p><p>It sounds to me like you are trying to build some sort of detailed index of mail locally using external tools that are ill suited to the task. Those tools you are familiar with are not necessarily the best for the purpose.  Perhaps instead of starting with incorrect assumptions abput syncronisation and what is and is not syncronised you would like to actually say what it is you are trying to do. Someone may be able to offer advice about the best approach to achieve that goal.  I do not think your current approach is it, but you have also said very little about the actual data you are trying to get, or why you need it in a spreadsheet.  </p><p>Personally I feel if you are using powershell to manually read MBOX files to extract data it is unlikely you will have a long term solution to anything.  There is no guarantee that Thunderbird will even continue to use the MBOX file format into the next release.  It probably will,  but the maildir like format has been in the wings for about 10 years now and I am hearing talk about a single central mozstorage (essentially SQlite) database, so what the future holds in not clear cut  Thunderbird has already moved address books and local calendars to mozstorage so mail databases is really only a next step. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Less? </p><p>And - where, then, if not in local folders, would said data be saved? </p><p>The purpose of the powershell is to grab certain information from customer order 'receipts' to create a FIFO spreadsheet, so that work is done on things in the order they are received.

I'm versed in the differences between imap and pop3, etc. and have Exim on my mail server... That said - the photo/screen shot attached.  Within the world of Thunderbird - ""Synchronize"" for offline use means what?   </blockquote> <p>I had thought I made that clear. A copy is stored in a local folder within the account in Thunderbird.  ie a sub folder of the account, not the ""local Folders"" account.  Both a stored on the local device.  One is IMAP and syncronised the latter is emphatically not. </p> <blockquote> There is a standard english dictionary definition, but is there more in thunderbird? Less?  And - where, then, if not in local folders, would said data be saved? </blockquote> <p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-07-20-02-42-34-27190c.png""> This is an IMAP account I have in Thunderbird.  The folders are syncronised to the imap server and the process of accessing a folder with my mouse initiates a check as the the currency of the folders content and updates the content as required.  Similar updates occur at timed intervals but that should all be well understood to an extim administrator. </p><p>The Local Folders account is is never syncronised to anything.  Even attempts to sync it's contents to a NAS or cloud service always fail in some way or another.  You ask about special meanings for synchronization in Thunderbird, and there is none.  There is a special definition of local folders in Thunderbird.  There is n account and then there is local storage on 5the local disk and  that can in some circumstances extend to cached data appearing on the local disk but not in the Thunderbird profile as such.    </p><p>To quote the google AI.  </p> <blockquote> ""IMAP is designed to keep your email in sync across multiple devices. When you read, delete, or move emails using an IMAP client, these actions are reflected on the server and then synced to other devices connected to that same account"" </blockquote> <blockquote> The purpose of the powershell is to grab certain information from customer order 'receipts' to create a FIFO spreadsheet, so that work is done on things in the order they are received.  Should Thunderbird adopt a different message store format for local content, well, we'll crack that egg when it happens.  It's not intended to be along term solution, just one to work while the workflows within the website are improved. </blockquote> <p>Ok,  why move the mail at all.  That is the first question I have.  The mail in the IMAP folder will be syncronised across devices.  Why use a filter to move it someplace else where it is not.  Use a filter to mark everything in the folder with a tag,  that would allow each processed mail to be flagged as done.  It would not however notify you if the email is updated by the server for any reason. </p><p>The second thing is I read FIFO as Fly In Fly Out.  Half my local community have such jobs.  But I do not see your usage fitting in with fly in fly out mine rosters so I may be off on a tangent here.  I am assuming your usage is in the scope of  ""first in, first out"" inventory management.  It is an abbreviation I have never heard of until today,  but I have never really worked in inventory management.  But google offered it and it sort of sounds like it might fit. </p><p>Personally I really do not understand why you are not using the extim mail store to extract the data from the canonical store (the server) and write it directly to a CSV file for use in a spreadsheet program.  Extim as I understand it uses maildir so there will be one file per email,  which would make walking over each email (a discrete file) much easier than trying to do it all in an MBOX file.  The server will have no duplicates and unless your folder is going to have hundreds of thousands of emails in it parsing the entire folder contents would be a fairly short order process as I am assume the rad side of the process would be no greater than that or reading an entire MBOX file with the same data. </p><p>You could do much the same with Thunderbird by enabling the local maildir storage for the account in Thunderbird.  I would prefer to use the source rather than a copy.  But if you are dedicated to a local device undertaking the function then Thunderbird with it's maildir like storage would be appropriate. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/maildir-thunderbird</a> </p><p>Just as an aside,  the dates shown in Thunderbird are the Date: header. Both as received and date headings.  You will almost certainly need to be using the latest Received: header if you are wanting to rank stuff on the order received on the server. That will require parsing the header </p><p>Next aside.  You might do much better using an addon to integrate your code into Thunderbird (it is JavaScript and local file system access can be a pain when writing data to disk.)  Using an addon would give you access to the predefined object data of the email including meta data like the from: to: date: body: without needing to parse the raw HTML. or text in the case of headers to get that information.  Powershell will not get you access to the email objects nor sanitized body text as opposed to raw HTML </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
