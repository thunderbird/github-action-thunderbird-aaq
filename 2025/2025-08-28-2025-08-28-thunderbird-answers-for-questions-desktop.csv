The problem began with a change in password to one account, which I accomplished successfully on my android phone using Samsung Email.  Sometime later, I opened Thunderbird on one of the PCs with that installed and it complained about the password on the account that was changed.  I was not successful in updating that password (copy/paste from 1Password) and when attempting to check the email from the other accounts that were previously OK (on this PC) Tbird complained about those passwords as well.  I checked the email on the 2nd PC that also has Tbird with these 3 accounts and they were all problematic as well.  I checked the email on my android and that still worked OK, suggesting that the IP (same for both PCs, different for the android) was ""blocked"".  I contacted server support who confirmed and promptly unblocked it.  They have been prompt and helpful, my comment about them being upset was my assumption because of the number of support tickets I generated to deal with this issue.  I began looking for what was different about the PC and android installations, and found the server names to be different.  One PC had ""<a href=""http://domain.org"" rel=""nofollow"">domain.org</a>"" (replace domain with my actual domain), one had ""<a href=""http://mail.domain.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.domain.org</a>"", and the 3rd had a server name without our domain name at all.   At this point I researched the recommended setup with the server provider and found all three methods claimed to be OK, but the preferred was ""<a href=""http://mail.domain.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.domain.org</a>"".  I attempted to edit the server names in TBird but found that cumbersome (use to be simple) and that resulted in a mandatory ""restart"".  Each time resulting in a complaint about the password or ID.  The 140 setup also doesn't allow removing or deleting the ""default"" SMTP, even after all accounts have been deleted.   In attempting to delete the accounts to start over, I found no way to do so....  despite claims in support forums to ""click on the red button"" in the upper right of the account settings page. For grins, I did another update of TBird, and the red delete button became visible!  Removing the accounts, attempting a new account ""automatically"" had mixed results, sometimes the system would suggest a POP server, but IMAP is preferred by me and the ISP. . Editing these settings again resulted in multiple requests for password entry.  More IP blocks resulted.  It appeared to me that attempts at using manual would revert sometime in the process to automatic, with unpleasant results. (To answer your question, the server blocks the IP if there are 5 failed logins within 10 minutes.  A successful login from the IP during the process does not reset the failure counter.) I deleted all the accounts from the PCs, and installed Thunderbird Setup 128.5.2esr that had been used for some time, and was used for some of the installation, manually installed all 3 accounts successfully on both PCs with not one complaint. Today, I noted that 128.5 has been ""updated"" to 140 on my PCs without my permission.  I have no confidence in this new version if subsequent changes to PW, etc., in any of the 3 accounts is needed.  I have never before had a problem using TBird (any version, previously) to setup accounts, automatically or manually.   The ISP confirmed that there are often problems when multiple PCs have the same accounts, and one updates something (like a password) resulting in the other making failed logins resulting in blocked IPs.  The whole purpose of IMAP is to enable one email  account to be shared/accessed across multiple PCs with the info synched. If you want the ISP name, please contact me privately via my email on file. </p>",erikfjer,false,0,0

Changing passwords is more a problem today than it was a decade ago, partly because many email providers now demand that a different password be used when accessing from a PC. That regularly causes posts to the forum by persons who change their password, report no problems when accessing online, and failing when accessing via Thunderbird. And, changing the password for an IMAP account on one PC requires, regardless of email client, that all other PCs accessing the account also change passwords. That isn't thunderbird, it's the email provider looking for the current password which is not on the other PCs. I regret that your PC was updated to 140 unanticipated by you, but the default setting is to automatically update. If you prefer to manually approve, then you need to change the setting. I respect your desire to protect your email provider's domain name, but that is often the key for someone here to offer a solution. We regularly see email providers such as comcast, spectrum, and others - including gmail - where users routinely experience difficulty in setting accounts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have been very pleased with their service, and their management tools etc available to me as the domain's web/email admin. </p><p>What pushed us to Thunderbird a year ago was the mail merge utility.  We do mass emails a few times a month to our members (only 100 or so) with customized content for each member, and were unable to find a suitable, affordable mailer (like mail chimp), so were using Libre Office with its built-in mail merge utility.  Subsequently several receiving domains (icloud, AOL, yahoo, MSN, and related) would reject the spurt of multiple emails from one ip to members of their domain. I would watch the traffic on CPanel's ""track delivery"" tool.  I worked with Ionblade to ensure that our messages were properly classified and evaluated (DKIM, DMARC etc.) but the problem persisted in that the receiving domains when seeing common sender IPs would institute a ""delay response"" and with too many delays, ionblade would cancel the messages to avoid the common IP being flagged as a spammer.  So, ionblade set us up with our own static IP so we weren't getting mixed with other potential bad actors, and TBird's mailmerge plug-in allows a specified delay between each outbound email.  Between our own IP and the transmission delays, we are no longer blacklisted by those domains as a spammer. </p><p>Erik </p>",erikfjer,false,0,0

I might have done it incorrectly. </p><p>But I saw an article last night and tried doing this: No, you cannot simply copy and paste the sbd folder into Thunderbird's Local Folders. To transfer your Local Folders from one computer to another, you must copy the entire Thunderbird profile folder (which contains the sbd files) and place it in the corresponding location on the new computer, then either replace the new profile with the old or use the profile manager to point to the new location. </p><p>Steps to Transfer Local Folders: 1. Find the Profile Folder on the Old Computer: Open Thunderbird and go to Help &gt; More Troubleshooting Information.  Find your Profile Folder and click Open Folder.  Go up the directory tree three levels to find the main Thunderbird folder.  2. Copy the Profile Folder: Copy the entire Thunderbird folder (which contains your profile folder and the profiles.ini file) and paste it to an external drive or a network location.  3. Prepare the New Computer: Install Thunderbird on the new computer.  Close Thunderbird completely.  4. Transfer the Profile Folder to the New Computer: Locate the new Thunderbird profile folder on the new computer (it will be in AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderbird\\Profiles\\ on Windows).  You can then either: Option A (Replace New Profile): Delete the contents of the newly created profile folder and paste the contents of your old profile folder into this new, empty folder.  Option B (Use Profile Manager): Create a new profile on the new computer and set it to use the location where you placed the copied profile folder.  5. Open Thunderbird: Open Thunderbird on the new computer.  If you were prompted to enter passwords, enter them to access your accounts and data. Your Local Folders, and all other data, should now be available.  </p><p>The name of the profile I copied onto my external hard drive is: izpoojy7.default It has a ton of folders and files inside it including folders Mail, IMAPmail </p><p>I tried pasting this entire folder izpoojy7.default in AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Thunderbird&gt;Profiles&gt;izpoojy7.default </p><p>But now when I try launching Thundebird, it says, ""Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded.

From there, you can try restoring your profile from a backup, creating a new profile and linking it to your old profile's folder, or creating a new profile entirely.  </p><p>I somehow got to the default and default release and deleted each.

But then I cliked on Start Thunderbird and instead of immediately getting that error, it opened!!! </p><p>And all of my Thunderbird messages from my old HP Envy which I use daily are now there!!!! </p><p><br> Steps to fix the issue Open the Profile Manager: Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog.  Run the command: Type thunderbird.exe -p and press Enter.  Choose a solution: Restore from backup: If you have a backup of your profile folder, you can create a new profile in the Profile Manager and then use the Choose Folder button to point to your backed-up profile folder.  Link to the profile folder: If you know where your profile folder was moved or renamed, you can select the existing profile in the Profile Manager and then use the Choose Folder button to locate the correct folder.  Create a new profile: If you don't have a backup or cannot find your old profile, create a new profile. This will be a fresh start for Thunderbird, but your old emails and settings will not be transferred unless you manually import them from a previous backup.  Why this happens Moved or renamed folder: . The most common cause is that the profile folder was accidentally moved or renamed.  Corrupted folder: . The profile folder itself might have become corrupted due to an abrupt shutdown or other issues.  Missing profiles.ini file: . Thunderbird relies on the profiles.ini file to find your profiles, and if this file is missing or corrupted, you will receive this error. </p>",FredricJLowe,false,0,0
