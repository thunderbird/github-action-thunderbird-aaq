Da una settimana circa ho dei problemi con il server di Aruba e solo con quello. E' tutto iniziato in un modo strano, quando scaricavo la posta la casella posta in arrivo del server di Aruba mi indicava un numero di mail ancora da leggere superiore a quelle che venivano realmente scaricate. Nei giorni seguenti il divario è aumentato ed in effetti andando sulla webmail di Aruba trovavo mail che non erano state scaricate. Da un paio di giorni da quel server non scarica più niente. Colpa di Thunderbird o di Aruba? Da dove posso incominciare a mettere le mani?
