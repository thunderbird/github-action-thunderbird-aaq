On Win, the folder you're copying/pasting is C:\Users\&lt;useername&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird, and I recommend deleting that folder on the target drive before pasting (vs. overwriting it). </p>",siffemoz,false,1,0

Perhaps you could advise that that server name is.  The images are so microscopic that I can not read them. With the server name I could check the certificate that they send when contacted to look for a clue as to why it is invalid. </p><p>You need to determine why you are being offered an invalid certificate by the server.  </p><p>If it is a hosted domain it may be the certificated is not valid because it has the hosts name on it,  not your domain.   If you have an antivirus scanning incoming mail, it could be that the antivirus is issuing a self signed certificate that is not valid without you undertaking a manual addition of the antivirus vendor as a trusted certifying authority for encryption. </p><p>I suggest you have a look in the error console(ctrl+shift+J) and see what messages appear there at the same time as that dialog appears.  That might shed some additional light as to what the real problem is. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
