Every time that Thunderbird tries to retrieve messages? There are many reasons for connection time-outs. I am no expert on them. One cause is a bad network. How well is your network performing?

In addition, I have made, as many other Thunderbird users did, numerous requests for help and requested fixing these Yahoo Servers/s which provided Mozilla customers poor customers service - everyone could find many reviews and complains at most of the Mozilla Forums in regard to such annoying issues which are not very complex to repair once-for-all! </p><p>- in regard to the issue 'New messages in Thunderbird go to the trash folder instead of the in-box': this is clearly a fault of the Server staff obviously caused by Yahoo because (getting so 'mixed up?!?'), as everyone knows, no Mozilla customers has any access to make any security Server settings on any Server/s ...! </p><p>PROBLEM #2: this question has been partially answered in PROBLEM #1 - in the past (approx 2-3 years ago), Thunderbird users had been given chance by Yahoo to select to log-in to other Email-interface design than Yahoo (like Thunderbird!) which had completely resolved this never-ending issue, however, this possibility has been taken out - and it is absolutely appalling why Yahoo ignored this substantial amount of Thunderbird users who successfully might have used it for their projects for many years! </p><p>PROBLEM #3: Please be more specific as to what do you mean by I quote - 'Do you access this account from any other app, webmail', etc.?: I have another Internet connection with Gmail-Email opportunity to be only used for similar emergency situations (and any communication issues) where I, 'once-in-time' (e.g. last or previous years) have lost Emailing (like messages Receiving, OR Sending, and/or both Receiving &amp; Sending), and some other Contributors has suggested to have such additional possibility. </p><p>- otherwise: I'm using anti-virus software provided with Windows Microsoft defender &amp; Windows Firewall, Malwarebytes security software, and the storing cookies in Thunderbird is enabled.

After numerous restarts for updates it got back to the latest version and worked. In this instance, Outlook and Gmail accounts connect normally. Only the connection to Mailfence stalls. It will not login. Connection History at Mailfence shows a valid connection, but doesn't show from what. I know it's TB , because one connection is DAV, the address book. After reverting to a previous version of TB, uninstalling a Windows update, that happened right before this started, and checking the configuration for Mailfence at least 15 times, I am checking with Mailfence to see if it's on their end. I knew Norton was NEVER the problem, but I humored the arrogant Moderator, and now it's cost Thunderbird a longtime user/donor. Sorry. </p>",larrycrites,false,0,0
