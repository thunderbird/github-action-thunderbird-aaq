I got an email from you (or someone pretending to be you) about losing access to browsing products like Firefox sync, Mozilla Monitor, Firefox Relay, and MDN. </p><p>I am wondering is this a real message or spam?  </p><p>I have been a Mozilla customer since your offices were in the Landmark buildings in Mountain View (now part of Google). I do on occasion use Firefox as a browser, but am not asked for a password, so I assume I'm automatically signed in. However, I use Thunderbird nearly daily as my main email account. I also don't sign in to that because it doesn't ask me to, and this must be how the account is set up (sorry I don't remember exactly; that was a while ago).  </p><p>So if this message is really from you, am I at risk of losing my Thunderbird account? If so, I have a lot of work to do transferring to something else.  </p><p>Thanks for your answer. </p><p>Lora R. Smith </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1719871;,lora.r.smith

I have 3 email accounts On start up it is set to check for emails - it checks account 1, 3 times, accounts 2 &amp; 3 twice each. If i select file - get new messages for.... and choose an account, it will check all accounts when account 1 is selected, some of them multiple times, it will check accounts 1 and 2 when account 2 is selected, and it will check account 3 twice whe account 3 is selected. It successfully retirieves al emails from ll accounts. It has been working correctly (just checks all 3 accounts at startup once each) for years, but just recently, it has assumed this behaviour. Not sure if it is related to a recent update. Any ideas&nbsp;? thank you </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",jandi

Is this new? Is it, in fact caused by Mozilla, as a matter of security? Are there bad actors mucking about? The slow/no response thing is frustrating since I don't have a lot of time to engage in this activity. My internet connection is via GreenLight.  Thanks for any enlightenment.
