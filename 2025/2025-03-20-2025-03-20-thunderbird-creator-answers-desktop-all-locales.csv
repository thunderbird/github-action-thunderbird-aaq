PAM-login for local and ldap users has been setup and is working. Automounting of network drives is working. Each LDAP user has their home directory stored on a Fileserver and mounted upon login. All applications are working as intended except thunderbird. </p><p>So far I've tried to run gnupg locally instead of having it start a session from the (mounted) home directory, assuming that gnupg is the corresponding means of de/encryption. I've copied the profile of the local user to be used as the profile of the LDAP user, logins.json is completely ignored by TB. </p><p>Upon starting of TB, passwords are asked for and are remembered in the session. But passwords/logins are not stored and available for the next session. </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;linux;seg-linux-debian;debian;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",jamestibiriuskirk
