A trial download of around 90 emails appeared to be successful and the messages were moved into a number of TB local folders.  Daily life then overtook the project. Now resuming, it's a bit of a shock to find TB almost completely empty:  no emails, no folders, and no account for the webmail, no accounts at all.  (The only thing there was a handful of collected addresses from a failed attempt some years ago to set TB up as an active client for a different webmail service.)  I thought I exited TB after the trial download before manually deleting the messages on the webmail server but maybe I didn't — if this is significant.  And I don't know what the TB settings for the webmail account were, which it set up automatically, as the account has now vanished.  I should have checked at the time, I realise. Not much to go on but can anyone surmise what happened, what I did wrong? Should I assume that the emails are lost for good?  I did not take a specific TB back up.  There is nothing in the TB profile.  File History was on an hourly schedule at the time but I am unclear what exactly it backs up, or how, and I can't see anything relevant there.  And comments in the forum suggest you can't restore successfully from there anyway. And I'd be very grateful for any advice on how to do this properly so that the emails, etc.,  do not evaporate.

It told me to delete emails for it to be able to compact. It had been set to advise me every time it had more than 10Mb to compact and up till then, it had always compacted successfully. So I deleted 100Mb of emails, yet it still told me that it needed me to delete more emails. The Profile folder was located in its own 10GB partition.  So I checked the partition and found that it had less than 100MB of space left.  So I copied the Profile folder into another 30GB partition and within Thunderbird, I changed the location of the four email local directories by typing the new location address in each of the Server Settings - Message Storage - Local Directory folder.  I very soon noticed that I also had to change the address of the Profiles folder in the Profiles.ini and installs.ini folder.  So I changed that manually.  When I opened Thunderbird it appeared to open without any problems.  My emails appear to be intact.  I haven't noticed any missing or corrupted emails.  The email structure e.g. sub folders, appear to be all there and correct, but it is not asking for the emails to be compacted. Under General Settings, the original setting is still set i.e. inform when more that 10MB and ask every time before compacting.  The old Profiles address is not accessible to Thunderbird any more, although I can still access it and am keeping it as a backup.  When I choose an email folder to compact, nothing happens.  I have tried the Repair Folder dropdown for the main INBOX folder but nothing happened.  I did notice that once all the Profile addresses were changed, Thunderbird automatically started to and completed re-indexing all the folders/files.

The size of the attachment is the same whether it's corrupted or fine. ~Sometimes emails appear with no ""header"" information (Sender, Subject, Date etc) just a pile of garbled characters in the body. ~The RHS day's event view in calendar does not always update to the current date. </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird for over 15 years so my profile folder probably has a few files that may be corrupt or obsolete.  Is there any way to clean out the profile folder of all non required/old files or to ""repair"" it by overwriting some of the files.

Come è possibile, ora, riordinare le Colonne in Thunderbird, quelle dove vi è lo Stato, ad esempio, quindi anche il Pulsante per Scegliere quali Colonne Visualizzare. Sino alla precedente versione, ciò si poteva fare, non agevolmente, usando la Navigazione ad Oggetti di Nvda, oppure con un Addon di Nvda, che ora non funziona più, ma quest'ultimo è un problema dello Sviluppatore del Componente, di cui attenderò Feedbacks. Nel frattempo, ho urgenza di poter riordinare le Colonne, giacchè la voce ""Non letto"" mi viene letta immediatamente prima dell'oggetto, a me interessa avere invece prima l'Oggetto e poi il ""Non letto"", dunque dovrei scambiarle. Inoltre, quando un messaggio è stato letto, viene detto 2 volte dalla sintesi, siccome avevo nelle versioni precedenti, anche lo ""Stato"" attivato.

This is unfortunate, because IT DOESN""T WORK unless you use an admin account.  I have verified this using my admin boot and my laptop which only has an admin account, but my bug report still says after a year and a half this is ""unverified"".  Apparently I will die from something before this gets fixed.

I had them set to share an inbox, by having both accounts, plus the Local account, point to the same Local Directory on the Server Settings Page.  </p><p>Until recently both of these accounts, while having distinct email addresses and distinct outbound mail servers, shared a single incoming mail server. I had it configured on both. </p><p>Normally I have focus set to the Local Inbox. I could use the global Get Messages button and it would fetch my mail.  </p><p>Recently I reconfigured the mail servers. So now each account has its own incoming and outgoing servers. </p><p>Now, when I use the Get Messages button it only downloads from the first account. To explicitly download from the second account I must use the Get Messages popup on that account. Not ideal! After some searching I find that the global Get Messages only accesses the currently active account. But since I typically have the Local account active it must then just use the first non-local account. I want it to do them all. </p><p>I was looking for a solution. a discussion: ""Unify your POP email accounts with a global inbox"".  I also find in Server Settings/Advanced: ""When downloading from this account's server, use the following folder to store new messages / Inbox for different account"".  </p><p>These both seem to accomplish the same thing I'm currently doing differently. Will either or both of these get the effect I'm looking for?  </p><p>I'm concerned about how any such change will affect which filters will be run. I have had separate, but identical, filters defined for each account, and also for the Local Account. (I don't know if the ones on the Local Account ever run.) Not ideal, but its what I got to work at the time I set it up. It would be ideal if I only had to maintain one set of filters. </p><p>I'm reluctant to start experimenting without first having a good idea what will happen because my email is very important to me. </p>",customize;troubleshootingdetailsmissing;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,,pkyzivat,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1418671

We deal with an organization which issues their own S/MIME certificates. For a long time it worked flawlessly - we imported their CA as trusted, imported personal certificates of email recipients and everything worked smooth. Lately they started issuing two different certificates per person - one for signing emails, another for encryption. And now since emails from them come with a signature created with a certificate which has ""Digital Signature"" and ""Non Repudiation"" uses - everything works fine ""inbound"". The problem starts if we want to send encrypted emails back to them. Even if we import the encryption certificates we get (those have only ""Key Encipherment"" usage) and the certificates themselves are valid in any possible way (lifetime, proper CA chain imported and so on), still Thunderbird tells us it can't find proper certificate to encrypt the message. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,,crackmyback,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1419275

I have configured it so that the profile is stored in Documents so that it is backed up at the same time as all other documents. I have a program which compares folders on networked computers and allows the folder files to be sync'd. Again used it for years. I was updated to V102.13.1 (64bit) on all my computers Except one which was an old Samsung Netbook which was 32 bit. I decided to update to V115.0.1 and downloaded the 64 and 32 bit versions, I decided to try the upgrade first on the Netbook as it was the least critical machine without risking my main and backup machines, both 64 bit. I first ensured that the current latest profile was saved and on all 3 machines. The profile saved on a 64 bit machine has always worked on the 32 bit machine. I only use Local Folders for email storage with several sub folders. I upgraded the Netbook to V115 however on opening the program I was unable to see any of my stored emails. I did note however that Thunderbird did download new emails from the server and displayed the number of new emails (urrently 14) but none of the headers were displayed. So I can not rtead any existing emails or unread new emails. I have again checked that the contents size of folders have changed. after doingthe mail update so the messages would seem to be downloaded but not displayed to enable them to be read. </p><p>I am very reluctant to upgrade any of my main 64 bit machines incase I have a sililar problem as I am currently away from home.  </p><p>I am open to any ideas as to the reason for this problem or confirmation that 64 bit Version 102 profiles do not work in V115  32 vit machines. </p><p>Thanks in advance </p><p>Alan </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,,alandiu1943,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1419379

In past year began using Thunderbird for my company email that migrated to Exchange. I have TB 102.13.1 setup to retrieve my company email thru Owl for Exchange plugin. Been using it for while now and all goes good with the exception of filters and tags. I have several filters setup on the inbox to check on incoming messages and every 10 minutes. If an email comes in from a certain sender the filter will tag it a certain color.  I have a total of 3 filters that look for particular  senders to tag different colors. When I first setup it seemed to work as intended. Recently it has stopped to automatically tagging the emails. I can manually tag the email but that kinda defeats the purpose of having the filters. Is there anything I should look for to trace the problem. As I said it worked initially.

The program also seems much faster in opening and more responsive in general, congratulations! </p><p>I found a small bug I think and I would also like to take the opportunity to give some suggestions about the program. </p><p>The bug is with the calendar. When creating an event you can place it in several pre-established categories, each of which had a different color in previous releases. Color which was then also displayed in the box created on the calendar, through a colored line which helps the eye to identify different events. But in 115.0.1 this feature is buggy, all categories have the same color and the colored line is not displayed on created events. </p><p>Suggestions: </p><p>1) Instead of a small colored line it would be useful if the whole box of the event created in the calendar were colored in the chosen colour, it would be more functional for days with many close events and also more aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. </p><p>2) In thunderbird you can customize folder view with various columns. Once the first folder has been customized, you can copy the same setting and apply it to other folders and subfolders, there are two special functions to do this, but there is no way to apply the setting to all folders at once! It would be extremely convenient in all those thunderbirds that have many configured mailboxes. </p><p>3) The date column should never be shortened when resizing thunderbird from full screen to custom size or side view with other programs. All the other columns if resized do not have much impact on the user experience, you often understand the subject even by reading only the first three words, you often understand the correspondent even by looking only at the first 5 letters, but in my opinion the date column should be always fully visible, time included. </p><p>4) Please allow donations in Bitcoin, free software for free software. </p><p>Thanks again for your work, we love you!&nbsp;:) </p>",customize;tb115;tb11501;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,,V.,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1419518

I want my folders, and especially subfolders because that's what most of mine are, sorted to meet my needs. Have we lost that possibility and come to that why doesn't TB have it natively anyway. My use case is, for example, I have a folder called ""Kept"". It has stuff like tickets and booking confirmations that I'll need to hold on to for a few months. I've always had that at the top of the folder tree, not in alphabetical order way down the list. Or in my ""Travel"" folder I similarly to ""Kept"" have tickets and hotel bookings. I want that near the top too, but also, within it I want the subfolders in chronological order of trip. And so on. Alphabetical order is just not as useful to me as the priority or frequency of use for that folder,e.g. most frequently used folders near the top.

The Thunderbird account was installes as POP. </p><p>How the installation got fixed: 1. Just in case, I copied the Mail folder from C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\zkwmmr59.default-release\Mail 2. Uninstalled Thunderbird, rebooted and installed As Administrator (original version was just installed by file Open).  After installation software came up with the POP account, and the original write error. 2. I removed present Gmail account Settings\Account\Settings\Account Actions\Remove Account, and then in Account Actions added MAPI account for Gmail. </p><p>This has resolved the write to folder prohibition issue, doesn't make much sernse, but it works, and software started to download headers, and now continues to download all messages, no issues observed.

1419711,2023-07-30 02:26:12 -0700,2023-08-02 02:01:46 -0700,DELETED THUNDERBIRD APP BY MISTAKE - URGENT (please...),"<p>I use a MacBook Pro v. 10.15.7 (Catalina), and I live in the UK. I am going to upgrade my old MacBook Pro to a MB Air, and my Time Machine has stopped working.  While researching a solution I found that perhaps there was not enough space on my HD to 'create a snapshot'. So in the process of deleting stuff in order to make space, I found lots of 'duplicates' in the Apps Storage section of the HD, I thought it was safe to delete them as the 'originals' would still be there (same date, same size). I now know I have been very ignorant/stupid (my dog died a few weeks ago and my mental health hasn't been the same since.) However, I was very mistaken and seem to have deleted a lot of my working apps, the most important of which being Thunderbird, which gathered my 4 different email accounts. I'm not sure what version I had last, as it has disappeared, but I'm pretty sure it would be the latest version. My latest download is 68.2.2 (20.11.19). So I tried to reinstall it, but came across this notification 'You have launched an older version of Thunderbird... Create new profile, or Quit.' I googled this but being a not-very-techy senior lady, I can't make sense of what I should do, my main concern being not to lose all my settings, my emails saved in folders, as well as being able to receive and send. I am sure I saw some reference in the past of a library which would contain the emails, but don't know what to do about this notification.  The other problem, of course is that I can't completely rely on Time Machine as my last backup is dated 24.7.23. Thank goodness today is a Sunday as there should be less traffic on my email accounts (I am involved with lots of local activities, including being a community journalist). I would be so grateful if someone could help me navigate this minefield and reinstate my app so it works as closely as it did before. Many thanks in advance for your help and patience. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1593885;1594019;1594050;1594089;1594103;1594253;1594335;1594481;,gfinley,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1419711

Ideally, when I want to change the space, e. g. from Mail to Calendar, the currently open tab should be reused. Otherwise I don't get the purpose of the spaces toolbar. If all spaces are opened in a new tab then I can use the tabs to switch between the space and the spaces toolbar gets useless. </p><p>In my opinion it would be nice to have an option to open spaces selected in the spaces toolbar in the current tab.

I am writing to request that you consider developing a web version of Thunderbird, as I believe it would offer many benefits to your users and enhance your competitiveness in the email market. </p><p>Some of the advantages of a web-based email client over a desktop client are: </p><p>- Accessibility: A web-based email client can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, without the need to install any software or configure any settings. This is especially convenient for users who travel frequently, use multiple devices, or work remotely. - Updates: A web-based email client can be updated automatically and frequently, without requiring any user intervention or downloading any files. This ensures that users always have the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches. - Backup: A web-based email client stores all the email data in the cloud, which means that users do not have to worry about losing their messages, contacts, or other information in case of a device failure, theft, or loss. Users can also access their email history from any device, without having to sync or transfer any files. - Customization: A web-based email client can offer more flexibility and options for customization than a desktop client. Users can choose from different themes, layouts, fonts, colors, and add-ons to suit their preferences and needs. Users can also switch between different web browsers and devices without losing their settings or preferences. </p><p>A web-based email client is not only convenient and efficient for users, but also important for the future of email communication. As more and more people use online services and platforms for their personal and professional needs, email is becoming an integral part of the web ecosystem. A web-based email client can integrate seamlessly with other web applications and services, such as calendars, contacts, social media, cloud storage, and productivity tools. This can enhance the user experience and functionality of email, as well as increase the security and privacy of email data. </p><p>Thunderbird is already a great email client that offers many features and benefits to its users. However, by developing a web version of Thunderbird, you can attract more users who prefer or need a web-based email solution. You can also leverage your existing strengths and reputation as an open source project that values user freedom, privacy, and security.

I am not a technical wizz by any means, but have deduced what I think might be the route cause. However I am not sure how to remedy it exactly. Its on Windows 11 22H2, if that helps. </p><p>Here is the situation as I understand it: </p><p>1. Until yesterday both of the apps on the laptop and desktop machines were running version 102.13.0 and working fine. </p><p>2. Last night, the laptop auto upgraded to 102.14.0, this did not happen on the desktop which remains on 102.13.0. Since then, no emails are being received into the laptop, and when I send a test email it goes through but gives me the pop up: </p><p>""Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors."" </p><p>The tests are not in the sent folder as a result. </p><pre>3. To be safe, I have switched off auto updates on the desktop machine to avoid the same thing happening there. </pre> <p>4. I have checked network/firewall settings to the best of my abilities, and the app is allowed on there. </p><p>5. I have checked the Server Settings and everything is as should be. I played with the SMTP and IMAP server settings switching between SSL/TLS and STARTTLS (and back again), to no avail. </p><p>6. I looked for an even later version to see if maybe that would work, and found 115.1.0. So I updated again but still in issue persists. </p><p>7. My next step would be to try and revert it back to 102.13.0. However I am uncomfortable with the thought of uninstalling the app altogether and redownloading the old version. I am also unsure how to do this/where to find that old download. </p><p><br> Help would be very much appreciated! </p><p>Luke </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1594950;1596070;,lukew100,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1420058

Who can I contact to get/build the new libnspr4-0d and libnss3-1d libraries which would allow to continue using TB2 without the need to decrease their parent packages libnspr4 and libnss3 to old versions (mentioned above)? Alternatively, I'm ready to get involved into making fork of TB2, to apply there all the missing improvements, but to allow having the old good interface which I like and would like to continue using. Or maybe there already is such a fork - then please let me know, where to find it and how to contact the responsible Developer/s.

This does send email notifications. But only on Event creation or event changes. This is not what I need. What I need is, for exemple, 1 hour before an event start, send an email message to be automatically sent to a set email address(es).

She used the address and username I verified were in the Exchange server, and upon signing in,  her mail client synced all her messages correctly. However, as expected, her calendar and certificate info was still missing since those don't come from the Exchange server. So, when I close Thunderbird and put  her original profiles back into the AppData\Roaming directory (adding, not replacing the new ones since that also doesn't work) and start Thunderbird, we're back at square one where she's got certificates, calendar events, and addresses, but no emails in the inbox or sent folders. </p><p>Has anyone seen this before? </p><p>P.S.: Sorry there are no photos.

Using V15, I was able to convert many of the old files into usable TB files.  But there are a few thousand that were NOT converted. </p><p>Here are my questions:  </p><p>1.) <strong>using an earlier version of TB</strong> - how do i do this now, since I already have TB running?  The instructions on how to do that are not clear.  Can i load up the V15 version (again) while my current version is still running.

Currently, upon inspecting the local directory, I've noticed the presence of 200 mail files and 200 POP mail files, as indicated in an image. I've already replaced the prefs file with the largest one from before the crash. Additionally, I attempted to import accounts; however, I excluded message import due to the substantial volume (thousands of messages spread across three accounts). While one user was automatically added, I manually added the other account. My primary concern is whether it's possible to rectify the paths for all these files. The situation involves both large folders (approximately 4GB) and smaller ones, all containing a mixture of mail accounts.

It seems like there are two things that could be improved that would allow me to access the Description more easily: </p><p>1. When I mouse hover over an event in the calendar, the description field appears and I can see the zoom link. However, if I move my mouse off the event and over to the zoom link, the pop-up window with the description disappears. If this description pop-up window could stay around when I move over to it (or perhaps if one single-clicks on the event, then this pop-up window could stay around), then one could click on the zoom event.  2. When I double click on an event, I can normally see all the fields of the calendar event. However, when the ""General"" and the ""Attendees"" fields are very long, then the ""Description"" field doesn't fit within the window, and I cannot find a way to scroll down to it. If one were able to scroll on the ""event details"" window, then I would be able to access the ""Details"" field and I could click on my zoom link.  </p><p>If either (or ideally both) of the above issues have a solution, then that would solve my issue with accessing zoom links in the Description of events.
