First, when I start Thunderbird (102.13.0), all accounts appear and work fine (send and received) except the one account I have that uses Exquilla.  That account (using Exquilla) does not appear in my Folders on the left side of Thunderbird.  I learned through hours of desperate fiddling around that if I send an email to that problem account, from another of my email accounts, with Thunderbird open during this process, then Thunderbird will pop up a window showing that I have new mail.  Clicking on that new mail notice causes Thunderbird to instantly update its Folders panel, now showing the Exquilla-related account that was previously not shown in the Folders panel.  My received emails are there, but I cannot send emails through that account (I can send through all other accounts).  When I look at the Error Console on the Exquilla Add-On panel's settings, I see many errors saying, """"invalid value for enumeration writeMode"" and pointing to a few specific lines in ""ewsUtils.jsm"".  See attached image of the error log.  I hope one of the Thunderbird or Exquilla programmers will simply look at their error logs because it seems to point directly to the offending code.  BTW, I wish to add here that I've emailed Exquilla Support twice in the past few months and never received a reply. </p>",dfcurry,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1590114

You want the product changed to to include a button that has never been in the core product. This is simply the wrong place to request such a thing.   This is user support where folk try and explain how to do what you want without the button. The addon developer has seen fit to not release a version of that button in recent years.

I have two Gmail labels in each of the accounts: From Account 1, To Account 1 in one account From Account 2, and to Account 2 in the other.  I use Thunderbird to copy the messages to these folders and then verify that everything is correct in the destination account via Gmail in a browser tab.

The reality is that Gmail is one the biggest email providers on the planet.  No, it's not standard IMAP.  Duh.  It's Gmail.  It's ""email +"".  We all know that, sir.  Gmail was not built for Thunderbird's ""move message from account A to account B"" feature.  It's the other way around, Thunderbird was built to serve all email users, including Gmail users.  But the feature is broken.  It's not moving anything.  It's creating duplicate documents in people's accounts, a true management hell for people who mean it when they choose ""move"" instead of ""copy.""  So don't call it ""move"" if it's not moving for 30% of the world's inboxes.  And please don't tell us we're holding it wrong.  The users shouldn't have to do a special dance just because they use a certain email provider. </p><p>Including a setting specific for Gmail accounts in Thunderbird settings would solve this problem instantly and save a lot of people from a lot of pain.  Thunderbird knows how to delete messages.  This situation is not out of Thunderbird's realm of capabilities.  All that's needed is a simple checkbox option in the Settings (e.g. ""Enable 'True moving' when moving messages from a Gmail account"") and then an 'if this, then that action', according to which ""move"" will mean ""copy, archive, and delete"" when dealing with Gmail accounts. </p><p>There may be simpler, more elegant ways of solving this issue (anything is better than telling users to fuck off).

I would rather live with zero updates for the next 10 years than have to settle for that.  All topped off by the menu bar being lovingly located BELOW the toolbar.  None of this is a case of ""getting used to it"", it's a case of terrible design choices. </p><p>For now I'm blocking all updates and will revisit in 6 months.  With all the hype I was somewhat excited for the new version, and *some* things seemed better, but visually it was more jarring than better. (Icky search bar Ctrl K ""buttons""!!???)  How about all the under the hood changes but keeping the main layout looking the same...gee there's a thought.  I should have looked into it more before upgrading.  I did have to re-do my toolbar buttons as almost all disappeared after the downgrade.  Waiting to see if there's any other issues that pop up from the downgrade.

So long as you choose a custom installation and put it in a folder that's different from the default folder, you can run both 102 and 115 at the same time, and that might be revealing (i.e., if mail goes out faster in 115 than in 102, TB 102 may be at fault; if they are about the same speed, it's not your 102 that's at fault.).

And then to install fresh. The message folders for the POP account could then be copied back to the Local Folders section so that they would not be lost. Let me know if this sounds workable for you. As far as account passwords go, you should be able to get new ones from your email provider. In summary, all is not lost.  (TIP: Your old profile is in the folder at c:\users\&lt;youid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.

I hadn't accessed Thunderbird for months on the laptop prior to this and it wouldn't let me access my mail but insisted I provide the password.  Well, the password is the same for my email, no matter where I try to access it (I have two desktops and the one laptop).  I use a password manager and cut and paste exclusively so there's no possibility of a typo.  It wouldn't accept my password!  Even my desktop accepted my password so I could accept email.  But my laptop, no.  The plot thickens. </p><p>This morning, just for S&amp;G, I restored my settings for the SMTP server to what it was originally on my desktop. It then demanded my password.  Huh?  I entered it from my password manager once again and BOOM! </p><p>The email went through.  Not just my incoming... my previous test message went through as well!  I now can send as well as receive. </p><p>All I can conclude is that Charter/Spectrum had struck again.  When they have a problem, my experience is that they always deny and deflect, sending me off on a wild goose chase for something that ultimately will end up being their problem.  This must have been yet another example.  In any case, it appears to be fixed, and not because of anything you or I tried. </p><p>I can remember a time when Charter had me reboot, then ultimately wanted me to delete my profile and set up another.  Ever since then, I've learned to reboot and go no further on what they say to do... seek help elsewhere! </p><p>I'm sorry I bothered you and I do appreciate your putting the effort in to try to help me.

I will assume you have a typical setup, either a laptop or reasonable size desktop. To get a feel for this, the basic settings are at settings&gt;general .  The default font may appear as 14 or 16 (not sure on this) but, whatever it is, increase it by 2, so that if it had be 14 it will now be 16. Then click the 'advance tab' and set all numbers shown to that number.  Next, look at top of pane and you will likely see 'Latin' or 'Other Writing Systems.' Click the menu and select whatever was the one not shown. On that screen, set the numbers to be IDENTICAL to the other. When done, the Latin pane and the Otherwritingsystems pane should look alike. Now view one of the messages. If the screensize increased, then we're on the right track. If still too small, just repeat the above with a higher number. My text here assumes that it is messages that are small, not everything. If everything, then the approach would be different. Let us know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1591354

I can change the font on an email after it opens but not when in the inbox, and I can't be sure what message I'm opening.  How do I find out how to change the font in the inbox, I'm retired and almost 80 years old and my eyes aren't as good as they used to be.  I live on a fixed income and I haven't donated much money to Mozilla but have continued to use Firefox &amp; Thunderbird even when I couldn't access some location because those locations didn't support it.   I stayed with Mozilla because I wanted to support the efforts of a young startup.    After reading your very helpful reply I can tell you one thing for sure.

I never really got to terms with the issues,  but setting the wav file in the account setting and clicking play makes the issues there clearer.  If the sound file plays there,  then it will work with Thunderbird wwhen it get new mail.  If it does not play at that point,  please prompt again and I will go off looking for exactly what the specifications are,  but I think it is something about bit rates and the file being stereo. </p><p>Then we have the issues with when to play the sound file.  Modern IMAP severs support a feature called IDLE.  This has a sub option for push email.  You will find this setting in the server setting as ""allow immediate notifications when new messages arrive.""  This means that mail is immediately forwarded to your mail client when it is received via the IMAP sync process, I am not completely au fait with the IDLE push notifications, but they do only occur for some folders in most implementations, hence the continuing need for timed checks.   </p><p>Use of Idle is distinct from the timed 10 or 15 minute checks for new mail in the settings line above it and like POP this is the time when new mail sounds apply as the delivery mechanism alerts Thunderbird that there is new mail. So I guess the IMAP sounds will be broken if you allow IDLE,  but your mail will arrive slower if you disable it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1591918

Like lots of people, I keep my data separate from my system and in my case all in Dropbox, so I wanted to do the same for my email folders - to have a synced back up in case of HDD failure.

I even went to the trouble of quoting your use of drop box in the reply.  I would hardly be trying to tell you the current release version was not supported. </p><p>Thunderbird struggles to function without serious issue on a local NAS or a network drive (network saturation), without the added overhead of syncing.  Total corruption of the profile is the most likely long term result of using cloud services as they are an order of magnitude slower that local network resources.   </p><p>Use of streamed backups on the Thunderbird profile is also not supported as Thunderbird just does not have the modern file locking and caching abilities to cope with any other software messing in it's profile while it is running.  Likewise you will find this forum full of suggestions to folk to disable on access scanning in internet security suites/Antivirus programs to prevent issues with data integrity. </p><p>The issue you are currently seeing will be the surface of an iceberg of data corruption, duplication and other, til now, hidden issues.  I have seen these smart synced profiles make multiple copies of the storage files (Often copies that are never referenced again)  Search the web of those folk with hundreds of prefs.js files complaining that Thunderbird does not save their changes.  Or those complaining that they have issues with the same mail being downloaded over and over (pop accounts) or even those that appear to have lost the mail in a folder because it is corrupted. </p><p>It used to be that antivirus programs were the greatest source of data corruption.  Personally I am thinking that the cottage industry in synced profiles is fast catching up.  Thunderbird sync can not come soon enough,  but like profile import it will probably be unable to sync password, making it largely useless. </p><p>You might want to have a look at how many redundant pref.js files you have in your profile.  My guess is many,  each with a number to make it unique, created when your sync created a contention issue.  The copies are never referenced because Thunderbird is hard coded to use only the prefs.js file, but the data is saved. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1592241

There is no good answer ever for 'Why?, as the response may well be ""because it doesn't do that (yet).'

It's wicked fast now. But it was a lot of work.  I created some shortcuts to the Profile Manager, the NEW Profile as well as the OLD Profile, so I could still access my old stuff as I used the new, empty Profile.

Like Renaming  ""Personal"" to ""Personal072023"".   </p><p>My theory behind it is some folders with all the attachments get flagged to consolidate, so if you clean them out, or rename and replace it will stop Thunderbird from flagging them, and because the Re-Named folders are no longer very active, it's less likely Thunderbird will see THOSE as an issue.  </p><p>Just a Theory.... </p><p>But, Me making a 2nd Profile and still having access to the OLD one has been great.

I have always thought that this step did a few simple things:   1)  verify that the address does not already exist and post a message if it does 2)  send the information to the named domain's email server and - possibly - validate that the referenced domain has an account with that name set up If unsuccessful in any particular a message is returned.  Is this what actually happens? Is the password used at all in this step? </p><p>After passing those validations, the next step is to choose mail protocols for inbound and outbound mail and connection validations for port numbers and security protocols.  After making those choices and clicking the Done icon, there is a further verification process.  During this process a message stating that the password is being validated is flashed.  I have always thought that in this step a message is sent to the named domain's server where the domain's software checks and validates the port number and security settings and the password and returns a message indicating success or failure which Thunderbird then interprets and displays an appropriate message.   </p><p>Is this what actually happens or do I need an education? </p><p>I keep getting an error at this step.  FWIW, I choose to use POP3 and accept the suggested port numbers and security options.  I've looked up Fastmail's settings information and found the suggested values to be those that Fastmail publishes. </p><p>Here, I think, is the rub.  From responses from Fastmail support, I think there are only ever 2 passwords used by Fastmail regardless of how many user email addresses are setup in Fastmail.  There is what they call an 'app password' which must be set up to allow Thunderbird to access Fastmail, and there is a single password that is set up with the mail Fastmail account/user email.  This second password is the only one Fastmail checks when processing email messages.  <strong>It is quite possible that I do not understand this correctly.</strong> </p><p>In any case, if my understanding as stated above is correct, then the question becomes, ""What password should be used when setting up Fastmail domain email addresses in Thunderbird?"" </p><p>I have tried using the app password without success.  I have tried using the 'master' email password without success.  I've tried using a password generated by Roboform without success, although this doesn't surprise me in the context of my understanding of the process because I cannot set up separate passwords for separate Fastmail email user addresses. </p><p>In every case I get the error message shown in the attached screenshot, regardless of password used.  The message doesn't say specifically that the error was a password validation failure or that the settings are wrong. </p><p>Finally, I CAN and HAVE successfully an account in Thunderbird for my Fastmail Account/User email address.  This addy works, as best I can tell. I would greatly appreciate someone correcting my misunderstanding or adding more insight into the process. </p>",rabbithutch1,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1592216

To salvage that sbd folder, you can try this:  - exit thunderbird - locate your local folders folder in the profile.

If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.    -&gt; Repeat the above for every account.   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

I could and did roll back to a previous version. 2 years ago they stopped allowing you to do that. And began to warn . That if you attempted it they wouldn’t take responsibility if you lost your data (Emails) folders . This is very sad. This should not be happening. I could delete Outlook and reinstall any version I want to.There are at least 5 since 2007. Not Tbird. Open source has its drawbacks. No one at Tbird will take responsibility for the program. All their community resources care about is that any questions or comments are Not “ offensive.” What do they think happens to someone’s frustration level when they confront a problem like I’m having . I prefer a standalone email program that works. For years there are only 2 good ones. Outlook and Tbird. All the rest are web based.

But you do not mention what screen resolution you are using in each of these screens. </p><p>All of Thunderbird uses pixels as a size for font etc.  So when you choose to open Thunderbird in a screen with a completely different pixel size ratio, some sections can appear smaller/larger depending upon the screen resolution. </p><p>The images shows the Folder Pane is showing much smaller font size in the 21:9 screen, so I'm assuming there maybe a difference in the actual pixel size.  Maybe the pixel size is much smaller on the  21:9 screen thus allowing more pixels per inch/centimeter.  Advise - If you get the screen resolution much closer to using similar pixel size then it should improve. </p><p>However, I notice you are using Vertical View and Card View. It looks like you are also using Max window. This means the left side of window is auto expanded to fit width of screen. You can see this effect if you move the left side of window to the left to reduce width. </p><p>Suggest you try not maximising window.  Try:  use the restore down option and then drag window to fit full height and almost - say 90% of the width of window. This should set number of pixels window width as opposed to max whatever pixels are available. But you are not going to get a perfect result because of the resolution - hence why I suggest you try to get a more closer screen resolution size and do not use max window. </p><p>I'd be interested to know what screen resolutions you are using on each screen and whether modifying improved the situation.

I had been moving to the junk folder for each address and that seemed to be extra work, so I though moving them all to that one file under Local would work best.

Don't filter on address is!  it sounds like is is exact and just what you want,  but it rarely is. </p><p>Email from this forum comes from the address no-reply@support.mozilla.org but the from header of the emails actually contains From: Mozilla Support Forum &lt;no-reply@support.mozilla.org&gt;  So from is no-reply@support.mozilla.org is not a match,  because there is more there than the filter contains.  Likewise,  I get mail from various groups that use the same sending address for the entire list,  but substitute individual people names before the email address (display name) so the mail ""looks"" like it comes from that individual instead of the list. </p><p>Using contains as the criteria neatly side steps this and works to deliver what you want.  It also means that is the sender uses say <a href=""http://ebay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.com</a>, <a href=""http://ebay.us"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.us</a>, <a href=""http://ebay.za"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.za</a> in their mails you can drop the last bit of the address and it will still be included by the filter. </p><p>Next is the fact that if you move an email,  it is no longer there for the filter to act on.  So if the same email is ""valid"" for two filters and the first moves it,  the second will not even see it. </p> <blockquote> I have been marking as Junk on some messages for years now. When does TB ever send those directly to the Junk file? </blockquote> <p>Lets again back up to the fundamentals.   Thunderbird ignores the from address in determining if an email is ""spammy"" and in marking mail as junk.  Always has and probably always will. Something that is probably missing from the relevant article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#</a>  A much older,  but also more detailed discussion on the junk filtering can be found here <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls</a> Thunderbird will not mark a message for someone in your selected address books in account settings as Junk/SPAM.  This can be an issue if the address book is selected in account settings and you are using it in your spam filters.  One thing fights the other. </p><p>Blocking an individual is beyond the scope of junk filtering. It is not looking at the content of the email to determine if it might be spam, just at who sent it.  So this part is best done using filters.  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender#</a> </p><p>Just be aware that it is probably better to not hand out your email address than it is to do a lot of filtering to block the unwelcome mail signing up for things generates. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1593707

They have used a contracted service with yahoo for probably the last 10 years and it has at best been a dogs breakfast.  Special passwords and odd setting to get yahoo to work with the ATT email. </p><p>There are many mail providers out there.  Google is not the only one.  Personally I have a weakness for GMX,  because the parent company is based in Germany and must use German privacy laws,  they don't retain much information about you at all.  Where as the US folk do their utmost to retain everything about you they can. but that list is far from complete.  Try googling free email providers on google,  they list close to 30. </p><p>Now we get to the real issue.  I assume your mail is currently downloaded as POP,  as IMAP mail will not survive the closure of the mail account on the server. </p><p>You worry about ""Merging"" stuff.   </p><p>I can not speak for Eudora,  but unless you have already imported that mail to Thunderbird it is about lost.  Eudora is not able to run on some of the more recent operating systems so I would suggest you import that mail before you actually loose it.  Eudora stores mail in a proprietary format so with no Eudora reading it becomes a real problem. </p><p>Next you talk about adding a gmail account to your existing profile like as if data is all going to be merged together.  That can be the case if you choose to use POP and a global inbox,  but simply selecting not to use a global inbox for the account will have the account added to the folder pane as it's own entry and having it's own inbox and associated folders.  Personally I use the global inbox, and Thunderbird reports it as being almost 7 and a half GB in size.  That is not the profile,  just the inbox.  The profile is over 50.  I have some 25 accounts,  mostly mail accounts registered in Thunderbird and I am starting to see cracks,  but data loss is a long way off I think.  I do however make a manual backup of the profile every couple of months, so loosing historical stuff is not really an issue and the google and outlook account retain copies of all mail in the past couple of years anyway. </p><p>Yes you can add the account to Thunderbird. Yes you can ""merge"" it is you want. I would suggest against it really.   </p><p>What you need to be sure of is your use of POP mail as that makes immutable local copies.  IMAP does not, even though it's downloading of whole folder structures and their contents is very handy,  it is only as good as the server it connects to. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1593714

Here is an abridged version: I use a MacBook Pro 9.2 (2012), v. 10.15.7 (Catalina). I have mistakenly deleted my Thunderbird app. I’m not sure what version I had last, probably the latest version.  I have a download 68.2.2 which I tried to reinstall, but this notification appeared '<strong>You have launched an older version of Thunderbird... Create new profile, or Quit.'</strong> I don’t know what I should do, my main concern being not to lose all my settings, my emails saved in folders, as well as being able to receive and send.  The Library shows T’bird, including Profile but I’m not sure it is the full working profile as it was modified yesterday morning. The last full profile backup I have saved is dated 2023.06.22.

Starting Thunderbird minimized with a Flatpak command is a bit tricky, but there's a workaround you can try. Unfortunately, there isn't a direct flag for this in the command.

If you have backups, you can replace the affected folders with those backups. Alternatively, if you use an email provider that supports IMAP, your emails might still be on the server.

When you hit that send button and the screen goes white, it's likely the connection to the outgoing server is timing out.

Even if the link doesn't show up as in the illustrations, you can find it by going to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Outgoing Server (SMTP). Check that your server settings match what your provider recommends. Also, make sure there are no antivirus or firewall settings causing conflicts.

If you want to know which email a person opened and what they did with it then you are monitoring that person and all their activities. You may not want to know what people are doing all the time and perhaps would not be checking all the time. But as you have no idea when something occurs, it means you still need to monitor everything just in case. </p><p>Using imap accounts the actions are updated to server, so all computers accessing that email address will get updated within a short time frame. They all show same data. So you talking about getting the data before that occurs in fact you want to know specifically when it occurs. </p><p>So you are looking for what user logon id on what computer (IP) starting Thunderbird logging into which profile and viewing what account and selecting which email and whether they changed it's status and what action if any occurred and what timestamp. In effect you would need to monitor the desktop and keystrokes etc. </p><p>This is way beyond anything which can just be done within Thunderbird which operates on a per installation using a designated profile.   The link david gave you is an example of the type of software you are looking for. </p><p>Otherwise, I can think of a few alternative methods you may want ot consider: Assign specific emails to specific people, so you know who is responsible for dealing with those emails. You need someone to have first access to mail and they assign people to specific emails by setting a 'Tag'. eg: Employee called Bob is assigned a Tag called 'Bob' and they deal with all emails with the 'Bob' tag. You would need to make sure all Tags are set up on each computer in order for everyone to see the tags.  However, this still does not stop people accessing email with wrong tag because they still technically can see everything. </p><p>Another method:  set up a filter on server which sends a copy of emails into separate email addresses and each employee has access to a specific email address and is set a password. So in effect they do not get full access to everything.  Only the top admin has access to all mail and all passwords and they set up filters or manually move mail to various email addresses/accounts to manage workloads.  If an email goes missing erroneously, you would still have main copy in main receiving account and you would also know who was dealing with that email. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1595686

No worries, we'll get this sorted out. The numbers in the grouped list titles might be a bit wonky due to some underlying issues. And as for the ""Today"" turning into ""Old mail"" – that sounds like a quirky bug too. To address this, let's try a couple of steps. First, make sure you're on the latest version of Thunderbird. If you are, try restarting Thunderbird or even your computer. If the issue persists, you might want to consider repairing your Thunderbird profile. Go to ""Help"" &gt; ""Troubleshooting Information"" &gt; ""Open Folder"" to find your profile. Rename the file named ""places.sqlite"" to ""placesOLD.sqlite"" and then restart Thunderbird. This often clears up odd display issues. If you're comfortable with it, you can also try creating a new profile to see if the problem persists there. Give these steps a shot, and hopefully, your Thunderbird will be back to smooth sailing. If not, come on back, and we'll dive deeper into solving this for you! </p>",suram080,false,0,1,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1595880

It sounds like you're trying to figure out how to automatically update or move Filters after moving Folders from one email account to a new email account in Thunderbird. While it might seem like moving Folders would also move Filters and update the rules, it doesn't work that way. What you can do is manually update your Filters to reflect the changes. In Thunderbird, open up the Filters menu, locate the Filters associated with those moved Folders, and adjust them to point to the new location. Unfortunately, there isn't an automatic update feature for this. Once you've updated the Filters, they should work smoothly with the new email account and Folders.

Then, try creating a new profile in Thunderbird and add your O365 account again. Sometimes profiles can get corrupted. Also, double-check your O365 server settings, as they might need an update. Lastly, if you're using two-factor authentication for your O365 account, generate an ""App Password"" from your O365 account settings and use that in Thunderbird.

Even though you haven't changed anything, sometimes these things happen. Let's try a simple fix first. Go to Thunderbird's menu, then click on ""Offline Mode"" to turn it off. If that doesn't work, try restarting Thunderbird. If the problem persists, you might want to check your email account settings. Make sure the server configurations are correct and that your email account is set up properly. If you're still facing issues, you could try removing and re-adding your email account in Thunderbird. Also, check if there are any updates for Thunderbird and your antivirus software. Sometimes updates can fix compatibility problems.

Succinctly states, it failed once again.  I followed your instructions; was able to copy the ...\Thunderbird folder from the 7 PC to an 8GB drive.  When I got to the 10 PC, I could not find the folder tree .... doing a Explorer search I found it. I copied the thumb drive to the ...\Thunderbird folder. It is about 5.5GB ... did it in less than 10 mins.  Then, I opened Thunderbird on the 10.  The first screen that appeared was the Google 'Gmail' screen, showing my main e-mail address.  When I typed in my password, I kept getting an error message.  Certainly I know my password.  Also, since I have 4 different e-mail identities, on the Win 7 PC, they all appear on the left column of Thunderbird.  On the 10 PC, only my main e-mail identity appears.  So, it's obvious that the copying of the files has not completed properly, and now I still can't gain access to my e-mails on the 10 PC, since Google/Gmail is interfering with this connection. </pre> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++ Also, since I'm still using the Win 7 PC, when I attempted to open this THUNDERBIRD help session, I clicked on the directive, ""This does not solve my problem"", to which it opened FIREFOX.  When FIREFOX fully loaded, it started to open this MOZILLA Support page, but then I got the (very frequent error message, ""GAH!, Your Tab just crashed"".  I pressed the restore button and the error message reappeared at least 4 times.  So, in desperation, I chose the other option, close. Then went back to the original page, ""This does not solve my problem"", clicked on this sentence and FIREFOX reloaded, and now I was able to enter this reply and additional comments. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ </p><pre> Finally, it seems that the folder where Thunderbird is residing is in a hidden folder tree.  On my version of Win 10, there doesn't seem to be any direct access to the c:\users\&lt;ownerid&gt;\appdata\roaming\ .....  I had to type in this chain into the Explorer window to access it.  So, this was a frustration in itself .... I know it's NOT your problem, but I just wanted to mention it.  The inner workings of WINDOWS is a BIG enigma to me, and has been since 1984, when it was first released!!!!  At this point, I don't know how to solve this file transfer problem, since other local technical people that I've talked to about this situation have told me that they can't help, and have suggested that using Thunderbird is NOT a wise choice, which bothers me since according to other sources, Thunderbird IS THE MOST POPULAR e-mail software in circulation.  So, this must be some personal negative bias, but it still doesn't solve my problems. </pre> <p>THANK YOU. k.t. P.S.

It sounds like there might be a synchronization issue causing your emails to be deleted when you open them. If you're using IMAP for your Gmail accounts, there could be a syncing problem between Thunderbird and the Gmail server. It's essential to ensure your emails are still present on the Gmail server before trying to fix Thunderbird. To address this, you might want to reach out to Gmail support for assistance. Additionally, consider checking if Thunderbird is up to date and if any add-ons are causing conflicts. Always make sure to back up your important emails before attempting any fixes. </p>",suram080,false,0,1,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1596155

If attachments are causing trouble, it might be a compatibility issue or a size limit problem. You can try asking your customer to send attachments in a different format or smaller sizes.

Search for ""layout.css.devPixelsPerPx"" and set it to a smaller value, like ""1.0"" or ""0.9"", depending on your preference.

This processing could be related to server-side operations or configurations. In Thunderbird, such messages usually indicate that the mail server is performing some tasks on your account before it can deliver the messages to your client. This can sometimes take time, especially if there's a backlog of emails. To resolve this, I'd recommend trying a few steps. First, ensure that your Thunderbird is updated to the latest version. Then, check your email account's settings, especially the server settings. If the issue persists, you might want to consider contacting Comcast's support to inquire about any ongoing server-side maintenance or issues. Additionally, you can try accessing your email through Comcast's webmail to see if the issue is Thunderbird-specific. Lastly, you might need to be patient and let the server processing complete, especially if there's a large amount of mail to process. It's frustrating, but sometimes these situations can take a bit of time.

In the profile folder, look for ""abook.mab"" for your Address Books and ""prefs.js"" for your email settings. You might need to replace these files with your backups if you have them.

The change in meeting time after accepting the invite could be due to a time zone conversion problem. To fix this, let's try a couple of things. First, ensure that both your Thunderbird and Windows 10 time zone settings are accurate and match your Europe/Prague time zone. Also, check if the sender's time zone settings are correct. If the problem persists, you might want to check if any add-ons or extensions in Thunderbird are affecting time zone settings. You can try disabling them temporarily to see if it makes a difference.

It's possible that the update might have caused some temporary syncing issues. To try and retrieve your missing email, you can go to the ""View"" menu, select ""Folders,"" and then click on ""All."" This should show you all your email folders, including any that might not be currently visible. If you still can't find the missing email, you might want to check your email provider's webmail interface to ensure the email is there. Sometimes, a re-indexing of Thunderbird's mailbox might also help.

No worries, we'll get it sorted out for you! It looks like the button isn't responding as expected when you first open Thunderbird, but it starts working after you delete a row using your keyboard's delete key. To fix this, you might want to try a simple workaround. Go ahead and try clicking on any other message or row first (you can use your mouse), and then click the ""Delete Current Row"" button. This might help to 'wake up' the button and get it working consistently. Give it a shot, and hopefully, that'll do the trick for you.

I understand the convenience of having a dynamic refresh for folders. Unfortunately, Thunderbird doesn't offer an automatic refresh feature for folder views like you're describing. However, you can manually achieve a refresh by pressing the 'F5' key or right-clicking on the folder and selecting 'Mark Folder Read' and then 'Mark Folder Unread'. While this isn't as automatic as you'd prefer, it's a simple way to update the view to display unread folders.

You say they are apparently somewhat coy about price, this may be because they really have not yet developed the product they want to sell you in a years time. However,  Thunderbird can not replace your server as you suggest. </p><p>Thunderbird is a mail client,  so will not act as a server,  nor does the project provide an email address directly for those seeking one.  There are commercial arrangements in place where you can get an email address via mailfence or ghandi but it will cost you.  That is not necessary in my personal opinion for the average person. Free mail accounts work well except for those in business,  and even then I still get invoices from Gmail accounts. </p><p>As a general mail user, which I am guessing you are.  You are probably going to the best served by one of the free mail providers or really a couple of providers, as you have to have a password recovery email address for most of them.  The obvious choices for Australians are <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, Gmail and Yahoo because they have heard of them.  Personally I have all three along with GMX and AOL, all of them deliver what they say they will.  But I like to include GMX in the mix because unlike the US based providers. I like their privacy statement.  GMX is a subsidiary of a German company and as such is subject to German privacy laws,  some of the most strict in the world. But as I found out today you have to hold the alt key when you select to create an account with them or the pop up blocker in the browser makes a mess of the process.  I do suggest you look at them as a provider.  Not so popular in Australia,  but in Europe they are fairly well known. </p><p>In you migration you will have to consider a couple of things;   </p> <ul><li> If you existing account is configured as IMAP you will need to export any mail you wish to save as once the account goes dark with the provider the mail will be lost as it is synchronized to the mail server.  If your account is POP then that is not a consideration. </li><li> If you want your correspondents to know of your changed address,  you will need to tell them.  But do not fall foul of the SPAM laws about unauthorized contacts. <a href=""https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam</a>  Remember that using CC sends the email addresses to everyone on the mail.

The missing scrollbar in the tags menu can be a bit frustrating when you have a bunch of tags. Unfortunately, Thunderbird doesn't have a built-in scroll feature for the tags menu, but there's a workaround you can try. You can use your keyboard to navigate the tags quickly. Just press the first letter of the tag you're looking for, and it should jump to the tags starting with that letter. Also, make sure your Thunderbird is up to date, as sometimes updates bring improvements. I hope this helps you manage your tagged emails more efficiently. </p>",suram080,false,0,2,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1595602

Migrating your Thunderbird profile can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got you covered! Instead of using the export/import method, try these steps: First, copy your profile to the flatpak profile directory, usually located at $HOME/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/cache/thunderbird/. Then, launch Thunderbird using the -P option to create a new profile and specify the path of your copied profile. Remember, you might encounter some old messages popping up – those 1970 ones – but don't fret, it's just Thunderbird catching up. If you run into any issues, you can always clean up your old profile data manually. </p>",suram080,false,2,1,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1595599

It seems like during the transition from POP to IMAP, moving your emails didn't go as planned. While I'm not sure about your specific situation, it's possible that the dragging process might have caused some issues. However, don't worry just yet! Your emails might not be completely gone. One thing you could try is to check the ""Local Folders"" section in Thunderbird. Sometimes, when you drag emails around, they end up there. If you don't see them there either, it's worth checking if you have any backups, perhaps on an external drive or a cloud storage. In the future, to avoid such situations, it's a good practice to back up your important data regularly.

You're definitely not alone in facing this issue. The good news is that there's a way to get it back on track. Try resetting Thunderbird's preferences for composing messages. Go to ""Options"" or ""Preferences"" (depending on your version), then ""Composition"" or ""Composition &amp; Addressing,"" and finally ""General."" There, you'll find a ""Compose messages in HTML format"" option. Toggle it off and then on again. This can often help fix glitches like this.

While Thunderbird doesn't directly support importing .wab files, you're right that converting to .csv might lead to losing the organization. What you can try is to use a two-step approach. First, convert your .wab file to a .csv file (I know, it's not perfect). Then, before importing into Thunderbird, organize your .csv contacts into folders that mirror your old structure. This should help maintain some of the organization. When importing into Thunderbird, make sure to choose the option to import into the system address book, and those folders you created should be preserved. It's not seamless, but it should keep your structure intact. Good luck, and let me know if you need more guidance! </p>",suram080,false,0,2,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1595861

For the IMAP account error, make sure you've entered the correct credentials and server settings. Also, double-check your internet connection.

You can try removing and re-adding your email account in Thunderbird, making sure to double-check the server settings and ensuring that your account is properly configured.

In Thunderbird version 102 with Lightning Calendar, setting up email reminders can be a bit tricky. Currently, Lightning offers only the ""Show an alert"" option, not the ""Send an email message"" one you're looking for. Unfortunately, Thunderbird 102 might not support sending email alerts directly. You're right, in a previous version, there was an ""Send an email message"" option. I suggest checking if future Thunderbird versions might bring this feature back. For now, the Attendees list might help with email notifications, but I understand you're looking for something specific like a 1-hour-before reminder. Hopefully, Thunderbird's development team will consider bringing back this email alert option in the future. </p>",suram080,false,1,2,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1596134

Don't worry, we can definitely help you sort this out. To address the issues you're facing, let's try a couple of steps. First, let's deal with the cookies and security error – make sure your browser settings allow cookies and try disabling any security add-ons that might interfere. Now, for the missing emails, it seems there might be a hiccup with your profile. You can try creating a new profile and see if that helps. If you want to import your old emails, it's best to do it manually – copy the email files from your old profile's Mail folder to the new one. Also, the 'prefs.js' error could be due to a corrupted file, so creating a new profile should also address this.

Currently Thunderbird is not updating to the new supernova, so if you got a mention of an update to Supernova it means you have some Update Software running on your computer and it located that particular version. </p><p>You say ""very cramped text viewing area display"". I'm presuming you are talking about the 'Message Pane' - the area which shows the content of a selected open email. </p><p>I'm not seeing any difference so this has to be due to some settings which may have been set up by default. </p><p>The new supernova design offers two ways of viewing the 'Message List' otherwise known as the 'Thread Pane'. One is 'Table View' (old method as used in 102*) and the other is 'Card View' which is new. At this point you have not mentioned which one you are using. You will see a new header toolbar above the Message List. It contains the name of the folder and number of messages. On the right will be the 'Quick Filter' button and a new icon - that new icon allows you to choose 'Table View' or 'Card View'. </p><p>If you are using 'Card View' then each email in the list will use more vertical space. So to see more of the list you end up with less height for the Message Pane. Note you can still  drag the splitter upwards to reveal more of the Message Pane, but then you have a very short Message List. The 'Card View' is really designed to be used when using 'View' &gt; 'Layout &gt; 'Vertical View'. This means you see a lot more emails in the Card View list and get a full length Message Pane.  Perfectly ideal for people with wide screens. </p><p>If you prefer the old method as used in version 102*, then you need to use 'Table View'. This means you can raise the Message Pane height and still see more of the list of emails. The 'View' &gt; 'Layout' &gt; 'Classic View' works best when using 'Table View'. </p><p>As in 102*, you can also control the Density - space between items in lists such as 'Folder Pane' ,'Message List' and Menus.  Menu app icon &gt; Density &gt; three options available. This is also available on the Menu Bar under 'View'.

I spotted 'Thunderbird font-size of composed messages tiny...' under 'See also' on the right hand side of this page. I made the 'Latin' and 'Other Writing Systems' settings the same and now the font-size is fine. Strangely, increasing the setting 'Latin' &gt; 'proportional' &gt; 'size' from '14' to '17' did the trick. I expected the optimum size to be '14' because 14pt usually appears large enough. I guess that parameter is using different units. Either TB installed itself with the wrong settings or it ignores the knock-on effect of having different font-sizes under 'Latin' and 'Other Writing System' but, as you say, they should be identical. I've never had this problem before after updating TB. It looks like the developers have introduced a configuration error and this should be put right and a new minor update issued immediately. </p>",dev45,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1596419

I did a folder transfer from this Win 7 PC of the 'thunderbird' folder in appdata\roaming to my thumb drive again this morning.  Then went to the Win 10 PC, and reversed the process.  When I opened (the latest downloaded version of) Thunderbird, ALL of my 4 accounts appeared in tact and from what I can tell, fully complete with ALL the stored e-mails.  So, for whatever magical reason, this time the transfer process seems to have worked. </pre> <p>But, there is one caveat.  I tried to open &amp; make THIS reply using Thunderbird on the Win 10 PC instead of the Win 7 PC, but it failed.  While I DID NOT get the Gmail window that I've discussed with you in the past, I did get the FIREFOX account screen.  OK!.  I typed in my main e-mail address, the one that you recognize, and when the screen updated, asking for my password, I entered it as I have it on paper.  I tried several times, but kept getting the 'wrong password' message.  After several attempts, the system times out ... I had to wait 15 minutes.  I will try again in a short while, but it seems that for the most part, THUNDERBIRD is working properly on the Win 10 PC.  So, I would say that we can close this thread.

Second, I opened Account Settings and Settings on this WIN 7 PC, jotted down all the particular settings.  Everyone for all 4 e-mail addresses is exactly the same, EXCEPT for the actual e-mail address &amp; the name assigned to the accounts.  They are all OAuth2, all 995, all SSL/TLS, all SMTP port 465.  Then I went to the WIN 10 PC, and opened the Settings and Account Settings.  All these settings are IDENTICAL to the list I made from the 7 PC. </pre> <p>So, thinking that there may be a file corruption somewhere in the Thunderbird folder, I went to CCLEANER, used their 'Uninstall' utility, and uninstalled Thunderbird.  Then I opened FIREFOX, got the link for THUNDERBIRD download and processed it to completion. I opened THUNDERBIRD, immediately got the Google sign-in screen overlaying the Thunderbird page.  My kombi17m showed in their box.  Again I typed in the password, as I have done numerous times before, and the screen changed to a Google alert notice that Thunderbird was attempting to access my Gmail account. I clicked OK, and the Thunderbird 'home' page showed. </p><pre> However, despite this seeming to be normal, I noticed in the left side column, now I have TWO incidences of the 17mkombi address, so this is one more aggravation.  I found no place in the Settings or Account Settings where I can delete one of these.  Furthermore, my other 3 e-mail addresses are not showing.  As a final test/check, I opened the Settings &amp; Account Settings for the 17mkombi on the Win 10 PC for the purpose of checking and comparing the connection settings with my list.  All of them are exactly identical to the list I made from the 7 PC.    So, while the issue with the connection seems to be magically solved, the only remaining problem seems to be WHY the other 3 accounts are not showing properly.  I believe I have it written down someplace the U.S. mailing address for MOZILLA.  After all of these exchanges over a period of several months, it's time for me to send a check in thanks for the assistance. </pre> <p>This is the right thing to do. THANK YOU!!!! k.t. P.S.  I didn't try to make screen copies to send to you since these exchanges are being done on the WIN 7 PC, and I would have to do a screen shot on the 10, then save the file, put it on a thumb drive, bring it here, and attach it to one of these exchanges.  VERY laborious in my opinion. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1596705

I'm in a suburb of Tampa, FL; you're located somewhere else far from here. I understand this.  Despite my long career in computer technology &amp; programming, WINDOWS has always been an enigma to me ever since MICROSOFT flooded the PC market with free copies of Windows 3.1 back in the early 1980s.  OK, so all this aside, please also understand a couple other basic points.  On this WIN 7 PC, I have NO problems automatically opening my 4 e-mail accounts WITHOUT having to enter any passwords while using  </pre> <p>T-BIRD (102. ....).  I can also go directly to the Google/Gmail software (through FIREFOX) to clear out the Sent e-mails, since on some of my four addresses, they are not automatically deleted, and so I do this manually.  WHY this is the case, I have no idea ... all my addresses were set up as POP3 accounts, and according to the setup data, all of them have exactly the same SMTP in &amp; out settings. </p><pre> When I downloaded THUNDERBIRD onto the WIN 10 PC, I went to the address setup screen, and entered all the data exactly as it appears for the 17mkombi address as it appeared in the WIN 7 setup.  I did exactly what you suggested several e-mails ago ... I COPY the Thunderbird folder on this WIN 7 PC to a thumb drive (it is about 5 GB size), and then I COPY the file on the thumb drive to the THUNDERBIRD folder on the WIN 10 PC.  While I do not fully understand all these protocol acronyms, I will write down your most recent instructions, go to the WIN 10 PC, and validate that the date present there is EXACTLY what you have defined above.  I assume that when you ask for screen shots, you're speaking about the existing ones that are here on the WIN 7 PC, or mot?  You might have to explain this more clearly. </pre> <p>THANK YOU. k.t. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1596669

Our prior problem was in having one problem to focus on. You mention having multiple accounts, but only one shows. And you mention that Google prompts for a password and says it is incorrect. I think you indicated four accounts?  </p><p>First, please review and confirm that there are an equal number of SMTP servers for each account and that each account's SMTP server is unique (both using same email id). The authorization code must be OAUTH2 for both. Connection security should be SSL/TLS for both. Incoming port 993 and SMTP port 465. Second, please post a screenshot of the incoming server setup and the SMTP server setup of the account that is giving password problem. We don't need to see the email address, so long as you are using the full address (e.g., karl@gmail.com, not just karl).  Third, please review settings&gt;privacy and security. Click savedpasswords and then showpasswords. Since the gmail accounts are not working, I suggest you highlight all rows of gmail accounts and delete them. That will reset TB so that future attempts for gmail retrieval will prompt for the password.  That should give a head start.

Just like the Inbox it is a dynamically computed collection of messages that can come from multiple other folders. The sources of this dynamic collection appear as subfolders. In my case, there were no subfolders shown. And when I right-clicked the trash bin and went to ""Properties"", the property dialog showed: ""Select the folders to search: 0 folders selected"". In other words, ""Trash"" did not show anything. </p><p>The real trash bin is under ""Local Folders"", although it does not appear in the UI. </p><p>So what I did is: In the properties dialog of ""Trash"", I clicked the ""Choose"" button (near the right edge). I was offered only one choice: ""Local Folders"", which could be expanded to a list of all its subfolders. And here, the ""Trash"" folder appeared. I selected it by a tick mark and pressed ""OK"". Voila, now my ""Trash"" bin showed one subfolder: ""Local Folders"". All the messages that I had previously deleted and that had disappeared mysterously were now correctly shown in the trash bin. Great! Problem solved. </p><p>What remains to be solved is: </p> <ul><li> how could the migration to version 115 have configured the Trash folder in this wrong way? </li><li> I have not understood yet, why my other search folders contain subfolders that appear to be unnecessary. For example, the Inbox searches not only in ""Local Folders"", but also the inboxes of my two Gmail accounts, although they always go into the unified inbox of ""Local Folders"" and never contain anything. Is that, because I had once experimented with setting them to IMAP and the migration code of version 115 somehow picked up on that? </li></ul> <p>Perhaps some Thunderbird guru can comment on that. </p>",mail@vorstaedt.de,false,1,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1597093

But strangely, in TB version 115 my Inbox appears with 3 subfolders: the two Gmail accounts I have and ""Local Folders"", but not the three non-Gmail accounts I have. Isn't that strange? </p><p>In addition, I noticed that the Drafts folder has four subfolders: 3 for my non-gmail accounts plus ""Local Folders"". The two gmail accounts do not appear here.

All it does it creates a load of orphaned folders for each attempt. It rarely solves anything because whatever caused things to stop working is still in the mix. </p><p>This image is just proof that you have an issue with something blocking or locking access to files in your profile. (all those prefs-Number.js files)  probably a rogue antivirus,  but it could also be a rogue backup or cloud sync.  File contention is not going to end well with Thunderbird generally loosing dat and forgetting settings you think you have changed. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-16-44-28-f698cf.png"">  </p><p>This image clearly shows the file path being used for that configured account.

In the process you have added some 33 or more sets of server entries to your prefs.js file and pose that file as having a thousand new entries in it.  I have no idea how many lines might be in a prefs.js file.  I have never looked.  I just do not tend to add or remove accounts.  I fix the ones I have so they work. </p><p>So I suggest before you go any further you go back to using the original profile.  Some years ago,  when V68 was released I wrote a <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2019/09/i-lost-my-profilemail-on-update-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post</a> describing how to recover from the sudden loss of the existing profile folder.  I suggest you try using that to get back to your 2018 configuration that you lost I am guessing last Christmas. </p><p>The path used for each account has no relevance to what I think you are trying to achieve,  but at this point I am assuming both what happened and what you have been doing to recover from the files on your drive.  You have not articulated what the actual problem is.  Because you have asked pointed questions and been unhappy with the correct answer to your pointed question,  I am guessing at both the issue and your motivations. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1597103

Most direkt megnéztem, ez már a 102-es verzióban is így működött, és nem találtam rá beállítást, amivel át lehetne állítani. Viszont az igényedre szerintem van megoldás, csak nem pont olyan mint eddig. A <em>Mappamódok</em> alatt (a három pont ikon alatt találod az <em>Új üzenet</em> gomb mellett) kapcsold be és próbáld ki az <em>Egyesített mappák</em> és az <em>Olvasatlan mappák</em> lehetőségeket. Nem részletezném a működésüket, mert eléggé magukért beszélnek, viszont az <em>Olvasatlan mappák</em> jó kis funkciója (a jobb felső sarokban lévő menüből érhető el) a <em>Tömör nézet</em>, ezzel közvetlenül azon mappák listáját kapod meg, amelyekben olvasatlan levelek vannak. </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1597771

Viszont, ha nincs szétnyitva a mappa akkor nem mutatja  a beérkező üzeneteket, a korábbi verzió mutatta ekkor is. Gondolom, valahol az opciós beállításoknál, ezt is lehet konfigurálni, de én elvesztem abban. </p>",hordos7,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1597768

Ha összecsukom a például a <em>Beérkező levelek</em> mappát, akkor a mostani 13 helyett 16 jelenik meg, mert hozzáadja az elrejtett mappában lévő olvasatlan leveleket. Nálad nem így viselkedik?

But iCloud doesn't work like Google Drive.  iCloud maintains an up-to-date copy of all files placed in the Desktop folder, and ignores other files--so they want you to put all your ""data"" in Desktop.  But because the TB profile is a hidden file in Library on a mac, you can't just move it into the Desktop folder.  If I copy it into Desktop, then I have two profile copies on my harddrive, and it costs me an extra 50GB of disc space on my mac.

I encourage all users to unsubscribe from the allmail folder as it just confuses people. Gmail doesn't actually have traditional folders; instead, it uses pointers to messages to keep track of them. So, all of your mail has at least two pointers ('labels' in Gmail's vocabulary).
