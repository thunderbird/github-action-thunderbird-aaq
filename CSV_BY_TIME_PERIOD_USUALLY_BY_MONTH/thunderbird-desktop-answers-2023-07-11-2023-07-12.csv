First, when I start Thunderbird (102.13.0), all accounts appear and work fine (send and received) except the one account I have that uses Exquilla.  That account (using Exquilla) does not appear in my Folders on the left side of Thunderbird.  I learned through hours of desperate fiddling around that if I send an email to that problem account, from another of my email accounts, with Thunderbird open during this process, then Thunderbird will pop up a window showing that I have new mail.  Clicking on that new mail notice causes Thunderbird to instantly update its Folders panel, now showing the Exquilla-related account that was previously not shown in the Folders panel.  My received emails are there, but I cannot send emails through that account (I can send through all other accounts).  When I look at the Error Console on the Exquilla Add-On panel's settings, I see many errors saying, """"invalid value for enumeration writeMode"" and pointing to a few specific lines in ""ewsUtils.jsm"".  See attached image of the error log.  I hope one of the Thunderbird or Exquilla programmers will simply look at their error logs because it seems to point directly to the offending code.  BTW, I wish to add here that I've emailed Exquilla Support twice in the past few months and never received a reply. </p>",dfcurry,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1590114

Historically the case is just reset  to lower case if you don't set it that way.  Perhaps a new ""feature"" is that automatic translation is gone. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1590490

When Quickbooks is open, Thunderbird will crash almost all the time.  If I close QB, it is fine.  I have an HP desktop w/ 8GB ram.  What I don't understand is that it started doing this recently, but never used to crash.  Is TB using more ram now since the latest releases?

Instalé thunderbird en otro PC y copié el perfil pero quedó igual, es decir sin mostrarme las cuentas de correo, solo me muestra las carpetas locales y no me deja enviar correos. Me da la idea de que hay un fail en alguna actualización ya sea de thunderbird o de exquilla, que es el complemento de pago que tengo instalado para operar con cuentas de microsoft 365, o también llamadas exchange, ya que thunderbird por sí solo no acepta esas cuentas. También puede ser que haya algún intento de hackeo, pero tal parece que no hay otros usuarios con el mismo problema que yo. </p>",coolblue7003,false,0,0,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1590436
