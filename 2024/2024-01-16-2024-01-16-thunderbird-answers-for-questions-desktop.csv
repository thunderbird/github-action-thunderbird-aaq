The only way to remove yourself from the charter account would be to create a new email account elsewhere, such as free ones (e.g., gmail or outlook), or fee-based ones (e.g., fastmail or protonmail) -- and there are others.  I am not recommending one over another, just listing a few of which I am aware. Note: Thunderbird can work with all of these. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
