I cannot make a screenshot but what happens is that thunderbird opens and starts loading but nothing happens, I don't get any mails or anything. When I click on help or something the whole page turns white and it says at the top of the page 'thunderbird doesn't react'. The only option I have is to close the program or wait till it is loaded, which doesn't happen.  Hope this makes it more clear..... </p>",k.ruiter,false,1,0
