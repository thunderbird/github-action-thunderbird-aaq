The From/To area now takes up much to much space.  Also there is this awful ""This is a draft message"" bar that appears that makes it worse with a useless edit button. </p><p>Also when I double click on a message to open it in a new window it gets these yellow warnings and lots of dashed lines placed on it.  The old one worked perfectly. </p><p>Also where the folders are displayed I cannot move the right side to display the full folder names. </p><p>Please advise if there is anything I can do. I never had these issues with the old one. </p><p>Thanks and regards, Len </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1631427;,reder

Everything was working normally until today.  I can still receive emails, but when I send, I get an error message asking for a password: ""password required for outgoing SMPT server""   Manually entering a password in that error message box doesn't help.   Spectrum support is not helpful beyond confirming that my email sends and receives normally as long as I access it on their website.   Three clues: 1) Spectrum recently announced ""new and improved"" email.   2) One customer service person described my email addresses as ""legacy"".   3) My gmail address sends and receives just fine from Thunderbird as usual.   Any insights appreciated!  Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",cdierl
