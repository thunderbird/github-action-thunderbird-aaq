Ended up having to `Reset toolbars and controls` in `Help &gt; Troubleshoot Mode`. </p><p>Now I've no access to the one-click efficiency of a `Mark Unread` button in this use case: ""bugger it, this email is too long for me to read now, I'll mark unread to remind me to read later"".  </p><p>There's no button in the Customize pallette that I can move to the menu bar. </p><p>Developers need to remember some users despise the <em>tap a mailbox item once, it loads in a `Message Pane` and is marked read in X seconds</em> workflow. I don't even use the Message Pane. </p><p>Once users have found the hidden-by-default Customise pallette and opted into customising their experience, buttons and options should not be removed from their choices.

The From/To area now takes up much to much space.  Also there is this awful ""This is a draft message"" bar that appears that makes it worse with a useless edit button. </p><p>Also when I double click on a message to open it in a new window it gets these yellow warnings and lots of dashed lines placed on it.  The old one worked perfectly. </p><p>Also where the folders are displayed I cannot move the right side to display the full folder names. </p><p>Please advise if there is anything I can do. I never had these issues with the old one. </p><p>Thanks and regards, Len </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",reder
