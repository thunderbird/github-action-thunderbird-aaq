I'm still not clear on the difference.  </p><p>For JUNK mail, TB gives us the option to select ""NOT JUNK"". Good.  </p><p>But for SPAM, I cannot find the option ""NOT SPAM""  </p><p>1) Why are there separate SPAM and JUNK directories? And why are they managed differently? This seems terribly non-intuitive and inconsistent and just strange.  </p><p>2) How can I train SPAM filter to not flag good email from trusted senders? For instance, I get email from my wife many times a day for many years. Today, TB put her email into SPAM. Isn't there a simple command to ""white list"" a sender's email address? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1646923;,jl11

In una versione vecchia, forse la 102*, i titoli nel pannello messaggi (Oggetto, Da, Data , Dimensione etc.) erano scritti in Grassetto ma poi, se si selezionava l'opzione ""Già Letto"" i caratteri diventavano Normal rendendo così facile capire se i messaggi nella finestra erano letti o no.  In questa versione non esiste più tale opzione per me utile.  C'è un pallino colorato ma è poco visibile e bisogna andarci col puntatore sopra per leggere lo stato del messaggio. Mi era molto utile la vecchia opzione. Ho cercato ma non ho trovato nulla per questa caratteristica. Sapete dirmi se è possibile rimetterla e come? Mi piacerebbe anche colorare lo sfondo della finestra messaggio con un colore chiaro (giallo o verde), anche qui non so come fare, se potete aiutarmi. Scrivo da un PC windows 7 a 32 bit. Grazie in anticipo. </p><p>Claudio </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1646972;1646985;1646988;1646990;,claudio.vincenzo

I had a client where I could edit the subject line and then store the email in another directory. Changing the subject line allowed for a better way to find the email later on as one can change the text to something understandable and easier to seach for.

Every time I open TB, it asks for  ""please enter your Primary Password"" which I don't have/deleted? If a try to remove the tick from ""Use a Primary Password"" it opens a box requesting my Current Password, I have tried the last one and the one before, none are accepted. When I search in Saved logins, it seems to me to be empty. in short I seem to need a current password to change my password. It is a vicious loop. Can any one help sort this out, Please Thank you from Ilio Pieroni </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",Iliopier
