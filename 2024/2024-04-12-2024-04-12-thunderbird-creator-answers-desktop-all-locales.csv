I deleted TB and deleted any reference to Thunderbird in the registry.  Turn off and restarted PC, downloaded new install and run and all the setting from before automatically were in place and still could not get pass the password issue.  My computer does not have any password.   </p><p>My wife's PC, under setting, does not have any saved passwords or a Primary password or even the ""Use a Primary Password"" checked.  If it is checked there is nothing there.  It just will not get passed the password issue being always asked when trying to ""Get Messages"". </p><p>How do you get rid of all the infor, setting, password requirements and to be able to restart with a clean Thunderbird install or get passed the password issue?

I have a backup of the old default profile folder (9k7faw1z.default), but not of the entire Profiles folder. I have tried to import this old default profile using the import function in my new Thunderbird install on my new Windows 11 computer.  </p><p>Alas, I get the error message ""Import failed unexpectedly; more information may be available in the Error Console.""  I looked in the error console, and it's empty. </p><p>Is there a better way to import my old data from my old default profile folder? It's 3GB of valuable data and I'll be in a pickle if I can't access it. </p><p>Thanks very much. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1646918;,LNEL108

I'm still not clear on the difference.  </p><p>For JUNK mail, TB gives us the option to select ""NOT JUNK"". Good.  </p><p>But for SPAM, I cannot find the option ""NOT SPAM""  </p><p>1) Why are there separate SPAM and JUNK directories? And why are they managed differently? This seems terribly non-intuitive and inconsistent and just strange.  </p><p>2) How can I train SPAM filter to not flag good email from trusted senders? For instance, I get email from my wife many times a day for many years. Today, TB put her email into SPAM. Isn't there a simple command to ""white list"" a sender's email address? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",jl11
