I have been forced by Rogers in Canada to migrate my internet service from their legacy internet service to Rogers Ignite with its Ignite (Comcast) gateway.  My email accounts were supposed to be migrated automatically, but, for reasons unknown, were not, and a tech support representative had to migrate them from the old legacy service to Ignite.  After that was done, I opened Thunderbird, and was asked to authenticate my 2 Rogers/Yahoo email accounts, one of which is my primary account, the other a secondary account.  I was asked to authenticate the secondary account first, which went well.  I then clicked on my primary account in the left-hand pane and was again asked to authenticate, but the dialogue box showed it was for the secondary account.  Thinking that this secondary account authentication was just being repeated for no particular reason, and not thinking that the email address in the authentication request box could be changed, I clicked Agree.  My primary account is now showing the exact same emails as are listed in the secondary account, and I'm extremely concerned that I will not be able to recover all of the thousands of emails in my primary account, many of which are business-related.  When I log into my primary account on the Rogers/Yahoo mail website, the emails in the primary account are still showing, so I know they are still on the Rogers IMAP server.  However, I really want to continue to use my primary account on Thunderbird.  I'm not sure if I should delete the primary account and recreate it - the Rogers support tech said that deleting the account may result in an issue where my current password for a re-created primary account may not be recognized, so I'm leaving things as they are until I hear back.  It the advice is to not delete and recreate the account, what steps can I take to recover the emails on my primary account in Thunderbird.

More recently, I have been having problems with it.  One of them I was able to fix after some research and trial-and-error (which was Thunderbird not letting me log into my Comcast/Xfinity email account), but this second issue is confusing.  I had to remove the account to get back into it (during the first issue), so I'm guessing that must have caused this (second) problem?   </p><p>When I went to check my filters/rules today (since I receive significant amounts of spam), I was shocked to see that my filters list was empty (I had about 30 or so filters in place before the first issue occurred).  I'm guessing there's no way for me to get these back, and so I'll have to manually reinstate each filter ""by hand""? </p><p>If there is any way to do this more easily, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you in advance for your time!! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1647143;,MRBDias2

The ""What's New in Thunderbird 115"" now pops up every time I run the ""old"" version (102.15.1). It is my practice to close all running apps at night before I have the computer go to sleep mode. Consequently I have this message starting my default browser every time I restart TB. It has become annoying. There must be something I can do to stop this. I looked in all the appdata directories but couldn't find anything obvious. I also looked in the update directory but nothing obvious to me there either. Can you provide a fix for this? </p><p>I have not upgraded to 115 because too many people are having problems of one sort or another. I do not want to search for help to patch problems resulting from the upgrade process. When problems settle down a bit more, maybe then. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1647141;1647199;1647261;1647679;1647742;,pnshldn

First, I will start with my HP Laptop, its my primary computer due to its speed.  I went to check my emails this morning.  I double click on the TBird icon on my desktop.  It does not open.  Waited a few seconds, tried again and again.  Finally, a folder containing pictures opened up.  Then, I went to open FireFox, and that same folder with pictures opened.  I tried this like five times and the same thing happened.  Then I got to thinkin, when I went to shut it down the other day, it said ""update and shut down"", so I did.  Now that I remembered the update, I decided to go back in time to when the laptop was running real good.  So I did that recovery, in doing so, it wiped out some of the applications I had on my computer, such as FoxFire, Thunderbird, Adobe, HP printer, CCleaner, and probably others that I seldom used.  Somehow, I got to the point where  I reinstalled Thunderbird.  The only thing is, it would not let me in.  When double clicking on the icon, it took me to a page that just wanted my name, email address and password.  I enter the info, that page stayed open and added a few more items to the page, such as IMAP and POP3 stuff.  IMAP was already selected by Tbird.  I then had the option to click ""done"" .  In doing that, it said ""Unable to log into server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password""  So there's that.  Cannot even see the email program. Second part of the mystery,  I have an old Gateway desktop. Its slower than slow.  I only use it in emergencies, as the above scenario.  I fire it up, wait about 5 minutes before I open Thunderbird on that.  Guess what, it wants a password.  Whats different about this deal is that the email opens, and I can see all my previous emails, but cannot receive or send.  I have no Idea whats going on, unless its my deceased wife coming back to haunt me...I don't know. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1647118;,bbdano126
