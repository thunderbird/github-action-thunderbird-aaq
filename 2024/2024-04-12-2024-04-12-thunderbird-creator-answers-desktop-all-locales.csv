I deleted TB and deleted any reference to Thunderbird in the registry.

My computer does not have any password.   </p><p>My wife's PC, under setting, does not have any saved passwords or a Primary password or even the ""Use a Primary Password"" checked.  If it is checked there is nothing there.  It just will not get passed the password issue being always asked when trying to ""Get Messages"". </p><p>How do you get rid of all the infor, setting, password requirements and to be able to restart with a clean Thunderbird install or get passed the password issue?

I have a backup of the old default profile folder (9k7faw1z.default), but not of the entire Profiles folder. I have tried to import this old default profile using the import function in my new Thunderbird install on my new Windows 11 computer.  </p><p>Alas, I get the error message ""Import failed unexpectedly; more information may be available in the Error Console.""  I looked in the error console, and it's empty. </p><p>Is there a better way to import my old data from my old default profile folder? It's 3GB of valuable data and I'll be in a pickle if I can't access it. </p><p>Thanks very much. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1646918;,LNEL108

I'm still not clear on the difference.  </p><p>For JUNK mail, TB gives us the option to select ""NOT JUNK"". Good.  </p><p>But for SPAM, I cannot find the option ""NOT SPAM""  </p><p>1) Why are there separate SPAM and JUNK directories? And why are they managed differently? This seems terribly non-intuitive and inconsistent and just strange.  </p><p>2) How can I train SPAM filter to not flag good email from trusted senders? For instance, I get email from my wife many times a day for many years. Today, TB put her email into SPAM. Isn't there a simple command to ""white list"" a sender's email address? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1646923;,jl11

If I choose to display only unread emails, the screen goes blank and no messages show. I then click on sent message, click back on incoming and the messages reappear in the ""all"" messages display. The Gmail account is just fine, I can click between ""All"" and ""Unread only"" with no issues. Can't figure out what's going on. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",clearlink03
