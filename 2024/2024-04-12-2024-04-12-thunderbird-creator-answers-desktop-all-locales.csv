I have a backup of the old default profile folder (9k7faw1z.default), but not of the entire Profiles folder. I have tried to import this old default profile using the import function in my new Thunderbird install on my new Windows 11 computer.  </p><p>Alas, I get the error message ""Import failed unexpectedly; more information may be available in the Error Console.""  I looked in the error console, and it's empty. </p><p>Is there a better way to import my old data from my old default profile folder? It's 3GB of valuable data and I'll be in a pickle if I can't access it. </p><p>Thanks very much. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",LNEL108
