Once done, you can copy messages from the POP inbox to the IMAP inbox, but that needs to be done a few at a time, as data can sometimes be lost when uploading if you attempt to copy a lot. One possibility to minimize the risk is to create a filter to do the copy. Once complete, you can then delete the IMAP account. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
