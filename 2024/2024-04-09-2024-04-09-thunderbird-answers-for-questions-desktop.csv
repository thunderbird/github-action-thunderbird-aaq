Just highlight account, rightclick and select settings, and on next pane where it says 'Account name', overtype with any descriptive text that you want to appear on main screen.  OR, if you want the name of account to remain the email address, just put mouse on the vertical bar at the right and drag farther to the right so the full name shows. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Maintaining it slows Thunderbird, increases disc space, and often causes confusion. BUT, if you want it, you can normally highlight the account, rightclick and select 'subscribe' and put a tick mark on the AllMail folder. And maybe I misunderstood your issue...  Please share more info. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Now, I did not pay attention and option ""Delete Gmail's copy"" in POP Downloading setting was marked.  Now I do not see any email in GMAIL in browser as all are deleted but all old emails are available in thunderbird.  </p><p>Can I get those old email from thunderbird to gmail server back&nbsp;? </p>",hanangul12,false,0,0
