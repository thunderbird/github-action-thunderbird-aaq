Just highlight account, rightclick and select settings, and on next pane where it says 'Account name', overtype with any descriptive text that you want to appear on main screen.  OR, if you want the name of account to remain the email address, just put mouse on the vertical bar at the right and drag farther to the right so the full name shows. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Maintaining it slows Thunderbird, increases disc space, and often causes confusion. BUT, if you want it, you can normally highlight the account, rightclick and select 'subscribe' and put a tick mark on the AllMail folder. And maybe I misunderstood your issue...  Please share more info. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
