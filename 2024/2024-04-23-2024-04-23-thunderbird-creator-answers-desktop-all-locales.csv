They are as obvious as can be, but becoming a pain in the ass to mark as junk.  None of the sending e-mail addresses are real and they all wind up with DKIM=fail.  I am not finding a solution I am happy with, having considered 1. a Thunderbird add-in that  checks DKIM - it has mixed reviews, and I have some clients whose e-mail systems do not respond to DKIM verification 2. SpamAssassin - not quite sure what this does, and I really do not to add another layer 3. I have enabled - in Thunderbird's Account setting and elsewhere - junk filtering, but it shows no signs of being successfully trained despite having manually marked hundreds of phishing e-mails as Junk. 4. I do not see how to create a filter to catch these (I am assuming looking for DKIM=fail in ""body"" would fail as  ""body"" refers to rendered e-mail contents, not the raw format. </p><p>Help would be appreciated.

Backed up profiles from old laptop 2. downloaded and installed latest version of Thunderbird on new laptop 3. coped profiles into \roaming directory 4. tested and successfully received emails and viewed all old emails. </p><p>The problem is that the Mail toolbar is nowhere to be found. Also, the calendar is missing. I tried right clicking on empty space and it only showed ""menu bar"" as an option.

I only made one change to my email in Thunderbird when this started happening. Prior to me setting up a filter to search for <a href=""http://amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">amazon.com</a> messages and direct them to a separate folder, the messages all appeared on top, in the correct date order. After, they appear on the bottom, even if I change to another folder or different email address and come back, the message is still at the bottom. </p><p>It is like when you have a folder open in Windows browser and then you save or modify files in that window, they reappear on the bottom. </p><p>Closing the program (like if you close a window) and reopening it causes the new message to appear where it should be. However, that is a substantial inconvenience. I have Thunderbird monitoring nine other e-mail accounts at present. None of them have a message filter. All of them show the email at the top of the page. New messages to my primary account appear at the bottom of the page even when I have Thunderbird showing the inbox of one of the other email accounts. </p><p>Using Windows 10,  Thunderbird 115.10.1 (64-bit). </p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",kauffman93
