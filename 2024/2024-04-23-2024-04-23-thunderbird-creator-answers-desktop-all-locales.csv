They are as obvious as can be, but becoming a pain in the ass to mark as junk.  None of the sending e-mail addresses are real and they all wind up with DKIM=fail.  I am not finding a solution I am happy with, having considered 1. a Thunderbird add-in that  checks DKIM - it has mixed reviews, and I have some clients whose e-mail systems do not respond to DKIM verification 2. SpamAssassin - not quite sure what this does, and I really do not to add another layer 3. I have enabled - in Thunderbird's Account setting and elsewhere - junk filtering, but it shows no signs of being successfully trained despite having manually marked hundreds of phishing e-mails as Junk. 4. I do not see how to create a filter to catch these (I am assuming looking for DKIM=fail in ""body"" would fail as  ""body"" refers to rendered e-mail contents, not the raw format. </p><p>Help would be appreciated.

I hope you can provide guidance or a solution. </p><p>Issue Description: When I attempt to ""Reply to All"" to an email that I previously sent (which is the last email in a conversation thread), Thunderbird automatically alters the sender's address. Specifically, instead of maintaining me as the sender, it changes the sender to the one (or the first one, if there's more) of the original recipients' addresses. As a result, the email appears as if it's being sent by the recipient back to themselves. This messes with the recipient's folders and rules, as the message has no indication it's been sent by me. This happens when I initiate the ""Reply to All"" action from the Sent folder on emails where I was the original sender. This only happens in one of the email accounts I'm using in Thunderbird, and it's a POP Mail Server type account. </p><p>Steps to Replicate: </p><p>Send an email to one or more recipients. Go to the Sent folder and open the email that was just sent. Click on ""Reply to All."" Notice that the sender's address is automatically changed to one of the recipients' (typically the first one, if there are more recipients). Expected Behavior: The sender's address should remain as my email address, not change to a recipient's address, ensuring the email is correctly identified as being sent by me to the other recipients. </p><p>Troubleshooting Steps Already Taken: </p><p>Verified that no extensions or add-ons are causing this behavior. Checked for any relevant settings within Thunderbird that could influence this behavior but found none. Updated Thunderbird to the latest version available. I would appreciate any advice, solutions, or workarounds you can offer to prevent Thunderbird from automatically changing the sender's address in this scenario. Please let me know if there are any logs or additional information I can provide to assist in resolving this issue. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",sseorrbiann

These calendars are not read-only, I can see the option delete, both  with right-click on the event and double-click to edit the event, but after pressing delete, the event remains on the calendar. Just pressing the delete button on the keyboard after selecting the event has the same behaviour. If I try shift the events from one calendar to the other, they do appear in the new calendar, but they do not disappear from the old. I have restarted Thunderbird, and also tried this on another computer with the same results. Both szstems are Windows 11, Th underbird 115.10.1 I would be very grateful for any suggestions </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",petros.christopoulos

While the calendar view looks decent, the tasks view is completely bloated with old, already completed tasks, some even from 2023. I selected ""open tasks"" or ""current tasks"" (? German translation) from the menu on the left side. It's not that all of the tasks are misclassified: When I go to completed tasks, there are hundreds of (correctly) completed tasks listed, but still. </p><p>Furthermore, the sub tasks of a main task are not grouped.  Is this a known limitation or am I missing some configuration? </p><p>In general, as of now, the task view is pretty unusable for me. Anything that I can do to help debugging this? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",laurenz.bihlmayer
