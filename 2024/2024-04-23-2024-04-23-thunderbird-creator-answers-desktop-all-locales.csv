They are as obvious as can be, but becoming a pain in the ass to mark as junk.  None of the sending e-mail addresses are real and they all wind up with DKIM=fail.  I am not finding a solution I am happy with, having considered 1. a Thunderbird add-in that  checks DKIM - it has mixed reviews, and I have some clients whose e-mail systems do not respond to DKIM verification 2. SpamAssassin - not quite sure what this does, and I really do not to add another layer 3. I have enabled - in Thunderbird's Account setting and elsewhere - junk filtering, but it shows no signs of being successfully trained despite having manually marked hundreds of phishing e-mails as Junk. 4. I do not see how to create a filter to catch these (I am assuming looking for DKIM=fail in ""body"" would fail as  ""body"" refers to rendered e-mail contents, not the raw format. </p><p>Help would be appreciated.

I only made one change to my email in Thunderbird when this started happening. Prior to me setting up a filter to search for <a href=""http://amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">amazon.com</a> messages and direct them to a separate folder, the messages all appeared on top, in the correct date order. After, they appear on the bottom, even if I change to another folder or different email address and come back, the message is still at the bottom. </p><p>It is like when you have a folder open in Windows browser and then you save or modify files in that window, they reappear on the bottom. </p><p>Closing the program (like if you close a window) and reopening it causes the new message to appear where it should be. However, that is a substantial inconvenience. I have Thunderbird monitoring nine other e-mail accounts at present. None of them have a message filter. All of them show the email at the top of the page. New messages to my primary account appear at the bottom of the page even when I have Thunderbird showing the inbox of one of the other email accounts. </p><p>Using Windows 10,  Thunderbird 115.10.1 (64-bit). </p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",kauffman93

I humbly ask for some options. Can I merge 2 profiles ie copy them into one profie folder? Can I hide/rename the profiles then delete Tbird and install anew?

I am using Windows 11 and am on a Lenova laptop and appears I have Thunderbird version 115.10.1. I have spoken to my internet provider at great length and they ending up saying that they could not help me any more and I had to contact Mozilla. When I try to receive emails I get a message saying this: Server <a href=""http://mail.skymesh.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.skymesh.com.au</a> has disconnected. The server may have gone down or there may be a network problem. I am able to access my emails through my internet providers web emails also. I don't know of any more information that I can put in here so I will leave it at that and hope that someone out there can help me as I have absolutely no idea what to do next. I am not a computer person what so ever and will not be able to fix this on my own so any help will be appreciated but I will need details.

I hope you can provide guidance or a solution. </p><p>Issue Description: When I attempt to ""Reply to All"" to an email that I previously sent (which is the last email in a conversation thread), Thunderbird automatically alters the sender's address. Specifically, instead of maintaining me as the sender, it changes the sender to the one (or the first one, if there's more) of the original recipients' addresses. As a result, the email appears as if it's being sent by the recipient back to themselves. This messes with the recipient's folders and rules, as the message has no indication it's been sent by me. This happens when I initiate the ""Reply to All"" action from the Sent folder on emails where I was the original sender. This only happens in one of the email accounts I'm using in Thunderbird, and it's a POP Mail Server type account. </p><p>Steps to Replicate: </p><p>Send an email to one or more recipients. Go to the Sent folder and open the email that was just sent. Click on ""Reply to All."" Notice that the sender's address is automatically changed to one of the recipients' (typically the first one, if there are more recipients). Expected Behavior: The sender's address should remain as my email address, not change to a recipient's address, ensuring the email is correctly identified as being sent by me to the other recipients. </p><p>Troubleshooting Steps Already Taken: </p><p>Verified that no extensions or add-ons are causing this behavior. Checked for any relevant settings within Thunderbird that could influence this behavior but found none. Updated Thunderbird to the latest version available. I would appreciate any advice, solutions, or workarounds you can offer to prevent Thunderbird from automatically changing the sender's address in this scenario. Please let me know if there are any logs or additional information I can provide to assist in resolving this issue. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",sseorrbiann
