YOU are the one who composes messages, and that is done by entering keystrokes into Thunderbird to send to Gmail. YOU are the one to decide to delete messages by pressing the appropriate keys in Thunderbird, but Thunderbird needs to be authorized by Google to communicate that decision of yours to the Gmail server.

If that is, indeed, a workaround that would allow me to retrieve the old emails, it will solve my problem.  The total objective/value of my Thunderbird front-end is that I can merge traffic irrespective of via which mail service the traffic was sent or received, then save the material [which includes a good deal of attachments] in local category hierarchies organized to support searches. </p><p>What your suggestion does not specifically state, but you seem to have the expertise to know, is where the state machine is maintained that is telling Thunderbird, when I click on ""Get Messages"" whether or not some ancient message has been sent/received or not.  Maintenance of that state on the client side seems possible, but somewhat worse than if the protocols were written for the server to maintain that state, but as written above, the only state I can manipulate when logged into Google Mail is that which records whether or not I have read the incoming. </p><p>So, I will try to set up a separate IMAP-based connection to GMail on the Thunderbird side and reset the Read switch on the server side and cross my fingers.
