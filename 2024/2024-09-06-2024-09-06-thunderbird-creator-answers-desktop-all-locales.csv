Then I got locked out? All kinds of colors turned themselves on, then it kept asking me if I wanted to change a function???? I kept saying no, then yes. It continued to ask. Turned off the computer and worried if I get my old stuff back. Today it is working but incoming mail is in the lower part of the screen, old mail is in the top.  How do I go back to the old version. This is my desktop </p><p>I just turned on my laptop and it asked me to upgrade. NOPE! I've used you guys for years and only made a small donation, sorry. Didn't know  you have an app for my Android??? Would have tried it. Does your browser follow and track me like Chrome, which I hate. I will aways speak well of you guys even if I can't go back to the older version. See ya, Randy </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Randyjohnjett

Today I cannot open Thunderbird due to a ""side-by-side"" error. See image attached. I am not very computer savvy and therefor find some of the suggested solutions on the web rather difficult to understand and apply. I would appreciate any help you can be.  Thanks, Murray Kerr, Auckland, NZ. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",MurrayKerr
