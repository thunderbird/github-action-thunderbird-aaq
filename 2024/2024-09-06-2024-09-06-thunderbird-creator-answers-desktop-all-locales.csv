Q, As to my actual question, if that window is closed, for what ever reason, I can not find away of re-opening the window, any help on how to do this? Please note I am not referring to the ""Today Pain"" which I can show or hide as needed. As an example I may have an appointment due on the 12th of the month, but need to prepare for it so I set a reminder for 3 days before, ie 9th. So on the 9th a reminder for the appointment appears allowing me to dismiss or snooze. I would commonly start to prepare and as such leave the reminder as is, not clicking dismiss or snooze but closing the window. Later on in the day I wish to open the window so I can clear the reminder. That's the window I wish to open and do not know how. Snoozing will not help as I may not be able to predict how long it takes me to prepare and therefore can snoze for too long or too short. I've included a screen shot of the actual window in question with a dummy reminder. Hope this was too long and thanks for any help offered. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",Private61
