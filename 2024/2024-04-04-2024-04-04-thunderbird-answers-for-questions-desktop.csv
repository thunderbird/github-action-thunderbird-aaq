This can happen for several reasons: </p> <ul><li> Non-Existent Email Address: The email address might not exist, or there could be a typo in the address. Double-check the email address for any errors. </li><li> DNS Problem: If this error occurs with every email you try to send, it could be a DNS issue. Clearing your DNS cache might resolve the problem. </li><li> Anti-Spam Filter: The recipient’s email server may have marked your email as spam. In this case, the recipient needs to whitelist your email address. </li><li> DBEB Blocking: If you’re using Microsoft 365 and sending emails to public folders, Directory Based Edge Blocking (DBEB) might be preventing the emails from being delivered. Ensure that the public folders are hosted on-premise. </li></ul> <p>To troubleshoot, start by ensuring the email address is correct and try sending the email again. If the problem persists, consider the other the possibilities mentioned above. </p><p>Best Regard, Ryan Manus <a href=""https://www.mycoveredcalifornia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CoveredCalifornia</a> </p>",ryan1969manus,true,0,0

TB WILL let you create what appear to be global filters, but they won't work, and if you are in your main inbox and issue Tools/Message Filters you will see them all, but no linkage is described as to which account owns which filters.  That is also why if you try to ""Run Now"" nothing will happen, because naturally the filter ""expects"" to see mail in the inbox of that particular email account. </p><p>This was my lack of understanding.
