This can happen for several reasons: </p> <ul><li> Non-Existent Email Address: The email address might not exist, or there could be a typo in the address. Double-check the email address for any errors. </li><li> DNS Problem: If this error occurs with every email you try to send, it could be a DNS issue. Clearing your DNS cache might resolve the problem. </li><li> Anti-Spam Filter: The recipient’s email server may have marked your email as spam. In this case, the recipient needs to whitelist your email address. </li><li> DBEB Blocking: If you’re using Microsoft 365 and sending emails to public folders, Directory Based Edge Blocking (DBEB) might be preventing the emails from being delivered. Ensure that the public folders are hosted on-premise. </li></ul> <p>To troubleshoot, start by ensuring the email address is correct and try sending the email again. If the problem persists, consider the other the possibilities mentioned above. </p><p>Best Regard, Ryan Manus <a href=""https://www.mycoveredcalifornia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CoveredCalifornia</a> </p>",ryan1969manus,true,0,0
