Checking with the senders revealed no change to the time they were sent. Looking at the messages when they appeared showed that they WERE received on time. Logging into the web interfaces for Gmail and Comcast/XFINITY email revealed that the messages were arriving on time. The only logical conclusion is that MTS has a problem in its IMAP protocol implementation that does  not recognize new/unread messages as such, and therefore does not retrieve them.
