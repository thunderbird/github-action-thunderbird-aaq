I have the 115 version installed on a Windows 10 PC. Both are updated. Checking on the forum, I have tried to pause the antivirus program and the firewall, without success. Exploring the problem, it seems to be related to an unusual I/O net waiting process. Most interestingly, I also had the same problem with a Linux Mint 21.3 laptop, with the ""same"" Thunderbird 115 version. However, I could fix that problem using Evolution&nbsp;:/. Please, send me any idea or suggestion that may help, it will be greatly appreciated!

I have tried every solution I have found on the net, incl. making sure TB was chosen as the mail client for any file type, removing any leftovers from outlook and from registration data base, but still only adresses connected with Outlook shows up (and I can see that it is from an old mailing list, that does not include more recent contacts). So why does the share windows not have assess to Thunderbird and its mail adresses? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",o.larsen1
