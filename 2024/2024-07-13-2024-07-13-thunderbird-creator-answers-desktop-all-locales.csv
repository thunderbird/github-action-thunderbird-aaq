I'm using one of ESET's security products which, after scans, find malicious content in the INBOX file, located locally on the device under the path %APPDATA%%RoamingThunderbirdProfiles(_Name_Of_the_profile)_Imapmail(_Name_of_mail)_INBOX(mail123). Unfortunately, the security product is unable to get rid of the dangerous file, but only gives information that something bad is in the email.  When trying to find a specific email, I unfortunately run into a lot of problems. 1. the name of the email - in this case ""mail123"" does not exist in the thunderbird application itself. If I understand correctly, thunderbird itself chooses names for individual mails and then packs them in the INBOX file. 2. it is possible to correlate the email name from the INBOX file to the actual name(subject) of the email using other software such as MailStoreHome by importing the entire email profile (_Name_of_the_profile). 3. once the email is already correlated and found in MailStoreHome, I should be able to find the same email in Thunderbird (as I have imported the INBOX file, which is located locally, and which Thunderbird itself reads). Well, unfortunately no. Such an email in the Thunderbird mailbox (I already know the subject, content, date, etc.) does not exist. </p><p>And here comes my question. Is it possible to open the INBOX file itself and then find the unfortunate email and delete it? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1661676;,Zdenon

Both the phone and the laptop are up to date with incoming emails. I can send an email to myself from the PC. Mozilla Thunderbird is up to date with auto update program. </p><p>Can someone please advise what steps I need to take to find out why this has just occurred. I am wondering if a recent auto update to Thunderbird has caused this issue . I am not ware if one can rollback to a previous Thunderbird revision  to check if this is the cause? Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thanks Greg </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1661684;,gregblake
