I'm using one of ESET's security products which, after scans, find malicious content in the INBOX file, located locally on the device under the path %APPDATA%%RoamingThunderbirdProfiles(_Name_Of_the_profile)_Imapmail(_Name_of_mail)_INBOX(mail123). Unfortunately, the security product is unable to get rid of the dangerous file, but only gives information that something bad is in the email.  When trying to find a specific email, I unfortunately run into a lot of problems. 1. the name of the email - in this case ""mail123"" does not exist in the thunderbird application itself. If I understand correctly, thunderbird itself chooses names for individual mails and then packs them in the INBOX file. 2. it is possible to correlate the email name from the INBOX file to the actual name(subject) of the email using other software such as MailStoreHome by importing the entire email profile (_Name_of_the_profile). 3. once the email is already correlated and found in MailStoreHome, I should be able to find the same email in Thunderbird (as I have imported the INBOX file, which is located locally, and which Thunderbird itself reads). Well, unfortunately no. Such an email in the Thunderbird mailbox (I already know the subject, content, date, etc.) does not exist. </p><p>And here comes my question. Is it possible to open the INBOX file itself and then find the unfortunate email and delete it? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1661676;1662014;1662074;,Zdenon

Gli altri account che gestisco con la stessa installazione di Thunderbird funzionano. Lo stesso account è accessibile correttamente e sempre con Thunderbird da un altro PC. Ho provato a eliminare l'account e ricrearlo: non risolve. Ho provato a eliminare l'account e modificare un altro account funzionante per trasformarlo in quello che non va. Fatto ciò, anche quello mi ripresenta l'identico problema. Non so più cosa fare, perché ogni cosa che faccio fa pensare che il problema non sia lì.

(??) I tried using a command prompt according to a Mozilla help site but that didn’t work either. </p><p>The message from MS that TB would be able to function might be so if I could only log into TB, but I don’t have a PP. I can get to my emails online from the MSN and Earthlink servers but not via TB. </p><p>This has been going on for the better part of a week. I have been unable to send or receive emails on my MSN account or my EarthLink account. Yes, I seem to have dug a hole for myself. Can someone please pull me out? Maybe I’ll just buy some stamps and an abacus. </p><p>Thanks for whatever help is out there, </p><p>I’m running Win 10 and Thunderbird: 115.12.2 (64-bit) </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1661778;1661805;1661830;1661896;1661898;,mennoted
