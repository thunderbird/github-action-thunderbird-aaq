Currently I have one commercial google account, and three <a href=""http://zoho.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zoho.com</a> accounts, and I'm using the latest version of Windows 10 Pro 64. </p><p>Today, when I went to check my emails, the zoho accounts has THOUSANDS of old emails, six months old or more, with recent dates and times shown, and multiple copies of each email.  The total was about 80 thousand, and still counting.  The Google account was fine. </p><p>So I closed Thunderbird.  Then I went to <a href=""http://zoho.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zoho.com</a> to get a web view of my accounts, assuming that they had been hacked.  But to my surprise, everything looked normal there.  Just my regular emails. </p><p>So I went to another computer, and found the same problem with Thunderbird.  So I assumed it was something to do with the old version of Thunderbird, and started doing upgrades.  When I got to version 68.1, the craziness stopped.  I could check accounts, and it came back with no new emails, so I was relieved. </p><p>But I did not like the look of 68, and could not find any add-ons or extensions to make it look better.  So I decided to continue upgrading, hoping a newer version would look better, or have more options. </p><p>When I got to version 101.2 I was really impressed with the colors, but then it went crazy again, downloading thousands of emails.  So I kept upgrading to the latest version, 115, but the problem did not go away.   </p><p>So now I am stumped.  Is it something in my settings?  How can I fix this?  Please, please help! </p><p>Thank you, Dave Morris </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",zohox3
