In a few cases, the info. in the body of the e-mail has been switched.  For example, the e-mail from my town telling me about the upcoming election shows information about an upcoming meeting at my church.  The election info. has vanished and the previously deleted church's e-mail's information was substituted in its place.  However, I can live without a few e-mails I think.  thanks again. </p>",cahwhite,false,0,0

Now it seems like i have two outgoing servers for Microsoft (see screenshots) and one is still operating on the old (flawed) standards but a new, second one automatically chose the OAuth2-option and I can send emails again. </p> <dl><dd>-) </dd></dl>",konrad.sternisko,false,0,0
