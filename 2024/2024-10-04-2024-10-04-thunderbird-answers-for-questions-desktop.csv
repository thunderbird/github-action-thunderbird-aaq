If you are in 'offline' mode and choose to compose emails and use 'Send Later' then emails are set up ready to send and stored in the 'Outbox'. If you are in 'online' mode, but for whatever reason do  not want to send the email at that moment then you can use the 'Send Later' option to store email ready to go in 'Outbox'. </p><p>When you want to send - right click on 'Outbox' and select 'Send unsent messages'. </p><p>The 'Local Folders' folder is also important for people when using imap accounts. <em>Senario:</em> If you are close to max quota on server and you need to delete emails in order to  make some space, but some are important and you want to keep a copy on your computer: Then in 'Local Folders' account, you create new folders with suitable names and get copies of important imap account emails and put them into the 'Local Folders' mail account. Once you are certain you have a good readible copy then you can delete mail off the server thus freeing up space. </p><p><em>Senario:</em> If you have a backup of imap account and need to use it because of loss of data on server: You can import the backed up mbox files back into the 'Local Folders' account. Then if required, you can put copies of emails back into the relevant imap folder.  This then enables you to upload emails back onto the server. </p><p><em>Senarios for Pop</em> But what if you have several pop accounts and you do not want to have a list of mail accounts with all their own folders in the Folder Pane - maybe you want all emails to display in just one place. Pop accounts can be set up as deferred accounts and set to use 'Global Inbox (Local Folders)' That means you do not see individual pop accounts in Folder Pane and therefore no individual folders per pop acount. You only see 'Local Folders' and all mail incoming, outgoing, storing for all pop accounts is only in 'Local Folders' account. Naturally, you can still create folders and organise mail as you choose within 'Local Folders' account. </p><p>Even if you have Pop accounts set up as standard regular pop accounts, you can still use 'Local Folders' for anything. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:so how do I get rid of the Local Folders accounts or atleast make it the last in my long list of email accounts?</em> </p><p>In 'Account Settings' The left pane shows the list of accounts.
