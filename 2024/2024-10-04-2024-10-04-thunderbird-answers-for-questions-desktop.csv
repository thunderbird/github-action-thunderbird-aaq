I had this problem with 6 email accounts on Outlook 2019 which accessed email on <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>. You can google: ""Microsoft Outlook Basic Authentication"" for more information. But if this is the cause, and you are using TB to access your email, all you should have to do is go to the setup for each of your email accounts on your computer in the latest version of TB (which supports advanced authentication) and change the authentication method to OAuth2. That is the modern authentication method that MS accepts now. You may have to also login to your Microsoft email account online to add 2 factor authentication on each account first. If the first step doesn't work, try the second step and retry the first one. I talked to several MS support techs before I got the correct steps. I cannot provide details about MSN because I have never used it.  I use another Microsoft account: <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>.

Then if required, you can put copies of emails back into the relevant imap folder.  This then enables you to upload emails back onto the server. </p><p><em>Senarios for Pop</em> But what if you have several pop accounts and you do not want to have a list of mail accounts with all their own folders in the Folder Pane - maybe you want all emails to display in just one place. Pop accounts can be set up as deferred accounts and set to use 'Global Inbox (Local Folders)' That means you do not see individual pop accounts in Folder Pane and therefore no individual folders per pop acount. You only see 'Local Folders' and all mail incoming, outgoing, storing for all pop accounts is only in 'Local Folders' account.

I had this problem with Outlook 2019.  You can google: ""Microsoft Outlook Basic Authentication"" for more information.  But if this is the cause, and you are using TB to access your email, all you should have to do is go to the setup for each of your email accounts in the latest version of TB (which supports advanced authentication) and change the authentication method to OAuth2.  That is the modern authentication method that MS accepts now.  You may have to also login to your email account online (<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>) to add 2 factor authentication on each account first.  If the first step doesn't work, try the second step and retry the first one.  I talked to several MS support techs before I got the correct steps.  Good luck! </p>",bobd888,false,0,0
