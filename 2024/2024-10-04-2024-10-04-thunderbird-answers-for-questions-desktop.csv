In a few cases, the info. in the body of the e-mail has been switched.  For example, the e-mail from my town telling me about the upcoming election shows information about an upcoming meeting at my church.  The election info. has vanished and the previously deleted church's e-mail's information was substituted in its place.  However, I can live without a few e-mails I think.  thanks again. </p>",cahwhite,false,0,0
