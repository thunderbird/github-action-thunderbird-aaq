Something weird happened, where the order of the emails in a folder was all wrong, and I pressed the Date header to get it to sort back under Date.  No proper response. Rebooted computer. On re-opening, the emails in the same folder are in order except this weird file at the top with a 2015 date, which now contains all of my important .eml files converted to attachments to this email, but without any ability to detach attachments. Those .eml files no longer exist in the folder as emails, they only exist as attachments to this weird email.   When I try to delete the file, I get a warning that 98 emails will be deleted, but in fact those emails now only exist as attachments.  I right clicked and got an option to ""Forward as Attachments"", so I sent myself an email that has all those .eml files as attachments (29 MB). Right now I have not collected that email into TB, it's just sitting on the gmail site. </p><p>So, if possible, I need to know how to convert those .eml attachments back into active emails in my folder.  Does my request and problem make any sense?  Is there any way to get my correspondence back?   All my other folders appear to be normal.   </p><p>I have all my files backed up in the cloud.  Is it possible to get back a single folder from my TB backup there? And actually, I haven't collected email in a couple of days, so I could just get my entire TB backup if I had to, then collect the most recent email.   Need help and advice, please.  </p><p>Thank you, --Victoria </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Victoria-nola
