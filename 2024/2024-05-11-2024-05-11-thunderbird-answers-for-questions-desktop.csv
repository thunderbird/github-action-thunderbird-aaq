Since I added a second email account to my Thunderbird, I find that emails arriving at account A (the original one) spend a second or two in the inbox and then fly from there to the trash folder under Local Folders.  I have Trash folder under each of my 2 accounts and below those are local folders that I don't remember seeing before.  So my problem is maybe twofold..first, why is mail being flagged as spam (prob. Not a Thunderbird issue) and also why do they not go to the account Trash folder?  Forgive my ignorance, just starting to find out more about Thunderbird after years of happy use.  The accounts are one pop and one imap, I think. </p>",pl.killow,false,0,0

That is how Gmail works.  It is unlike any other IMAP server in that regard. </p><p>Empty folders are more likely indexing issues caused by antivirus than anything else.

Thunderbird brought a lot of stuff (all that was in gmail at that time for which there is was a synced tag/folder). Let's say anything left in gmail ended up in 'gmail in thunderbird'.  </p><p>From what you said, I understood this: If Thunderbird using IMAP pulls from Gmail to put in Thunderbird, the original one in Gmail is gone (it's in Thunderbird).

Unfortunately without success. There are not many variations of the SMTP settings... I first thought it might be due to the TLS protocol. But according to the AWS website they support version 1.2 and 1.3 which as far as I can see in the config:// settings Thunderbird can also use. </p><p>I also tried to establish a local connection to the SMTP server using telnet. This also worked. It must therefore probably be an error with Thunderbird. </p>",komandar,false,0,0

The instructions David posted are clear on the authentication method being normal password.  Given the error is that the chosen authentication method is not supported, I suggest you use the supported method. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The error lies with the (Linux client of) Thunderbird. It seems that the change of an SMTP or IMAP entry is only applied if you close the application completely after the change and reopen it. </p><p>It's a bit awkward but then it works. </p>,komandar,false,0,0

They are a terror on crippling the new account setup process. </p><p>I have multiple Yahoo accounts configured in Thunderbird set up over the years and all work.  Much as I dislike Yahoo and only maintain them to confirm they work here in support.  </p><p>Point one. Thunderbird searches out to the web to set up an @yahoo address to get account settings from a database. <a href=""https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/yahoo.com</a> </p><p>If the database contains setting for both IMAP and POP you are asked to choose which you want to use. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-05-11-19-10-10-bab04e.png""> </p><p>As you are not getting that but some detected POP settings,  that would be my first point of failure caused by the firewall component of your antivirus product. </p><p>Once you settings are detected then the done button kicks off a web page in Thunderbird served by yahoo requesting you to log in. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-05-11-19-12-15-59f83b.png""> This is another point of failuire as oAuth logins require cookies to be enabled in Thunderbird.  They are by default,  but so many utilities ""protect your privacy"" by turning them off so the process does not work. </p><p>Fundamentally I just completed the tasks in this reply while I typed,  so if you are not getting that far,  you have local issues.
