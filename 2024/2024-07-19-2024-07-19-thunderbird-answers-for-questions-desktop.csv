Thunderbird does not automatically trust certificates that are not issued from the chain of trust that backs the Internet's encrypted communications.  It is up to the user to make their own informed decision if they trust the company.  Given how many of them are based in Eastern Europe, the US and some other governments are suggesting a number of the companies can not really be trusted. </p><p>Edge does not have an isolated certificate store that can not be easily manipulated from another program,  so it trusts the self signed certificate in the Microsoft store inserted by the antivirus product.   </p><p>Thunderbird maintains it's own non programmable store.

I tried just creating new email accounts and leaving the old ones closed so then at least I could have access to my historic emails but Thunderbird or Hotmail would not allow me to even create those new accounts in the old installation. It looks like the only way is a full uninstall and new installation which is too bad because as of September 16, according to the notifications I have received on all accounts now from Hotmail, I will have to abandon 20 plus years of history and start anew. I don't even know how to save the history so that I can visit it, so it looks now like on that day I will have to find a new way to do it (probably just leave the hotmail accounts open on my desktop I guess) and that will be the end of my 20 plus year of Thunderbird. Very Frustrating. </p>",ronspamalot1,false,0,0

I was able to compare about config file between Troubleshooting and regular modes and everything is exactly the same except for the Last Filter Time and Next Filter time for each account. Those figures change each time Thunderbird is opened or changer to Troubleshooting Mode. There are some significant differences between the Troubleshooting Information panels when in Regular mode and Troubleshooting mode. I wonder if it matters if I simply leave it in Troubleshooting mode all the time since OAuth2 protocol works there and not in Regular mode. It is a little slow and klunky in Troubleshooting mode but it works. Any ideas on that or how to determine which Troubleshooting Information items are critical to the higher security Hotmail requirements? </p>",ronspamalot1,false,0,0

The trick was to back up the current profile then wipe all profiles out as well as the profile.ini file so that it became a fresh installation. Then I copied only the Mail folder over to the new profile , created ""new user"" the same name as the old user (Outlook did the rest) then, after the new user was established, pointed the Local Directory to the old user account in the Mail folder that I copied over. I did this for each address (Thunderbird had to be restarted after each process) and everything works as advertised. The easiest way to move the Calendar over to the new set up was to export it to a .ics file in the old set up then import it in the new set up. I have been using Thunderbird since about 2004/2005 so I guess somewhere along the line an update screwed around with the Outlook security protocols and manifested around January of this year when I started having authentication issues with one of my accounts. I am relieved that I was able to solve this without blowing away my 20 odd years of history. Thank you for your help and patience C45P3R. </p>",ronspamalot1,false,1,0
