I like Thunderbird with it's modern new design very much!,"<p>Dear community, </p><p>I have decided and will stick with Mozilla Thunderbird, with hopefully future support for important and established standards such as IMAP, Card DAV, Cal DAV and so on. Apart from the other free providers, I have also spent a long time studying the many options and settings of this client. Very few seem oversized or inappropriate. Very nice, minimalist design and functional! Some people should be ashamed of what they complain and demand. I am a big fan of my own domains and emails from established hosting platforms. Email is more important to me than social media and messaging apps. I really appreciate your work. This is not about annoying advertising and money, but about passion and commitment. You guys make me happy. Thank you. </p><p><em>Daniel Hill</em> </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",aidedee

Every time I open it, it has shifted and resized a bit from the last time. It's not one monitor to another or even the other side of one screen, but it's always slightly higher or lower, slightly smaller or larger... It's just driving me nuts because everything else is perfectly positioned. Note that I am using fancy zones to do this placement, but everything else works fine. </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;needsinfo;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,1696948;,void2258

Previously using a very old 78.5 version for many years. I now have a row of buttons on the toolbar at the very top.  The first button is ""Get Messages.""  When I first open Thunderbird and click that button, nothing happens.  If I right click that button I see two options.  One is to ""Get All New Messages"" and the other is the name of my only account.  If I click the ""Get All New Messages"" option, it still does not work.  If I click the name of my account, it proceeds to asks for my password and look for new messages.  There is also a small button that looks like a cloud with a down arrow below Menu Bar under the word File.  That is also used to Get Messages.  When I click that button after first opening Thunderbird, it works.  It asks for my password and looks for new messages.  The odd thing is this.  After I get it to work the first time and I type in my password and it look for new messages, then the ""Get Messages"" button at the top that did not work at first now works.  So when first open Thunderbird that button does not work to do the first check for new mail.  After using the cloud icon the do the first check when first opening Thunderbird, then the larger button at the top works. Anyone know why it works this way?

Mine is different: ""The folder 'Trash on my@email.com' could not be compacted because writing to folder failed. Verify that you have enough disk space, and that you have write privileges to the file system, then try again."" It now happens on two different email addresses (one is POP one is IMAP). Trash seems otherwise to work and can be deleted. But still this alarm.
