I like Thunderbird with it's modern new design very much!,"<p>Dear community, </p><p>I have decided and will stick with Mozilla Thunderbird, with hopefully future support for important and established standards such as IMAP, Card DAV, Cal DAV and so on. Apart from the other free providers, I have also spent a long time studying the many options and settings of this client. Very few seem oversized or inappropriate. Very nice, minimalist design and functional! Some people should be ashamed of what they complain and demand. I am a big fan of my own domains and emails from established hosting platforms. Email is more important to me than social media and messaging apps. I really appreciate your work. This is not about annoying advertising and money, but about passion and commitment. You guys make me happy. Thank you. </p><p><em>Daniel Hill</em> </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",aidedee

But then, I learned that I can not log into Proton mail unless I purchase a bridge. So, I changed to have Thunderbird to log into my gmail account. But now I find myself running around in an infinate loop and I don't went to be in this loop forever. I keep getting the message, Incoming server already exists.
