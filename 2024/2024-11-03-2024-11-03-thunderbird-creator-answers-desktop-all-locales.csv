The instructions tell me to open the calendar, select file or mailing list.  There is no file or mailing list to select.  I cannot find it anyway.  I can add a contact, but no list.  My account is a gmail account.  Created the caldav address book, and my contact imported just fine. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",nealbrecht

I am being prompted every twenty minutes about an event from last week.  The Dismiss and Dismiss All buttons on the reminder form do nothing. </p><p>I am using Thunderbird 128.4.0esr (64-bit).  The calendar is set up through Provider for Google Calendar version 128.0.0. </p><p>(Doing nothing is an improvement over the built-in calendar, which threw an error message every time instead). </p><p>This seems to be a persistent problem many users have encountered over the years, judging by past support requests from people with the same issue. Is there any way to dismiss these notifications? If not I will be uninstalling Thunderbird and finding a different email client. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",aperkinsva7arp

I was thinking about switching to TB as I don't use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc., I only use Outlook. My question is...........I have 3 email addresses, and in my main address, I have about 10 different folders, like computer, travels, friends, jokes, business, health, ebay, etc., etc. In a few of these folders I have thousands of saved old emails I'd like to keep. Will TB be able to store all those old 5,000 or 10,000 emails??  Exactly how would I transfer all those folders and emails to TB?? I'm not too computer savy, so please let me know exact steps to take.      Thanks much!!    Bob </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",bbarletta

They also deleted or uninstalled my Thunderbird at the same time--they deny doing it. I reinstalled T-bird and downloaded my current inbox from webmail, but 25+ years of work and personal email files saved in Local Folders were missing, along with my address book. Carbonite recovered &gt;130GB of T-bird files that I think and hope are my saved files and put them in one big folder on my desk top--hours later, Hurricane Helene hit. I have my replacement computer now and a recovery drive from Carbonite with&gt;450G of my data on it, including my earlier recovered Thunderbird files. </p><p>Question: how do I get those files and address book back into my Thunderbird? This is critical for me. I'm a writer, and all my professional communications are in them, along with all my volunteer work and personal messages--more than 25 years' worth! Between the hurricane and this, I've lost more than a month of work already as well as contacts, medical records, etc.. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",kmckay23
