It's saved in the Drafts folder. Obviously it's too large to send in this state so I've investigated what services are available. I used WeTransfer in the past but this seems to limit the message size. I installed FileLink using the default service. The message now has a Thunderbird Send button on the menu bar (next to the Attach button) but clicking it does nothing. I don't want to use the Attach button though since all the files are already attached. Clicked Send and saw the usual warnings about the message size being way too large for the server. Wondered how FileLink will work. Read the FileLink help again and decided to detach everything and attach them again using Attach &gt; FileLink &gt; Thunderbird Send.  I navigate to the folder of interest and select the first group of four photos. A panel is displayed for one of files containing Info, Options and Donate buttons, with Download limit and Time limit drop-down lists. Two ""Make sure it is less than ..."" statements point me to the Send service provider. I don't know how to get there though so I populate with numbers, which turn out to be too high when I click encrypt and upload, and an error box is shown. 1 download and 3 days seems to work.  Sending this message on a Friday is probably not the best idea as nothing is expected to happen before Monday and 3 days is too tight. I could be resending the message next week. I add the next batch of files and another panel pops up for one of them, and I duly respond. Presumably the others are ok? Attachments at the bottom of the message window have 'working' roundels by them so I put the laptop on one side to let them do their thing while I sip my tea. Refreshments over and back to TB. Still in progress but while changing between windows I notice more panels are lurking, one for each attachment, which was unexpected. Making the same choices for each attachment is a bind (excuse the pun). Nine files are uploaded and two smaller screenshots remain as regular attachments. I check over the download URLs embedded in the message. I modify the message content accordingly and send it. </p><p>I would value step-by-step instructions for this process. It's one that I do infrequently so I can't remember what I did before! Must be my age. </p><p>Any suggestions gratefully received.

As of several days ago, Thunderbird will not receive messages from my yahoo account. I can send messages, but not receive them. I created a new account for the same (yahoo) email and let Thunderbird pick the settings so I know everything is correct. That account does not receive email either - no surprise, the settings are the same. I tried another email client (spark), and it works well, but I prefer Thunderbird as I use it for my other email account. I have turned off the firewall and virus protection, but this did not fix the problem. I added Thunderbird to the exceptions for the Windows Firewall and this did not fix it either.

For most people, I believe the option found at Settings&gt;General is sufficient. I also believe the default setting to automatically apply updates is appropriate if users do periodic backups. But I respect there are those who have strong feelings on the topic, and those who run a business and rely on stability more than new features. I acknowledge this information may be available elsewhere, and possibly superior in its approach, but this does work. So, here are the steps:  </p> <pre>-   Create a simple text file called policies.json  -   Enter this text into the file:     {      ""policies"": {         ""ManualAppUpdateOnly"": true,         ""AppAutoUpdate"": false,         ""AppUpdateURL"": ""<a href=""https://yoursiteisnothere.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yoursiteisnothere.com</a>""       }    }  - create a folder named ‘distribution’ and store it in the folder where thunderbird.exe resides. For Windows, that would be normally be C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\ or C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\ - place the file called policies.json in the distribution directory - start Thunderbird  - to verify this, click Settings&gt;General and scroll down to Updates. There, you should see the words,            “Failed to check for updates.”  (See attached screenshots for examples.)  </pre> <p>If you later decide you want an update, the file or folder must be removed or renamed. If changes are made while Thunderbird is running, you must exit and restart for the change to take effect.  </p><p>NOTE: My suggestion to persons using this technique is to, at least twice per year, download the latest version,  test to your satisfaction along with any addon updates. The intent is to stay relatively current for releases, security, and support. To never update is not recommended. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1634737;1634772;,davidsk

The problem is, that when I navigate to a Sent folder, Thunderbird lists the messages in the Sent folder, but does not display any content of a message. If I choose to open a sent message in a new tab or window, this tab or window is completely blank, including the tab header. The error console does not log any message related to this. Any other folder (like Inbox, Trash or in Local Folders) show mails ok. When browsing with a file manager to the sent messages on the disk, then the messages are there with the correct content, as far as I can see. At least I can read the mail body like this. So, what could cause Thunderbird to list sent mails but not display them? Any help is appreciated. And if I can provide more useful information, I will do.
