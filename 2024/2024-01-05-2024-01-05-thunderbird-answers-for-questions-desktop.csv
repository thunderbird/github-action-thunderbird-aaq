But I think you are talking about trying to use a method of relay via another server to send. </p><p>Generally the iprimus SMTP server settings would be: </p> <ul><li> Outgoing Server SMTP: <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a> </li><li> Port: 25 </li><li> Connection Security: None </li><li> Authentication Method: Password transmitted insecurely </li><li> User Name: full email address </li></ul> <p>Did you previously select 'Authentication Method' to send password insecurely?  Or did you select  'No authentication'&nbsp;?  If the latter then try  using 'Password transmitted insecurely'. </p><p>However, you may find the residential home ISP is blocking port 25 for security reasons. This is the ISP not allowing sent via port 25 as a relay for other servers. It's also common for most public wifi hotspots to block port 25 as well. It's a common practice among ISPs to prevent spam and other email-related security issues and most commonly used by hotels etc. </p><p>Usually, you can try the following to see if it gets allowed but I did not find these settings mentioned by iprimus. </p> <ul><li> Outgoing Server SMTP: <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a> </li><li> Port: 587 </li><li> Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> User Name: full email address </li></ul> <p>In addition make sure the computer Firewall (note if installed Anti-Virus then it may control the Firewall) has Thunderbird program set up as an allowed program. </p><p>An alternative you could try would be to create a gmail account and get emails forwarded from iprimus account to the gmail account, then set up gmail account in Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I suggest you start by getting this sorted first. </p><p>In 'Multifloor Gdansk' account you seem to have two 'Sent' folders. </p> <ol><li> Elementy wyslane  (Items Sent) </li><li> Wyslane  (Sent) </li></ol> <p>You should not have two sent folders.

'Elementy wyslane'  (Items Sent)  OR Wyslane  (Sent)&nbsp;? </p><p>Log on to your webmail account via a browser and send a test email to another email address, which folder does the server auto put the copy of that sent email. Is copy of sent email in the 'Sent' or the 'Items Sent' folder&nbsp;? Whatever folder received that copy of webmail sent email is the folder you need to use in the imap account in Thunderbird.  </p><p>In Thunderbird: 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Copies &amp; Folders' for the 'Multifloor Gdansk' account Select 'Place a copy in': Select 'Other' and choose the correct folder - the one the server uses by default. </p><p>Then you need to remove the other one as it causes confusion. If there are sent emails in the wrong sent folder then move them to the correct sent folder. Then compact that wrong sent folder. </p><p>Finally, remove the wrong sent folder by unsubscribing to see it. In Folder Pane&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Multifloor Gdansk' account folder and select 'Subscribe' (Subskrybuj) </li><li> Select the sent folder which is not used by server </li><li> Click on 'Unsubscribe'  (Zrezygnuj z subskrypcji) </li><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>This should then mean you only have the one sent folder.
