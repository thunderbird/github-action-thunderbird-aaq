Or did you select  'No authentication'&nbsp;?  If the latter then try  using 'Password transmitted insecurely'. </p><p>However, you may find the residential home ISP is blocking port 25 for security reasons. This is the ISP not allowing sent via port 25 as a relay for other servers. It's also common for most public wifi hotspots to block port 25 as well. It's a common practice among ISPs to prevent spam and other email-related security issues and most commonly used by hotels etc. </p><p>Usually, you can try the following to see if it gets allowed but I did not find these settings mentioned by iprimus. </p> <ul><li> Outgoing Server SMTP: <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a> </li><li> Port: 587 </li><li> Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> User Name: full email address </li></ul> <p>In addition make sure the computer Firewall (note if installed Anti-Virus then it may control the Firewall) has Thunderbird program set up as an allowed program. </p><p>An alternative you could try would be to create a gmail account and get emails forwarded from iprimus account to the gmail account, then set up gmail account in Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

For those of you still using the old method of making a profile folder backup (as I was) - old method: where you go to thunderbird help &gt; troubleshooting information &gt; scroll down to profile folder - click on open profile folder &gt;&gt; then close thunderbird and go one level up in the folder tree and copy the folder ""thunderbird"" - that is the profile folder then paste it into an external drive - this is the backup. This unzipped copy of all the profile files contains these long file names. Searching for tools in mozilla right after i posted this i found that the new/better way is to use the thunderbird export tool - my profile folder is &gt;&gt; larger than 2GB so i used the large size method - into a zip and of course that copy/pasted just fine because now the only file name is the name of the zip file.

I agree that must be a reason though i have no idea what it might be or what to do about it.
