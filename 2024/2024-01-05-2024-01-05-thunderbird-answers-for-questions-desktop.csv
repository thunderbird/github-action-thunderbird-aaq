Or did you select  'No authentication'&nbsp;?  If the latter then try  using 'Password transmitted insecurely'. </p><p>However, you may find the residential home ISP is blocking port 25 for security reasons. This is the ISP not allowing sent via port 25 as a relay for other servers. It's also common for most public wifi hotspots to block port 25 as well. It's a common practice among ISPs to prevent spam and other email-related security issues and most commonly used by hotels etc. </p><p>Usually, you can try the following to see if it gets allowed but I did not find these settings mentioned by iprimus. </p> <ul><li> Outgoing Server SMTP: <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a> </li><li> Port: 587 </li><li> Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> User Name: full email address </li></ul> <p>In addition make sure the computer Firewall (note if installed Anti-Virus then it may control the Firewall) has Thunderbird program set up as an allowed program. </p><p>An alternative you could try would be to create a gmail account and get emails forwarded from iprimus account to the gmail account, then set up gmail account in Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

While the new address book has improved the CSV import by orders of magnitude,  it  is not anything like automatic in most cases.  It might even be a good use for AI, guessing what fields might be the same thing. </p><p>I just ran the import on a CSV file I happened to have with contacts and email addresses.  I am not sure where it came from  but it demonstrates the idea that you have to manually map stuff. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-01-08-00-31-29-454b3b.png""> </p><p>If you look on the left of the table,  you have the field names defined in the import file.  On the right the filed names the data will be placed in and in the middle the actual data. </p><p>So the first line is OK,  the name is going to the address book first name field. The second and subsequent are rubbish. It is intending to put the files email address in as the last name,  so you need to click the down arrow and actually correct that to something you might be able to use. Like Primary email address and so on for each field from the file you wish to import and by unticking the field you can skip it. </p><p>Once you have the file fields of data and where the program is planning on putting it all squared away. Then you click continue.  Until then you are almost guaranteed to implement the old computer adage of garbage in,  garbage out.  If due to some weird act of god,  the field names in the CSV and Thunderbird import fields align. Or you modified the file data labels like David suggested,  you skip the manual alignment of fields. </p><p>My feeling is that CSV import and export should be avoided by most folk as they simply do not expect a manual process. This is further complicated by most folk opening the CSV file in excel at some point and only the latest two? versions of excel can read and save the Unicode text files that windows uses for CSV without scrambling them for any use but in excel. </p><p>Unless CSV import is executed correctly and methodically it rarely works and if you are new to CSV you need someone to hold your hand because there are a lot of gotchas.   I generally spend some time massaging the data in LibreOffice,  export to CSV and then import because the format is really just not defined as such.  CSV is like a road.  You know one when you see one.  But there are a million and one variations and the definition is very loose. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,0

For those of you still using the old method of making a profile folder backup (as I was) - old method: where you go to thunderbird help &gt; troubleshooting information &gt; scroll down to profile folder - click on open profile folder &gt;&gt; then close thunderbird and go one level up in the folder tree and copy the folder ""thunderbird"" - that is the profile folder then paste it into an external drive - this is the backup. This unzipped copy of all the profile files contains these long file names. Searching for tools in mozilla right after i posted this i found that the new/better way is to use the thunderbird export tool - my profile folder is &gt;&gt; larger than 2GB so i used the large size method - into a zip and of course that copy/pasted just fine because now the only file name is the name of the zip file.

I agree that must be a reason though i have no idea what it might be or what to do about it. However i just found the work around - backup the profile folder using thunderbird's export tool - it compresses all the files into a zip so no ""exposed"" long file names that run afoul of the windows long file name problem. </p>",billJ24556,false,0,0
