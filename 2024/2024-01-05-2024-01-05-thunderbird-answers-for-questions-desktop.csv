But I think you are talking about trying to use a method of relay via another server to send. </p><p>Generally the iprimus SMTP server settings would be: </p> <ul><li> Outgoing Server SMTP: <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a> </li><li> Port: 25 </li><li> Connection Security: None </li><li> Authentication Method: Password transmitted insecurely </li><li> User Name: full email address </li></ul> <p>Did you previously select 'Authentication Method' to send password insecurely?  Or did you select  'No authentication'&nbsp;?  If the latter then try  using 'Password transmitted insecurely'. </p><p>However, you may find the residential home ISP is blocking port 25 for security reasons. This is the ISP not allowing sent via port 25 as a relay for other servers. It's also common for most public wifi hotspots to block port 25 as well. It's a common practice among ISPs to prevent spam and other email-related security issues and most commonly used by hotels etc. </p><p>Usually, you can try the following to see if it gets allowed but I did not find these settings mentioned by iprimus. </p> <ul><li> Outgoing Server SMTP: <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a> </li><li> Port: 587 </li><li> Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> User Name: full email address </li></ul> <p>In addition make sure the computer Firewall (note if installed Anti-Virus then it may control the Firewall) has Thunderbird program set up as an allowed program. </p><p>An alternative you could try would be to create a gmail account and get emails forwarded from iprimus account to the gmail account, then set up gmail account in Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
