I do use virtualbox but my host is linux (ubuntu 24.04)  and thunderbird runs on the host. (fyi: Windows 10 is the guest ... I only use it so that I can run Quicken)Anyway,  Anyway, thanks for thinking about this. I think I have it mostly solved: </p><pre>  I happened upon top-level folder (in my main home directory) named,  snap   snap  contains a thunderbird sub-folder, which contains a common subfolder,   which contains a .thunderbird subfolder   which contains a Mail subfolder   which contains a  Local Folders  subfolder   which I replaced with the Local Folders folder that I had backed up. </pre> <p>When I restarted the machine, I FINALLY saw my entire list of email folders. Now, I understand that all should have been obvious to me from the start. Nevertheless, I am pleased to finally have found them. </p><p>I still have not been able to restore my address book.  I think its name is  abook.sqlite  plus supporting files such as abook.sqlite-wal ... and other associated files. I tried the same think that worked for my email folders, replacing the two small abook.* folders with the 5 abook.* folders that I had backed up in snap/thunderbird/common/sjb519n6.default but my (sizeable) address books did not reappear. </p>",pezust,false,0,0
