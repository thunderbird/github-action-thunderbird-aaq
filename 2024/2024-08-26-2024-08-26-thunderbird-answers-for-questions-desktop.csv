The folder LPI worked but the icons in default density were too large so the less LPI pixels cut off the folder names (like the bottom of the 'g' and 'p', etc).  However, I solved that by setting density at ""compact"" then adjusting the LPI to 26px for both the folder pane and the email-list pane (threads pane?).  The ""Events"" pane adjusted so that was ok. </p><p>So this worked.  Thanks very much! &nbsp;:-) </p>",BPaul_H,false,0,0

Be sure that thunderbird is not running. copy from c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to USB drive. When copying this way, Windows copies every file. then paste the thunderbird folder into c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the existing thunderbird folder.
