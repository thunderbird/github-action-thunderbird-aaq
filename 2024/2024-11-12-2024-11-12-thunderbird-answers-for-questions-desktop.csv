If Anti-virus is allowed to scan etc anything in your profile folders it has a problem because it does not undrestand how emails are stored. </p><p>Emails are downloaded to Inbox and stored in a single mbox text file called 'Inbox' (no extension). Each email is written to that file, one after the other as they are downloaded. So, one single text file document may contain a lot of emails. Anti-Virus does not know this. If it finds one email has an attachment it does not like, then if you have the setting to auto fix or you allow the fix then it's likely the entire file will get 'fixed' and this will result in email loss. </p><p>This is one of the reasons why you should create several Folders in Thunderbird to organise and store emails, so they are not all in one file. I would also advise that you do not allow any Anti-Virus or malware product access to your profile name folders OR if you do, then never allow/permit a fix, just make a note of where the problem is located. Please note: sometimes the bad file was already deleted, but not completely removed from profile - if you compact all folders then that will clean up and remove hidden marked as deleted old mail. Sometimes this in itself sotrs out the problem.  Otherwise, if you know which file had problem, you can create a folder on desktop and then export copies of all  emails in say the Inbox to that new folder on desktop as .eml files. Then run scan of that desktop folder. If it locates a bad email, then you know which one to delete in the Inbox in Thunderbird. Finally, delete the fodler on desktop and empty the computer recycle bin. A Bit long winded but you find the issue and don't lose emails. </p><p>However...you need to try and restore emails...I'll post in a another email/comment. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
