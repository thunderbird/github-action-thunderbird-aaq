If Anti-virus is allowed to scan etc anything in your profile folders it has a problem because it does not undrestand how emails are stored. </p><p>Emails are downloaded to Inbox and stored in a single mbox text file called 'Inbox' (no extension). Each email is written to that file, one after the other as they are downloaded. So, one single text file document may contain a lot of emails. Anti-Virus does not know this. If it finds one email has an attachment it does not like, then if you have the setting to auto fix or you allow the fix then it's likely the entire file will get 'fixed' and this will result in email loss. </p><p>This is one of the reasons why you should create several Folders in Thunderbird to organise and store emails, so they are not all in one file. I would also advise that you do not allow any Anti-Virus or malware product access to your profile name folders OR if you do, then never allow/permit a fix, just make a note of where the problem is located. Please note: sometimes the bad file was already deleted, but not completely removed from profile - if you compact all folders then that will clean up and remove hidden marked as deleted old mail. Sometimes this in itself sotrs out the problem.  Otherwise, if you know which file had problem, you can create a folder on desktop and then export copies of all  emails in say the Inbox to that new folder on desktop as .eml files. Then run scan of that desktop folder. If it locates a bad email, then you know which one to delete in the Inbox in Thunderbird. Finally, delete the fodler on desktop and empty the computer recycle bin.

Two of those pop account folders have a problem. Only you know which ones they are. If you are unsure...in the pop account folder there will be an Inbox file no extension - open it using Notepad++ and you should be able to see contents and there might be an email address helping you id that account.  </p><p>You can now look in the backup 'Mail' folder and Copy the relevant backup pop mail account folder and paste it into the current profile 'Mail' folder and let it overwrite the original OR just delete the original and paste in the copy. </p><p>Do this for both of the problem pop mail accounts. </p><p><strong>2.

What do you mean by  'main folder' ...is it 'Inbox'&nbsp;? If yes, then you need the 'Inbox' mbox file - it has no extension. 'Inbox' is an mbox file and contains emails. It has no extension - this is the file to import. 'Inbox.msf' is an index file used by Thundrbird and it does not contain any emails. 'Inbox.sbd' is a folder which may contain mbox files - this is only created if the 'Inbox' had subfolders. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:Where can I find the right file for the import? Is it right about inbox or inbox.msf?</em> In order to verify that you really are looking at the correct location.... Please post an image showing where your backup is located. I need you to have View &gt; using 'Details' so you see column headers - Name, Modified Date, Type, Size I need to see the complete directory, to see where the backup is located. I was expecting it to be on another drive etc. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:yesterday I tried to recover the mails after the backup, with creating a new profile ,</em> Do you know what a new profile is? Sorry if I cause offence, but recently, I've come across several people who get very mixed up and think a mail account is a profile. If you have a good backup then you do not need to create a new profile. I'm not sure what instructions you followed, but if you were intending to copy over the entire backup of a profile name folder which is more than whats required but..... it would have entailed something like this: </p> <ul><li> In Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Under 'Application Basics' section </li><li> near the bottom - Profiles - click on 'About:profiles' </li><li> It opens in a new tab. </li><li> Click on 'Create a new Profile. </li><li> clickon Next </li><li> Give it a new name - 'Default User' is written by default, so use it or type something like 'Default Rec' and click on 'Finish' </li><li> A new profile gets created, but it's completely empty at this point. </li></ul> <ul><li> Then you Exit Thunderbird </li><li> Access the backup profile ...please note the backup will look like same location as where you have normal folders - so please make sure you really are looking at the backup. </li></ul> <p>Backup...C://Users/&lt;username&gt;/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/&lt;<strong>profile name</strong>&gt; </p> <ul><li> you need to be looking at the contents of the '<strong>profile name'</strong> folder as described in previous comment.  </li><li> Highlight everything in that backup 'profile name folder - Ctrl+A </li><li> Right click on highlighted items and click on 'Copy' </li></ul> <p>Then Access the current profile: </p> <ul><li>     In windows search type: %Appdata% </li><li>     select the 'Appdata' file folder option </li><li>     Select 'Roaming' folder </li><li>     Select 'Thunderbird' folder </li><li>     select 'Profiles' folder </li><li>     select the &lt;profile name&gt; folder which you have just created called eg: 'Default Rec' to see it's contents. It will have a load of letters and numbers followed by the .default rec part. </li><li> It will not contain much maybe one file  - If it contains a load of files and folders because you were trying to do something - then delete them all so the profile name folder is now empty. </li><li> Then Paste all the copied files and folders from the backed up profile name folder into that 'Default Rec' profile name folder. So basically the new profile now contains all the files etc contained in the backup profile name folder. </li></ul> <p>AS the  'profiles.ini' file knows the new profile exists, and you have just modified it's contents, you do not need to edit anything nor point any profiles to look at  other profiles. Job done. </p><p>When you start Thunderbird, it may start automatically on that 'Default New' profile. You will know what is default by checking the 'about:profiles' again. </p><p><br> Please note - there is an assumption the backup was created before you had the Anti-Virus software attempt to fix things AND there is also an assumption the backup was not stored on the computer, otherwise the Anti-Virus may have fixed the backup as well&nbsp;!   I'm not sure what you allowed that Anti-Virus to do, but going forward, I would advise you do not let any Anti-Virus anywhere near your Thunderbird profile and never let it attempt to fix anything. Always keep a backup on another drive preferably an external drive. </p><p>So...where is the backup located&nbsp;? As I said - post image showing it's location including full directory. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Copying the profile folder is a guaranteed way to have thunderbird work as anticipated. If there is a problem, it is in the copying. Many proprietary copy programs attempt to optimize the transfer process and, in doing so, corrupt the profile. If the old computer boots, I suggest trying again. Or, if the hard drive can be accessed, the profile can be copied. I think what you're really asking here is ""I have a profile that doesn't work. How do I fix it?""  If that is the situation, then posting a screenshot of whatever Thunderbird data you have may help. On the default WIndows configuration, the profile is at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles\&lt;profile name&gt;. Ideally, users who copy the thunderbird profile have everything needed on new PC. Screenshots of the profile folder, plus of the imapmail folder within the profile and the Mail folder also will be helpful. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
