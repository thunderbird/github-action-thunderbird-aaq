However, one of the mail folders that I can see in my new profile on the MacBook is not appearing on the Folder Pane when I open Thunderbird. It's part of my Local Folders so I tried to add a folder of the same name and it told me that there was already a folder by that name. So it's definitely there but just inaccessible through the Folder Pane. Is there a magic way to get all folders to show up? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1664466;1664472;,pkcweir

I spent hours attempting to recover five years worth of data through online means, with absolutely no success. I eventually made a donation to Mozilla in order to hopefully reinstall this program in a desperate attempt recover all of these files, but have still made no progress. Please, please help me to recover this information. Thank you in advance for any help you can offer. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Trashfiend
