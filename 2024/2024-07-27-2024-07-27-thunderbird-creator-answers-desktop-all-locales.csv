However, one of the mail folders that I can see in my new profile on the MacBook is not appearing on the Folder Pane when I open Thunderbird. It's part of my Local Folders so I tried to add a folder of the same name and it told me that there was already a folder by that name. So it's definitely there but just inaccessible through the Folder Pane. Is there a magic way to get all folders to show up? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",pkcweir
