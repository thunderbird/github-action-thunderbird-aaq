However, one of the mail folders that I can see in my new profile on the MacBook is not appearing on the Folder Pane when I open Thunderbird. It's part of my Local Folders so I tried to add a folder of the same name and it told me that there was already a folder by that name. So it's definitely there but just inaccessible through the Folder Pane. Is there a magic way to get all folders to show up? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1664466;1664472;,pkcweir

Recently I installed Ubuntu 24.04 on another partition, including Thunderbird 128.0esr, now installed as a snap package (it's a recent change in Ubuntu; instead of apt package previously). </p><p>The new Thunderbird correctly reads my emails (imap) but it cannot send emails, save drafts or mark emails as read on the server. So I have Thunderbird 115 on the old partition working perfectly, but Thunderbird 128 not working on the same GMail account (I also have the same problem with another non-GMail account). I checked the smtp settings carefully, they are identical between the two versions. </p><p>It's possible I made a mistake, but I'm at a loss about what is wrong. How can I diagnose and solve this problem? </p><p>(I know that I could reinstall Thunderbird with the apt package, but I assume that the snap package should work too and I would like to understand the cause) </p><p>I'd be grateful for any advice </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",erwan.more
