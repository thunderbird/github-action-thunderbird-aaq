If there is already an answer here, I apologize for not finding it and asking again. </p><p>I support a small business.  The main email address is office@&lt;mydomain&gt;.com.  Three of us monitor that account, on three separate computers.  We have always struggled with not knowing if one of the others already responded to an email or not.  This has led to us either spamming the person submitting the inquiry, or all of us ""ignoring"" it by assuming someone else responded. </p><p>Is there a way for Thunderbird to monitor and indicate if the email was replied to on any of the systems, not just the one we're sitting in front of?  We own the domain and host our email server through inmotion hosting, which gives us lots of control if something needs to be configured server-side. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1632792;1632806;,office743

A questo punto il messaggio del programma era sempre lo stesso e cioè che non poteva accedere al mio profilo e non si apriva per poterci lavorare o comunque per cambiare impostazioni ecc.

I check my messages on the isp webmail service during the day, so I know roughly how many messages will be downloading when I run Thunderbird. </p><p>Last night Thunderbird crashed midway through downloading emails and it took several attempts to reopen it.  When I did get back in emails from the past 3 days are not in the inbox, but they have been deleted from the web server.  They weren't in the deleted folder when I checked. </p><p>I contacted my isp to ask if they could recover the emails, but they didn't think they could with the emails having been deleted from the server. </p><p>I'm unable to confirm if the emails did download but they were removed from the web server so I wanted to know if there was any way to recover them within Thunderbird?

One eventually reappeared but the second one will not.Message is 'incoming server already exists! I used ot have both side by side!,"<p>I have been usibg Thunderbird to manage mail, calendar, contacts since Nov 2022 with little problem. Suddenly the two email addresses disappeared. I have followed all the help I found on this forum - uninstalling Thunderbird, re-installing and re-entering the IMAP details. One account - after receiving the message - 'incoming server already exists' in a loop - suddenly populated the address. I cannot get the second one to get past the same message - and all the folders I had set up are gone. Please advise what is the issue.  I am using Windows 11 and the emails are gmail.Thank you! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",SuziM
