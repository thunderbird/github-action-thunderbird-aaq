I'm an old man with computer knowledge that ended with a computer science degree in 1984 which I haven't used since. So I have a general idea but it's forty years old... I'm using Thunderbird 115.7.0 (64-bit) on a 2021 Dell Alienware computer with the 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz 2.30 GHz processor and 64 GB of RAM using Microsoft Windows 11 Pro Version 22H2 OS Build 22621.3007... I also have McAfee LiveSafe Virus Protection software installed: Version 114.212 Release Name 16.0 R114 Affid 20327 Antivirus Build 1.1.2569.0 Content Creation Date 01/25/2024 Content Version 1665.0 Secure VPN Build 9 Version 1.14... Here's the problem... When I try to download my emails the computer goes into super duper slow motion. I also have a wired wifi connection that's the fastest Spectrum offers and almost nothing else shares it so it's usually very fast. I also get Thunderbird error messages (i should have screen shots sorry) about not being able to read something or other or write to some folders and perhaps needing permission. As an aside, I'm the only user of the computer so no permissions are ever needed. Also, this only happens when I first turn on the computer and there are a number of emails to download. Once I've downloaded the bulk email and I later check or it automatically checks, it will download the one or two messages slowly but without errors... Thanks again, I hope someone can help... Take care... </p>",z5jt84wrvj;davidsk;barrym;Toad-Hall;,true,false,false,";category:fix-problems;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird",12,0,0,,,

Removed accounts manually and added them back into thunderbird.  Still had problems. 4). Went out to the microsoft account management and switched 2 step process login and turned that off.  Did not solve the problem. 5). Read online and saw that people change the authentication method to: OEAUTH2.  I put in the password when the window popped up to login to my account, but if I close down the program and open it later, it pops up this box to login again.  Switched it back to normal password. 6). Verified passwords are correct in Password manager. </p><p>Now what is interesting is if I have it as normal password, sometimes when I click ""retry"" for the password, it magically works and pulls in my emails.
