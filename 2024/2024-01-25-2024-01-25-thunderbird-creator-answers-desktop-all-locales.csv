I'm an old man with computer knowledge that ended with a computer science degree in 1984 which I haven't used since. So I have a general idea but it's forty years old... I'm using Thunderbird 115.7.0 (64-bit) on a 2021 Dell Alienware computer with the 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz 2.30 GHz processor and 64 GB of RAM using Microsoft Windows 11 Pro Version 22H2 OS Build 22621.3007... I also have McAfee LiveSafe Virus Protection software installed: Version 114.212 Release Name 16.0 R114 Affid 20327 Antivirus Build 1.1.2569.0 Content Creation Date 01/25/2024 Content Version 1665.0 Secure VPN Build 9 Version 1.14... Here's the problem... When I try to download my emails the computer goes into super duper slow motion. I also have a wired wifi connection that's the fastest Spectrum offers and almost nothing else shares it so it's usually very fast. I also get Thunderbird error messages (i should have screen shots sorry) about not being able to read something or other or write to some folders and perhaps needing permission. As an aside, I'm the only user of the computer so no permissions are ever needed. Also, this only happens when I first turn on the computer and there are a number of emails to download. Once I've downloaded the bulk email and I later check or it automatically checks, it will download the one or two messages slowly but without errors... Thanks again, I hope someone can help... Take care... </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1632935;,z5jt84wrvj
