I'm an old man with computer knowledge that ended with a computer science degree in 1984 which I haven't used since. So I have a general idea but it's forty years old... I'm using Thunderbird 115.7.0 (64-bit) on a 2021 Dell Alienware computer with the 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz 2.30 GHz processor and 64 GB of RAM using Microsoft Windows 11 Pro Version 22H2 OS Build 22621.3007... I also have McAfee LiveSafe Virus Protection software installed: Version 114.212 Release Name 16.0 R114 Affid 20327 Antivirus Build 1.1.2569.0 Content Creation Date 01/25/2024 Content Version 1665.0 Secure VPN Build 9 Version 1.14... Here's the problem... When I try to download my emails the computer goes into super duper slow motion. I also have a wired wifi connection that's the fastest Spectrum offers and almost nothing else shares it so it's usually very fast. I also get Thunderbird error messages (i should have screen shots sorry) about not being able to read something or other or write to some folders and perhaps needing permission. As an aside, I'm the only user of the computer so no permissions are ever needed. Also, this only happens when I first turn on the computer and there are a number of emails to download. Once I've downloaded the bulk email and I later check or it automatically checks, it will download the one or two messages slowly but without errors... Thanks again, I hope someone can help... Take care... </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1632935;1633022;1633027;1634418;1634432;1636668;1636680;1636720;1637388;1637392;1637393;1637395;,z5jt84wrvj

Verified passwords are correct in Password manager. </p><p>Now what is interesting is if I have it as normal password, sometimes when I click ""retry"" for the password, it magically works and pulls in my emails.  I thought maybe it was related to my internet connection, so I tried it on 3 different internet connections and I get the same results. </p><p>My setup is as follows: </p><p>server: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> Port: 993 Connection Security: SSL/TLS Server Type IMAP server </p><p><br> </p><p>It is frustrating because like I said sometimes I click retry and it works for that specific account.  </p><p>Thank you again for all of your help. </p><p>Jeff </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1633074;1633204;1633213;1633270;1633297;1633306;1633309;1633352;,vacantlandadvice

Which is the issue I am having but I have 2 accounts tied through TB and only one is having the problem.  I looked at the settings and they are the same.  I tried changing the acct with the problem to authenticate with normal password and it asked for the password but it tells me it is a login failure.  Yet when I used the same login credentials at gmail I get right in.  Can you help or recommendations?  Thanks so much! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1633069;,info10695

Both on the same computer. My old thunderbird installation had the local folders set up to point to an external SSD. I hadn't used it in a few years, and when I restarted thunderbird it lost all of my local folder information. I moved the email files (e.g. 2006 and 2006.msf) from the SSD into the local folder of the installation (I found the local folder from Troubleshooting Information). It's still not showing up. First screenshot is of the files I copied and pasted. </p><p>I also tried importing but there was an error, second screenshot is of the error. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1633038;1633040;1633063;1633065;1633337;,anna.ceguerra

Upon clicking Send, the progress bar displays momentarily, then disappears and the following ""Send Message Error"" appears:  ""Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: &lt;r*******@twcny.rr.com&gt; sender rejected. The email address you are sending as must match the email address you used to auth. Please check your SMTP settings. AUP#Out-1500. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again.""  Consultation with Spectrum Road Runner tech support confirmed that the problem is not on Spectrum's end. Thunderbird account settings seem to be in order.  Curiously, though, I have three other ""profiles"" in Thunderbird e-mail (two locally hosted by a small firm and one <a href=""http://aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">aol.com</a>) and all three function normally, including sending. Any insights would be most appreciated, as such tech problems are way above my pay grade.
