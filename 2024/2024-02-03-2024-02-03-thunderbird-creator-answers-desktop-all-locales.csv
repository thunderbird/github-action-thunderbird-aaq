I did go an establish a key per the instructions I saw for doing so --&gt; account settings, end-to-end encryption, OpenPGP add key.

So for example, I received screenshots of an airline trip I'm doing, but the message contained the following: [A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated] Inbound Another example is receiving an email from a bank. Instead of showing the embedded link, it displayed as html. So, I can't read what was sent. Or it's hard to pick out the link. </p><p>I've gone to privacy and controls, but I can't find where I need to change this.  Please help. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",jennifer.mann.ca
