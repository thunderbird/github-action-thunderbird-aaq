But in general I would say that is not the normal expectation. </p><p>All emails are stored in 'All Mail' In an Imap account&nbsp;: If you delete an email and have it auto put into the gmail Trash folder then gmail will auto delete emails older than 30 days from Trash and also auto delete them from 'All Mail'. </p><p>If you do not auto put deleted mail into gmail Trash, you are in effect by-passing the gmail TRash, then gmail understands that to mean 'Do not Delete email' just delete the 'label' and then Archive the email in 'All Mail'.  So you still have it - it just does not have any labels attached to it. </p><p>In 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Server Settings' for gmail account 'When I delete a message' To put email you delete into the gmail Trash: 'Move it to this folder Select 'Trash on gmail email address' In my case gmail have called the Trash folder 'Bin' - seems some brits have a 'Bin' as 'Trash' </p><p>But What option have you got selected&nbsp;?  It's important we understand what you have got set up. </p><p>Also how do you delete&nbsp;? What buttons or icons or keyboard keys do you use&nbsp;? Just wondering if you are deliberately using 'Shift'+'Del'. </p><p>If things are reappearing and you have an issue with 'All Mail', then it sounds like this may be due to a lack of compacting. But regardless there may be some corruption. The 'Inbox', 'Drafts' and 'Spam' usually get the most activity when it comes to moving or deleting emails, so those 3 folders should get compacted on a regualr basis. Personally, I do it every day before exiting Thunderbird. But in your case you also have the 'All Mail' and that means usually it also needs compacting because it has everything. But in this instance, do not compact 'All Mail'. </p><p>under 'Message Storage' Select 'Clean up (Expunge) Inbox on Exit' </p><p>This then auto compacts the Inbox on exit cleaning up all the old traces of moved or deleted emails. This is good housekeeping and helps to maintain a healthy mbox file. But please remember to not exit/close down computer too quickly as Thunderbird will be performing background processes.  The alternative would be to not set the auto expunge/compact, but remember to do it manually before exiting, so you can be sure it has finished before you close Thunderbird. </p><p>Basically 'All Mail' is a massive file as it contains everything - incoming, saved in other folders,  junk/spam, outgoing, archived - everything all in one place. Basically, it just means you have a complete duplicate - two of everything in one account.  </p><p>Normally, I would advise people not to subscribe to the 'All Mail' because it's just a duplicate and uses up space on C: drive and in Thunderbird, it can be an enormous mbox file.  That means every single email is in one single text document. If it should get corrupted, it may effect every email you have in any folder.  If you have Anti-Virus installed as is the case with Windows OS (I note you are on Linux)  then it can try to auto fix any files it does not like and this may result in a complete loss of emails. Even if you do not have an Anti-Virus performing anything, that 'All Mail' folder needs regular compacting. That means recreating a second copy that just contains emails not marked as deleted, so that's another copy before the original is deleted. You do not want any corruption occuring with that mbox file.   </p><p>If you directly delete any email from the 'All Mail' folder then it gets auto deleted from Inbox or any imap folder.  </p><p><strong>DO THIS:</strong> I would advise you to 'unsubscribe' from seeing that 'All Mail' folder because it's too risky to compact it. </p><p>Then restart Thunderbird so it just removes the 'All Mail' data. Manually compact the 'Inbox', 'Drafts' and 'Spam'. Right click on folder and select 'Compact' Do each folder in turn. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;: Thunderbird 115.16.0esr (64-bit)</em> Is there any reason why you have not updated to a newer version of Thunderbird&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1
