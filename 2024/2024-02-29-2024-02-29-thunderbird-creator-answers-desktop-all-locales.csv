Naturally my business email is quite busy compared to my private one.  Lately, for no discernable reason, the business email will refuse to check messages.   Even in the tools &gt; activity manager, nothing shows up when it is asked to get messages.  The only way I've found to restore this is to go into the profile folder and delete the global-messages-db.sqlite, let it reindex (which take close to 20 minute) and then maybe after restarting again it might start getting the message again (even this isn't 100% effective).  Even if it does work, it is only a temporary fix and it will soon break again.  There are no error messages, just no response when asked to check messages.  If it is left running for a very long time (typically hours) it sometimes recovers on its own and will suddenly deluge me with hours worth of emails. </p><p>I have attempted to clean out history to see if it was just overflowing, but even after getting rid of multiple years of history, cutting the size roughly in half, it has no discernable affect other than speeding up that reindexing. </p><p>Meanwhile my private email account works perfectly fine and gives me no issues.  However, my business email is a lot more important and needs to be responding promptly.  I can't have it refusing to get message for long period for no reason. </p><p>Any help on this matter would be appreciated as I really don't want change clients, but I may have no choice soon. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1639570;1639626;1639758;1639800;1639915;1639923;,wadetritschler

For the past year or so, every few weeks, I open Thunderbird to find that it doesn't know who I am.  My entire account has seemingly disappeared!  The first time this happened, I nearly lost it.  I thought everything was gone.  After doing some research, I discovered the likely problem was that the prefs.js file in my profile folder was corrupted.  Going back to a backup (thank goodness for backups!) and copying an older version of prefs.js to replace the corrupted one fixed the problem - all my emails and folders were back as they were before.  Whew!  Until it happened again.  And again, and again, and again, etc., etc. </p><p>Since this is a well known problem (I found the ""fix"" noted above in Mozilla help), I assumed at some point there would be a permanent fix.  But several iterations of Thunderbird have come and gone since then and the problem remains.  I have used Thunderbird for nearly 20 years, and have loved it.  But if I don't find a solution for this problem, I may have to abandon the platform.  I can't afford to have my email client forget me every few weeks.  Resetting the prefs.js file takes time, and alarmingly it doesn't always work!  A few times I found my backup prefs.js also failed and had to rely on an even older backup which can sometimes be problematic if I changed any settings in the interval in between.  I REALLY hope someone has found a more permanent solution to this issue!  If you have, please post it and let us know where to find the cure for Thunderbirdheimer's!! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1639676;1639861;1639910;1640413;1640424;1640429;1640481;,ppriu
