Naturally my business email is quite busy compared to my private one.  Lately, for no discernable reason, the business email will refuse to check messages.   Even in the tools &gt; activity manager, nothing shows up when it is asked to get messages.  The only way I've found to restore this is to go into the profile folder and delete the global-messages-db.sqlite, let it reindex (which take close to 20 minute) and then maybe after restarting again it might start getting the message again (even this isn't 100% effective).  Even if it does work, it is only a temporary fix and it will soon break again.  There are no error messages, just no response when asked to check messages.  If it is left running for a very long time (typically hours) it sometimes recovers on its own and will suddenly deluge me with hours worth of emails. </p><p>I have attempted to clean out history to see if it was just overflowing, but even after getting rid of multiple years of history, cutting the size roughly in half, it has no discernable affect other than speeding up that reindexing. </p><p>Meanwhile my private email account works perfectly fine and gives me no issues.  However, my business email is a lot more important and needs to be responding promptly.  I can't have it refusing to get message for long period for no reason. </p><p>Any help on this matter would be appreciated as I really don't want change clients, but I may have no choice soon. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",wadetritschler

I use ""set up your existing email adress"" and enter my values for my gmail account. It says ""Configuration found in Mozilla ISP database"". I Press ""Done"" and it <strong>immediately</strong> comes up with the error message ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password."". I never get a pop-up allowing sign-in to Google. </p><p>On my old machine, having an older TB, I was connected to my gmail account (using OAuth authentication), so it is not a question of settings on the account. I have looked at all the suggestions I found by googling the problem and both cookies and JavaScript are enabled (I have literally not touched any settings, I attempt to set up this account on the first open of TB). In all the accounts i found from people having similar issues with TB and gmail, people are at least getting the google sign-in window/pop-up, but I am not even getting that. </p><p>Regards, Morten Larsen </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1639546;,mortenlarsen
