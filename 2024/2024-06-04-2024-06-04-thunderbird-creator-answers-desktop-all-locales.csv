I have not even gotten to the point of installing a eml to mbox software to move my folders, etc into TB from emClient.  I am changing because emC quit authenticating 'out of the blue'.  I have been getting and sending emails perfectly well in TB until about 4 days ago.  I get a message that says it cannot connect to Comcast server.  Nothing about authentication or a password.  It just stopped!  I talked to Comcast tech support today and they said everything on their end looked good.  I have spent several hours tonight going thru TB checking everything, reading this forums notes on unable to connect, restarted a couple of times, etc.  Needless to say, I am not happy and really don't know if I should ditch TB and go to a 3rd different email program.  (Note:  I am not one who changes often or without a fight to keep a program.)  I have been with emClient for over 10 yrs.  All their suggestions have not worked.  I like TB and really want it to work.   Suggestions please. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1655808;,karolcooper

An answer to someone else's problem said to be sure the local folder contains a true copy and not just a link, by checking that I could read it, but how do I do that for several thousand emails? Maybe they are all true copies in at least in one local folder? I need to remove a large chunk of 25000 gmails in All Mail to free up space on my hard disk. I was having problems with Global Search and followed instructions to re-index everything. Apart from taking several hours to index All Mail, I subsequently found that I could no longer get 2GB free space by using Disk Cleanup, the best I could get was about 300MB, which is apparently too small for Thunderbird to compact All Mail, or for Dropbox to sync with my mobile phone camera photos. The All Mail file in C:\Users\Michael\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\hgwapwu4.default\ImapMail\<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>\[Gmail].sbd is 4.5GB, and Important is 1GB </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1655755;,msturdy77
