I have not even gotten to the point of installing a eml to mbox software to move my folders, etc into TB from emClient.  I am changing because emC quit authenticating 'out of the blue'.  I have been getting and sending emails perfectly well in TB until about 4 days ago.  I get a message that says it cannot connect to Comcast server.  Nothing about authentication or a password.  It just stopped!  I talked to Comcast tech support today and they said everything on their end looked good.  I have spent several hours tonight going thru TB checking everything, reading this forums notes on unable to connect, restarted a couple of times, etc.  Needless to say, I am not happy and really don't know if I should ditch TB and go to a 3rd different email program.  (Note:  I am not one who changes often or without a fight to keep a program.)  I have been with emClient for over 10 yrs.  All their suggestions have not worked.  I like TB and really want it to work.   Suggestions please. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",karolcooper
