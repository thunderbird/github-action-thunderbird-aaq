SPAM/Scam toolbars and antivirus programs being my pet hates.  They cripple the software often.  I recommend an automatic exception for the Thunderbird profile folder in any antivirus product.  If you are using IMAP,  be aware simply deleting an email involved a round trip to the server and two interferences from antivirus in the process.  One on the outgoing request and one on the reply and that does not matter if there is an exception or not.  That is about file changes making the files unavailable when needed because they are now locked for scanning after each change.  50 deletions,  50 scans of the base storage file. </p><p>Is the program single threaded?  Not for years.  Just have a look in the Windows task manager. </p><p>The unified folder has been with Thunderbird since what version 3 I think. I have never fully trusted it,  but many use nothing else.   But there were issues with it post the version 115 release and the development team released an addon that can reset the unified folders as part of the debugging process. here <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/unified-folders-debugging/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/unified-folders-debugging/?src=ss</a> </p><p>Back in September last year when the addon was released the information that came with my email notifying me was""For users who have issues with 115.3.0 or newer, they should be encouraged to use this tool, and file a bug report with the diagnostic output (created before they try to ""fix"" the issue).""
