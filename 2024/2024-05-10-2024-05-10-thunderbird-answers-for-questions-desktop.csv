My 'guess' is that, if it is iMAP, the messages were still appearing on Thunderbird, but with a new server, there were no messages on the new server. So, since IMAP sync's to the server, the messages on PC would have been deleted. With more details, I may have guessed wrong. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Grey indicates your provider is moving the mail to spam/ considers the email spam and Thunderbird does not see the item as spam. </p><p>Note that Yahoo do not have any way to influence their spam filters.  You mark the message as not spam and move it somewhere else and within minutes yahoo will reverse your actions.  A thoroughly poor implementation in my opinion.
