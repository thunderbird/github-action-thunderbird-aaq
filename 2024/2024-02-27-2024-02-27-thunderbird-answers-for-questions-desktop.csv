It is not what Thunderbird needs,  it is that the domain's mail records are simply not complete at the DNS level.  Why your host or registrar would send you here I have no idea.  Sure you intend to use Thunderbird,  but you will be using it to connect to this mail server when it is fully configured.  Right now it is not even functional. </p><p>A check of the <a href=""http://parcelexshipcenter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">parcelexshipcenter.com</a> [70.34.33.112] address would indicate as David said it was hosted by hostpapa <a href=""https://ipinfo.io/70.34.33.112"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ipinfo.io/70.34.33.112</a> so I suggest you have a conversation with them about what you need to do to set up your domain to receive and send email. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ A check of the IP address you include for mail in the cpanel 96.83.96.213 appears to be a consumer IP address with comcast . <a href=""https://ipinfo.io/96.83.96.213"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ipinfo.io/96.83.96.213</a> </p><p>The router is defined as <a href=""http://96-83-96-213-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net"" rel=""nofollow"">96-83-96-213-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net</a> [96.83.96.213]  Do you have a mail server connected to your local network on that IP address?  If so you need to update the MX record in your domains DNS to record that IP as the registered mail exchanger (MX) for the domain. </p><p>At this point however I am thinking you actually have no mail server and are thinking the mail client (Thunderbird) will act as a mail server.  That will not work. Thunderbird is not a mail server.  See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mail_server_software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mail_server_software</a> </p><p>If you were to install a mail server package on the address on a server Thunderbird could connect to it to retrieve mail.  If you also installed an SMTP package Thunderbird could connect to that to send mail. </p><p>If it appears to be getting complicated quickly,  you are correct.  That is why folks generally employ a specialist for setting up and configuring their domain.  It is not really a DIY project (unless you have days and weeks to spend chasing the fine points of making it all work together) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The funny thing is that Thunderbird is still receiving/sending the emails from our gmail acct and we can manage them in our Thunderbird. Everything that was there at the domain place was working fine like you saw. The only change we made was to add the A Record 70. and the Cname for our new website hosted by someone else . Those were the only changes we made. Meaning that if we were to remove the website by removing the A Record 70. and the cname the email should have been working just fine just like it was before. is that right? I'm not saying that adding the website is what caused our email issues but like I said it was the only change we made. Nothing else was touched. Can you please tell me using the last picture I sent you, what we need to add or change so that Thunderbird starts working again? </p>",sales398,false,0,0

I am inferring that your host provider offers no assistance in what is usually an automatic service. That is, I am amazed that you, the customer, have to get involved with this. This doesn't speak well for the host provider. People at second-level support there should see this as a no-brainer and a 2-minute fix. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Your domain appears to be at namesilo and they offer two business email plans. Although it's not free, such plans actually work and there are real support persons for the account (although we still provide email management support for Thunderbird, as always). If administered at domain level, you bypass the web hosting involvement. Also, self-hosted accounts are not secure: anyone with web access can access all the accounts, bypassing passwords. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It would be physically separate, so any emails on the old account would need to be somehow copied. That may be possible from cpanel, but I've never attempted it. If there is a lot of mail there, getting the current situation fixed may be better in the short-term, but the support there seems questionable. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
