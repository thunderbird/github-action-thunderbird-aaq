It is not what Thunderbird needs,  it is that the domain's mail records are simply not complete at the DNS level.  Why your host or registrar would send you here I have no idea.  Sure you intend to use Thunderbird,  but you will be using it to connect to this mail server when it is fully configured.  Right now it is not even functional. </p><p>A check of the <a href=""http://parcelexshipcenter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">parcelexshipcenter.com</a> [70.34.33.112] address would indicate as David said it was hosted by hostpapa <a href=""https://ipinfo.io/70.34.33.112"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ipinfo.io/70.34.33.112</a> so I suggest you have a conversation with them about what you need to do to set up your domain to receive and send email. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ A check of the IP address you include for mail in the cpanel 96.83.96.213 appears to be a consumer IP address with comcast . <a href=""https://ipinfo.io/96.83.96.213"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ipinfo.io/96.83.96.213</a> </p><p>The router is defined as <a href=""http://96-83-96-213-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net"" rel=""nofollow"">96-83-96-213-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net</a> [96.83.96.213]  Do you have a mail server connected to your local network on that IP address?  If so you need to update the MX record in your domains DNS to record that IP as the registered mail exchanger (MX) for the domain. </p><p>At this point however I am thinking you actually have no mail server and are thinking the mail client (Thunderbird) will act as a mail server.  That will not work. Thunderbird is not a mail server.  See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mail_server_software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mail_server_software</a> </p><p>If you were to install a mail server package on the address on a server Thunderbird could connect to it to retrieve mail.  If you also installed an SMTP package Thunderbird could connect to that to send mail. </p><p>If it appears to be getting complicated quickly,  you are correct.  That is why folks generally employ a specialist for setting up and configuring their domain.
