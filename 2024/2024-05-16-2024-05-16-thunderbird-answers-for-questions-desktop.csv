Forse Thunderbird Portable ha delle limitazioni di quantità: quando salvo in zip tutta la cartella Thunderbird, il file .rar occupa alcuni giga, io l'ho configurato in modalità IMAP.

Non ho ancora verificato se su un altro PC, Thunderbird dà lo stesso problema, lo farò: ma quest'ultima installazione non è portable. Grazie comunque, Vincent p.s.
