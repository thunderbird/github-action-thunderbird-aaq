Ho disattivato l'accelerazione hardware (l'ho trovata nell'editor della configurazione), ma non c'è stato nulla da fare, non è cambiato niente.

In effetti ne ho moltissimi. Forse Thunderbird Portable ha delle limitazioni di quantità: quando salvo in zip tutta la cartella Thunderbird, il file .rar occupa alcuni giga, io l'ho configurato in modalità IMAP. Il problema me lo dà solo su uno dei quattro accounts configurati, quello di yahoo (in effetti è quello più utilizzato, contiene oltre 100 volte più messaggi degli altri tre messi insieme, senza contare i numerosi allegati). Non ho ancora verificato se su un altro PC, Thunderbird dà lo stesso problema, lo farò: ma quest'ultima installazione non è portable. Grazie comunque, Vincent p.s.

On occasion, this gets corrupted, causing what you saw, but can also cause the sender of one message to appear as sender of a different message -- the message is still correct and processes correctly, but can appear incorrectly on message list pane.
