Your settings for this are a firewall or your antivirus program and whether VPN settings themselves for this connection or with your SMTP configuration for outgoing internet traffic will not be as they should be today. Please look up the disruptive topic for a moment. Configure yourself what it would be? If you think you have a disturbing add-on or extension, you can boot into trouble shoot mode for Thunderbird. If not, it could be other software. Check whether you can do this with the add-ons disabled and find the disturbing piece of software add-on in this way and delete it. </p><p><br> </p><p>Greetings Firefox volunteer </p>",Googlethunderbird,false,0,0

Its history also does not show that it has blocked any access attempts by Thunderbird. I have no add-ons, and running Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode makes no difference. The only error messages from Thunderbird (in Activity Manager) read ""failed to connect with server <a href=""http://imap.dsl.pipex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.dsl.pipex.com</a>.""

For the phone to be in sync, both need to be set up as IMAP accounts. If unsure, highlight account name on main view, rightclick and select settings, then click 'server settings' and the type (IMAP or POP) will be displayed. Also, you cannot change an account from one to the other, but must set up a new account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
