Ho disattivato l'accelerazione hardware (l'ho trovata nell'editor della configurazione), ma non c'è stato nulla da fare, non è cambiato niente. Anzi ho notato altre anomalie (non dovute a quest'ultima operazione): oltre a non farmi vedere i nuovi messaggi, quando vado ad aprire i messaggi residenti in cartelle (vecchi, sono fermi al 6 maggio c.a.) alcuni non me li apre. In effetti ne ho moltissimi. Forse Thunderbird Portable ha delle limitazioni di quantità: quando salvo in zip tutta la cartella Thunderbird, il file .rar occupa alcuni giga, io l'ho configurato in modalità IMAP. Il problema me lo dà solo su uno dei quattro accounts configurati, quello di yahoo (in effetti è quello più utilizzato, contiene oltre 100 volte più messaggi degli altri tre messi insieme, senza contare i numerosi allegati). Non ho ancora verificato se su un altro PC, Thunderbird dà lo stesso problema, lo farò: ma quest'ultima installazione non è portable. Grazie comunque, Vincent p.s. Ne verrò fuori: passare ora come ora a un altro account necessiterebbe mesi e mesi, perlomeno per ricostruire l'alberatura delle numerosissime cartelle e trasferire tutti i messaggi </p>",vpisano56,false,0,0
