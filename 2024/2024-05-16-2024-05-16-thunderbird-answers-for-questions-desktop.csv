Your settings for this are a firewall or your antivirus program and whether VPN settings themselves for this connection or with your SMTP configuration for outgoing internet traffic will not be as they should be today. Please look up the disruptive topic for a moment. Configure yourself what it would be? If you think you have a disturbing add-on or extension, you can boot into trouble shoot mode for Thunderbird. If not, it could be other software. Check whether you can do this with the add-ons disabled and find the disturbing piece of software add-on in this way and delete it. </p><p><br> </p><p>Greetings Firefox volunteer </p>",Googlethunderbird,false,0,0
