The original text disappears and is replaced by some random letters and texts. Plus, in one case the original text of one email replaced the original of other email from other person. </p><p>I decided to install Malwarebytes, and from time to time I get a warning about Thunderbird, I have no idea if is related. </p><p>There is anyone that can help to solve this? It is frustrating, because I use Thunderbird for my work accounts, and now I am losing emails that I need. </p><p>Thank you, Ricardo </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",kado.jogos

After the initial download many emails were missing.  I want to try again because during the initial download I was sorting thru and deleting a lot of emails and I wonder if that somehow broke something in TB.  So this time I want to allow the entire POP download to happen before I start sorting and deleting.  I removed all my email storage and also the popstate.dat file (advice found on other messages on this forum).  However TB will only download new emails and recreate a popstate.dat file.  Any advice? </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cbryan32

Its font density settings are all trash.  </p><p>I rolled back because it's so bad.  And how cool was it that the UI was updated without warning me that ""installing the latest version"" would overhaul UI settings and design without asking if I want that? So cool, so thoughtful, like a dog dumping on the kitchen floor.  </p><p>Is there any option in it yet to allow users to keep the old UI? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",RevertSearch
