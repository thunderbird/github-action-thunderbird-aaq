The original text disappears and is replaced by some random letters and texts. Plus, in one case the original text of one email replaced the original of other email from other person. </p><p>I decided to install Malwarebytes, and from time to time I get a warning about Thunderbird, I have no idea if is related. </p><p>There is anyone that can help to solve this? It is frustrating, because I use Thunderbird for my work accounts, and now I am losing emails that I need. </p><p>Thank you, Ricardo </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",kado.jogos

After the initial download many emails were missing.  I want to try again because during the initial download I was sorting thru and deleting a lot of emails and I wonder if that somehow broke something in TB.  So this time I want to allow the entire POP download to happen before I start sorting and deleting.  I removed all my email storage and also the popstate.dat file (advice found on other messages on this forum).  However TB will only download new emails and recreate a popstate.dat file.  Any advice? </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cbryan32

I made some folders and setup some message filters to automatically sort my emails into those folders, to replicate my tags in Gmail. When I was doing this, one folder failed to create initially (let's call it ""myFolder""). It simply wouldn't appear after trying to create it, even on repeated attempts, although I could still create other folders fine with a different name (so presumably myFolder was partially created somewhere in the backend and couldn't be overwritten). Anyway, I managed to solve this eventually, although I forget how. Maybe just refreshing the connection or restarting the program. </p><p>Anyway, this morning I updated to 115.7.0 (32-bit), and on applying the update I managed to briefly catch a message when the program restarted saying ""Deleting myFolder"". And sure enough, that folder has been deleted along with all of its email contents (which is rather a lot of emails!). There is nothing in the Archives nor Deleted folders. All of my other folders are still intact just fine. If I go to my \ImapMail\[server]\INBOX.sbd folder, I can see all the other folders there, but not the deleted myFolder one. And same story if I look in the folderCache.json or folderTree.json files. </p><p>I can also access the account in question via RoundCube and SquirrelMail web interface. In the former it shows all the other IMAP folders I created in Thunderbird, but not the one deleted on update. In the latter it shows the first folder I created in Thunderbird, but none of the rest (I think myFolder was the second or third I created). </p><p>I cannot see any kind of backup profile. I only appear to have an empty .default profile, and the active .default-release profile. There is also nothing new in my Windows Recycle Bin. </p><p>1. Can someone please help firstly with recovering the lost folder? Or at least all my emails that were in it? </p><p>2. As a second priority I would obviously be interested to learn what caused this, and how to avoid any risk of it happening again in the future? I am amazed that Thunderbird would automatically and permanently delete large numbers of emails in one go both locally and off the server, without any user interaction/confirmation, and without any way to undo it? </p><p>Might it be safer to just use local Tags in Thunderbird rather than synced IMAP folders? I wasn't sure how to manage those automatically with filters, but now I have found a suggestion advising that it can be done with Saved Searches. If I create a new Saved Search Folder, I presume that would then just be a local view folder which I could filter by tags into, and wouldn't have any impact on the server? </p><p>Best wishes, </p><p>Brian </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",BB

Ricevo regolarmente le mail, ma quelle più vecchie spariscono dalla casella senza che io le abbia archiviate o cancellate. Ieri le mail ricevute il 18/01 erano lì, oggi (06/02) le più vecchie presenti sono del 19/01 e domani spariranno. Ho cercato tra le impostazioni se è settata la cancellazione o l'archiviazione automatica della mail in arrivo ma non ho trovato nulla. Ho comunque cercato se c'erano cartelle locali in cui le mail ricevute potessero essere finite, ma niente. Sparite. Il problema interessa solo la posta in arrivo, le mail inviate invece sono tutte presenti. Grazie a chi vorrà aiutarmi! </p>",other;needsinfo;,thunderbird,other,it,1635283;,desireedandrea
