I made some folders and setup some message filters to automatically sort my emails into those folders, to replicate my tags in Gmail. When I was doing this, one folder failed to create initially (let's call it ""myFolder""). It simply wouldn't appear after trying to create it, even on repeated attempts, although I could still create other folders fine with a different name (so presumably myFolder was partially created somewhere in the backend and couldn't be overwritten). Anyway, I managed to solve this eventually, although I forget how. Maybe just refreshing the connection or restarting the program. </p><p>Anyway, this morning I updated to 115.7.0 (32-bit), and on applying the update I managed to briefly catch a message when the program restarted saying ""Deleting myFolder"". And sure enough, that folder has been deleted along with all of its email contents (which is rather a lot of emails!). There is nothing in the Archives nor Deleted folders. All of my other folders are still intact just fine. If I go to my \ImapMail\[server]\INBOX.sbd folder, I can see all the other folders there, but not the deleted myFolder one. And same story if I look in the folderCache.json or folderTree.json files. </p><p>I can also access the account in question via RoundCube and SquirrelMail web interface. In the former it shows all the other IMAP folders I created in Thunderbird, but not the one deleted on update. In the latter it shows the first folder I created in Thunderbird, but none of the rest (I think myFolder was the second or third I created). </p><p>I cannot see any kind of backup profile. I only appear to have an empty .default profile, and the active .default-release profile. There is also nothing new in my Windows Recycle Bin. </p><p>1. Can someone please help firstly with recovering the lost folder? Or at least all my emails that were in it? </p><p>2. As a second priority I would obviously be interested to learn what caused this, and how to avoid any risk of it happening again in the future? I am amazed that Thunderbird would automatically and permanently delete large numbers of emails in one go both locally and off the server, without any user interaction/confirmation, and without any way to undo it? </p><p>Might it be safer to just use local Tags in Thunderbird rather than synced IMAP folders? I wasn't sure how to manage those automatically with filters, but now I have found a suggestion advising that it can be done with Saved Searches. If I create a new Saved Search Folder, I presume that would then just be a local view folder which I could filter by tags into, and wouldn't have any impact on the server? </p><p>Best wishes, </p><p>Brian </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",BB

So when I delete a message, I want the next most recent one to be highlighted, not the next oldest one. At the moment, every time I delete a message, I have to then click on the message above the one it defaults to. It's a pain. Can I reverse the flow and make it move to the more recent message rather than the older one? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1635405;1635411;1635570;1635571;,clivechafer

As far as a ""browser"" goes, it appears pretty barebones, yet it's showing some of the highest RAM usage on my device, while it's not even doing anything! </p><p>Here's my use case: I have an install of Thunderbird that I use only for the calendar (don't ask why). I have no email accounts synced to it; I have everything related to email disabled or hidden that I possibly can. There is one CalDAV calendar that it displays (but I know the issue is NOT frequent background syncs, because if I change an event on my phone, I still have to click Thunderbird's ""Synchronize"" button for it to update from the server).  </p><p>With the minimal usage described above, Thunderbird has 3 processes visible in Windows Task Manager, using a total of 18% of my RAM pretty consistently. In comparison, I also have Brave Browser open to Gmail. Brave, with half a dozen extensions installed, heavy JS usage, and constant telemetry/pinging google servers, has 19 processes in Task Manager, but all together consistently uses <em>under 14% of RAM</em>.  </p><p><strong>Why in the world does Thunderbird use more memory just to sit idle with one calendar open than does a Chromium browser with constant traffic??</strong> </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1635468;,fiffox
