Po kliknięciu na wiadomość pokazują się nagłówki. Problem raz na jakiś czas pojawia się u mnie w firmie na różnych stanowiskach. Edytując plik folderu wiadomości zauważyłem, że koniec linii jest zapisany w CRCRLF, zamiast CRLF. Naprawa folderu z poziomu Thunderbirda nic nie pomagała. Rozwiązaniem okazało się usunięcie nadmiarowego znacznika nowej linii CR - napisałem sobie program do tego celu, który udostępnię w sieci, ale fajnie by było, aby ta funkcja naprawy była w samym Thunderbirdzie. </p><p>pozdrawiam </p>",kamil16;,true,false,false,";category:troubleshooting;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird",1,0,0,,,

And the third (the one that had two events picked up) is subscribed to an OwnCloud account's calendar, and may have worked.

Killing Thunderbird and restarting results in the same situation. Thunderbird is trying to start up where it was when it was killed. It appears that something in the message causes this problem.  I have tried the following: </p> <ul><li> Tried to clear the startup cache, which I am able to access by bringing up the ""Write new message"" window.

I also tried this as the user (me) who set up the system and is presumably more privileged but that did not help. I am not knowledgeable enough about Windows 11 security to know how to overcome this.
