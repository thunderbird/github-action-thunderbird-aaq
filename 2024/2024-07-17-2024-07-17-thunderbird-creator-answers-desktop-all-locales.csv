Email (receiving and sending) stopped working on the 12th","<p>We have 3 email accounts, each for out business. 1 of them stopped working several years ago with no resolve but we didn't use it that much to make it matter.  Now our main email is not working. It stopped working on the 12th of July. We are not getting emails and our business RELIES on this. We are at a total loss. I've tried everything. I can send email from the main which is no longer working to the other one that still works but cannot send anywhere outside that.  I'm not real knowledgeable with this stuff but I did empty the trash. We had 4 years of trash emails that needed dumped so I did that. Still notihing. The server is a POP3 and the port is correct. 110 is the default on all 3.  The outgoing server (SMTP) what ever that is, is the default server for the email that is not working.  WE ARE DESPERATE HERE. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP US. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",sdallas611
