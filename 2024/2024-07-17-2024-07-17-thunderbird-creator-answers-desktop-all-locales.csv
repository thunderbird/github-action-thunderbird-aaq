Now our main email is not working. It stopped working on the 12th of July. We are not getting emails and our business RELIES on this. We are at a total loss. I've tried everything. I can send email from the main which is no longer working to the other one that still works but cannot send anywhere outside that.  I'm not real knowledgeable with this stuff but I did empty the trash. We had 4 years of trash emails that needed dumped so I did that. Still notihing.
