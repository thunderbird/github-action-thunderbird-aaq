So both systems access the same 10 IMAP email accounts. I keep messages locally, so the profile uses a fair bit of disk space on both systems. </p><p>In fact, the profile originally came from a different Win10 machine, so I had to copy it to a (large) thumb drive.

But despite the errors that caused a few thousand items (of the 302,000) not to get copied, it seemed to work just fine(!). </p><p>It turns out that Zorin seems able to read and write NTFS filesystems quite well. So now I'm wondering if I can copy the profile directory from Zorin to the Win10 partition on the same machine, and replace it with a symlink to that NTFS directory? Does Tbird do funky low-level things to the profile that might not work as expected with Zorin accessing it on NTFS? There would be no risk of race conditions since only one system can be booted at a time. It's just the problems I had copying to the thumb drive in the first place that make me worry that Tbird does some kind of magic with the profile that might not work with linux accessing NTFS... </p><p>I guess I'll go ahead and try it (and report back here), but I'm wondering if I should expect problems.  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",sootsnoot

Looking at the calendar, I see why:  Thunderbird apparently <em>pretended</em> to import three calendars, but skipped all but two old events.  I can create more empty calendars, but that is incredibly unhelpful.  One calendar is local.  One is an online ICS file published by an organization.  And the third (the one that had two events picked up) is subscribed to an OwnCloud account's calendar, and may have worked.  The first is obviously the most important, since I'd rather not spend time working out the database schema so that I can manually input every single event and appointment. </p><p>What hoops do I need to jump through to refill my calendar?  I'm running on Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, with the Thunderbird Flatpak (commit c2e09fc595198cf5c467ddad1fab56c0be512758584e16c3b933f2410968306a according to the command-line, if that gives any clues) installed.
