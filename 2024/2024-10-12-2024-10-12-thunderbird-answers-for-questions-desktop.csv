Thunderbird remembers your account password, so that you don't have to type it every time you start it. When you change your password on the server Thunderbird will prompt you to provide the new password. Sometimes that process doesn't work correctly. In that case you'd need to delete the old password Thunderbird has remembered. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb</a> </p> <blockquote> I can't remember any Thunderbird password, </blockquote> <p>There is no 'Thunderbird password'. You do need your email account password to get your email. </p> <blockquote> And does it mean that the password has to be the same for both Messaging Co and Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>There is no 'Thunderbird password'. You do need your email account password to get your email. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
