Thunderbird remembers your account password, so that you don't have to type it every time you start it. When you change your password on the server Thunderbird will prompt you to provide the new password. Sometimes that process doesn't work correctly.

However I see the followings: </p><pre> -- My email name followed by two folders: history.sqlite, no Inbox folder  -- Local Folders followed by two folders: Trash and Outpox, no Inbox folder </pre> <p>3- If I try an import of the Inbox file, it is grayed out, I cannot select it in the import process </p><p>Questions: -- I assume the Mail/pop.* is related to my email inbox and not the Local Folders Inbox? -- I also assume the Mail/pop.*/Inbox contains all my 200+ mail. -- If both assumptions are true then its just a matter of making both Inbox folder appear? -- What about the 2 other folders present?   Why are they even displayed when I am pretty sure normally they aren't? </p><p>Troubleshooting I had done: -- My troubleshooting step-3 is when I created a personnalized folder, I mean seeing the b*.default was the foldername of my first profile, I was having dougts about this one also being used for the 2nd email box I want to convert later.  I created a profile with a personnalized name to represent my current email name but I hadn't paied attention that at the same time, my default profile must have downloaded my server inbox.

If true, then you should now have access to the messages. Assuming that is true, I am confused on your questions on the other files, considering that you seem to have been copying between profiles. That is, you are NOT being explicit on your problem. If the messages are there, then can you access them? If you need help, then screenshots of the folders will help.  On your other question on support, please remember that thunderbird is FREE and damn few people give even a nickel of support. and you don't pay a fee to ask questions, so thinking that the developers should be sitting and waiting for questions is just not financially feasible.
