First of all, it is tiresome when I type a phrase in the quick filter box, then switch to another folder, and in the quick filter box the phrase has not been deleted and I have to delete it manually. This is impractical, and it used to be that when I changed folders, the quick filter mode would reset. Secondly, there are some problems with it, because in some folders like sent, it doesn't show any emails even though they are there. Only when I close the quick filter mode (although I never had to do it before) do the mails in sent appear. On the other hand, with quick filtering mode enabled, even when I delete everything that is entered there, it still doesn't show emails in some folders. The third last thing is the extended time to show mails that load quite long after typing a phrase in the quick filtering field. My work is severely slowed down by this.

Now that still works but only after the view menu is accessed - which is a little odd. 2) It is also proving impossible to change the default size of text in emails.  The fontsize option in config doesn't work.  I have tried disabling add-ons in troubleshoot mode but to no avail.

When I opened the same attachment using the Windows Outlook desktop Application, all the information was displayed correctly. Changing the Action field in the Thunderbird settings under Datatype and Attachment  to open the PDF with EDGE, the information in the attachment was displayed correctly again in the preview mode of Thunderbird. There seems to be a limitation within the PDF preview mode in case the standards settings are used: this should be corrected as it can cause serious problems, if important information is not displayed. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1680932;,srota
