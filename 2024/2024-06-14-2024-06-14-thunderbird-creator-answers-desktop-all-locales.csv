At first it will spin, then come back for a few seconds, then spin again. Eventually the whole app is unresponsive. </p><p>The troubleshooting steps I see on here all start with ""Go to [some location in the menu]"". I can't do anything with anything in Thunderbird. I can force it to quit and start it up again, that's about it. </p><p>It is also always asking me for the passwords of some of my IMAP accounts. These are big accounts, some folders have several hundred thousand emails. The Inboxes are smaller, maybe a couple hundred in total at the moment. The last configuration I was able to make put it into Unified mode. </p><p>The damn thing is that after having been useless like this ever since I installed it, last week it started to work fine. Stayed that way for several days. Eventually that failed, though, and my whole Mac ended up locked up the way the app is, I had to manually power it off. </p><p>I don't know if it writes any info about what it's doing to a log file somewhere, I am not having much luck trying to find any information here. Just other people with similar problems but no substantive replies. </p><p>Using Thunderbird on an older Mac laptop, running macOS Monterey 12.7.5. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",bradbulger

To send a new email or respond to my emails I have to manually log in to my outlook website account or use my phone (Android).

(no extensions except birdtray) I have 4 email addresses added to my TB, and I like to see all of them together, therefore I am using Unified Folders. When I am accessing Unified Inbox, TB is very slow and basically frozen until it loads this folder (often a pop-up appears that 'TB is not responding'). it takes between 30-60 seconds to load my emails (either on start-up, or clicking on another folder, then going back to Unified Inbox). Every other folders open almost instantly. I have to admit I have a lot of emails in the Unified Inbox (~20K), however the inbox of my main email has 18K, and accessing that folder separately is instant. So any operation, other than opening Unified Inbox, is quite snappy. </p><p>This issue persists since I upgraded to v115, even when I did an OS reinstall (also tried installing apt (v115.11.0)). </p><p>I have seen this answer: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1428374#question-reply"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1428374#question-reply</a> however, nothing changed by resetting the folder. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",molnarszilard10
