I have managed to do this using the Google Server option, although it made my brain hurt a bit. The problem with the above fault is that it is time dependent. Initially after implementing DoH, the email problem remained, but tonight at 18:40 GMT, when the problem is usually apparent, the problem has now gone and the email system is behaving itself. The problem was also gone at 09:00 GMT today. I will keep testing Thunderbird using Sky addresses over the next few days to see what happens. </p><p>I don't see how I am the only user affected and It surely cannot be a password or settings problem on my part because of the time dependency issue.

All my years of  previously sent Thunderbird email disappeared.  Also, a very large number of new innocent incoming emails were tagged by Thunderbird as suspect spam.    A password change and a full computer scan over a week ago found some ""virus"" items and removed them.  Problems remained, however.  Yesterday I launched a full computer scan by Bit Defender (which took quite a while).     BD found a trojan horse called TrojanGenericKD.72198276  and BD said it removed it. It also found two infected email items it could not remove that were in Thunderbird email archives.   Bit defender gave the option of removing them manually  --  good luck with my faded command prompt skills. The automatic removal option in the options panel scared me, as it was unclear HOW MUCH stuff would be removed. And it was unclear what the other  ""archiving"" option would do. I used screen commands to see that the identified location, which was: C:\users\Dwight\appData\Roaming\Thunderbird\profiles\      [mostly hidden directories] The last directory had only two small files:96x914ek.default-release  and a similarly named one In spite of the great uncertainty, I took the chance that BitDefender would only remove those two files, so I told YES for BD to fix it.  BD said it had fixed it.    I rebooted the computer, and all the old sent email had reappeared.     Not sure everything is fixed, but it looks hopeful.  The spaghetti monster fingers are still crossed. Good luck.  Local Thunderbird experts are hard to find. </p>",razzoo2,false,0,0

I for one have simply given up trying to help those that do. It is just a huge mess in enough instances to put me off even trying. </p><p>I would actually think the issue might well be antivirus related.  I was sort of thinking that and then I got to the POP messages being duplicated and that is classic antivirus interference. </p><p>When Thunderbird retrieves mail in the circumstance you use, it writes the server reference for each mail to the popstate.dat file in Thunderbird.  But this is done at the end of the retrieve cycle,  not after each mail so if for some reason the get messages hangs up and does not terminate normally the file is not updated.  This used to be a special trick of Nortons,  but I have heard of it of most antivirus products over the years.   </p><p>Sometime clearing out the junk/spam folder on the server will fix that issue as the antivirus just drops the ball when it encounters malformed email and that is the most likely place to get that.  Otherwise you will be looking for a mail that arrived just after the last dated email.  Far simpler is to simply disable mail scanning until you have downloaded the troublemaker.  Malformed mail is not really a risk in Thunderbird, only to the stability of the scanning tool. </p><p>You might find your inability to write is also antivirus related.  Generally we recommend disabling any on access scanning in the antivirus for the Thunderbird profile folder.  This has two immediate benefits. </p><p>Compacting folders becomes much faster and more reliable.  This has a secondary benefit of removing old deleted mail that a subsequent definition update in the antivirus that sees it quarantine your entire inbox, or delete it, because it still contains an old deleted email that has a threat in it that the AV could not detect when the email arrived. </p><p>There is a very significant reduction in files being unable to be updated due to contention issues on the disk. Contention has many possible causes,  but the antivirus is the most common.  Some other possibilities are the profile folder being in a location that is cloud synced (often as a result of the profile being deliberately included in the ""My Documents"" or Documents"" folders) which our Googles and Microsoft all want to place in the cloud so we pay them to store it. Other issues are streaming backups or even on a network storage location because network storage access can be slow.  </p><p>You might also want to check in your profile for files with numbers in them like the prefs.js file.  You should have one,  if your antivirus is really acting badly you might have 99 or more.  When Thunderbird can not open a file, it tends to create a new numbered version,  save the data to it and never refer to it again.  This looks to the user like setting changes do not get saved because when they were saved they were also lost. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However, I cannot figure out how to specify a different time zone than the system timezone when creating an event. For example, if I just bought a flight that departs at 4PM London time and I am in Miami when creating the event, how can I create this event without having to convert that time to my current time?  Surely this is possible but I can't figure out how. Thanks for any help! </blockquote> <p>I understand your challenge with managing different time zones in Thunderbird Supernova. It can be quite frustrating to manually convert times, especially when you have important events like flights that need precise scheduling. </p><p>As a <a href=""https://apexlimofl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Limo Car Service Provider in Miami</a>, we often deal with clients traveling across different time zones, and having accurate scheduling tools is crucial. In Thunderbird, you can try adding the timezones button to the event creation menu. This feature should allow you to set the event time according to the desired time zone without converting it manually. This way, when you're booking a car service for a flight departing at 4 PM London time while you're in Miami, you can enter the correct time directly. This functionality not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors in your scheduling. Hopefully, this helps streamline your process! </p>",mfseoservices,true,0,0

For IMAP accounts, I suggest clicking File&gt;work offline&gt;download to ensure that all content is on the PC. Then, copy to Local Folders folders to be safe.
