EACH smtp server needs a unique Description field, and I always place email id there.

Do you want to get rid of the messages that you receive daily or even hourly? These messages are from your Amazon topics. You can try using an anti-malware program. Installing a firewall can also help or you purchase an antivirus program that includes it. I see that you are using a very outdated version of Thunderbird. This could also be the case with a somewhat outdated operating system on your computer. Please try to update it to our latest version of Thunderbird regarding the Thunderbird Software that you have installed.

However, if your email provider has a limit, you would need to contact them. Sending to 130 or so may cause you to be defined as a spammer.

He tried also on each email client I have and confirmed all settings correct and he said that the only thing left is the BT end, in which case there is nothing I can do about it!
