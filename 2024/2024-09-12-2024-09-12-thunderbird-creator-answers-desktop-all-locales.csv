I realized it on Monday 24/09/07, by opening the program and getting an error message. A new profile-file was immediately initialized by the program and also a program-update was made to version 128.2.0esr (32-Bit)). Unfortunately, I do not know the version, I used before the update Using your instructions from the Mozilla knowledge-base, I was able to restore the file-situation, as it was before my mistake killing my profile. Although trying now for three days getting the old data (inbox, sent mails, address book) in the new profile by importing or over writing I didn't have any success. Trying to import old profile-data by the program-tool results in an error message. When overwriting the existing files with the old ones, I get new folders, but they were all empty. After long time of research in your knowledge-base, trying mentioned solutions without success, I suppose that it is no more a question of recreating a knew profile but a question of the program-update made on Monday and a data conflict between the two program versions. I Think the new version cannot handle with the old data. I would like to install the version I used before the update, but do not know whether which version it was nor where I could find an old program-version? Or is there a possibility to manage old data with the new version, and I do not know it?

We use outlook 2007 to store our customers details in the address book along with their order details, customer number etc. Plus we use the calendar for important dates like tax and when to pay suppliers. </p><p>We have our own domains (9 in total with several email address for each - about 30 email addresses) which we download the emails from into outlook 2007 so we can store those emails and orders in the .pst file and easily find them again plus archive them each year. Outlook gives us the choice of if the emails should be removed from the server or not - some we do and some we don't for various reasons. </p><p>I have downloaded thunderbird as that is what was suggested as a replacement. Tried importing, some things came across and some didn't. Some emails, except those in the sent folder, came across. None of the accounts came across nor the address book. The folder tree was very odd too as all folders were under a folder called ""outlook import"". I had added my hotmail address when i first opened thunderbird and then added one of our domains emails manually, it showed all the folders in that domain email, that is not really want i wanted, i just want to download the emails in the inbox of our email address. Then i would move it to where it needed to be - orders, customer questions, suppliers emails etc. </p><p>I then saw in the help files that i should use the 31 version then upgrade after importing, so i started again. </p><p>I started with the address book as that is very important as i have 31k in there. Very little info came across, some were missing names, some missing customer numbers, and it is very difficult to get to the ""other"" field which contains all their order numbers. With outlook all of that is there when you open a contact AND when you view as a list. </p><p>So my questions to start with are ..... </p><p>1. Which version of thunderbird should i be using to import outlook 2007? </p><p>2. How do i get all the contact info over? </p><p>3. How can i make the address book interface more user friendly? </p><p>4. Is outlook 2007 actually going to stop working for how we work or have i been misled? </p><p>Hope someone can help or point me in the direct of other help available.

Notably with cookies.sqlite,  cookies.sqlite-shm, store.json, mozlz4, aborted-session-ping  and many others, which I note some have continued to be updated. I have been unable to find any other settings in Thunderbird referring to Drive C:, other than those in Server Settings.   </p><p>I could presume that if I installed another version of Thunderbird on Drive D: and maybe moved those existing contents of the Thunderbird folder on C: onto Drive D:, and made those numerous settings changes to the App it could work.

I would much prefer the Message Pane to resize instead of the Message List. </p><p>Current situation: </p><pre>- Set to Vertical Layout: Message List is on the left of the Message Pane. - Resize TB's window: the last column of the Message List grows to compensate the extra space and all columns shrink if window size is reduced beyond a certain threshold. </pre> <p>Preferred situation: </p><pre>- Resizing the TB's window changes the Message Pane size and does not affect the Message List columns. </pre> <p>I am constantly constantly adjusting column sizes to compensate when I connect to an external screen or when maximizing TB. I can't find a preference to change this behavior. Fixing the Message List columns sizes and adjusting the Message Pane size would be much better and more natural.

O, meglio, ho mantenuto la configurazione POP sul pc e aggiunto quella IMAP (che ho anche settato sullo smartphone, eliminando lì quella POP). L'archivio POP era di circa 70GB al momento del pssaggio ed è stato trasferito nella casella IMAP, mantenendo la copia anche nella casella POP locale. </p><p>La casella POP ha come regola lasciare i messaggi sul server finchè non vengono eliminati in locale. Tornato dalle ferie ho, con terrore, scoperto che la casella IMAP non ha nessuna email anteriore al 9 agosto 2024, mentre la casella POP ha un vuoto che va dal 7 settembre 2023 al 22 luglio 2024. </p><p>Inoltre, la casella POP presenta una (apparentemente) stessa email in data 22 luglio 2024 che si ripete 1249 volte e visualizza nell'elenco della posta in arrivoin alcuni casi degli allegati e in altre delle etichette, che sono però apparenti perchè quando si clicca l'email è sempre la stessa, senza allegati nè etichette. </p><p>Il mio dubbio è che le 1249 email non siano affatto sempre la stessa ma siano in realtà email diverse che sono state sostanzialmente sovrascritte da quella datata 22 luglio 2024 (il numero potrebbe corrispondere a quelle ""mancanti"" del lasso di tempo 7 settembre 2023/21 luglio 2024). </p><p>Cosa può essere successo (il pc non ha virus, ho controllato più volte) e nessuno può avere manualmente cancellato nulla, tanto meno dalla casella POP visto che il notebook lo avevo io. </p><p>Grazie dell'aiuto </p><p>Eugenio </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;needsinfo;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,1674132;,eugenio.giordano
