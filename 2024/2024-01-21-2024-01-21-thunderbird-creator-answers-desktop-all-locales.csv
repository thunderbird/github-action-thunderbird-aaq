These are usually but not always from different EU countries. I have message filters that gets most but not all of them. The hacker e-mails are full of random /ab/cd/... hex characters. I think they're trying to use some sort of buffer overflow exploit. I don't think you have it. They also send short message with ""click here to unsubscribe"" and not much else. (Naturally, I don't ""click here"".) </p><p>I have two questions: 1) It's not clear on the message filters whether I should delete them before or after the junk filter. Either way some of them seem to sneak through to the trash folder. What's the recommended setting so that the filter action takes place? (Filter action == delete) 2) I tried adding a check in the message body for /ad/ or something else. With the body containing all sorts of /hex-pair/ random stuff, the check was pretty sure to hit. The delete action never seemed to work. (Sometimes clicking on the inbox then back to the trash folder gets rid of them. Sometimes not.) These apparent attempt to exploit buffer overflow messages do not contain normal written text. </p><p>Maybe you could help me find some other way of auto-deleting this junk. It comes in with all sorts of random subject titles that I can tell are this spam, but would be hard to auto-detect without a sophisticated AI. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1631931;1632083;,fn.eskesen

However, I have noticed that in the latest Thunderbird version (I'm using 115.6.1) the Compact folder starts automatically compacting all subfolders under the current one. This is a big problem for me: under the inbox, which I need to compact fairly often because all messages pass through it, I have literally hundreds of subfolders, some of them dating from more than 20 years ago, when I used Netscape Communicator. Those folders are ""read only"" (I only have them for reference), and I do not want to modify them in any way, to avoid risking their contents. Thus, I DO NEED for Thunderbird to stop compacting subfolders automatically. Is it possible? How can it be done? </p><p>Also, after a folder compacting has started, what's the best way of cancelling it, short of closing Thunderbird? I understand that the compaction process is quite safe, as it copies all data to a fresh file, but would rather not risk data loss. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1631911;1631913;1631927;1631963;1632005;1632006;1632111;1632114;,ajgelado
