I suggest inserting a unique description in Description field of SMTP server settings, such as the related email address, and then recheck the account setting pane that links to the SMTP server to verify that it is correct. A relay error indicates that the smtp server is identifying an email address that is different from the sending email address. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
