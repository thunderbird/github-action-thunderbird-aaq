I presume the Mac has a file manager and, with Thunderbird not running, locate the old folders on the external drive and copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder on the Mac. You can find the specific location by clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scrolling down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - that places you in the profile and the Mail folder should appear. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

But now I have a similar question related to a thunderbird folder created by a label I created in Gmail. The Gmail label appears as folder in thunderbird. That's ok.

If you want a new email address, you can create one with a service provider and then follow their instructions for setting up Thunderbird to send/receive messages on that account.
