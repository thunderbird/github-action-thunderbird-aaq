1450651,2024-06-22 20:42:58 -0700,2024-06-22 21:13:51 -0700,Slow gmail sends,"<p>I run a dual boot system with Fedora 40 with Thunderbird installed via DNF and  Windows 11 Professional with Thunderbird installed from the Mozilla download site.  I have had a Gmail account configured on both sides for some time.  Recently I have been seeing very slow (2-3 minutes) outgoing sends from the Gmail account on the Fedora side ( thankfully they are eventually successful), but no such slowdowns from the Windows 11 side.  As far as I can tell the accounts on both sides are configured the same (I always take the automatic config option when adding an account).  I have also looked at the extra account settings required for OAuth2 authentication with Fedora, and believe they are all correct.  I have made sends directly from the Gmail server, and they have no delay, so the problem must be related to communication between Thunderbird and the Gmail server on the Fedora side.  Interestingly, I do get the following warning message when opening the Fedora Thunderbird: </p> <hr> <p>Could Not Authenticate -- Imap(<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>) </p><p>The server for account ""imap (<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>)"" refused the supplied username and password. Do you want to go to the settings for another attempt at logging in, or do nothing? </p><p>Login failed, sever replied A000002 NO Invalid credentials (Failure) [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] </p> <hr> <p>This obviously is a problem, yet it doesn't seem to be fatal, as the server eventually connects, but after the delay. I have checked my account password, and I know it is correct.  I would appreciate any insights into what is going on. </p><p>Tom Rosmond tomrosmond@gmail.com </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1658700;,tomrosmond

I have a keyboard shortcut bug and an icon action bug to report, as well as a text formatting suggestion. As background, I'm running TBird 115.12.1 (64-bit) on Windows 10 and have three different IMAP email accounts and a collection of local message folders that I access. </p> <ul><li> <strong>Keyboard Shortcut Bug:</strong> I use the the filter box activated by &lt;Ctl+Shft+K&gt;. Everything works fine when I freshly launch TBird, but after some variable length of time after switching between various apps and activities, when I return to TBird I find that &lt;Ctl+Shft+K&gt; does not switch focus to the filter box. In this state, typing a search string gets lost. I can manually select the filter box and enter a search string, but the keyboard accelerator is not functional. It does not repair itself until I relaunch TBird. I have tried unsuccessfully to isolate events outside of TBird that bring this on. </li></ul> <ul><li> <strong>Icon Action Bug:</strong> I also use the inbox selector icon and a similar problem happens after extended external session activities, but not necessarily coincident with the filter box problem. The inbox selector icon stops functioning to display the new input mailbox folder being selected -- it keeps the previously selected folder in the mailbox window. To switch to another folder, I have to manually open the folder sidebar menu and select the folder I want to display. Again, I have not been able to pin down what causes this to happen. It resets to normal function when I reload TBird. </li></ul> <ul><li> Text Formatting: Before the upgrade to SuperNova, when composing/editing a message, I could select disjoint strings (using &lt;ctl&gt;select) and have text formatting options (like text style) apply to each of the selected substrings in parallel. Now with SuperNova, when I select disjoint strings, the text formatting option applies only to the first selected substring. This makes complex text formatting very tedious because I have to sequentially select the substrings and apply the formatting commands. Please restore the previous ability of reformat multiple selected disjoint strings. </li></ul> <p>Thanks again for your outstanding work on improving TBird! </p><p>Regards, Tom Rindfleisch &lt;tcr@stanford.edu&gt; </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1658864;,tcr1
