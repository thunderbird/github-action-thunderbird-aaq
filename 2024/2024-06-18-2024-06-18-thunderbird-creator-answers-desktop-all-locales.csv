I've changed my password as you requested me to do and if I send  out e-mails, they seem to go out just fine, but STILL no e-mails coming into my account.  WHY IS THAT?  Please let me know if there's anything else I need to do, to be able to receive my e-mails. Thanks again. Dave Beard 403 Swan Way Vallejo, CA 94589 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dlbeard
