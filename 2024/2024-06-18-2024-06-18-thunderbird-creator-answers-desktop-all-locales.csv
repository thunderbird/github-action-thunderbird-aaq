Plus TB keeps asking me for my password which is a long series of letters, ie. security key. Please help. There was very important info in those folders and I'm feeling kind of desparate. I uninstalled TB and reinstalled. Not fixed at all.  Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",deannie.scott

I've changed my password as you requested me to do and if I send  out e-mails, they seem to go out just fine, but STILL no e-mails coming into my account.  WHY IS THAT?  Please let me know if there's anything else I need to do, to be able to receive my e-mails. Thanks again.

Now, T'bird insists on opening into that same screen and there is no link to to show my inbox. I have removed and re-installed T'bird with no result. I have tried approximately 15 'sure' fixes from the internet and Mozilla but without success. Finally I read that the new version will open the screen which you were last using at shutdown, but there is no link to open the inbox. There is no link to the inbox on the left side of screen nor a down caret on the right hand side of screen. I have no folders showing, such as ""Inbox"", ""Drafts"", ""Sent"" or 'Local Folder'. I have referred to the Mozilla list of shortcuts without success.  My inbox is not empty F5  and Shift + F5 do nothing.
