When I compose a brand new message, pressing the Enter key inserts a new paragraph, with extra line spacing, and pressing Shift+Enter inserts a line break with single line spacing. This is how I want things. </p><p>I am experiencing a problem when replying to emails from a particular sender. Their emails HTML code contains a ""&lt;style&gt;"" element that removes the extra spacing for paragraphs: </p><p>&lt;style type=""text/css"" style=""display:none;""&gt;P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}&lt;/style&gt; </p><p>When replying to their emails, their HTML is inserted as quoted text, and the ""&lt;style&gt;"" element affects the whole email, including my response as I compose it. As a result, when I press Enter, I no longer see the extra line spacing, and Enter or Shift+Enter results look the same in the HTML version of my email. Yet they insert different content, and in fact the plain text version of the email still adds two line jumps for paragraphs vs a single jump for line breaks, and I cannot tell while composing.  </p><p>Then, when I send my email, the recipient email reader (e.g. GMail or Office) appears to somehow pick up the difference again, so my paragraphs are displayed again with extra line spacing. This is an issue, because I cannot tell the difference between paragraphs and line breaks, they look the same to me, and I end up using both interchangeably. But they don't look the same to the recipient, and the resulting response looks messed up. </p><p>How can I prevent the quoted email from overriding styles in my own response?  </p><p>I tried installing the CustomCSS addon to add my own ""&lt;style&gt;"" element, but unfortunately it gets added at the top of the document, and the quoted response's ""&lt;style&gt;"" element comes afterwards, thus overriding anything I set. </p><p>Perhaps the sender's configuration is at fault (they should not use a global ""&lt;style&gt;"" like this), but they are a customer, and it would not be appropriate for me to ask them to fix their email configuration. </p><p>The only ""solution"" I can think of is to switch to ""Body text"" as default style, such that paragraph blocks are never used.

I have two email addresses at <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a>.   Suddenly this week one of them stopped working an an message asking for my password appears dozens of times.    AOL now manages the <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a> email server.   I can login using my password to the host email for that email account so I know that a password associated with that account.  But I suspect the problem is a different password and I don't know how to fix it. </p><p>If I go to Tools/setting in Thunderbird,   there is button labeled ""Saved Passwords. </p><p>For the working email account, there are two records.  For the failing email account, there is only one record.  the one that is missing is ""mailbox://<a href=""http://pop.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.verizon.net</a>""   I suspect that is the problem.   </p><p>Any ideas about whether my analysis is correct and, if so what to do about it? </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1657973;,chasfm11

One of my local folders was corrupted. I restored a backup copy of Thunderbird that had the emails in a local folder. By local folder, I mean a folder stored on my iMac and not subject to iMap services. What I would like to do is to export the local folder from the backup TB instance and import it to my ""live"" TB version. Is this possible? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rw10839
