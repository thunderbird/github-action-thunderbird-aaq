There was a folder called Sent that did show up, which had 3 sub-folders - WPP Sent, Borah Sent and Sent XGV.  </p><p>So I decided to reimport everything to see if I could get my original Sent to show up. That time, Sent did show up but the Sent folder with the 3 sub folders didn't. So most recently, I went in and moved the sub folders out of the Sent folder but they still didn't show up on the folder Pane - it was the WPP Sent that I tried to add as a new folder under Local Folders but it said there already was one. Do you suppose anything with the word Sent is going to be a problem? I'll try changing those names and see what happens. </p>",pkcweir,false,0,0

Lately (after the last microsoft Update??) every time I launch Thunderbird it throws up a dialogue box for each account stating that ""log in has failed""  and asking me to enter the password. Despite my putting the password in correctly it is rejected repeatedly but after a few attempts I finally get my emails. </p><p>I have used Thunderbird regularly for 5 or 6 years now and have never had this trouble before. Is it more of Microsoft's monkey business or is there some fault in Thunderbird? </p><p>Kindest regards, Colin Ballard, 27 July 2024 </p>",colrose.b,false,0,0
