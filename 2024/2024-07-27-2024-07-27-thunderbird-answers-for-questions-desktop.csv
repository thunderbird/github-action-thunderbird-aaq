There was a folder called Sent that did show up, which had 3 sub-folders - WPP Sent, Borah Sent and Sent XGV.  </p><p>So I decided to reimport everything to see if I could get my original Sent to show up. That time, Sent did show up but the Sent folder with the 3 sub folders didn't. So most recently, I went in and moved the sub folders out of the Sent folder but they still didn't show up on the folder Pane - it was the WPP Sent that I tried to add as a new folder under Local Folders but it said there already was one. Do you suppose anything with the word Sent is going to be a problem? I'll try changing those names and see what happens. </p>",pkcweir,false,0,0
