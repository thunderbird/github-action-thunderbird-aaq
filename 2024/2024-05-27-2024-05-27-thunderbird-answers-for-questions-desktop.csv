You may have to re-setup the accounts, but all the messages are likely intact. Here are my suggestions:  - recreate the POP accounts, but DO NOT enter password yet.  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open profile'  - now exit thunderbird and you are inside the profile. note the name of the profile. For this post, I'll call that PROFILEONE - backup one folder to prior folder and you are now in the Profiles folder. It should show the name of the profile you were just in and the name of your prior profile. I'll call that PROFILETWO. click that one - Now click the Mail folder as that is were all POP accounts exist. You should see a folder for each account. click a folder and you should see the message folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc.. For each account, copy all message folders and then go to PROFILEONE, Mail Folder, that account folder, and paste there. These should overlay any dummy folders there (dummy because you haven't entered password yet.) - Repeat the above for each account - Now, review and adjust settings for each account to your preference, such as Server settings. - Now that youu have account settings as desired, click to receive messages and enter password when prompted.  The above steps are because you have POP accounts and my suggested steps are to preserve the folders and the count of what has been downloaded. Otherwise, if you set the accounts up withougt preloading the folders, Thunderbird would ignore what had already been downloaded and start from scratch in downloads. If these were IMAP accounts, you would not face this problem.  </p><p>Suggestion: since you are running a business, I encourage you to do a backup every day at end of day. My suggested approach would be this:  - exit thunderbird  (IMPORTANT) - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media  Then, if ever facing this again, you would just need to  - have thunderbird installed but not running - copy the backedup thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overlay the prior version.  - restart thunderbird </p><p>If you encounter problems or need more assistance, please post screenshots of view in Windows File Explorer of the affected folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

However, it immediately appeared in the left hand pane with thirty new emails. New emails are being received and emails can be sent - still without the password being demanded.  Before I continue I would appreciate confirmation that this is normal, please. </p><p>I can access the default profile direct using Explorer.

The ""new"" gmail account accesses gmail without the password, but the <a href=""http://sfr.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">sfr.fr</a> email account keeps prompting me for the password. In Tools I chose the option ""Import an account"" then ""Import from TB profile"" and it offered my current default location. I followed this and the Data to Import included Accounts &amp; settings, Address book and Mail. I clicked OK and it started but did not appear to complete.  The Mozilla support site (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-import#w_how-to-import-settings-and-data-with-the-import-tool"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-import#w_how-to-import-settings-and-data-with-the-import-tool</a>) is not altogether clear if it can import from itself. I tried importing from the backed up profile, no go, then tried renaming the backed up profile, again no go. It starts, shews 25% done then closes out. I am still in need of a way to access my TB local folders once I have re-loaded all my accounts. </p>",jfdi,false,0,0

The trouble with POP is it starts downloading again.  Can you see the message folders on the old profile? if your can, these steps will recover the local folders: - exit thunderbird - in old profile where you see folders in Mail\Local Folders, copy them and paste into the Mail\Local Folders folder of the active profile, and then restart thunderbird  </p><p>On the import, the simple way for addressbook is to  - exit thunderbird, - locate the addressbook.sqlite and history.sqlite files on old profile and copyreplace to same location in active profile </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
