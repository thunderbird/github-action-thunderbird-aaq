You may have to re-setup the accounts, but all the messages are likely intact. Here are my suggestions:  - recreate the POP accounts, but DO NOT enter password yet.  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open profile'  - now exit thunderbird and you are inside the profile. note the name of the profile. For this post, I'll call that PROFILEONE - backup one folder to prior folder and you are now in the Profiles folder. It should show the name of the profile you were just in and the name of your prior profile. I'll call that PROFILETWO. click that one - Now click the Mail folder as that is were all POP accounts exist. You should see a folder for each account. click a folder and you should see the message folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc.. For each account, copy all message folders and then go to PROFILEONE, Mail Folder, that account folder, and paste there. These should overlay any dummy folders there (dummy because you haven't entered password yet.) - Repeat the above for each account - Now, review and adjust settings for each account to your preference, such as Server settings. - Now that youu have account settings as desired, click to receive messages and enter password when prompted.  The above steps are because you have POP accounts and my suggested steps are to preserve the folders and the count of what has been downloaded. Otherwise, if you set the accounts up withougt preloading the folders, Thunderbird would ignore what had already been downloaded and start from scratch in downloads. If these were IMAP accounts, you would not face this problem.  </p><p>Suggestion: since you are running a business, I encourage you to do a backup every day at end of day. My suggested approach would be this:  - exit thunderbird  (IMPORTANT) - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media  Then, if ever facing this again, you would just need to  - have thunderbird installed but not running - copy the backedup thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overlay the prior version.  - restart thunderbird </p><p>If you encounter problems or need more assistance, please post screenshots of view in Windows File Explorer of the affected folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

At this point, I suggest doing a backup of the profile in case, while cleaning up, you accidentally delete an important folder. Do that with TB not running. Also, with TB not running, see if you can review most recent dates for the accounts with numbers to see if you can eliminate the ones with numbers and just have one account for each. For example, my guess is that the gmail-13 is the most recent, but does it have all the messages that have been collected so far (messages in gmail, gmail-1 through gmail 12). Same for the other accounts. Also, I suggest deleting all but the prefs.js with highest number and rename it to prefs.js. The smartmailboxes entry can be deleted. That is for unified mail and thunderbird will rebuild automatically. I think, at this point, you have found all the components to manually review to collect together. It will take time to check it all, but I think you can probably recover everything now.  </p><p>Going forward, if you plan to continue with FreefileSync, be sure to test it after doing several backups to verify that it works. I routinely see people posting here on the forum, having used propriety software for backups that didn't work after a restore. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I backed up the profile, so that is secure. I deleted all the prefs save the last which I renamed prefs.js - no change when I restarted TB. The gmail -x relate to several gmail accounts, not easy to identify them individually. Smartmailboxes all deleted. Still no joy, so I opted for a fresh installation of TB. I un-installed TB and cleaned up the registry and caches withCcleaner. I downloaded a new TB from Mozilla, but the install is stalled when I reach the dialog box for the file location. It offers me the same location and user as the uninstalled TB or as Administrator.  Administrator is not an option as I am also the Administrator and the Admin user account was not set up with a password - so TB won't install there.

Here are the tips:  - The description field is free form and should have a unique identifier for each account. - DO NOT edit it by clicking account pane. Yes, there is a button there to edit it, but that is the curse.  - INSTEAD, once on account settings pane, scroll down left side until you see 'Outgoing Servers (SMTP) and click there.  - you should see a separate SMTP server for all account. Edit them here, making sure that the description is unique for each, such as showing email address.  - now, revisit the account pane for each one and select the desired SMTP server. DO NOT edit it here, as you've already done that. - now, all should work. Let me know if it doesn't.  NOTE: the problem you were experiencing is that, if edited from account pane, you actually keep editing the same server and it can go on forever..&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
