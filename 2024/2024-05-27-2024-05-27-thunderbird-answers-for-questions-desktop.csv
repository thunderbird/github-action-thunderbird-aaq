You may have to re-setup the accounts, but all the messages are likely intact. Here are my suggestions:  - recreate the POP accounts, but DO NOT enter password yet.  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open profile'  - now exit thunderbird and you are inside the profile. note the name of the profile. For this post, I'll call that PROFILEONE - backup one folder to prior folder and you are now in the Profiles folder. It should show the name of the profile you were just in and the name of your prior profile. I'll call that PROFILETWO. click that one - Now click the Mail folder as that is were all POP accounts exist. You should see a folder for each account. click a folder and you should see the message folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc.. For each account, copy all message folders and then go to PROFILEONE, Mail Folder, that account folder, and paste there. These should overlay any dummy folders there (dummy because you haven't entered password yet.) - Repeat the above for each account - Now, review and adjust settings for each account to your preference, such as Server settings. - Now that youu have account settings as desired, click to receive messages and enter password when prompted.  The above steps are because you have POP accounts and my suggested steps are to preserve the folders and the count of what has been downloaded. Otherwise, if you set the accounts up withougt preloading the folders, Thunderbird would ignore what had already been downloaded and start from scratch in downloads. If these were IMAP accounts, you would not face this problem.  </p><p>Suggestion: since you are running a business, I encourage you to do a backup every day at end of day. My suggested approach would be this:  - exit thunderbird  (IMPORTANT) - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media  Then, if ever facing this again, you would just need to  - have thunderbird installed but not running - copy the backedup thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overlay the prior version.  - restart thunderbird </p><p>If you encounter problems or need more assistance, please post screenshots of view in Windows File Explorer of the affected folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
