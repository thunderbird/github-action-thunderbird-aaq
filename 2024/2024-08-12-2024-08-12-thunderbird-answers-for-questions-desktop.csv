Thunderbird is already there, so your first task is locating where the profile is stored (which could vary depending on the distribution).

However, it is possible to upload both received and sent messages, but it can be problematic if you have a lot of messages.  A compromise might be to migrate your POP message folders to Local Folders and manage them from there, using the IMAP account going forward. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
