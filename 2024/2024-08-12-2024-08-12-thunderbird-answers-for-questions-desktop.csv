You have the option to leave copies on the server or not. </p><p>Imap is nothing like Pop. Imap accounts can only display whatever is on the server.  All folders and emails are stored on the server and Thunderbird Imap account is like a mirror copy. You delete  or move emails in Thunderbird they get deleted or moved in webmail account and also vice versa. You can never truelly consider folders in an imap account as a separate independent copy on your computer because all imap folders synchronise with the server.
