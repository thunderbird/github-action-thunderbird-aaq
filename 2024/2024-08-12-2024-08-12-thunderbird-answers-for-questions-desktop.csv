You have the option to leave copies on the server or not. </p><p>Imap is nothing like Pop. Imap accounts can only display whatever is on the server.  All folders and emails are stored on the server and Thunderbird Imap account is like a mirror copy. You delete  or move emails in Thunderbird they get deleted or moved in webmail account and also vice versa. You can never truelly consider folders in an imap account as a separate independent copy on your computer because all imap folders synchronise with the server. You can create backups of imap accounts. </p><p>You will find that techno people employed by Spectrum know more about their own webmail accounts and not so much about third party email clients. </p><p>If you were previously using  Pop then please note you cannot access the pop account server settings and simply alter them to imap server settings.  </p><p>You would have to create a 'New' &gt; 'Existing mail account' and set it up as an imap account. </p><p>I'm not sure when this problem occured in the first place or what caused it, but changing to imap may not be suitable for you - it's up to you really. Either way please do the following.  </p><p><strong>1. </strong>If Firewall thinks the current Thunderbird program is not allowed access to the internet then it will block Thunderbird. So, before you do anything make sure Thunderbird is allowed access. </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird </li><li> Access Firewall - this may the default on computer or if you installed a Anti-Virus then it may be controlling the Firewall. </li><li> MAke sure Thunderbird program has been set up as an allowed program.  In the past I have come across occasions when an update in Thunderbird upsets the Firewall which thinks it is a new program. So you may need to block thunderbird ok it and the access Firewall again and set up to allow. </li></ul> <p>Confirm this has been done so ensuring the latest update of Thunderbird program is allowed access. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> I've discovered in the past that Spectrum blocks access because it wants you to logon to webmail account and update your password.  This seemed to effect those using Pop more than those using Imap. Maybe it's because imap forces people to keep all their mail on the server - who knows&nbsp;!!

If you use the 'Message Pane' to view emails then: When you use 'mouse' to click on an email in the list, it means open selected email and display in Message Pane. To scroll messages without opening: Using the mouse wheel - move in different directions to go up and down. </p><p><strong>Alternative:</strong> mouse click on the vertical scroll bar - so computer  understands you want to scroll and then use the  eg: down arrow key, to scroll down. OR physically drag scroll bar section up and down - right click and hold down to grab. </p><p>But if you select to open an email and then use the eg: down arrow key, it means select next email and open it. </p><p><strong>Another alternative that may suit you:</strong> Close the Message Pane - the quick method is to use the keyboard key 'F8' Then use mouse up and down arrow keys to move up and down and nothing opens, but it still highlights a given mail in list. When you have move down to something you want to open. Enable the Message Pane again using F8 and the email you had selected gets opened. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
