Ever since the Supernova update, TB crashes pretty much daily (up to 3x a day). I turned off auto-updates as soon as I found out how to, since everything was so confusing and didn't work the way I was used to. Now I'm afraid to do any more updates since I don't want a whole bunch of other things to get screwed up. I have learned to kind of work around  the problem areas, though it's frustrating. But I don't want to spend another 10-15 hours trying to fix new problems. Any suggestions? I can't seem to find any information about people who have had this crashing problem and then had it resolved through an update. Thanks </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1660957;,DD46

Initially there were no problems and I could receive messages and send then after June 3 I could do neither. I contacted iinet and themessagingco. for assistance. I spent heaps of time with themessagingco changing settings for incoming and out going mail but am still unable to send or receive on Thunderbird. Help required, as I want to continue using Thunderbird. I am able to receive and send through webmail for themessagingco but really want to use Thunderbird. Is there something on Thunderbird that needs changing?  Helen </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",helenl51
