Now, instead of just starting TB and it downloading all new messages, I have to click Get Messages multiple times to retrieve everything. I have seen similar questions here and the answers have all been variations of blaming the user. So: a) I have not changed any settings. b) It used to download all available messages, whether when TB started up or when I clicked Get Messages. c) Just now on starting TB, it took 6 clicks to retrieve 20 message. They are all text, no attachments, so the total size would be in KB, not MB. d) Using Speedtest, my connection speed is over 300 MB/second so it isn't a connection speed limit on my side. And I doubt it is a speed limitation on Gmail's side. </p><p>With all of that in mind, I would appreciate any suggestions of what could be causing the problem and what the fix might be. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",firefox1043

When I check for new messages, it starts downloading instantly, but then there can be a pause with the Windows hourglass shown for ~5-10 sec before downloading resumes. </p><p>When I click a new email in any of my inboxes, it opens a fully formatted TB page with the To/From/Subject all shown correctly, but the message content area is blank white. May take up to ~10 sec to display the message content.  Doesn't matter if the content is plain text or includes images or with/without attachments.   Same thing can happen with emails previously received and read. </p><p>Don't think this is an ISP issue because Firefox 129.0 isn't having delays opening web pages. </p><p>No errors reported by: chkdsk /r on both boot SSD and internal data HDD DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth sfc /scannow </p><p>Any suggestions?
