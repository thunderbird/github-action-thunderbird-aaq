If so, is it in the right place here? If not, where to put this? </p><p>Platform: Windows 10. Issue: Thunderbird (Lightning/Calendar) keeps aggressively stealing focus, i.e. putting the Reminder window on top of whatever else I am doing. This is incredibly annoying and unproductive. The only option is to completely disable Reminders, which defeats the purpose of course. See also, for example, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/185c727/how_can_i_prevent_the_reminders_window_from/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/185c727/how_can_i_prevent_the_reminders_window_from/</a>. Requirement: I would like to still hear the Reminder sound, and it would be great if the application also 'gets highlighted' (in orange) on the Taskbar (like many applications that have something new going on, but do not immediately push themselves to the foreground) to get a visual Notification, as well. </p><p>In any case, this overly dominant behaviour of the application should NOT persist. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",engage1

These occurred after I powered up in the AM and launched Thunderbird.  In the first instance all the messages that were downloaded (about 20) would only display in HTML code.  In the second instance about 20 downloads were replaced by an email I had received 3 years ago, displayed without a sender or a recipient in the message.  Once downloaded, I can't figure our how to download these messages again (correctly I hope).  I had to read the messages on my phone. Help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lanejm47

When I reply to the message via Thunderbird, it uses the correct sender-name.   </p><p>I assume that there must be at least two fields in the Email message that would identifying the sender-name of the message.  I tried to find out more from the RFC5322 specs here: </p><pre>   <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322</a>  </pre> <p>My guess is that  Thunderbird is getting whatever it displays as the sender-name in my inbox from a different field from what it uses as the ""To"" name when I reply to a message.  For most messages, these two fields are probably the same, so there's no noticeable difference.  But attached screenshots illustrate the difference: </p><p>[1] Thunderbird Inbox wrongly shows Sender as ""Dan Sullivan""  (deceased husband of sender, who may have been the account holder when the Earthlink Email address was setup many years ago) </p><p>[2] Gmail Inbox show Sender as ""Margaret Sullivan""  (writer of the message) </p><p>[3] Thunderbird reply correctly shows the recipient as ""Margaret Sullivan"" </p><p>This isn't a huge problem.   (When I pointed out the oddity in my reply to my friend, I  told her that ""(Personally, I enjoyed the reminder of Dan's charming smile.)""  But it probably should be added to the list of things to tidy up whenever anybody's modifying the relevant component of the Thunderbird program. </p><p>Of course, my friend can probably prevent it from happening by changing some field in whatever software she uses for writing/receiving Emails, but that might be more trouble than it's worth for a non-geek.   Happy New Year! Thanks to Thunderbird for providing the Email client software I've been happily using for many years, and hope to continue doing so for many years to come. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1627677;1627678;,MandyWh
