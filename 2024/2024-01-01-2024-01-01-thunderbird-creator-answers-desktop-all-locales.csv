From what I have read, the process of transferring my profile seems straightforward for whitch I'll be able to handle.  <strong>However, from what I have read transferring my profile will not transfer my local folders</strong>.   </p><p>I have read dozens of online articles releated to the transfer, but only a few articles even mention how to handle the local folders, and those that do mention it are confusing and seem to gloss over it as if no one uses local folders. Can someone point to a good write-up on how to handle moving my local folders. </p><p>Thank you for any help. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1627586;,sdadolf

If so, is it in the right place here? If not, where to put this? </p><p>Platform: Windows 10. Issue: Thunderbird (Lightning/Calendar) keeps aggressively stealing focus, i.e. putting the Reminder window on top of whatever else I am doing. This is incredibly annoying and unproductive. The only option is to completely disable Reminders, which defeats the purpose of course. See also, for example, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/185c727/how_can_i_prevent_the_reminders_window_from/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/185c727/how_can_i_prevent_the_reminders_window_from/</a>. Requirement: I would like to still hear the Reminder sound, and it would be great if the application also 'gets highlighted' (in orange) on the Taskbar (like many applications that have something new going on, but do not immediately push themselves to the foreground) to get a visual Notification, as well. </p><p>In any case, this overly dominant behaviour of the application should NOT persist. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",engage1
