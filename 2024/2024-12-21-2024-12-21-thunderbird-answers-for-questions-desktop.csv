These are Spectrum's general settings for outgoing mail: </p><p>- **SMTP Server Address**: `<a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>` or `<a href=""http://mail.twcny.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twcny.rr.com</a>` (depending on your region) - **Port**: `587` (preferred) or `465` - **Encryption**: `STARTTLS` for port 587 or `SSL/TLS` for port 465 - **Authentication Method**: Normal Password - **Username**: Your full email address (e.g., `mad1doc@twcny.rr.com`) - **Password**: Your RoadRunner email password </p> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> 2. **Check Credentials** </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>Double-check that your username and password are entered correctly.

Try temporarily disabling them to see if this resolves the issue. If it does, add Thunderbird to the firewall/antivirus exception list. </p> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> 5. **Check Spectrum's Service Status** </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>There may be issues with Spectrum's mail servers.

That's a problem. I need mbox files for 1) long-term storage of mail outside Thunderbird, and 2) possible import back into Apple Mail someday. I concluded a while ago that maildir/eml is not a good interchange format, at least on the Mac or at least with Apple Mail. So using this method would require me to convert scores of e-mail folders to maildir/eml now, which I would prefer not to do. </p><p>Unless you or someone else knows of a way other than ImportExportTools NG to import mbox files into maildir/eml folders? </p>",user213815874572776100201782415079883066567,false,0,0

We have used Thunderbird (on Linux) with pop3 and maildir at my small business (5-10 partners) for five years now. Switched to Thunderbird from Claws Mail because we wanted a more modern mail client, but for us it was mandatory to use maildir because it means we can store and later archive all data per project on a local file server in a plain text readable file format. We have experienced zero problems, so at least when used for pop3 it seems to me that maildir is reliable. To me personally one text file per mail has always seemed like the way to go, while having thousands of mail belonging to different projects and clients baked in to an ever growing mbox database seems like potential future problems. </p><p>I have even set up a quite odd pop3 solution in order to avoid imap; where two computers (home and office computer) are sharing the same maildir mailbox located on a ssh file server. This also works fine as long as you are syncing the local '.thunderbird' config/settings dir (by using 'unison') before Thunderbird is started and after it has been closed. This setup worked flawlessly with Claws Mail and the only complaint I have with Thunderbird is that downloading new mail is slow when the mailbox is not located on a local drive. </p><p>So to conclude my experience is that maildir is solid for use with a pop3 mailbox. My recommendation is to put the pop3 mailbox on a local ssd/hdd, because downloading new mail can be really slow if you put the mailbox on a remote server drive. </p><p>//Mikael </p>",mikael25,false,0,0

If a user with a 20Gb folder receive just one small email of 1 kb, a 20Gb file is changed and needed to transferred and backupped. Even a advanced backup system that trasfners only changes of files, it has to read 2 files of 20Gb, check differences and transfer them to backup archive. It's too much. Thunderbird archives folder action (press A key and emai is transferred in users archive folder) mitigates this issue, in my company we are forced to archive past years, so current email folder decrease of size and old mail are stuck in a fixed archive. Maildir format should be the standard format for Thunderbird. </p>",angerangel,false,0,0

I thought Thunderbird was suppose to delete downloaded emails after a certain numbers of days. From what I saw, there were thousands of old emails still sitting in AOL.  </p><p>So I created some new folders on AOL and moved all the emails from the inbox to several of the new folders, dividing the email up in the new folders by dates (years).  Then after getting them into smaller amounts in each folder, I moved all the emails from December 1 2024 through todays date into the AOL inbox.  I had closed the copy of Thunderbird on this old computer prior to working on the files in AOL </p><p>Then I went to the computer that I've been using Thunderbird on for the last year and opened up Thunderbird and pressed the ""get new messages"". It started working and after a while all the emails I had in AOLs inbox came into my Thunderbird inbox. For some reason I had to manually run the filters on the inbox to get the emails to flow into the proper folders I had set up in the past and it now looks like my program is running correctly again. </p><p>I tried to find the place in Thunderbird where you can set the number of days that Thunderbird leaves the emails in AOL's inbox before deleting thm, but for some reason I could not find it. Maybe someone will point out the place where it is.  </p><p>I think the problem I might have been having had to do with the thousands of old emails that had never been deleted from my AOL inbox after that had been downloaded into Thunderbird. </p><p>I greatly appreciate all the help I have been receiving here to try and resolve my issue. And I felt I should post the above information to let everyone know that the solution seemed to be to get rid of all the old emails that for some reason had never been deleted after Thunderbird had downloaded them. </p>",FredBerney,false,0,0
