So clearly I am someone using gmail that does not know if you don't physically sign into your email account using something other than a mail client you will loose access. </p><p>Not that their announcement actually says anything much about email specifically,  but as they are talking about inactive accounts, I think you will find checking your email is enough to make the account active. See https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/updating-our-inactive-account-policies/ </p><p>I will worry about it when they start sending me emails that they will be closing my account.  it is three months into this new regime and I still have no account closure emails. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The ones I don't get much in or out were blocked/deactivated even though TB retrieved every 10-15 minutes. So you have been lucky if you use a desktop.&nbsp;? </p><p>The only thing I have read which is most likely the link you provided, is they are changing the time frame to go 2 years inactive before deactivating. Then they send an email asking you to stay active or not. They sent me nothing until I got that notice. That's when I tried to physically sign in and found 3 accounts blocked while 3 were not. And yes, it doesn't mention email other than ""use it to read or send to keep the account active"" but it doesn't say how much or how often. </p><p>I'm on a desktop and not a cell phone that usually keeps you logged in (cell phone) until you physically log out. Completely different scenario with me. My cache is dumped (desktop) when I shut down. TB does not log in or out of gmail, it just uses your pw to retrieve messages. If it did log me in, I should be able to immediately go to gmail and use that account. That's not the case and why I asked the question. </p>",TheNightowl,false,0,0

Log into your google account with a browser and check the history of security notifications.  If the buttonjs do not work,  contact Google. </p><p>If you are using Thunderbird and deny those permissions,  then Thunderbird will simply fail to function as a mail client.  So don't post here later about Thunderbird not getting mail,  not syncing your calendar and contacts.  You have chosen to prevent that happening by denying the required permissions. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
