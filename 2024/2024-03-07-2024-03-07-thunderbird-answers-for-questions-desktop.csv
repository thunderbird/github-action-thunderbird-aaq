Since Thunderbird works fine with HTML, there should be no problem. Or am I missing something? Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

Prior to my fumbling around with the settings, the messages I received appeared with HTML images appearing when I opened the message. Now, however, only text appears when the message is opened. I need to know which setting I need to re-set and how I get to that particular setting. Thanks, again, for your help, and if you can help me find that setting, I will greatly appreciate it. Tom. </p>",TomWilliams231,false,0,0
