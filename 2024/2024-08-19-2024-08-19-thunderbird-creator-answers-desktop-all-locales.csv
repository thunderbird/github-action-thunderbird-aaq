I now get a microsoft message when trying to download new messages, saying it cannot access an invalid certificate.

Although inconvenient, this system worked and I could use the email provider system.

I have had Monzilla Thunderbird App for some while , primarily used for email, and access to my email account with Microsoft and has always been a bit of a pain to say the least. That I fear is because it was never set up properly by myself in the first place. </p><p>However, at the moment I can't receive any email from my PC .......""bards@btconnect.com ""  unless I sign in via a webpage. However, access via my smartphone using supplied Outlook email app, no problem. </p><p>So I am hopeful that you guys can help me sort out my PC access once and for all. </p><p>The current problem has arisen after receiving a forced donation / subscription page from Mozilla having made my donation I still do not have access to my email and folders. </p><p>Brief history: i. Originally PC access to account via Monzilla working fine, (donations made at intervals to Monzilla). ii. Microsoft then changed security systems and servers and with current setup at the time I couldn't get access to email incoming or outgoing ( problem with Imap / PoP3 servers). iii. Fix provided by Monzilla with new account denoted as .... bards@btconnect.com (OWL) whatever OWL stands for I do not know, (annual subscription required). iv. Even with the use of this get around , I still had problems sending mail this I believe was a problem down to default passwords and old server settings. (confliction between default settings and original account settings and use of OWL&nbsp;? ). v. As mentioned above the current problem has arisen after receiving a forced donation / subscription page from Mozilla having made my donation I still do not have access to my email. problem with server settings again. Don't know what's going on&nbsp;? and I am thoroughly confused and would appreciate some help getting things back on track.
