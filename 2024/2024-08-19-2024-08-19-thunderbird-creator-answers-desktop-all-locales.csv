Originally PC access to account via Monzilla working fine, (donations made at intervals to Monzilla). ii. Microsoft then changed security systems and servers and with current setup at the time I couldn't get access to email incoming or outgoing ( problem with Imap / PoP3 servers). iii. Fix provided by Monzilla with new account denoted as .... bards@btconnect.com (OWL) whatever OWL stands for I do not know, (annual subscription required). iv. Even with the use of this get around , I still had problems sending mail this I believe was a problem down to default passwords and old server settings. (confliction between default settings and original account settings and use of OWL&nbsp;? ). v. As mentioned above the current problem has arisen after receiving a forced donation / subscription page from Mozilla having made my donation I still do not have access to my email. problem with server settings again.
