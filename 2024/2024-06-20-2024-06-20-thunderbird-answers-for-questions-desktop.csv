I am not arguing anything, just trying to understand the short &amp; non-descriptive answers that generated more questions for me than answer.  No one stated that the OAuth2 option only displays for certain server entries prior to your post and I had no idea I could use their 365 servers for an <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> address.  I do not know which address domains are compatible with what servers. Your first response stated to use ""those"" settings.  I did not know if you were referring to the 365 servers from the previous post or something to do with the hotmail link you included in your response.  Then you never responded to my reply asking for clarification.  When sfhowes wrote POP uses the same settings as IMAP, I thought they were stating that IMAP and POP are interchangeable.  For me, they are not, since I prefer to download my mail to my local device.  Granted, my reply to sfhowes was not bad and I apologize to sfhowes for that.  I will try the settings tomorrow and either close this thread or report further. </p>",gorbage,false,0,0

I meant to write that my reply to sfhowes was ""bad"", instead of ""not bad"". </p><p>So...I tested the <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> server and the OAuth2 option finally appeared but not until after saving the server name and going back to edit it.  The original post from sfhowes was correct and the Microsoft article I had found, is not.  Just to reiterate and summarize for anyone that happens upon this thread, the OAuth2 authentication method for outgoing mail server settings, and probably incoming, only appears  in the drop-down list of choices based on the server name entered. </p><p>My guess is that Thunderbird has some sort of handshake with the server to determine whether it uses OAuth2 or not.  It might be done when saving the server name.  When the save is made, Thunderbird could be communicating with the server and updating the authentication method options.  This would force you to edit the settings after just saving them so you can now choose the updated list option of OAuth2. </p><p>Maybe someone could confirm this and add to this thread but for now, I consider it resolved. </p>",gorbage,false,0,0
