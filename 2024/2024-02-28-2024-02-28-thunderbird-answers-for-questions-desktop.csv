This had the following effect. When I now use Ctrl++, it increments to a larger zoom quicker and I can only use the Ctrl++ a total of 3 times because there are only 3 numbers after the number 1.  Basically less clicking/pressing of keys. There is less choice in the number of variable zoom levels. But if you find yourself doing a lot in Ctrl++ to get to a size you want then this fix will help a lot. </p><p>It means you need to consider what numbers you need after the number 1 As this is a personal adjustment setting, you may need to fiddle about with the numbers until you get what you prefer.  </p> <ul><li> To save your choices click on the tick icon. </li></ul> <p>If you ever need to reset back to the default set of numbers then you can click on the far right curved anti-clockwise arrow. </p><p>Remember - Before you test your settings  Reset everything back to default: View &gt; Zoom &gt; Reset Zoom and you may discover you need to reselect email as well. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I advised choosing a suitable size if you need to see a larger size font on all occasions - aka currently you have to zoom for every email.  </p><p>I had no idea what settings you were using so I suggested: </p> <ul><li> Fonts for Latin and Other Writing Systems </li><li> Set 'Proportional Size' to eg: 18 </li><li> Set 'Monospace Size' to 18 </li><li> Set minimum size to 16 (allows a bit smaller but stops smaller font size)  </li></ul> <p>But you felt this was too large. </p><p>So if you want the default setting to increase but the above settings were too much then try a bit less: </p> <ul><li> Fonts for Latin and Other Writing Systems </li><li> Set 'Proportional Size' to eg: 14 </li><li> Set 'Monospace Size' to 14 </li><li> Set minimum size to 12 (allows a bit smaller but stops smaller font size)  </li></ul> <p>But 'zoom' itself is entirely different. It is a manual setting on a per email basis which is initiated only when you select it.  If you find you sometimes use zoom, but not always then the method mentioned above means you can preset the zoom levels meaning you don't need to keep clicking to get a suitable level. </p><p>But the zoom level number 1 means using  default starting point to be whatever you set up in 'Settings' &gt; 'General' &gt; 'Language &amp; Appearance' section &gt; 'Advanced' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I am changing the HEP.  I plan to keep my current email name.  I had hoped to simply modify the SMTP address information.  I have been told this is not possible, that I have to create another AN and copy over my existing file folders.  That is where the two questions above come in to play. Although I do not have the SMTP info from the new HEP I went ahead and added the new AN.  I was expecting to see the first 6 folders of my current AN but instead there are just the Inbox and Trash. Is that to be expected or have I missed something? The second question relates to getting my original folders over to the new AN.  I discovered the right click option mentioned above.  I am wondering if that would be a good way to do the copying as opposed to doing it from a backup. It would seem to be a cleaner way to go.  I hope this helps. </p>",dobrphi,false,0,0

I installed it yesterday and it does help a bit, but not really a solution. </p><p>Here is the improvement: now when I click the edit button I no longer get a blank thunderbird contact folder. I still do not get a cardbook contact folder, I still get a thunderbird folder but it now has that original contact information filled it and it is editable, kinda. the difference in not having a true cardbook contact folder is that the thunderbird contact folder does not have the ability to edit the many sub categories that cardbook has available. ie. clients/current or completed or pending or other sub categories of clients, like design, build,etc. same for subcontractors and all other major categories. </p><p>I love how cardbook gives me more control and faster ways to find info because of that feature and would like to get it working. </p>",dan17,false,0,0
