This had the following effect. When I now use Ctrl++, it increments to a larger zoom quicker and I can only use the Ctrl++ a total of 3 times because there are only 3 numbers after the number 1.  Basically less clicking/pressing of keys. There is less choice in the number of variable zoom levels.

I advised choosing a suitable size if you need to see a larger size font on all occasions - aka currently you have to zoom for every email.  </p><p>I had no idea what settings you were using so I suggested: </p> <ul><li> Fonts for Latin and Other Writing Systems </li><li> Set 'Proportional Size' to eg: 18 </li><li> Set 'Monospace Size' to 18 </li><li> Set minimum size to 16 (allows a bit smaller but stops smaller font size)  </li></ul> <p>But you felt this was too large. </p><p>So if you want the default setting to increase but the above settings were too much then try a bit less: </p> <ul><li> Fonts for Latin and Other Writing Systems </li><li> Set 'Proportional Size' to eg: 14 </li><li> Set 'Monospace Size' to 14 </li><li> Set minimum size to 12 (allows a bit smaller but stops smaller font size)  </li></ul> <p>But 'zoom' itself is entirely different.

Look in windows file explorer (assuming you use windows) within the profile to see if there are any files with 'nstmp' in name.

Someone responded to a similar post I had at Gitlab. want to share it here because it may help others and though thier suggestion was helpful did not actually solve the issue. Here is a copy of my reply to that person at Gitlab: </p><p>thanks for that <a href=""https://gitlab.com/CardBook/CardBook/-/issues/1602"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/CardBook/CardBook/-/issues/1602</a> link, it does have a link to more recent version of cardbook 93.3 than my original 92.9 with the problem. I installed it yesterday and it does help a bit, but not really a solution. </p><p>Here is the improvement: now when I click the edit button I no longer get a blank thunderbird contact folder. I still do not get a cardbook contact folder, I still get a thunderbird folder but it now has that original contact information filled it and it is editable, kinda. the difference in not having a true cardbook contact folder is that the thunderbird contact folder does not have the ability to edit the many sub categories that cardbook has available. ie. clients/current or completed or pending or other sub categories of clients, like design, build,etc. same for subcontractors and all other major categories. </p><p>I love how cardbook gives me more control and faster ways to find info because of that feature and would like to get it working. </p>",dan17,false,0,0

I do recall months ago, searching feverishly for an email, and then finding it as a ""sub"" under another email, just like this current situation. </blockquote> <p>If you lost your profile on an undate and reentered your account information  you will have been caught up in the changing of the default threading to on from off.  But yes it has been around a while. </p> <blockquote> 1)  How would I now get that *second* line item (Socially-Responsible Investing Alyse-Style), for example, to NOT be in a sort of ""folder"" of the first line item (End-of-Year-Planning Questionnaire)? All I had done was, in my Sent box, I right-clicked an email, then selected Move to &gt; Recent &gt; 2024 Started w Jacqueline, and it ended up in the 2024 After Jacqueline as wanted, but mistakenly *within* ""End-of-Year-Planning Questionnaire"" line item as a sort of ""sub"" line item. I simply want all items that I move to the 2024 After Jacqueline folder to end up in left-hand-alignment with each other ... all line items flush left.  For example, like this:  End-of-Year Planning Questionnaire Socially-Responsible Investing Alyse-Style  2) How do I make that STOP happening for future email line-item moves? </blockquote> <p>I think all of that is covered in the article I linked to.  Personally I would change the default and then revert my folders. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

I’m seeing lots of complaints on the TBird site sbout other people not having that selection either. I’m in TBird 115.8.0 on Windows 10, if that’s what’s causing that viewing problem. </p><p>Also I can’t tell what you mean by personally you’d reset the default and revert. Is that sone other set of steps than you’re linking to? </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0

I get you have lost your address book,  did you have to enter any other information with the last upgrade,  like reenter your account information? </p><p>Fundamentally you can not go backwards.  It will only lead to more troubles to try. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
