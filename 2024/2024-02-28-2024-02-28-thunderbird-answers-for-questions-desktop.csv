BUT, if the email provider refuses, my suggestion is to use Google Workspace. It's not free, but provides the full service reliability that you would want for a business.

Click 'open folder' - exit TB - the account, if POP, is in the Mail folder, otherwise the Imapfolder.  - it will appear as Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; with message folders such as inbox, inbox.msf, etc.  - COPY the entire &lt;accountname&gt; folder and store on the external drive.  - restart Thunderbird  - click 'account settings' and then 'server settings'  - note the bottom line links to 'local directory'. click the browse button to locate and select the folder you created on external drive. This may require a restart of Thunderbird - restart Thunderbird and all should be okay. Nothing will have been lost in the process.

Look in windows file explorer (assuming you use windows) within the profile to see if there are any files with 'nstmp' in name.

Second, you might revisit your settings for compacting and adjust the size at which you want the compacting to occur.
