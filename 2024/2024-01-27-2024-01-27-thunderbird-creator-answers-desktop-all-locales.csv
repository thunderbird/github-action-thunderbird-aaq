This thread has gone through 8 back-and-forth messages between myself and the other party, 4 from me and 4 from the recipient. </li><li> I expand the thread, and see 4 messages, only those from the recipient. </li><li> I want to see the messages that I sent, so I can see what I said and understand the conversation so I may appropriately reply. However, I don't see my messages. </li></ol> <p>This is confusing behavior by default, and contrasts with the behavior of threads in Gmail, Apple Mail, and most other email clients. </p><p><strong>Experience 2: Workaround but not quite:</strong> </p><p>After researching and googling the issue, I see several Thunderbird extensions, and several simple workarounds that purport to solve this problem. </p><p>I don't want to try an extension just yet, that feels like a big commitment, so I try one of the workarounds: The instructions tell me to right click my Inbox folder, choose ""Properties,"" then click the ""Choose"" button to add additional folders. The folder to add to include replies from me is the Sent folder, so I check it and save. </p><p>Problem solved! So far. My thread now shows all 8 messages, including the ones I sent back. I can finally follow the conversation, and it seems to work how I expect. </p><p>Until one day, I go to send a message. </p><p>I just sent an email to my brother to ask him about something, and hit Send. Great! Worked fine. Except... suddenly the message I just sent appears in my Inbox. </p><p>That's weird. Did I accidentally send it to myself? I click the message, and nope, it's just sent to him. But why is it in my Inbox then? </p><p>Oh, right, it clicks now. I added ""Sent"" to my Inbox. Of course it will show my sent messages in the Inbox, then. </p><p>So this workaround isn't a true solution, either. </p><p><strong>What I expect.</strong> </p><p>First, I have not tried extensions yet. I'm pretty sure this is such a core expectation of how an Inbox works, that I have a strong belief that it should work as expected by default. I'll stand by that. </p><p>How it should work, as a brand new user: </p> <ol><li> I install Thunderbird, and follow the steps to add my Gmail account. </li><li> I open the thread I have in progress (in this case it's a back and forth with a watch repair shop) </li><li> I see the initial message, which I sent, at the top level; followed by their reply, followed by my reply, followed by their reply, on and on until the most recent message (that they happened to send). </li><li> I send a reply to the message at the end, and it appears at the end of the thread. </li></ol> <p>Now, some time goes by and I send a fresh message to a new recipient. </p><p>I do not see it in my Inbox. </p><p><strong>Fin</strong> </p><p>Again, I'm not interested in convoluted steps to fix this and make it work, or extensions that solve it for me. </p><p>I implore the Thunderbird contributors to focus on this <em>key</em> and highly influential moment in the early new-user experience, and resolve the confusion properly. I don't really care how, but I think it needs to be done by any means available. Perhaps a new setting for the Inbox folder to just set up the corresponding Sent, which would be extremely ridiculously easily detectable for 99.9% of email accounts and easily resolvable for the remaining 0.1%. Once the Sent folder is known, the behavior is straightforward to specify. This feels like an easy win at a key moment. </p><p>Thunderbird has improved so much in the last couple years; let's continue resolving the rough edges not only in the UI, but also the UX. Cheers. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1633378;,trisweb

I really don't know if there people that really like to have emails from different accounts sorted differently or show different columns. I guess not.
