Note: Yahoo Microsoft (MSN,hotmail, live and outlook) and Gmail all require oauth authentication, in those instances there is no ""password""  only an oauth line in the password manager that contains a ""token"" issued by your provider in the initial authentication process.  It is not your password.  Although if deleted, or denied by your provider (lie they forced a new password on you) it should initiate a new authentication web page flow.  I have seen these pages variously described a a bug, a nag screen and one person thought they had been hacked.

My account settings (server name, port, security, etc) all seem to match their recommendations (I have checked and rechecked). I do need and have a password, and it works to login to their webmail. I was required to change this password (for other reasons) and have done so. Then I obviously had to change it in Thunderbird in order for emails to sync/download (I am using POP, not IMAP) but that is where things have gone awry, somehow. There is now no line item for the provider's server which I can update the password for, and I cannot see how to add or create one. I could create an new account of course, but the default for that is IMAP, not POP, and Thunderbird won't allow you to change server type. I have tried manually setting up a new account, but I am prevented doing so at the last hurdle because Thunderbird notes the email/sever combination already exists. And even if I do this, I don't know how to link my 1000s of stored emails in multiples folders to the new account for continuity. So, still stuck. </p>",grantdixon,false,0,0

It writes all new mail to the temp folder so antivirus product that do not scan email can have at it.  Nothing more.  So having it off is actually standard as there are few except defender that do not scan email.  But that is also a large part of why I use defender.  No pesky email scanner. </p><p>Personally I am guessing bit defender has quarantined or deleted you mail store.  They work through Identifying a ""threat"" and asking you to authorized an automatic fix.  Often this is the deletion of 20 years worth of email stored in that mail folder. This is why I exclude antivirus products from scanning my profile folder.  There is no such thing a a ""threat"" in a stored email.  Thunderbird does not execute scripts in the email and attachments are stored a mime encoded plain text so email in storage is not a threat.  Even attachments pose on threat until they are decrypted and turned back into a file,  and that occurs in the system temp folder where the antivirus already has access to kill the file.
