I just did a ""clean"" install of Windows 10 (previously had Win 7 installed). I have my Thunderbird profile in M:\Thunderbird"". Program is installed on D:\Thunderbird. When I opened Thunderbird using recently installed Win 10, it found my e-mails on gmail and imported them. Then I imported the profile from M:\Thunderbird. Now I have TWO profiles on Thunderbird. Every time I now open Thunderbird, it imports all my new mails into two different places. </p><p>Trying to merge them into one profile and now have nothing. Here's what profiles.ini looks like: </p><p>[Profile2] Name=paulp575 IsRelative=0 Path=M:\Thunderbird </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/j1vvmapz.default Default=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/1cd37335.default-release </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>[InstallD7D8687A29006428] Default=M:\Thunderbird Locked=1 </p><p>How can I change profiles.ini so that Thunderbird only opens the profile at M:\Thunderbird? And also ensures I only have one profile on Thunderbird's main screen? I'd show a screen shot, but now when I open Thunderbird it wants me to go through the process of setting up my account! </p><p>THanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1633575;,paulp575123

Initially this works OK. However, sometimes this website calendar is amended and I'd like to be able to update my Thunderbird calendar but a subsequent import fails completely if it includes an update to an existing entry. I know that the UID of an event in the ics file matches that of an existing Thunderbird entry but the LAST-MODIFIED value is later in the second ics file entry. Is there any other condition that should be required to allow the import to run and update any matching existing entries? Any ideas welcome.
