Every time I now open Thunderbird, it imports all my new mails into two different places. </p><p>Trying to merge them into one profile and now have nothing. Here's what profiles.ini looks like: </p><p>[Profile2] Name=paulp575 IsRelative=0 Path=M:\Thunderbird </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/j1vvmapz.default Default=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/1cd37335.default-release </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>[InstallD7D8687A29006428] Default=M:\Thunderbird Locked=1 </p><p>How can I change profiles.ini so that Thunderbird only opens the profile at M:\Thunderbird?
