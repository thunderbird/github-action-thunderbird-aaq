That is, when you make a change, the prefs.js is updated in memory and works fine until you close thunderbird, at which time it writes the updated file back to the profile. Since the settings aren't there when you next start, that shows that it isn't being saved. It could be a firewall or an anti-virus most likely. If you check your profile within windows file explorer, you might see multiple copies of prefs.js. Again, I don't have a solution, but that does seem to be the problem. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
