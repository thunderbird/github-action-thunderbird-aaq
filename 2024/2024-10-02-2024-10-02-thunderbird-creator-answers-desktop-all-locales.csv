There is 1 folder in <strong>Favorites </strong>that does show it is a sub-folder about 5 levels deep,  (although most of the upper level folders will show emails when selected). There are 20+ folders shown in the Recent folders that do show emails as expected. When i select the 'All Folders' option under 'Folder Modes', nothing happens.  The display does not change, and when i click back to show the options again, 'All Folders' is NOT selected (even though i just had selected it!). </p><p>I read though several topics related to Local Folders, but i do not see this specific issue.   I verified the Local Folders directory on Windows does have data (.sbf, MSF, and File) and all the sub-directories.   It contains about 4.3GB of data.   I tried Copying the actual Local Folders directory on Windows to a new directory, and then changed the Local Folders Account settings configuration to use that new path, however same result, Still cannot see Local Folders entire directory structure. Using TB v128.30.esr.  Have it configured to apply updates when available.  I saw in the release notes there were updates released on or around Sept 18-19. I initially thought the Local Folders index was corrupted somehow on Windows, so i tried the 'Repair Folder' option on the 5 levels i could see in the 1 Favorite that was showing, especially the top level, however that did not change anything.  Since I cannot see the whole Local Folder structure, i cannot try on any other folders. I now suspect there is an issue with 'Hide Local Folders' function.  that seems to be what has caused all this. </p><p>will attach screen caps showing the menu options, and Recents/Favorites.
