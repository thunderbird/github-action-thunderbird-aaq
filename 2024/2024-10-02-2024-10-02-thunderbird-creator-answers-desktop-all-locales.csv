I can get messages delivered to the inbox of my main account but Thunderbird no longer searches the server for messages on the secondary account.  Both accounts are set up in Thunderbird with identical settings.   </p><p>I have been online and read the support suggestions on how to resolve this but it hasn't worked.  Support suggested it may be that the password has changed and advised me to remove the password from settings and next time I open Thunderbird I will be asked for my password.  This did not happen.  I removed the password from the account which is not downloading to my inbox and when I reopened Thunderbird I was not asked for the new password.  However I can send emails from this secondary account. </p><p>I have checked webmail and there are definitely messages waiting there to download. </p><p>My main Thunderbird email (the one that is downloading messages to my inbox) is aparbury@comcen.com.au not the one showing on this log in. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",anabel.parbury
