I initially thought the Local Folders index was corrupted somehow on Windows, so i tried the 'Repair Folder' option on the 5 levels i could see in the 1 Favorite that was showing, especially the top level, however that did not change anything.  Since I cannot see the whole Local Folder structure, i cannot try on any other folders. I now suspect there is an issue with 'Hide Local Folders' function.  that seems to be what has caused all this. </p><p>will attach screen caps showing the menu options, and Recents/Favorites.
