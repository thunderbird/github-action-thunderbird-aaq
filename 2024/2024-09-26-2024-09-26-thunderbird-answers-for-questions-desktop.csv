I have looked into them but I am still searching around to see if there are others. You were not willing to endorse mailfence and in searching read some complaints about them.

I don't store my emails with the current host, they just play middleman, receive the emails and ship them off to my Thunderbird.

They may offer such as standard,  or at an additional cost.  but that is the first requirement. </p><p>Second you need to maintain all of the domain registrations  there are some registrars hat will register certain domains for a few dollars a year and you can point all of the domains to whatever fixed IP address you have obtained.  The mail exchanger for a domain is defined in DNS,  so multiple domains can have the same mail exchanger.  </p><p>next,  to send mail you need to have an IP address that is not recorded as ""consumer"" or any mail you send will be rejected by the vast majority of mail providers on the planet due to there being blocklists of consumer IP addresses to prevent the bad old days of spam bots infecting consumer PC's </p><p>Then you need to have a mail server setup and running on your NAS or as a specific local server or a hosted provider.  If the server is to be local suitable oncoming holes in your firewall and router for incoming mail to be delivered to you are required. </p><p>Wikipedia maintain a list of mail server software for you to use as a starting point for software you need to install. </p> <blockquote> Can you tell me how either I can host my own emails or a really reasonable priced email host? </blockquote> <p>That is outside the scope of this forum as it is a hosting question,  not related in anyway to the Thunderbird mail client.  I really suggest you retain professional assistance with this as it has significant potential for trouble if you make a mistake.  Like doing your own corporate taxes or undertaking your own conveyancing.  You can do it,  but it means assuming all the risk of failure due to a lack of knowledge about specifics. </p><p>Forbes published a list of email hostintg providers. <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/business/software/best-email-hosting-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.forbes.com/advisor/au/business/software/best-email-hosting-service/</a> where they recommend  DreamHost, SiteGround, A2 Hosting, Zoho Mail and  Google Workspace   I suggest you research a hosting service that meets your personal needs and ability to pay, or as I said retain the services of professional consultant an pay them to do it for you..  As a peer support forum,  no one here is going to be able to offer you professional advice on which you should act, or rely upon.  About all we can do is share what we know in the hopes it is of help to you, but it does not constitute professional advice. </p> <blockquote> I don't want to loose these emails. The ones that mostly got used by the businesses have been dissolved. But the ones we are getting personal emails threw, we want to keep.  Please advise.... thank you for your time and dedication to helping. Judi </blockquote> <p>It is this last part that particularly concerns me more than anything.  IMAP mail accounts do not have a permanent local copy of mail,  so if you are using this protocol then you could potentially loose everything in that mail address simply by changing the hosting provider or closing the account. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I had a blog for it to blog my travels (at the time) around the USA. I am no longer traveling and don't need the blog/website etc. </p><p>BUT, I do have numerous emails with that domain extension. The company that hosted the blog (when I was using it) is (for now) maintaining accounts for existing customers but taking no new ones. I also am not happy that they are just being the so called middle man for my emails and it costing me over a $100 per year. I fear them totally ending one day as they are really a very small home based mom/pop outfit. </p><p>What I want to do, is move my domain name and keep my existing emails active. The emails are all POP3 accounts. Someone else told me I needed to get an EPP CODE. I believe I have that. Then someone told me about MX files, I don't know where those are or how to get them and they never responded to me about that. All they had said is if I wanted to move my Domain and emails and not have any interruption time in my emails, I would need my MX files. I am not sure if this is true or not but I am trying find out. </p><p>So this is all it is....  1) I want to move domain name (I know how that is done, I have done it once before but didn't have emails attached to it) 2) I want to move my emails with the said domain name but I need to know how to do it without any interruptions of my incoming emails. Some emails I receive are time sensitive and I need to know that won't happen.  </p><p>That is all I need to know. </p><p>Any and all help in this matter is beyond greatly appreciated.

Files get downloaded and then appended to relevant file eg: Inbox mbox file. </p><p>Advise: make your thunderbird profile folder and it's contents is exempt from being scanning. Also switch off scanning of incoming files/emails - even if this is just for a day or two to test performance. </p><p>One quick way to ensure a proper test is to do the following so AV and other similar types of programs are temp disabled without the need to alter anything: Exit all programs Restart computer in 'safe mode with networking' - note - if currently wireless using WIFI then you will need to connect computer to router/hub using an ethernet cable.  Then start Thunderbird and see if things improve. </p><p>Another main reason for delays are files containing emails which are getting rather large, so take up memory etc when they get opened to write data into. If you have a lot of emails in some folders then suggest you create some new folders with suitable names for organising and storing mail.  Then compact folders. I would advise you manually compact certain folders on a regular basis. Any folder that receives mail which is subsequently moved or deleted will still have a copy of email in original folder but it is 'marked as delted' and hidden from view. Compacting means a new file is created and then it looks in the original file for anything 'marked as deleted' - it does not copy those emails - only all the good emails you want to keep are copied into that new file. Then original is removed and new file replaces it. The new version is like a cleaned up file. It's considered good housekeeping maintenance and helps to reduce file size, recover disk space and reduce the risk of corrupt file. </p><p>The three folders that usually need compacting the most are 'Inbox', 'Junk/Spam' and 'Drafts'.  But also any folder which you know you have deleted or moved a load of emails. </p><p>To compact: Right click on folder and select 'Compact' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Specifying to leave on server does achieve your goal, but accessing from different PCs does cause previously downloaded messages to download again. You're in a compromise situation. If you do not trust your ISP's server, your safest move (in my opinion) is to create a second account in IMAP and download everything (file&gt;offline&gt;download) and then copy all of it to local folders. That is, if you don't trust the ISP and if it goes bust, then you've lost everything. Then, you could continue to use the account from multiple PCs, knowing you had a full copy. And do backup if you take that route. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I guess I wasn't detailed enough in the question. </p><p>I believe that the last time I tried to create an imap account on a server where I had the same credentials for a pop3 account, thunderbird either would not or could not do it, possibly because the server would not allow it.  So then I run into problems converting from pop3 to imap, which I haven't investigated.   </p><p>But the problem still remains that since I will always want to keep email locally (if not <em>only</em> locally), although I would not download the same email twice, it seems that I would still somehow have to sync my locally-stored email between the two machines.

In current situation, though, I suggest using POP and keeping all messages on server. That means you will download to each PC, but it does protect you. However, you also stated you wanted to be able to delete from one PC yet keep on another. That will always be problematic unless you download to both PCs first and then do selective deletes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Set up Imap accounts on each device and they display only what is on the server. So all imap accounts no matter what device - they all display the same data. But you cannot regard those accounts as an independent copy because they synchronise with server. </p><p>If you prefer to use POP&nbsp;: Pop accounts do not synchronise with anything. They download a copy of whatever is in Inbox that has not been previously download to that specific pop account. A 'popstate.dat' file located in the profile mail account folders keeps a record of what has been previously downloaded into that specific account on that computer. </p><p>If you need to download same emails into two completely separate computers that each have a pop account, then you need to have setting 'Leave message on server'. It does mean you can then download to two or more separate devices, but it would also mean organising emails twice. The other problem is there would be two completely independent 'Sent' folders </p><p>The alternative is to perform a copy of emails from one computer to another or just copy the entire profile, but , when you copy thunderbird from one computer to another it would overwrite anything on the second computer, thus losing any emails you had in Sent on second computer - if they were different. One compromise would be to only send from one specific computer, so the second computer only displays whatever the first sent. </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird </li><li> Access Profile&nbsp;: C://User/User Account/ Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </li><li> Quick way to access that location - see image below. </li><li> Copy that Thunderbird folder (if you have several 'profile name' folders - it copies all) </li></ul> <p>Then on other computer: </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird </li><li> Access Profile&nbsp;: C://User/User Account/ Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </li><li> Delete that Thunderbird folder </li><li> Paste the copied Thunderbird folder into the 'Roaming' Folder </li></ul> <p>This means you have identical copy when you start Thunderbird. However, it is important that you have exactly the same version of Thunderbird operating on both computers at the time of copying from one to the other. </p><p>As you are experiencing - although it works perfectly to have two separate pop downloads, it's not really designed for ease of use - that's why imap accounts were created to get around the problem. </p><p>As david points out - any important emails can always be 'copied' into 'Local Folders' then those are independent copies on your computer. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I believe that the last time I tried to create an imap account on a server where I had the same credentials for a pop3 account, thunderbird either would not or could not do it, possibly because the server would not allow it.

You cannot simply modify a pop into an imap account. Some servers do require people to enabled Pop and/or Imap - this is done via the webmail account using a browser.  Some servers require a slightly more complex set up if using Oauth as Authentication Method. But at this point, I have no idea what server you use for emails, so cannot really advise much more. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Not sure where I said I want to keep some emails on one machine but not another.  I want both machines to be identical.   The lack of trust extends to the possibility that they get hacked as well as their incompetence leading to lost email or misconfigured server or suddenly they don't accept my credentials. </p><p>@Toad-Hall Thanks for the extensive tutorial.  Fortunately, I already knew most, but not all, of that. </p><p>In particular, I am wondering what specific incompatibiliities exist if using different versions of tbird, as long as they are not separated by the great divide, since I use only old versions since I absolutely hate the UI of newer versions and I don't need the new features.  There is an issue, though, with the use of oauth required by some, such as Microsoft, where it seems to fail both with old and new versions of TB. </p><p>The way I work is that I have a large number of tb mail subfolders, and mail is automatically and manually sorted into the appropriate folder.  Doing that a 2nd time for 3 weeks of email doesn't sound like big fun. </p><p>But, I think I have come up with a simple solution.  Namely, keep all TB data on an external ntvme ssd drive plugged into the primary desktop, and when I want to travel, just move it from the one machine to the other  (the laptop), as if it were a thumb drive.  Seems like that would work fine as long as the versions of TB on the two machines are compatible. Am I wrong? </p><p>In the past, what I have done is copied the entire profile folders, but that takes time, and has to be done in advance.  Then when I get back, copied the entire profile folders back.  Again a bit tedious. </p><p>Thanks to all for all the suggestions and clarifying my understanding of details. </p>",pb,false,0,0

Re the diag suggestions: My T-bird (Windows 10 client) is on the latest version (128.2.3esr (32-bit)). The slowdown in T-bird functioning started after recent updates. I checked add-ons. Only two. One I added awhile back (Compact Headers) and another that I don't think I added (CompactHeader). Not sure how or when that latter one was added. Perhaps in a recent update? I disabled CompactHeader and restarted T-bird. So far, it appears to be running as expected now - it's not taking forever to load a message, switch messages, delete a message, or get messages. Sorry for the drama. But that slowdown was so abrupt and recent that it really threw me off after years of satisfying use of T-bird. If the functionality continues successfully, I will donate again.

When I select I forgot my password, I am sent a code to email or phone, I then enter the code in the box provided and then I'm in the account without getting the option to change the new password. I tried it several times a week ago after the Reset PC and tried it again a couple of days ago and it is still the same. If I keep on trying I may get locked out.  </p><p>I found the passwords in Thunderbird, I had forgotten about that. I was familiar with it when I was changing from pop 3 to iMap.  </p><p>Before the Reset, I had password managers in my browsers and they worked really well to keep track of my many passwords. There are four passwords for Mozilla in the FF password manager but none of them work. As I remembered few passwords when I started to get everything set up again I didn't have access to the password managers. I was desperate to post in Thunderbird to get my emails working again and could not understand why I was not permitted to change the forgotten password.  I'm now almost back to normal though I find the new Thunderbird settings irritating.  For instance, I'm deleting old messages as I didn't realise I had kept so many until this new version shows the number of messages in each of my many folders - that is good.  What I find irritating is having to 'apply current view to folders and children'. AS I'm used to using the Touchpad (now broken) and now have to use the physical mouse I'm wobbling around and the option is at the bottom of the pull down menu, just as the Delete option is. I need a larger surface for the mouse as I run out of space. In the TB Community, I has a battle trying to reach My Questions in the Profile. Each time I got close, the pop up/drop down menu would close. It was like a game in a funfair - tap My Questions before it disappears. My arm is aching which does not help.  </p><p>I will carry on clearing out my old/unwanted mesages and will also try out One Drive. I have had the 5GB free version for some time and just upgraded to 100 GB. It is confusing as I can only view files in File Explorer. They all looked the same and I wonder why despite selecting the One Drive icon it should all be in File Explorer. The interface/dashboard should be different for One Drive.  I'm looking for One Drive for Dummies tutorial. One that covers the basics and with views that show in full screen what the tutor is doing. The ones I have viewed to date talk about file sharing, different versions of the same document etc. One thing I have learned is that delete does not mean delete and you can restore a deleted document for 30 days. </p>",phildiamo,false,0,0

This will re-index the mail stored in Thunderbird.  It will probably remove all of your old mail as it no longer exists.  But  this is an indexing process,  not a data changing one.

It is just bringing the index up to date with reality. </p><p>Now all mail prior to a certain date going missing sounds like some sort of server side retention policy.

Following the upgrade, in one particular folder every message now displays the same, incorrect value for ""Correspondents"" and that same value for the ""From"" in each individual message within that folder. </p><p>The folder in question holds messages generated by posts to the ""Issues"" and ""Pull Requests"" queues in a <a href=""http://GitHub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub.com</a> repository, specifically, (List-Id) ""Perl/perl5 &lt;<a href=""http://perl5.Perl.github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">perl5.Perl.github.com</a>&gt;"". (You can see the original post on <a href=""https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/11327#issuecomment-2105730328"" rel=""nofollow"">GH</a> GH .) In the Thunderbird tree listing of messages I see the ""Correspondents"" for this message displayed as ""H.Merijn Brand"" -- as is the case for all other messages in this folder. In the message pane I see the ""From"" displayed as ""H.Merijn Brand"" as well. (See image attached.) However, if I hover the mouse pointer over the ""From"" value, the pop-up indicates the real value of ""From"": ""James E Keenan &lt;notifications@github.com"". &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>(H.Merijn Brand is a real person and major Perl contributor.  If I had selected any other message in this folder, his name would have been displayed, but hovering over the ""From"" value I would have gotten a different poster, say, ""Todd Rinaldo &lt;notifications@github.com"".) &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>If I double click to display the message in a new tab, the ""From"" value is also displayed as ""H.Merijn Brand"", even though hovering over the ""From"" value indicates that the message really came from ""James E Keenan &lt;notifications@github.com"". &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>When I go to my email service provider's (<a href=""http://pobox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pobox.com</a>) web interface, I see the ""From"" value displayed correctly for all messages, i.e., the messages are not all visibly attributed to ""H.Merijn Brand"". So this problem is specific to the way Thunderbird is rendering the messages.  Moreover, it is specific to this version of Thunderbird, as earlier in the day, before my OS upgrade, I was using whatever was the last version of Thunderbird I had installed against Ubuntu 22.04.  This is the only folder in my Thunderbird installation where I am subscribed to GitHub messages.  Can anyone provide guidance? </p>",jkeenan1,false,0,0

Fundamentally a VPN tries to hide your location by obfuscation of the IP address you use to connect to the internet. </p><p>Your ISP may well require you to connect to the internet using their connection service to access and send mail.  So that process stops working with a VPN as you are no longer connected to the internet using their service.  </p><p>I would guess your ""corporate server"" is outside of the VPN, or on its own VPN/Proxy, so as far as it is concerned you are not moving so you don't have issues.   </p><p>For your calendar server,  when you could have been all over the world in 10 minutes via VPN.  This is something most providers are rather shy of.  If your phone says you are in Columbia and your VPN says you are in Moscow, and twenty minutes later in Durban then there is a fair chance your calendar provider may think hey how can you be in two places at once.  The guy has been hacked.  Institute questionable connection protocols,  like insist on a password next connection, or suspend the account until you reply to an email. </p><p>Fundamentally a VPN works in direct reverse to most of the protocols instituted by legitimate organizations like banks, and social media where they are sure then know where you are to protect you.  It is not that the tech world hates VPNS.  They really like to think they are dealing with you and not a hacker and your VPN usage makes you look like you are being hacked.  One thing that might help is to enable DNS over HTTPS in Thunderbird.  That will at least stabilize the DNS server used as each VPN probably redirects that as well. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My understanding is these VPN products tunnel directly from the client PC (me) through my network to a defined VPN server in various places around the world.  All communication through tunnel, in either direction, is encrypted. </p><p>This allows me to stop off at a Starbucks coffee store and access their wifi network then connect to any external server with everything coming through the tunnel encrypted (such network where the tunnel is running through is the Starbucks wifi network.  Connectivity from the VPN server will be as I direct, e.g. to my IMAP email server using encryption and port 993. </p><p>So, my calendar is client based but is also connected to the corporate Zimbra calendar so I can see both my email and calendar from my iPhone.  Unusual things happen in my Thunderbird calendar, of which the described anomaly with my VPNs is one.  There are others which have nothing to do with the VPN. </p><p>That's why I am wondering what changing my VPN from ExpressVPN to NordVPN has to do with my unresponsive calendar responses to an event alert but has no effect on my email uploading and downloading. </p>",BPaul_H,false,0,0

Then the only thing that appears in ""Attached""  is as lot of gibberish and some personal information about only one of the addresses. </blockquote> <p>I can not reproduce that problem at all based on your description.
