The internet service provider usually offers a free email address and sometimes additional ones as part of the package.  You can view those emails via the ISP webmail account using a browser OR you can use an email client such as Thunderbird to access that server and download/send emails using that email address. </p><p>You may also have your own website as you own a domain and you pay a company to host that website and they may offer an allowed X number of email addresses.  You will be charged eg: annually for domain and also webhosting.  Again you can view those emails via webmail OR use Thunderbird. </p><p>You may have acquired a free email address via a company that offers them eg: gmail, yahoo, gmx Again you can view those emails via webmail OR use Thunderbird. </p><p>In all cases, the server of ISP/webhost/gmail etc  facilites receiving of emails on your behalf. They will permit a quota limit for storage. Whether you choose to download a copy of emails and keep original on server or delete original off server is your choice. Keeping copy on server does mean you can use Imap mail accounts. </p><p>If you have Pop mail accounts then any emails you have downloaded are stored on your computer.  Pop accounts do not synchronise with server, so emails are an independent copy. If you have an Imap account then you cannot consider those downloaded emails as a true copy on computer because it can only show what is one server. All imap folders sycnhronise with server to show what is currently on server. You would need to create suitable folders in 'Local Folders' mail account and get 'Copys' of emails in imap folders put into those folders. Then you can say you have an independent copy on your computer. </p><p>Thunderbird is an email client; a program running on your computer to faciliate the management of viewing all mail accounts in a single view. It also offeres sending of email and other facilities such as viewing calendars.  </p><p>Thunderbird is not a server nor does it offer hosting of websites etc. </p><p>Nothing is free. It costs to run servers whether that is for website or receiving emails. If you have domain names, websites etc that you no longer need or want etc then remove them after ensuring you have good copies of all emails in Thunderbird on computer. </p><p>There are companies where you can try to just have the email address not host a website. But maybe it's time you rationalised what you need to keep. </p><p>Thunderbird used to have a link with a couple of business partners who could offer new email addresses. Obviously you would need to pay for those email addresses. Those options seems to have been removed since Nebula was released. But the companies still exist - you could check them out.  </p><p>I cannot endorse anything as I've never used them. But these are a couple of link you can check out to see if it offers you what you are looking for. Needless to say any email address you create can also then be added as a new existing mail account in Thunderbird.  </p><p><a href=""https://www.gandi.net/en/domain/email"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gandi.net/en/domain/email</a> <a href=""https://mailfence.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mailfence.com/</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Files get downloaded and then appended to relevant file eg: Inbox mbox file. </p><p>Advise: make your thunderbird profile folder and it's contents is exempt from being scanning. Also switch off scanning of incoming files/emails - even if this is just for a day or two to test performance. </p><p>One quick way to ensure a proper test is to do the following so AV and other similar types of programs are temp disabled without the need to alter anything: Exit all programs Restart computer in 'safe mode with networking' - note - if currently wireless using WIFI then you will need to connect computer to router/hub using an ethernet cable.  Then start Thunderbird and see if things improve. </p><p>Another main reason for delays are files containing emails which are getting rather large, so take up memory etc when they get opened to write data into. If you have a lot of emails in some folders then suggest you create some new folders with suitable names for organising and storing mail.  Then compact folders. I would advise you manually compact certain folders on a regular basis. Any folder that receives mail which is subsequently moved or deleted will still have a copy of email in original folder but it is 'marked as delted' and hidden from view. Compacting means a new file is created and then it looks in the original file for anything 'marked as deleted' - it does not copy those emails - only all the good emails you want to keep are copied into that new file. Then original is removed and new file replaces it. The new version is like a cleaned up file. It's considered good housekeeping maintenance and helps to reduce file size, recover disk space and reduce the risk of corrupt file. </p><p>The three folders that usually need compacting the most are 'Inbox', 'Junk/Spam' and 'Drafts'.  But also any folder which you know you have deleted or moved a load of emails. </p><p>To compact: Right click on folder and select 'Compact' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

You say ""Doesn't seem to recognise my manual configuration"" Thunderbird has to provide the server settings, username and password which are accepted by server that maintains the account and emails, so they are very specific. However, at this point I have no idea what those server settings are supposed to be.  But the following is used. 1. User name = full email address 2. Password is the same password you use to access your account via webmail. There are times when this may be different as some servers now insist on you using an app specific password. But as I do not know what server you are trying to use, I cannot say at this point whether that is the case.  </p><p>The window that shows you attempting to create a mail account with error message should provide enough data if you have not created mail account just yet. </p><p>If you have created a mail account but get password error: <strong>On new computer:</strong> In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Scroll down to 'Mail and News Accounts' </li><li> Copy all the data in that area </li><li> paste that data into this forum. </li></ul> <p>Then I will understand what you are currently using for server settings on new computer. </p><p><strong>Then On old computer</strong> <strong>Q: </strong>What version of Thunderbird are you using&nbsp;?

Specifying to leave on server does achieve your goal, but accessing from different PCs does cause previously downloaded messages to download again. You're in a compromise situation. If you do not trust your ISP's server, your safest move (in my opinion) is to create a second account in IMAP and download everything (file&gt;offline&gt;download) and then copy all of it to local folders. That is, if you don't trust the ISP and if it goes bust, then you've lost everything. Then, you could continue to use the account from multiple PCs, knowing you had a full copy.
