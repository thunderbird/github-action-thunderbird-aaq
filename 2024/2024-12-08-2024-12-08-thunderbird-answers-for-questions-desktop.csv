My inference is that Thunderbird is financially stable, thanks to the donations of users who donate regularly. Yes, I'm sure support and features would improve, but it feels good to be part of an organization that provides a product and services for free. Regarding your email address, only you can do that from your email provider. And, thank you for being a donor.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I created a new profile and tried 3 of the accounts I could see and none of them produced the new profile when Thunderbird was relaunched.

Luckily I had a backup using the programs export feature. It was a couple of months old but it helped a lot. Lesson learned for me to to back much more frequently.
