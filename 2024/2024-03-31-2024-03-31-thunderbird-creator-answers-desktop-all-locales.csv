Also in the period  4 february-12 february mails are missing. I wonder if there is a possibility to ""get them back"". I certainly did NOT archive them or delete them. I never had this before.  Zeelandnet cannot help me. I hope you can..... </p><p>Kind regards, Mrs. Irene Dieleman, the Netherlands </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dielevrouw

Many times, not all the time, the changes to the policy are ignored. I recently removed the ""star"" from several e-mails in a folder that were older than the defined retention time of 60 days but the emails are still in the folder. I just lowered the retention definition in another folder from 30 days to 10 days but the older emails are still in the folder however, in a different folder, when I changed the settings from 120 days to 60 days, the older emails disappeared almost immediately.  Is there something I can do to force the folder to behave . </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dog3
