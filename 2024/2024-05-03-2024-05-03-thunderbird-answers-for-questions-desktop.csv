Prior to beginning the compacting of my Thunderbird inbox,  that inbox had 204,752 total emails. My Pop server had 72027 unread emails (That's just the way the web server works. It doesn't give me a total number of emails) Prior to starting the compacting, I had deleted 3 emails from my Thunderbird inbox, because I didn't know if emails deleted since the previous compacting (like I said, I have no idea when that was) would get deleted from the server. The compacting took at least 30 minutes. When it was finished the totals for the Thunderbird inbox did not change. The number of unread emails on the server increased by 15 to 72042 due to emails received in the 30 minute compacting timeframe. The 3 server emails that I had deleted from Thunderbird were still on the server. Next, I had Thunderbird download new messages from the server. It downloaded 38 new emails because the previous download was from a little earlier in the day. After the download completed the number of emails in the Thunderbird inbox was 214790 (up 38 from before the download). The number of emails on the server stayed at 72042.

You see, I need to keep at least a few months worth of messages on the server so that I can access them from my Iphone Mail app when I am not at either of my computers. So your method of having Thunderbird delete the emails after they have been downloaded to both your PC's is no good to me.
