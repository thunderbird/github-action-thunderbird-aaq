Unlike other email providers, Gmail actually uses just one folder for everything, assigning labels to differentiate what other email providers call folders. Thunderbird (and other email clients) use folders for consistency, which means that Thunderbird must duplicate messages when a move is made. There is a special folder for Gmail, AllMail, which points to all messages, regardless of location. The unified view is not a part of this; that unified view is a display option that Thunderbird constructs to give the impression of one inbox, but that is just an illusion. You may be able to isolate this issue better by selecting View&gt;folders and tick 'all folders' or rightclick the unified folder icon to expand the view to show individual accounts.

The compacting took at least 30 minutes. When it was finished the totals for the Thunderbird inbox did not change. The number of unread emails on the server increased by 15 to 72042 due to emails received in the 30 minute compacting timeframe. The 3 server emails that I had deleted from Thunderbird were still on the server. Next, I had Thunderbird download new messages from the server. It downloaded 38 new emails because the previous download was from a little earlier in the day. After the download completed the number of emails in the Thunderbird inbox was 214790 (up 38 from before the download). The number of emails on the server stayed at 72042.

Part of the frustration on this question is that even after I had tried to follow their instructions about compacting the Thunderbird folder (inbox in my case), it wasn't working. Then on 5/5, I posted that I must not have been doing the compact properly, because when I did it correctly, emails that I deleted from Thunderbird <em><strong>were</strong></em>   deleted from the POP server, and mails older than the number of days specified <em><strong>were also deleted</strong></em> from the server.

My Thunderbird account is with <a href=""http://ATT.net"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.net</a> and the inbound server is a POP account.  When I log into the server, it does not show any incoming emails in my online Inbox (as they have already been automaticaly downloaded into Thunderbird) and I have already viewed them in my Thunderbird Inbox) and there is nothing in the server Read mail box.  When I look at an email in Thunderbird I either leave it in my Inbox if I want to keep it and refer to it later or I put it in Read mail to keep a record, or I delete it or label it as Junk.  So I don't understand why my pre-2024 emails disppeared from my Thunderbird InBox, unless they were somehow automatically moved into my Thunderbird Read Mail box (where messages from previous years exist).  However, it is unclear if the previous years' messages in my Read Mail box are there because I soemhow moved them there or if they were automatically moved there after I read them in my Inbox.  So unclear if ALL of the Inbox messages from previous years are now in the Read Mailbox or only some of them? </p>",drleo,false,0,0

What you have told us is that when you download from server, it looks like the account is not leaving emails on server. </p><p><br> As emails are stored in mbox files, it means eg: all emails you have in the 'Read' folder are in reality only in a single mbox text document called 'Read'.  This is somewhat a more risky way of storing emails. If something happens to that single text file then it could mean a loss of a lot of emails.  </p><p>You could also run into a problem if the text file gets too large because you may need a particular type of program which can open it. If way too big, I have known it cause a computer crash in the past because it used up all available RAM. You may need to open it if trying to rescue emails. Hence why I asked for the image details to tell us the size of the mbox file. </p><p>Hence why it's a good idea to create several folder and organise the emails. Then you do not have all your 'eggs in one basket' - if you see what I mean. It also means you can set it up so locating emails is much easier. At the moment all old read emails are in one folder, so not so easy to locate stuff.  Suggested Folder names eg: 'Family, Friends, Bills, Online Orders, Hobby name' etc. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
