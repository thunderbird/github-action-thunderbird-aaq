How would I go about combining the mailboxes into a single folder for ease in backup purposes?    I have 5 email accounts on this profile, 4 of which I no longer have the account but want to keep the mail for archive purposes.  The 5th account is a valid gmail account and that's the one in the separate file location.  To combine them into one folder to make backup easier, do I just copy the gmail mailboxes into the other folder and then go to server settings and then browse to that location for the Local Directory of the mailbox?    </p><p>I have another question I asked in a previous post that wasn't answered and maybe you can help with that too.   For the 2nd installation of Thunderbird on a different hard drive for another set of mailboxes, I want to import all the data from another computer so it's working on this computer.   I think I can do the same thing I did for the other mailboxes fairly easy now.   There are a couple abandoned email addresses on that computer also, but the problem that comes up making me reluctant to try this, is one of my emails on the old computer has a domain address that has old emails from before I changed email servers.  The new hosting company migrated all my data to the new server but somehow my account was lost from their server about a week later.   The original hosting company deleted my account so they couldn't migrate the data again.  Thunderbird is my only copy of those emails.   The Thunderbird information on the old computer is pointing to the old mail server that doesn't exist anymore.  My new mail server is using the same email address.   How do I copy the old profile over and not lose the data when I create the new account that's on Microsoft Exchange since the email address is the same?   I thought about renaming the old account and setting it not to retrieve messages.  I don't need them combined as I only use it for looking up old information from time to time.   I imagine if they were in the same account it would upload all those old emails to the new Exchange server which I don't need.   </p><p>Also do you have a link to information about creating the new account for Microsoft Exchange?  When I tried doing it on another computer it said my license doesn't give me access to an Exchange account.  I guess they want me to have a Microsoft Outlook license.   I've been using GoDaddy's webmail.  I set this domain account up on an old computer as IMAP but it won't let me send any messages out from Thunderbird.   It retrieves mail and syncs mail but it won't let me send.   What I have is Microsoft 365 Mail from GoDaddy but I don't have a current version of Outlook to use, hence the need for Thunderbird.   I have older Outlook licenses but they tell me older ones won't work.   </p><p>Thanks again </p>",junkmmc,false,0,0

To combine the gmail, exit TB, copy the profile to be within the profile at appropriate location, and then start tb, change account location (which will probably require restarting tb).  For accounts that are dead, my suggestion is to copy to Local Folders and rename prior to removing the account. That protects them from any account issues.  To move old accounts to be within current profile, a simple approach is to use the import-export utility to individually copy selected message folders to Local folders. My comments to this point apply to messages already local to the PC. That is, copying message files from one online account to another is its own can of worms and needs special treatment.  You mentioned godaddy and exchange. We have had a number of users posting here that use thunderbird for their godaddy/office365 accounts, so I cannot advise there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

From other posts on this forum, I am aware that Thunderbird is not consistently installed in the same location, but is somewhat dependent on the repository from which it came. So, here are my thoughts: - locate the position of the active profile: to do this, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to profile folder and click 'open folder'  You are now in the profile. exit thunderbird, back up one level so that you are outside the profile.  - copy that exact profile folder elsewhere on drive or to external media.  - after copying review what you copied to ensure you have the desired data, including your addressbook (abook.sqlite) and your accounts, whether on the Mail or Imapmail folders and local folders in the Mail\Local folders folder.  - now uninstall and reinstall according to your needs. If the prompt allows keeping the data, do that, if only as extra security - start thunderbird. if all is there, that indicates the new version installed with same settings. If not, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' and exit thunderbird. you are now in the new thunderbird's profile. back up one folder so you are outside the profile. Now copy/past the profile you previously saved into that profile folder. Now restart thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

But sounds like good advice.  Note: That process doens't work to open the profile folder. Not sure how to find the profile folder otherwise. If i click nothing happens, which I am sure is related to the reason I have to do this uninstall/reinstall process.  Simply put: TB can't interact with the system properly (yes, due to the type of install I did, which doesn't allow access to system files, default apps etc) </p><p>I first noticed the problem when I couldn't open PDFs in emails other than with TB (undesired). I choose ""System Handler"" in settings, then when I double click nothing happens, so have to save before I can open it from Files app. Same goes for images, videos, all files.  </p><p>I learned (total noob to Linux here) that it's because I installed TB from the Fedora repository, which limits it's access to other files outside of its container. If I uninstall and install from FlatHUB (where Mozilla packages their own installer) these problems will go away. Not being able to click ""profile folder"" is (I'm sure) the same issue.  </p><p>So I guess, if I can just suss where my profile folder is, i  think you're sayig I can just backup that entire folder to other media, and i at least should be 'safe' in terms of those local folders and emails, which is the main concern. I dont have any contacts set up yet, or calendars, just one imap account, my preferences/settings, and a HUGE list of nested local folders (25+ years of email!) </p><p>thanks </p>",mozilla516,false,0,0

It is spurious,  but it is also often a harbinger of issues with an antivirus product that is using self signed certificates to essentially hack encrypted communication.  You will need to fix that with the antivirus vendor.  Those that use the certificates also offer instructions for Thunderbird to add then as trusted in my experience. You do not see this with Outlook as it uses the Windows security store for certificates and it is easy to add a certificate and trust in code.  Thunderbird has it's own store and no way to quietly authorize yourself as trusted.  It requires user intervention to add another trust provider. </p><p>What is surprising is that that version of Thunderbird can even get mail as that is usually the first thing compromised when the certificate issues arise. </p><p>It may also answer your question, if the account is configured as IMAP, which Thunderbird defaults to.  I am not sure about Outlook defaults, or if you used the import from outlook option,  or just added your account to Thunderbird as IMAP which would have populated it with the email in the server account.  Then the folders you mentioned as missing will be deleted as they can not the synced with the server. So have a look at what the account is configured a in account settings (it is the first thing on the server settings pane) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Not sure whether you read my original post, but Rogers (my ISP in Canada) migrated both my primary and secondary email accounts yesterday from their old legacy service to their new Ignite service (Comcast/Rogers modem).  The Rogers/Yahoo mail website shows all of my emails in both my primary and secondary accounts. Yet when I open Thunderbird, both primary and secondary accounts are populated by the exact same emails from the secondary account only.  Because of this, I deleted my primary account in TB and recreated it, but the problem still persists.  Tech support at Rogers suggests finding a way to delete the primary account and its data from TB completely (they told me about the TB servers), and recreate the account from scratch.  The primary account in TB is definitely not showing the emails listed on the Rogers/Yahoo mail website.  Any suggestions as to how I may recover my primary emails in TB? </p><p>Thank you for your time and help.  Les. </p>",addpro,false,0,0

Got the following result (which was for Gmail, but resolved my non-Gmail account authentication problems outlined in my original post. </p><p>I first removed all my accounts from TB.  Then followed the instructions outlined in BOTH options 1 &amp; 2 below:  deleted all passwords for all accounts in both the Privacy and Config Editor settings, then closed TB and restarted it.  Added all the accounts back in Account Settings, and sign-in/authentication proceeded normally for all accounts. (I did not need to follow option 3.) This time the emails that downloaded for each account matched the correct account names, unlike previously when my primary account, for some mysterious reason, downloaded the emails from my secondary account. (I've taken the liberty to modify the original instructions for how to get to Privacy &amp; Security and Config Editor settings for version 115.9.0.)  Here's the Bing result: </p><p>""To fix Thunderbird authenticating the wrong account, you can try the following solutions: </p><p>1. Open TB Settings&gt;Privacy &amp; Security, check the box to accept cookies (so OAuth authentication can complete), remove the passwords from Saved Passwords, restart TB, enter the account password in the OAuth window when prompted. Check also that the authentication on the outgoing mail server is OAuth2. </p><p>2. Go to the Config Editor (Settings&gt;General&gt;Config Editor), search for ""username"" at the bottom, make sure that the username of the problem account contains the full email address. If necessary, delete your passwords and log in again using Oauth2. </p><p>3. Check if there's something interfering with the connection, such as antivirus, VPN. Run Windows in safe mode and see if the accounts can be added (or remove AV if it's not Windows Security, and VPN if used)."" </p><p>Thanks again for the help.

Google very kindly remove the recipients from the BCC list on the email stored in your sent folder on their server and replace it with undisclosed recipients. </p><p>You essentially have two choices. 1. Use another mail provider that has a more down to earth storage policy of your data. As far as I am aware only Google has this odd quirk. </p><p>2. Change the location copies of send mail are stored to the local folders sent folder in account settings.
