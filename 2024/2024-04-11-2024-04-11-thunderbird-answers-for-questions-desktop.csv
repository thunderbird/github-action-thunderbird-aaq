How would I go about combining the mailboxes into a single folder for ease in backup purposes?    I have 5 email accounts on this profile, 4 of which I no longer have the account but want to keep the mail for archive purposes.  The 5th account is a valid gmail account and that's the one in the separate file location.  To combine them into one folder to make backup easier, do I just copy the gmail mailboxes into the other folder and then go to server settings and then browse to that location for the Local Directory of the mailbox?    </p><p>I have another question I asked in a previous post that wasn't answered and maybe you can help with that too.   For the 2nd installation of Thunderbird on a different hard drive for another set of mailboxes, I want to import all the data from another computer so it's working on this computer.   I think I can do the same thing I did for the other mailboxes fairly easy now.   There are a couple abandoned email addresses on that computer also, but the problem that comes up making me reluctant to try this, is one of my emails on the old computer has a domain address that has old emails from before I changed email servers.  The new hosting company migrated all my data to the new server but somehow my account was lost from their server about a week later.   The original hosting company deleted my account so they couldn't migrate the data again.  Thunderbird is my only copy of those emails.   The Thunderbird information on the old computer is pointing to the old mail server that doesn't exist anymore.  My new mail server is using the same email address.   How do I copy the old profile over and not lose the data when I create the new account that's on Microsoft Exchange since the email address is the same?   I thought about renaming the old account and setting it not to retrieve messages.  I don't need them combined as I only use it for looking up old information from time to time.   I imagine if they were in the same account it would upload all those old emails to the new Exchange server which I don't need.   </p><p>Also do you have a link to information about creating the new account for Microsoft Exchange?  When I tried doing it on another computer it said my license doesn't give me access to an Exchange account.  I guess they want me to have a Microsoft Outlook license.   I've been using GoDaddy's webmail.  I set this domain account up on an old computer as IMAP but it won't let me send any messages out from Thunderbird.   It retrieves mail and syncs mail but it won't let me send.   What I have is Microsoft 365 Mail from GoDaddy but I don't have a current version of Outlook to use, hence the need for Thunderbird.   I have older Outlook licenses but they tell me older ones won't work.   </p><p>Thanks again </p>",junkmmc,false,0,0

To combine the gmail, exit TB, copy the profile to be within the profile at appropriate location, and then start tb, change account location (which will probably require restarting tb).  For accounts that are dead, my suggestion is to copy to Local Folders and rename prior to removing the account. That protects them from any account issues.  To move old accounts to be within current profile, a simple approach is to use the import-export utility to individually copy selected message folders to Local folders. My comments to this point apply to messages already local to the PC. That is, copying message files from one online account to another is its own can of worms and needs special treatment.  You mentioned godaddy and exchange. We have had a number of users posting here that use thunderbird for their godaddy/office365 accounts, so I cannot advise there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

From other posts on this forum, I am aware that Thunderbird is not consistently installed in the same location, but is somewhat dependent on the repository from which it came. So, here are my thoughts: - locate the position of the active profile: to do this, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to profile folder and click 'open folder'  You are now in the profile. exit thunderbird, back up one level so that you are outside the profile.  - copy that exact profile folder elsewhere on drive or to external media.  - after copying review what you copied to ensure you have the desired data, including your addressbook (abook.sqlite) and your accounts, whether on the Mail or Imapmail folders and local folders in the Mail\Local folders folder.  - now uninstall and reinstall according to your needs. If the prompt allows keeping the data, do that, if only as extra security - start thunderbird. if all is there, that indicates the new version installed with same settings. If not, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' and exit thunderbird. you are now in the new thunderbird's profile. back up one folder so you are outside the profile. Now copy/past the profile you previously saved into that profile folder. Now restart thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

But sounds like good advice.  Note: That process doens't work to open the profile folder. Not sure how to find the profile folder otherwise. If i click nothing happens, which I am sure is related to the reason I have to do this uninstall/reinstall process.  Simply put: TB can't interact with the system properly (yes, due to the type of install I did, which doesn't allow access to system files, default apps etc) </p><p>I first noticed the problem when I couldn't open PDFs in emails other than with TB (undesired). I choose ""System Handler"" in settings, then when I double click nothing happens, so have to save before I can open it from Files app. Same goes for images, videos, all files.  </p><p>I learned (total noob to Linux here) that it's because I installed TB from the Fedora repository, which limits it's access to other files outside of its container. If I uninstall and install from FlatHUB (where Mozilla packages their own installer) these problems will go away. Not being able to click ""profile folder"" is (I'm sure) the same issue.  </p><p>So I guess, if I can just suss where my profile folder is, i  think you're sayig I can just backup that entire folder to other media, and i at least should be 'safe' in terms of those local folders and emails, which is the main concern. I dont have any contacts set up yet, or calendars, just one imap account, my preferences/settings, and a HUGE list of nested local folders (25+ years of email!) </p><p>thanks </p>",mozilla516,false,0,0

To do what you want with IMAP, I suggest you download the messages, then copy to local folder prior to then deleting everything. You get some risk avoidance by first clicking File&gt;offline&gt;download to ensure all content is downloaded prior to copying. The safest approach: use POP. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
