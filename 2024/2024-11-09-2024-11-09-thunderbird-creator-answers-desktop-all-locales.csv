I deleted the sent mail on one and it deleted another one as well. The ""fix"" on the box for sent doesn't do anything. One account was getting mail in the inbox and sent mail box, the same message. And one account stopped sending mail but was receiving ok and I kept getting error messages that it was a bad address from Google. I've been playing with it for hours and finally got it sending and receiving to the right accounts I think. It's still set up per your directions for gmail.

I'll make a separate post on the 'lost password' issue later.  For this post, I'll focus on the failure to download emails issues. </p><p>When I do a send/receive (for all accounts), I will see for an account the name turn blue momentarily (indicating a new email), but that will disappear quickly and no email will be downloaded.  When I go to webmail for that account...there is a new email in the inbox that failed to download.  Further attempts to download are futile.  This has happened with multiple accounts and multiple senders, and the only solution I've found is to move all the emails to local folders, delete the account, re-setup, and move the older emails back.  Then it will download the email at issue (indicating to me it is not an issue with the email itself).   Deleting the global-messages-db.sqlite file doesn't solve the issue.  Anyone know why this is happening and how to stop or at least fix it easier than my solution? </p><p>My gut says that the email is downloading, but is getting marked wrong somehow.  The emails are not in any other folders that I've detected--they're not going to straight to trash.  In thunderbird, all junk settings are off.  the 'global' box is unchecked, as is the box in the specific account.   </p><p>As for the details, it happened today and after I updated to the latest version 128.4.2esr, but that didn't help. It would have been the prior version before updating.  Win 11, 1 yr old computer with no hardware issues.

I use the pop3 mostly and that's where the issues are (solely).  Also, Thunderbird data is on a NAS on a LAN.  I understand that is not preferred, but I've been doing that for a decade or more without issues (until recently).  I have my own domain, and that email system uses cpanel.  I've had that for years without issue...again until now.  I've made no changes on the email server end-that'd be beyond me anyway.  And its intermittent--fairly rare, say 1 in 500 or more emails?

I found, that TB 128.4.2esr (64-Bit) silently ignores added members, like couples, who use the same mail address.  The solution I tried is to add another address entry addressing both of them in the name field. Ending up with three entries in the general address book with identical mail addresses.  Now, adding the entry with both names to the Personal Address Book doesn't show this entry but one of the other two with the same address.  Any solution for this kind of (minor) problem?  Thank you! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1687077;,florian55
