Our dispatch center sends the mails out using PGP for encryption, the decryption works properly. Since FiltaQuilla cannot work on encrypted mails, I forward incoming mails to the same account which removes the encryption. The strange situation is: if the filter is executed automatically upon arrival of a new mail, it forwards the message, but does not attach the attachment. If I run the filter manually, it does as it is intended to. See the screenshot for details: the mail comes in at 5:53, the automatic forwarding arrives at 5:59 but without an attachment. My manual filter-test runs properly and includes the attachment at 8:22. I've updated Thunderbird only yesterday evening to V 115.10.1. Before the mayor update to 115, I had the feeling that this problem did not occur. Please let me know if and how I can provide more details such as logs.

But after hours of trying solutions, I think the answer was to mark some older emails that were marked unread as read.  Then the latest couple of days of emails started coming through.  This happened when migrating <a href=""http://Cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Cox.net</a> emails to Yahoo and then modifying Thunderbird account settings to retrieve them.  This email account has over 14K emails from 2014 and later showing in Yahoo Inbox and somehow the Thunderbird Inbox is showing 26K, probably some duplicates, although I have been using the extension ""Remove Duplicate Messages"".  In Yahoo, I made more folders for several older years and moved emails from the Yahoo main Inbox to those various years to cut the size of the Inbox.  Any other suggestions would be great for similar situations. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",blaby

The reason was that that somehow the folder had got unsubscribed. This shocked me because I hadn't even realised I needed to subscribe to folders to search them.   </p><p>In a practical sense the problem is therefore fully solved and all I need to do is to make sure I'm subscribed to everything. But I find it disturbing that anything could undermine the very simple search of what emails I received today. So  I'd like to understand if there is indeed any way to see all of today's emails without any exception. </p><p>The search I was using was ""Age in days in less than 2"" and I was doing this both with ""Run search on server"" ticked and unticked. The emails are all there on the server, so surely there must be a way to see them in a raw naked state before they are sorted into folders? I guess the global search is able to do just that, but as far as I can see it doesn't seem able to search by any kind of date range (can filter but not search). </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Andrew3142

When I look at that account in isolation (ie not in unified folders) I can still see the inbox as a subfolder.  </p><p>The subfolder 'INBOX' appears to be a duplicate of the account's main inbox (it contains the same number of emails), which may account for the appearance of duplicates. </p><p>At a guess this is probably related to inadvertent moving of folders. I find that when trying to use the scroll bar (to scroll down the subfolder list), if the mouse strays slightly to the left it will pick up a subfolder and move it unintentionally. This can cause all sorts of problems with disappearing emails and the folder structures showing differently on different computers. </p><p>In this case the duplicate email problem only happens on my desktop. On my laptop I can still see a subfolder named 'INBOX' but it shows as empty and I don't see the duplicate emails in unified folders. </p><p>It would be really useful if Mozilla could introduce a 'confirm folder move' feature as that would eradicate inadvertent moves. </p><p>How do I resolve the apparent duplicate emails on my desktop?
