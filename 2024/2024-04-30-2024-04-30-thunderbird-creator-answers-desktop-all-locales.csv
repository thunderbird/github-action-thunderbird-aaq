Our dispatch center sends the mails out using PGP for encryption, the decryption works properly. Since FiltaQuilla cannot work on encrypted mails, I forward incoming mails to the same account which removes the encryption. The strange situation is: if the filter is executed automatically upon arrival of a new mail, it forwards the message, but does not attach the attachment. If I run the filter manually, it does as it is intended to. See the screenshot for details: the mail comes in at 5:53, the automatic forwarding arrives at 5:59 but without an attachment. My manual filter-test runs properly and includes the attachment at 8:22. I've updated Thunderbird only yesterday evening to V 115.10.1. Before the mayor update to 115, I had the feeling that this problem did not occur. Please let me know if and how I can provide more details such as logs.

But after hours of trying solutions, I think the answer was to mark some older emails that were marked unread as read.  Then the latest couple of days of emails started coming through.  This happened when migrating <a href=""http://Cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Cox.net</a> emails to Yahoo and then modifying Thunderbird account settings to retrieve them.  This email account has over 14K emails from 2014 and later showing in Yahoo Inbox and somehow the Thunderbird Inbox is showing 26K, probably some duplicates, although I have been using the extension ""Remove Duplicate Messages"".  In Yahoo, I made more folders for several older years and moved emails from the Yahoo main Inbox to those various years to cut the size of the Inbox.  Any other suggestions would be great for similar situations. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",blaby
