As soon as I read your post, I realized you were using an update product that was retrieving the wrong version. </blockquote> <p>David is correct to advise you to do this. Update software can cause problems because sometimes a new release is available but only for those who are installing for the first time. So it's not just not knowing whether to use a beta or a release as in your case. Example: When a major release occurs, all those people currently using Thunderbird will not be offered an update to the latest relase because usually a few gremlins still need to be sorted. This information was stated when 115 was released on July 7th: <em>Thunderbird version 115.0 is only offered as direct download from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> and not as an upgrade from Thunderbird version 102 or earlier.</em> </p><p>Those using version 102.13.0 continued to get updates for 102* - 102.13.1, 102.14.0. 102.15.0 and 102.15.1 </p><p>Unfortuately, no updater software is aware of this. So it's important Thunderbird has control over updates. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
