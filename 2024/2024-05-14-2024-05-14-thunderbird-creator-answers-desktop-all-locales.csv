Has anyone else heard of, or developed an issue recently where TB will not delete multiple emails when selected?

Now, when I highlight multiple emails to delete, instead of deleting them, TB marks them all as read, and only deletes a single email (the oldest email in the group I selected).  </p><p>I saw one other question about this, but it was marked ""archived"" without an answer.
