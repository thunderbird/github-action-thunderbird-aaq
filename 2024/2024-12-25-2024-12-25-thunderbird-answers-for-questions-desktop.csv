If the attempted withdrawal occurred over the Web, and you use the same password for your bank account and your e-mail account, maybe. It's unlikely that one person is going to the effort of sending you dozens of spam messages every day. But trying to solve all that would be outside the scope of Thunderbird.  </p><p>If you believe that someone else has control of your e-mail account, you'll want to change your password or cancel the account. </p><p>As arlev wrote, you could try server-based filters and rules. I do believe that training Thunderbird to recognize spam would help. Spam filters usually consider more than just the source. I assume that Thunderbird's filter does too. </p><p>If you want to reduce your spam mail dramatically, there are other, more complex and expensive actions you could take. </p><p>Good luck. </p><p>Rick </p>",mozilla664,false,0,0
