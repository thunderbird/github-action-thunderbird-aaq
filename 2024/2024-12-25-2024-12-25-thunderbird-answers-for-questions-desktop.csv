Did you set it to that in Thunderbird by using a theme? or specify for your operating system to use a dark theme for applications? </p><p>Those are the two starting points. </p><p>Then we come to your actual emails.  If the sender is specifying a font color,  like just about anyone using a Microsoft product will,  then the email will display in the font colour specified. </p><p>Are your outgoing mail specifying a white font?  If it is I will get a white on white email from you.  So even though I generally do not specify a font colour I will be forced to to read the email from you and to reply to it.  (I loath black backgrounds and will reduce an email to plain text if I have to so I don't have to venture into dark mode.) </p><p>The forum software indicates you are using a windows based system.  Have you enabled application dark mode in windows? Windows 10 and 11 both default to dark mode with their black taskbar and menu.

A poor cousin is the dark theme in Thunderbird, as the default should switch from dark to light based on the operating system settings. </p><p>This is actually a very technical part of email and most folk fail entirely to understand that they are frequently forcing their choices on others unless the go about doing it the right way.  Like you are frustrated that your choices are being ignored,  there is probably someone reply to you that is equally incensed by your choices of colors.
