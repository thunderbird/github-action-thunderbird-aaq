All with Windows 10 and prior to 115.8 I must have been using all versions going back 20 years.  I opted for auto renewal of updates years ago.  I have not clue why I was asked for my Thunderbird password which I could not find. I went online and lots of others were not happy with 115.8 and spoke about 102.15.1. I installed 102.15.1 with a new password. Yesterday after a few days of trying to retrieve my calendar with birthdays, anniversary's and whatever it installed.  Very happy. Prior to going back to 102.15.1 U did a backup of my Thunderbird folder and my guess is i have a new folder with 102.15.1 I would up grade to 116. On my Windows 10 I have two options.  One to log into my <a href=""http://Ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ionos.com</a> email hosting account or 102.15.1 Thunderbird account which does not show all those many emails in my <a href=""http://Ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ionos.com</a> Thunderbird account.

Very strange S23 and Ionos show all emails and Windows 10 does not.  It was suggested my Best Buy I wait until Thunderbird 116 issues. I reset my Thunderbird option to opt out of automatic new updates.  With your help I might reconsider downloading Thunderbird 116 to solve what problem I have with viewing all those emails showing in my Ionos and K9 folders. Oh, and whatever version I had prior to 115.8 I liked it more than 102.15.1 Thanks and hope you can help. </p>",email14,false,0,0

I believe that message only means that the info is not in the Thunderbird database. </blockquote> <p>No it means that the new account wizard was not able to detect any settings in the ISPDB data base,  via polling the published server location for a settings file for the account or by probing the server returned by the MX DNS entry for a server to get mail from or a server name made up using the domain from the email address..  Fundamentally the search for usable setting has come out as a failure.  Where the domain is included in the ISPDB,  it is generally a strong indication that there are firewall issues, usually software firewall issues as if say Thunderbird can not find setting for Gmail then the problem is clearly connectivity, hence firewall. </p><p>The secondary step of validating the settings and being unable to connect is usually an indicator of there being antivirus/firewall issues as well, the settings detected are used to try and initiate a normal mail account sign in.  Failure here is often the issue of defective or self signed certificates used by antivirus products.  The error message here about wrong username and server are rarely anything but red herrings.  But from my reading of the setup routine,  you have not made it to this step.  You are stuck with unable to detect. </p><p>The failure to detect settings is rather common where hosted domains are concerned.  Mostly because everything is done to a price and most of the things around encryption are done in a halfhearted manner. As is the server setups for mail.  However by faithfully copying the settings from the provider as to domains server name and ports it should work.  I would however recommend against using port 25.  For the last 20 years it has been used as the server to server transmission port,  not the submission port.  It is also commonly blocked by antivirus product keen to prevent spam bots getting to send mail successfully should you some how get infected with one. So port  587 would be the appropriate one to use. </p><p>If you have an antivirus program that scans mail,I do not I use Microsoft Defender,  you may well have to look into the settings and disable email scanning completely while you set up, or indeed disable the antivirus entirely as they try and scan encrypted connections which your provider has said you should use and errors relating to certificates do not reliably bubble up to a point you can see them. </p><p>At this point where you have forced a non working account to be created. I guess the best approach is to try and work out why it does not work, instead of lingering on the creation wizard. </p><p>So initially open the error console. (ctrl+Shift+J)  press the trash icon on it's toolbar to clear it and press the get mail button for the account. <strong>Note</strong> any errors that appear while it gets to the no mail point of failure and post them here.  Note there is a copy all messages if you right click in the error console to facilitate pasting them into a reply on the forum.  If you try the process a few times and consistently see the same error ,  please point out what that error is. </p><p>If that gets us nowhere,  and it might, then I will suggest full on logging of the IMAP protocol,  but lets see if you can get something the easy way first. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
