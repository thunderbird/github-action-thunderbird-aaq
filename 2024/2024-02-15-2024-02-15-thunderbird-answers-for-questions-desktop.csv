For example, if reading messagess in a non-default account and you click 'new messsage', Thunderbird uses that account's from address. There is an addon, Identity Chooser, which may address your concern. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It MUST be done by Google in its prompt. The password for web access is never the same password (for Gmail) as the password on the PC.
