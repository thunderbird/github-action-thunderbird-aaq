However, when on a website using Firefox, and click on a ""contact us"" link to activate an email message to the website folks, a Windows Mail composition window opens instead of a Thunderbird composition window.  I have to copy the email address out of the Windows Mail ""To"" field and paste into the Thunderbird ""To"" field. </p><p>How do I configure things such that clicking on a web link to open and start an email to said website results in that occurring in Thunderbird and not Windows Mail? </p><p>I'm on Win11 with latest Thunderbird as default email app and use latest Firefox browser. </p><p>Thanks!
