Gmail realise this is not user friendly, so it uses 'labels' which act like tags, the labels get applied to the only copy of email that is stored in the 'All Mail' folder, thus meaning it's possible to see a virtual copy of same email in eg: Inbox, Sent' etc. </p><p>Imap accounts can download that copy in server Inbox into Thunderbird imap Inbox.  Thunderbird has no knowledge of labels meaning the copy in imap Inbox is a separate copy in the mbox file called Inbox, which you see as a folder called Inbox. </p><p>So whilst only one copy of email exists on server in 'All Mail', it means in imap account, they are separate copies. </p><p>As the imap 'All Mail' synchronises with server, it will display whatever is on server in 'All Mail'. If emails are removed from 'All Mail' you will find they are no longer available anywhere. </p><p>If emails are in 'All Mail' but not in 'Inbox' or another folder, this means the relevant labels have been removed from the email in 'All Mail'. </p><p>How do the labels get removed from an email? Email has been Archived - easily done by either selecting to see email and clicking on 'Archive' button or pressing the 'A' key. Or email was deleted using the 'Shift' + 'Del' keys which seems less likely. </p><p>You should do one of the following - one is done in Thunderbird the alternative option - which may be easier is to do it via the webmail account. </p> <ul><li> In 'All Mail' folder: </li><li> Right click on email and select 'Copy to' and choose 'Inbox'. </li></ul> <p>When Inbox sychronises with server, gmail will apply the 'Inbox' label thus meaning it can display that email email in the server Inbox and this means it can be displayed in the imap folder called Inbox. </p><p>The alternative is to logon to the gmail webmail account and select the 'All Mail' folder. It will tell you what labels are applied. So if an email has no labels then you know it is only seen in 'All Mail'. You can reapply an Inbox label to those emails. They will then appear in the webmail account Inbox. I've put some images below showing how to do it. </p><p>When Thunderbird synchronises with server Inbox, a copy will get downloaded to the imap Inbox.  </p><p>Personally, I would advise that once emails have been reissued the 'Inbox' label, the 'All Mail' folder should be unsubscribed from seeing it.  </p> <ul><li> Right click on imap account name folder and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> Select 'All Mail' in list and click on 'Unsubscribe' </li><li> then click on 'OK'. </li></ul> <p>Please note anything deleted from the 'All Mail' folder will be deleted off server, so it will not exist and that means it will disppear from any other folder it displays in. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
