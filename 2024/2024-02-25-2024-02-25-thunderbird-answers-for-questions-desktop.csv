Thunderbird has no knowledge of labels meaning the copy in imap Inbox is a separate copy in the mbox file called Inbox, which you see as a folder called Inbox. </p><p>So whilst only one copy of email exists on server in 'All Mail', it means in imap account, they are separate copies. </p><p>As the imap 'All Mail' synchronises with server, it will display whatever is on server in 'All Mail'.

That evolution is the current T115-A store.  </p><p>So I'd like to keep T45-B instance and store as a standalone setup, for rare cases when the T45-B data state might be needed. I could try opening a copy of the T45-B store with T115-B, to see if it works. </p><p>T115-A is the only client allowed access to the third party email servers.  </p><p>I'd periodically backup the T115-A store to B, for example in separate B directories, like so: ComputerB\C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\A-BACKUP-2024-01-01 ComputerB\C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\A-BACKUP-2024-01-08 ComputerB\C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\A-BACKUP-2024-01-15 </p><p>Ideally, the T115-B instance can easily render each of the above backup stores on B.  </p><p>Maybe there's an easy way of pointing T115-B to the different stores in the above example. </p><p>I don't know how to use the TB Tools menu to do any of the above. </p><p>Are these all I need?
