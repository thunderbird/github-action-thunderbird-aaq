I already downloaded a MP3 file and I selected it on ""Reminders"", ""Use the following sound file"". I can see the window that pops up, but no sound is played. Also when I click on Play, it doesn't work. I know the sound file is fine, thus I can play it on my laptop. What should I do?  Another question, is there any Add-on with Reminder sounds?  </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",lalos999
