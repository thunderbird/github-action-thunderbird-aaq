The transfer retained the '@cox.net' referent in the e-mail address -- e.g., 'myusername@cox.net' -- to make the transition to Yahoo Mail seamless for all correspondence.  The new Yahoo Mail username also now includes the '@cox.net' referent -- e.g., the former 'myusername' under Cox is now 'myusername@cox.net' under Yahoo.  The transfer was successful, and e-mail send &amp; receive functions for all of my old Cox accounts now work on the Yahoo Mail servers -- but ONLY in Yahoo's webmail. </p><p>in order to get Thunderbird to recognize my existing accounts under the new Yahoo regime, I went to 'Set Up Another Account &gt; Email' and entered the required information, as illustrated in the attached screenshots.  (See attachments 01 &amp; 02.)  The Set Up procedure initially found the old Cox server settings, apparently from Mozilla's archived data for the account. I Then performed a manual configuration, and, as indicated in the attached screenshots, the Set Up procedure also successfully found the new Yahoo Mail servers.  Success, right? </p><p>Wrong!  When I restarted Thunderbird, the new Yahoo Mail server settings were in place, but the username had not been updated -- it lacked the '@cox.net' suffix. After manually amending the username and again restarting, the new server settings and amended username were in place, but connection to the Yahoo servers failed repeatedly.  (See attachment 03.)  A second round of the 'Set Up Another Account &gt; Email' procedure revealed that the archival Mozilla data had not been updated -- it still pointed to the old <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> settings -- and a second manual configuration led to the same results as the first:  Thunderbird failed to connect to my account on the Yahoo Mail servers. </p><p>I then looked for a way to completely remove the existing account from Thunderbird, and then to create a new account from scratch for the existing account on Yahoo Mail.  I consulted Thunderbird online support advice [ref. 'Close My Account -  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1395523"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1395523</a> ]: </p><p>""If you created a mail account in Thunderbird for a particular email address to download emails from server then you can easily remove it ( Menu icon &gt; Account Settings -- Select name of account in Left Pane -- Click on 'Account Actions' -- Select&nbsp;:'Remove Account'. -- Restart Thunderbird. ),"" </p><p>However, I could find no 'Remove Account' selection anywhere in the version of Thunderbird that I am using (ver. 115.9.0 - 64-bit)! </p><p>Please explain what I must do:   </p><pre>   1. to make an existing Thunderbird account originally set up for an old '@cox.net' address hosted on Cox servers now connect to a new '@cox.net' address hosted on Yahoo Mail servers;  </pre> <p>or, alternatively,   </p><pre>   2. to remove all traces of an existing Thunderbird account originally set up for an old '@cox.net' address once hosted on Cox servers, and then to set up a new Thunderbird account for the same '@cox.net' address now hosted on Yahoo Mail servers. </pre> <p>___________________ </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1649917;,NotFromHere
