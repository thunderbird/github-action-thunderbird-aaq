These settings are set up in the Account Settings &gt; synchronisation &amp; storage.  If emails are fully downloaded then you would consider those to be a local copy stored in an mbox file, but as imap folders synchronise with server,  what is stored locally depends upon what is stored on server. </p><p>Any email stored 'locally' is stored in an mbox file. eg: the 'Inbox' is a single mbox text file which may have several emails in it, written one after the other in order downloaded. </p><p>If only headers are downloaded then there is no mbox file and emails are not stored locally on computer. </p><p>All headers for all emails are stored in appropriate 'Index' files and the they have same name as mbox file but have a .msf extension eg: Inbox.msf These index files are considerably much smaller and use minimal memory. </p><p>Thunderbird uses the index files when it displays emails in the 'Message List' aka Thread Pane. It also uses index file when searching etc.  </p><p>When you select to open and read an email then Thunderbird uses header info to open relevant mbox file, retrieve the email from the mbox file and displays the contents in the Message Pane or tab. At this point it will use more memory as it needs to open the relevant mbox file (assuming email is fully downloaded) to locate the relevant email. The number and size of emails stored in that single file determines how much memory is used. </p><p>If you have only downloaded headers in order to save space on disk then communication occurs between Thunderbird and server to download the relevant email into a temp cache in order to open email and display contents. Memory will increase during this process.  </p><p><strong>Ways to speed up processes:</strong> Organise emails into folders to aid with locating emails and reduce file size. Compact folders on a regular basis to remove all old traces of moved or deleted emails. It helps to maintain a healthy file and reduces file size. Move old emails that you need to keep into 'Archive' folders which you set up on a per year structure and also retain folder structure. If you use an Imap account then you could <strong>copy</strong> emails into the 'Local Folders' mail account setting up various Folders to organise them.  I advise 'copy' because if something goes wrong you can repeat the operation without loss. Remember a 'move' means move out of imap and therefore off server, so use Copy and later use the delete to remove from imap folder.  </p><p>Remember to compact folder after moving or deleting a load of emails. </p><p>If you have an Anti-Virus program scanning any file that opened - it will intervene in the process and cause some delay as Thunderbird temporarilly cannot access it's own files then I advise you set up to exclude the Thunderbird profile folder (and all contents therein) from scanning. If profile is in default location then on a Windows OS this the 'Thunderbird' folder you should exclude: C://Users/user name/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </p><p>If you do want scanning then please do not allow the AV to 'fix' things because it does not understand that one file may have lots of emails and you could loose a load of data.  </p><p>Also advise you exclude same Thunderbird file from any cleanup software like CCleaner or Wisecleaner as they have a habit of causing all sorts of inconvenient issues. </p><p>Memory means - memory used on disk to store files eg: mbox and index files and RAM memory used to process an action like opening a file. So having a lot of memory used in disk to store stuff can be ok, but having very large files that need to be opened uses RAM and that maybe the slow down you experience. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

When an Anti-Virus intervenes in the process there is  delay and Thunderbird is temporarilly unable to access it's own files. </p><p>How to test properly: You need to exit all programs and then restart the computer in 'Safe Mode with Networking' - note if you normally use wifi to connect to internet then you will need to connect your computer to the router/hub using an ethernet cable before you restart in  'Safe Mode with Networking' mode. Then start Thunderbird as normal. </p><p>Alternatively - set up Anti-Virus exception to not scan any file in the thunderbird profile folder. If using Windows OS and profile is in default location then you need to set to not scan this 'Thunderbird' folder or any file or folder within it. C://Users /username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </p><p>Please note it will also help if you regularly compact your folders especially Inbox, Junk, Drafts as they get the most action when it comes to moving or deleting emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
