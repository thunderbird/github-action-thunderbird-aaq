These settings are set up in the Account Settings &gt; synchronisation &amp; storage.  If emails are fully downloaded then you would consider those to be a local copy stored in an mbox file, but as imap folders synchronise with server,  what is stored locally depends upon what is stored on server. </p><p>Any email stored 'locally' is stored in an mbox file. eg: the 'Inbox' is a single mbox text file which may have several emails in it, written one after the other in order downloaded. </p><p>If only headers are downloaded then there is no mbox file and emails are not stored locally on computer. </p><p>All headers for all emails are stored in appropriate 'Index' files and the they have same name as mbox file but have a .msf extension eg: Inbox.msf These index files are considerably much smaller and use minimal memory. </p><p>Thunderbird uses the index files when it displays emails in the 'Message List' aka Thread Pane. It also uses index file when searching etc.  </p><p>When you select to open and read an email then Thunderbird uses header info to open relevant mbox file, retrieve the email from the mbox file and displays the contents in the Message Pane or tab. At this point it will use more memory as it needs to open the relevant mbox file (assuming email is fully downloaded) to locate the relevant email. The number and size of emails stored in that single file determines how much memory is used. </p><p>If you have only downloaded headers in order to save space on disk then communication occurs between Thunderbird and server to download the relevant email into a temp cache in order to open email and display contents. Memory will increase during this process.  </p><p><strong>Ways to speed up processes:</strong> Organise emails into folders to aid with locating emails and reduce file size. Compact folders on a regular basis to remove all old traces of moved or deleted emails. It helps to maintain a healthy file and reduces file size. Move old emails that you need to keep into 'Archive' folders which you set up on a per year structure and also retain folder structure. If you use an Imap account then you could <strong>copy</strong> emails into the 'Local Folders' mail account setting up various Folders to organise them.  I advise 'copy' because if something goes wrong you can repeat the operation without loss. Remember a 'move' means move out of imap and therefore off server, so use Copy and later use the delete to remove from imap folder.  </p><p>Remember to compact folder after moving or deleting a load of emails. </p><p>If you have an Anti-Virus program scanning any file that opened - it will intervene in the process and cause some delay as Thunderbird temporarilly cannot access it's own files then I advise you set up to exclude the Thunderbird profile folder (and all contents therein) from scanning. If profile is in default location then on a Windows OS this the 'Thunderbird' folder you should exclude: C://Users/user name/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </p><p>If you do want scanning then please do not allow the AV to 'fix' things because it does not understand that one file may have lots of emails and you could loose a load of data.  </p><p>Also advise you exclude same Thunderbird file from any cleanup software like CCleaner or Wisecleaner as they have a habit of causing all sorts of inconvenient issues. </p><p>Memory means - memory used on disk to store files eg: mbox and index files and RAM memory used to process an action like opening a file. So having a lot of memory used in disk to store stuff can be ok, but having very large files that need to be opened uses RAM and that maybe the slow down you experience. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Thank you, Toad-Hall!  By excluding that folder from scans, have I compromised my security in any significant way? </blockquote> <p>Not really. Emails in themselves are harmless. They may only get 'dangerous' if the recipient - aka you - does something foolish.  </p><p>When you download emails nothing happens even when you open the email - it depends upon what settings you allow and what you do next which matters. But there are a few basic rules to follow for any email and if you follow them you'll be ok.  </p><p>Never assume it is from the person it might say it is from. Some nefarious people use other peoples email address in the FROM but it's not really from that person. Sometimes the  Display Name looks legit but the email address is clearly wrong. Usually, you can tell if the email is from a personal friend by the way they type the email. Sometimes the 'Reply-to' says it's to a completely unknown email address. </p><p>Thunderbird by default does not allow any remote content.  Images may have remote content, so if you see black outline of a box with a broken file icon then it's an image containing remote content.  Sometimes that remote content is just linking image to a website and if you allow it to display, it's possible the sender will know you have opened their email to you and they know what info/image content interested you.  Nothing more sinister then using a browser and searching the internet or viewing legit websites.  Sometimes the icon is so small you would not know it exists and the remote content may be a tracker.  Othertimes clicking on an image or text link may do sometime you do not want such as directing you to a website which is harmful and could attempt to download something you do not want. </p><p>Useful additional info: <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Privacy_basics_-_Thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.mozillazine.org/Privacy_basics_-_Thunderbird</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remote-content-in-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remote-content-in-messages</a> </p><p>So the Advise is -  </p> <ol><li> Never assume it is from the person it might say it is from. </li><li> Do not change settings to allow remote content. </li><li> Do not auto switch on 'Display Attachments inline' until you are certain who sent the email and it contains image attachments you want to view within the email - not using using another program. Disable the option after use. </li><li> Never click on any link - image or text - until you know what you are clicking on - hover over link and the real link information  is shown in the bottom Status bar. </li><li> Never open any attachment until you know who sent the email. Do not be curious and try to open something just to find out what it is. There are plenty of bogus emails from people saying eg: your Invoice is attached, when you know you never ordered anything.  Malicious attachments are disguised as important documents, invoices, advertisements, or other seemingly legitimate files to entice users to open them because people are curious. </li><li> If you get suspcious emails - delete them and then compact the folder to remove all traces of the deleted email. </li></ol>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
