My current Thunderbird addresses are setup through Hostgator hosting and I've rarely had an issue. I recently set up a Zoho email address and added it to my Thunderbird platform so I can send and receive emails there. Problem is, when I send a test from one of my long time Thunderbird emails to the new email that goes through Zoho, it never shows up in my Thunderbird inbox. Never shows up in my Zoho inbox either. I can send from the new Zoho email to one of my established emails no problem using Thunderbird. But it doesn't work the other way around. I've checked everything I can think of--IMAP server settings, SMTP settings, added MX records, you name it. Not sure where the hang up is. Hopefully someone can help, thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jay130

The same applies to the very handy tags which I also gratefully use. I filter mails to appr 30 folders and archive them yearly, so actually finding an email can take some time.

I Have tried working with the new UI since it was pushed and as of today I have had enough and I have reverted back to 102. there are a number of issues that have still not been addressed or fixed in 115 or 125 but the thing I keep finding increasingly infuriating is the UI. I understand UI is personal taste for some however for productivity changing the UI can be disastrous. it has been months since the release of 115. And the amount of time I have wasted because of the new UI is staggering. it is (to me and from what I am reading MANY others) extremely un-intuitive and tedious to use. I will not mention all the performance issues here as they are a separate issue. I would have liked to see an option to use the previous (read standard / tried and true) UI but since they did not, they appear to need an incentive to do such, so as the subject asks how much will it cost to add an option to revert the UI and how can we annotate that we would like it reverted as the donation page does not allow for notes or requests, and obviously the current leadership has a vision that is not in line with many users expectations. </p><p>I would like to reiterate this is not an attack on people who do like the new UI but a simple fact that many people appear to not like it and would like to be able to continue using the software both up to date and with a UI that actually makes sense to them since email clients have been virtually the same for over 2 decades now and that look and feel has become the de-facto standard in the industry for a reason. </p><p>TLDR: new UI is no longer intuitive to ""industry standard"" applications and I want to know how much it will cost to bring that back. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Arckonicon1
