I have been able to access email accounts without referencing the compressed/zip file. When I insert the flash drive, a message pops up asking me to ""insert the last disk of the multi volume set"" I don't understand this request.

My current Thunderbird addresses are setup through Hostgator hosting and I've rarely had an issue. I recently set up a Zoho email address and added it to my Thunderbird platform so I can send and receive emails there. Problem is, when I send a test from one of my long time Thunderbird emails to the new email that goes through Zoho, it never shows up in my Thunderbird inbox. Never shows up in my Zoho inbox either. I can send from the new Zoho email to one of my established emails no problem using Thunderbird. But it doesn't work the other way around. I've checked everything I can think of--IMAP server settings, SMTP settings, added MX records, you name it. Not sure where the hang up is. Hopefully someone can help, thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jay130

I prefer the Thunderbird format for emails, more options. How can I add them to Thunderbird?  I already have them in Thunderbird with the <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> address but no new emails are coming in on the ones that have already transferred to yahoo mail.  (They didn't all go at the same time so I am still getting emails on the ones that didn't transfer yet.)  Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",hamerskyhome

One thing I do have occasional problems with concerns searching and using tags I hope I am wrong, but when I search for one or several emails I usually find them, but still have no idea of where they are located.  The same applies to the very handy tags which I also gratefully use. I filter mails to appr 30 folders and archive them yearly, so actually finding an email can take some time.  The path  to the folder is not necessary - just the name of the folder would be enough to pinpoint it </p><p>yt / Joran Ahlback </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lists
