I buy and sell online a lot and always create a folder for each purchase or item for sale, so I can easily keep track of emails. Then when the sale is completed I delete the folder (I do have back ups if I need them). After an update recently, every time I delete a folder Thunderbird expands the entire Trash folder. Its driving me mad. Why is it doing this? How can I stop it doing this please? I've looked through all the settings but cant find one relevant. I am using version 116.6.1. Thank you </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",vicki.savage.nz

Inbox folder view shows that there are unread and new emails. There are no message filters set. Closing and reopening Thunderbird made no difference. Thunderbird profile file properties shows there is a large amount of data. Yesterday Thunderbird seemed to be operating normally. I don't recall but possibly it was compacting and may not have completed when I shut down my laptop for the day. I ran CCleaner before shutdown. I appreciate your time and advice! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",hugh007
