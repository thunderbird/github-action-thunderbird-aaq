I buy and sell online a lot and always create a folder for each purchase or item for sale, so I can easily keep track of emails. Then when the sale is completed I delete the folder (I do have back ups if I need them). After an update recently, every time I delete a folder Thunderbird expands the entire Trash folder. Its driving me mad. Why is it doing this? How can I stop it doing this please? I've looked through all the settings but cant find one relevant. I am using version 116.6.1. Thank you </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1631275;,vicki.savage.nz

Inbox folder view shows that there are unread and new emails. There are no message filters set. Closing and reopening Thunderbird made no difference. Thunderbird profile file properties shows there is a large amount of data. Yesterday Thunderbird seemed to be operating normally. I don't recall but possibly it was compacting and may not have completed when I shut down my laptop for the day. I ran CCleaner before shutdown. I appreciate your time and advice! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1631266;,hugh007

But it's a while now that Tb keeps downloading same mails over and over. Tried to live with it but it slows down the pc in the very moment it's downloading p.e. 1500 mails. So reinstalled Tb, recreated a new profile for all mail accounts. Worked for a month maybe, and now it started again. Some mails get corrupted also, as on the webmail they are readible and on Tb they are messed up. Tried compact, ecc. but that's not working. Using windows defender with standard settings&nbsp;?

Both had the same message, just one link. One of the mails was keyed in manually, the other mail was made using the command line option. The link in the manually established mail worked, but the link in the command line established mail generated a 404.  Both mails look the same. I could send both mails for a comparison, but this platform accepts only images. Therefore I can only send a screenshot, knowing this will not be very helpful.
