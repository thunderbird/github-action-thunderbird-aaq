There's nothing that can be done to fix that, but with dark themes I can usually not see them. Due to a bug (or feature, if you prefer) in the Windows 10 Scaling and Layout settings, once you change them, there's no going back, at least that I have found. Low vision forced me to try to increase the font size in Windows, and in the (seemingly irreversible) process, I set Scaling to 150%. That fixed the problem of <em>text</em> being too small, but it also affected many programs in a negative way. Everything is waaay too <em><strong>big</strong></em>. For example, the menu bar and overall page header in Firefox was massive, taking up nearly a third of the top of my monitor screen. It did the same thing in Chrome only worse. The page footer was almost as big and between the two it left about two inches in the middle to view a website's content. This was very annoying to say the least. </p><p>I found a fix for Firefox, by changing the <strong>ui.textScaleFactor</strong> to 100. However, that did not work for Thunderbird. I found a way to fix it, by going back to Thunderbird 102, and now the email and address book are fine, and the calendar works fine, except for the colors with really bother me. I can't read the screen without looking away to the right of the screen. This is because the colors are too bright, and that is in a dark theme. I don't even want to look at a light theme. It would probably blind me. </p><p>Here's what I have. The 1st image is what it looks like, and the 2nd is what I would like to make it look like. Is it possible to do that? Please excuse the low quality color replacement on the 2nd image... </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1631387;1631392;1631430;1631432;1631540;1631574;1631636;,axslingerland

I have a laptop and and desktop, both with Thunderbird, same Rev level, both with WIN 10.  The laptop allows me to just click on an unread email to set it as being read which is great as many emails I know the contents and just want to save the email for later reference.  A while back my desktop started making me double click and open up the mail just to show being read..  That is fine if I want to read the email but a waste of time having to open it up every email just to set to read.  Tons of emails from Amazon in particular but many others I just want to keep on file but not have to open up just to make it show as read read.  I know you can go and make them to show read but that is as much or more trouble that just opening them up.  Having the one click to show being read was a super time saver.  I have checked all the settings and I can't find any difference in the setup between the two. Anyone have any clues on this so I can make my desktop work like the single click laptop..
