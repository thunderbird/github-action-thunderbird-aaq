I buy and sell online a lot and always create a folder for each purchase or item for sale, so I can easily keep track of emails. Then when the sale is completed I delete the folder (I do have back ups if I need them). After an update recently, every time I delete a folder Thunderbird expands the entire Trash folder. Its driving me mad. Why is it doing this? How can I stop it doing this please? I've looked through all the settings but cant find one relevant. I am using version 116.6.1.
