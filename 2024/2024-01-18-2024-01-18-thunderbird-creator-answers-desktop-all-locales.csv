There's nothing that can be done to fix that, but with dark themes I can usually not see them. Due to a bug (or feature, if you prefer) in the Windows 10 Scaling and Layout settings, once you change them, there's no going back, at least that I have found. Low vision forced me to try to increase the font size in Windows, and in the (seemingly irreversible) process, I set Scaling to 150%. That fixed the problem of <em>text</em> being too small, but it also affected many programs in a negative way. Everything is waaay too <em><strong>big</strong></em>. For example, the menu bar and overall page header in Firefox was massive, taking up nearly a third of the top of my monitor screen. It did the same thing in Chrome only worse. The page footer was almost as big and between the two it left about two inches in the middle to view a website's content. This was very annoying to say the least. </p><p>I found a fix for Firefox, by changing the <strong>ui.textScaleFactor</strong> to 100. However, that did not work for Thunderbird. I found a way to fix it, by going back to Thunderbird 102, and now the email and address book are fine, and the calendar works fine, except for the colors with really bother me. I can't read the screen without looking away to the right of the screen. This is because the colors are too bright, and that is in a dark theme. I don't even want to look at a light theme. It would probably blind me. </p><p>Here's what I have. The 1st image is what it looks like, and the 2nd is what I would like to make it look like. Is it possible to do that? Please excuse the low quality color replacement on the 2nd image... </p>",axslingerland;sfhowes;Agentvirtuel;,true,false,false,;category:calendar;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/113.0;product:thunderbird;solver_id:5713557,7,0,0,,,
