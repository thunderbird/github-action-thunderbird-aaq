Sorry. </p><p>I don't have a lot of internal hard drive space and want to have Thunderbird store emails to an external hard drive.  So, I have a few questions about this. </p><p>Q1: How do I do this?  I saw a procedure on a non-Mozilla site and it seemed questionable to me.  So I thought it would be best to get the procedure from here </p><p>Q2: When I move the files (not copying them) will this impact the emails online (Gmail and Yahoo)?  I don't want to accidentally delete them from the server </p><p>Q3: I am concerned about the following scenario: I tell Thunderbird to use the external drive.  Thunderbird starts to download emails to the external drive.  What happens to the emails that are on the internal drive?  does Thunderbird move them to the external drive?  Or will I have to move them manually?  Can I safely move email folders on top of folders of the same name without messing anything up? (I'm concerned that Thunderbird would not know that a previously downloaded folder exists and would start to download it in the new spot.  So when I move the folders from the old spot to the new spot, it would overlay the new copy and I don't want that to mess anything up) </p><p>I hope my questions make sense.
