Only they can confirm that for you. For your personal backup, check in synchronization&amp;storage that the folders are available for download and also verify that you have set sync all messages regardless of age.  Then, click File&gt;offline&gt;download  to ensure all messages are downloaded intact. Once you are sure that you have all messages. create local folders for each of the downloaded folders and copy to the local folders. That ensures the messages will not be deleted during any account activity during the move. This is a backup, so I encourage doing a backup of the profile for added safety.   </p><p>If the web host staff move the mail successfully, you will not need this backup, but if they are unable to do it, you can enter manage the mail from local folder or upload to the new server. Doing that can be problematic, as IMAP isn't designed for high volume uploads. You could upload in small batches, or create a manual filter as that would slow the process slightly. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
