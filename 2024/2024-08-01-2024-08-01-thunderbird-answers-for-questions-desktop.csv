That is how thunderbir learns - for a particular email address that consistently fails, I suggest creating a filter to bypass spam checking. This URL may also help. I agree, spam is sometimes difficult to stop.  </p><pre> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a> </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0
