Thunderbird changed them all to read the same in both the ""From"" and ""Correspondent"" field.

When I uninstalled again, and then re-installed the prior version, 115.13 Supernova, the emails are named correctly.  Now it's set to not update. </p><p>The strange thing about the original problem is that T-bird is grabbing the source email from the Microsoft Exchange server and changing them.  All the above effected T-bird email always displayed correctly in Outlook mail. </p><p><strong>May be related to Windows version???</strong> This problem was on my HP AIO desktop running Windows 10.  Meanwhile, my HP laptop running Windows 11 also updated T-bird before I could stop it.  However, it kept the same emails named correctly, but it added the sender's email in both the ""From"" and ""Correspondents"" fields in all emails.  Not just the prior miss-named ones.
