During the removal, the first pane shown after clicking to remove includes a checkbox to remove data. If you left that unticked, then your messages should all still be in the profile.

For the Mail folder, doing a screenshot of any accounts there may be helpful and the contents of the Mail.sbd folder - but only to the extent that there are folder that do not match with current account.
