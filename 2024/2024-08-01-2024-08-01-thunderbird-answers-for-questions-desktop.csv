That is how thunderbir learns - for a particular email address that consistently fails, I suggest creating a filter to bypass spam checking. This URL may also help.

During the removal, the first pane shown after clicking to remove includes a checkbox to remove data. If you left that unticked, then your messages should all still be in the profile. You can verify that by these steps: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down left side to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - you are now in the profile, click the Mail folder and I believe it will show your removed account name.  - click that and I believe you will see you message folders, such as input, input.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc.  </p><p>Report back on that and we can discuss next steps </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
