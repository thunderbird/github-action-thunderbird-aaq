That is the amount of space your mail provider has offered for you to store mail in your account.  Each provider makes their own decisions about what quota to offer and how you are notified when it is exhausted.  But the error message you are receiving is fairly standard for over quota errors.  Given that sent mail is stored on the mail server in the sent folder,  it is quite possible to  have mail you send bounced from your account when the mail is uploaded without that specific error occuring. </p><p>So how much is your storage quota.  A google search of optonline turned up this <a href=""http://help.webhosting.optonline.net/documents/rd/gb/gettingstarted/old/Managing_Domain_Names/Update_DNS_and_MX_Records/faq_email.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.webhosting.optonline.net/documents/rd/gb/gettingstarted/old/Managing_Domain_Names/Update_DNS_and_MX_Records/faq_email.htm</a> </p> <blockquote> Is there a limit to the number of messages I can have in my mail box?  So long as an email account remains below its size quota (for example, it's 75 MB on the Gold Plus Plan), there is no limit to the number of messages.  If you would like to increase your email account's quota, then in the Email section of SiteControl click Change Quota next to the appropriate email account.  What is the maximum size for an email attachment? You can send and receive attachments up to 10 MB in size, as long as this does not cause your mail box to exceed the email account quota as determined by your plan.  The mail server limits all outgoing and incoming emails to 10 MB.  </blockquote> <p>So you can have 75Mb of mail in your mail account at anyone time with that mail provider.  Google offer 15gb and Yahoo something like a terabyte.  But they are making money of your data unlike a hosting service which is also profit driven. </p><p>Essentially your ability to act as a pack rat with email on an optonline provided account is severely limited.  I would strongly suggest you try archiving some of your mail to the Thunderbird local folder.  Local folders can store as much mail as your local hard disk has space for,  but you are responsible for enabling and maintaining suitable backups as there is no copy stored on someone else's machine somewhere else (the cloud).  This is particularly important for business owners that have legal obligations to hold copies of business records(of which email is one) for sometimes decades. </p><p>Also ensure that the deleted folder is emptied regularly,  probably on shutdown in the account settings and that the account expunges at the same time as expunge is when the IMAP server gets it's space used by deleted emails back. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If true, (and if you set up a domain for the club) the domain name for the account can be switched to the new one and keep the same email address.

I followed your instructions and my backup has the following files (have attached a screenshot). Is this what i should have? What happens if i need to restore these files?

Let's take it to a deeper level now.  - start windows file explorer, click 'View' and then click 'show' and tick 'filename extensions' - that is important to see everything. For example, if you now look at your backup, you should see 'profiles.ini', not just 'profiles'  - if you open profiles.ini with notepad, you will see it has the name of the active profile.  - close that and open the profiles folder and you will see the profile with that name. That is backup of your profile. - if you open that folder, you will see a folder called 'Mail' and one called 'imapmail'. Those are the repositories for accounts.'S\ SO, if you have a POP account, click the Mail folder and you will see your account name there. If you click the accountname, you will see your message folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, and sent and sent.msf, etc.  (The .msf files are the index files and the other files contain the messages.)  - If you have an local folders, they are stored in Mail\Local Folders, so you can view them there.  </p><p>If you need to restore the profile,  - first, thunderbird must already be installed, so install if necessary, but EXIT it. Thunderbird cannot be running when restoring a profile.  - then, in windows file explorer, copy the backed-up Thunderbird folder to overlay the on that is there at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming.   </p><p>I suggest doing the backup weekly to minimize the possibily of losing messages, but monthly at minimum. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
