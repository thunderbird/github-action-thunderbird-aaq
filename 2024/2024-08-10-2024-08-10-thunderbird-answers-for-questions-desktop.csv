It bounced back and the receiver did not get the message. However, since then I have received this message 10-15 times. As you can see, the bounce indicates it results from a message coming to me...not from me. If this is indeed the result of my large message from days ago, how do I stop it. If it the result of a message sent to me, how do I find out who is sending it? </p><p>Thank you!!!!!!! </p>",rick465,false,0,0

If <a href=""http://optonline.net"" rel=""nofollow"">optonline.net</a> (optimum) is your email provider, then odds are the message relates to you. If not, the sender has received the bounce notice and knows the message was not received, so no real need to figure who it is. What I find frustrating is that the wording implies that it's YOUR fault that the message was too big for you to receive. Weird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If true, (and if you set up a domain for the club) the domain name for the account can be switched to the new one and keep the same email address. The messages (assuming IMAP) will need to be downloaded and copied to new server. To do that, click File&gt;offline&gt;download to ensure you get all the message content, not just the headers.

I followed your instructions and my backup has the following files (have attached a screenshot). Is this what i should have? What happens if i need to restore these files? Do i just follow what you have said in your previous note? Are you able to open any of the folders below? Or do they have to be restored for you to view them? Thanks again </p>,rosgold,false,0,0

Let's take it to a deeper level now.  - start windows file explorer, click 'View' and then click 'show' and tick 'filename extensions' - that is important to see everything. For example, if you now look at your backup, you should see 'profiles.ini', not just 'profiles'  - if you open profiles.ini with notepad, you will see it has the name of the active profile.  - close that and open the profiles folder and you will see the profile with that name. That is backup of your profile. - if you open that folder, you will see a folder called 'Mail' and one called 'imapmail'. Those are the repositories for accounts.'S\ SO, if you have a POP account, click the Mail folder and you will see your account name there. If you click the accountname, you will see your message folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, and sent and sent.msf, etc.  (The .msf files are the index files and the other files contain the messages.)  - If you have an local folders, they are stored in Mail\Local Folders, so you can view them there.  </p><p>If you need to restore the profile,  - first, thunderbird must already be installed, so install if necessary, but EXIT it. Thunderbird cannot be running when restoring a profile.  - then, in windows file explorer, copy the backed-up Thunderbird folder to overlay the on that is there at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming.   </p><p>I suggest doing the backup weekly to minimize the possibily of losing messages, but monthly at minimum. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The real problem is that the profiles.ini file in the thunderbird folder is pointing to a profile that doesn't exist. An option is to look in the profiles folder in the thunderbird folder and see if a profile is there.
