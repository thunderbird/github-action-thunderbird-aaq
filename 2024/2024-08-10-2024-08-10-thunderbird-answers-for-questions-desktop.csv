It's not what I'd call ""fully hanged"" but it hangs constantly whenever it needs to send or receive emails. Lots of people have reported this and I've spent days (on the <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> forum) asking if it's possible to roll back to a version which previously worked - but no-one seems interested. </p><p>[Edit...] Two days ago an urgent update got released for ver 115 (115.14.0). Not only did it not fix the problem but there's now a new problem whereby it doesn't mark emails as downloaded on the upstream server. So the same emails keep getting downloaded again and again&nbsp;:-( </p><p>Some rollback instructions would be <strong>very</strong> useful. </p>",john391,false,0,0
