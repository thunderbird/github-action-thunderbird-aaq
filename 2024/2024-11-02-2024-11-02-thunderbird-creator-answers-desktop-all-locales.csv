I finally upgraded and Thunderbird was updated to v128.  I was able to configure it to what it looked like in v102.  However, when I compose an email and try to drag and drop a file (e.g. a "".pdf"" file) onto the compose pane of the new email window it doesn't work.  I've tried a variety of things, including saving my old profile, creating a new profile, then trying to write a new message, and finally trying to drag and drop a file for an attachment.  This no longer works.  I can, however, click on the ""Attach"" icon at the top of the write window and within a few clicks, and some searching, and a few more clicks, can attach a file. </p><p>What happened?  And is this fixable?  Why does all new software make it more difficult to do simple tasks that have worked for years, thinking it makes life easier by making it more difficult?  Sigh... </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",BPaul_H
