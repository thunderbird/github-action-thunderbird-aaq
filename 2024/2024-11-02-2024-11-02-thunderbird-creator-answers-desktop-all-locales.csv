I finally upgraded and Thunderbird was updated to v128.  I was able to configure it to what it looked like in v102.  However, when I compose an email and try to drag and drop a file (e.g. a "".pdf"" file) onto the compose pane of the new email window it doesn't work.  I've tried a variety of things, including saving my old profile, creating a new profile, then trying to write a new message, and finally trying to drag and drop a file for an attachment.  This no longer works.  I can, however, click on the ""Attach"" icon at the top of the write window and within a few clicks, and some searching, and a few more clicks, can attach a file. </p><p>What happened?  And is this fixable?  Why does all new software make it more difficult to do simple tasks that have worked for years, thinking it makes life easier by making it more difficult?  Sigh... </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",BPaul_H

It's been my backup in case Outlook fails (which it does with some regularity). I've been using Outlook for many years and have finally given up with all its problems (crashes, loss of data, and lastly, loss of my entire .pst file!). I may be doing something wrong in Thunderbird, but here is what is happening:  1. It prints incoming emails as pages of what looks like code and no message details. 2. It prints outgoing emails OK, but the header contains a lot of useless code. 3. I like to be able to use other fonts for things like signature etc., but can't find how to do that. So, what am I doing wrong and how do I fix it? Any advice will be very much appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1685488;,avbogen

Both of our email clients stopped receiving messages, although it was possible to send. The Verizon network status message now says that ""data service may be limited"" for our area and for an area nearby the message is ""Data, voice, text and wireless home internet service are limited"" and ""There is a known issue in this area and we are working on a solution. This type of issue takes us a little longer to fix. Most are resolved within 48 hours. You can check your network status again later for updates. Check network status."" The other email client is working normally now, but wasn't for most of yesterday. </p><p>Yesterday, one Thunderbird profile was repeatedly asked for the password, but the correct password was not accepted. The password manager showed the failing password for the username to be the correct one. Last night and this morning, the identity remains correct and is still the default identity. Also, the outgoing server still seems to be correct. However, his morning, Thunderbird still asked for the password--but the password manager does not show the username or password in the list anymore </p><p>How do I restore the username/password? Or does that have to wait until Verizon repairs its problem? The other email client had been missing pieces that were suddenly restored with any action on our part. Please note that any reply has to use simple words and phrases--trying what I have described has maxed out my technical skills and knowledge. Also, two more notes: We do not want to use one general password for all at this time. Also, there does not seem to be any problem with the computer itself. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1685486;1685490;,waterdeer
