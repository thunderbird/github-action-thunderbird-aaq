I delete about half of my messages unread, and about one-quarter more after reading/scanning them.  The remainder are then downloaded after I open TB on my Windows PC and select Get Mail (F5).   </p><p>'Until about Aug. 20, everything worked as planned, even though TB was also downloading some of my Sent messages. </p><p>But since then, with no setup changes made by me, TB also includes ALL the messages that I previously deleted at the Gmail site.  So I must delete them again, a tedious, annoying process.  Experimenting, I overcame the problem by permanently deleting the trashed messages at Gmail before launching TB.  It also amount to double deleting, but it is much faster that way.                             </p><p>WHAT MUST I DO to restore the previous functionality of this process?     </p><pre>I'm not a techie, but began using Eudora over 25 years ago, so PLEASE don't replies with guesses. </pre>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",larry41

The OP had folders whose icons had changed color to purple - the same as Drafts.  The solution was to download the add-on folderflags, drag the .xpi file onto the add-ons manager, confirm the install, then on each folder, right-click and select Properties, then use the new Flags tab to switch off the Draft flag.   </p><p>There are two things that I'd like to add to that solution:  </p> <ol><li> After changing the flags, I had to restart TB for the folder icon colors to go back to their normal yellow.  Note that one of my affected folders had also moved immediately after Local Folders / Drafts folder.  After switching off the flag and restarting TB, that folder also went back to its normal alphabetical order position.  </li><li> The OP didn't know what was causing the folders to be marked as Draft.  I can reproduce the problem by these steps: </li></ol> <ul><li> Start a new message, type some text.  </li><li> In the menu bar, select Options &gt; Send a copy to &gt; <em>select a folder</em> </li><li> Save the message - this immediately adds the Draft flag in the selected folder.  </li></ul> <p>Many thanks to Thomas for asking the original question, and contributor Matt who provided the solution. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",tony3121

I did have a backup of my profile of sorts from a few months ago when I was forced to migrate email ISP companies from Cox Communications to Yahoo when Cox left the email industry last spring.  I say 'of sorts'  because I only kept the file structure from the actual profile down vice from Thunderbird down.  And even if I had done that, it wouldn't work well since I copied out the profile before the switch to Yahoo, so the email accounts have the old Cox server info not the current Yahoo ones.   </p><p>I have come to terms with the email loss and I did take the opportunity to switch from POP3 to IMAP something I have been meaning to do for a while now.  And  I was able to copy over the Local Folders , so it's not all gloom and doom.  But what I really need to get is the address book.  I have tired to import it using the ""import from another Thunderbird Installation"" but that ended with an error condition.  Is it possible to copy the address book from one profile to another? </p><p>Oh and one last thing, Thank you for the ISP configuration data base that T'bird used to auto-configure the IMAP server setups.
