In the past we have had no problem moving our profile between the two systems.  This spring when we returned from FL, when the Profile was put on the DT at home, we saw major differences.  We had always dealt with POP systems so we stored all email on a local system.  We, my wife and I, have 5 different email addresses, all of which WERE on the same inbox.  After this spring move to DT, all 5 had different accounts and inboxes.  After this, our old inbox was stored in Local Folders.  This we could live with. BUT </p><p>The remainder of our local folders were incomplete.  We had about 1/3 of what was on the Laptop available on the Desktop.  There was an unused Profile that had all of the Local Folder folders in it.  It had taken me about of month to explore the difference, we had other things to do including an emergency trip back to FL to determine whether our condo was flooded with sewage as our next door neighbors was.  It wasn't!! </p><p>So, I have tried a simple copy and paste to move the many missing Local Folders, both mozmsgs and sbd, to no avail.

1461507,2024-09-01 14:39:25 -0700,2024-09-02 04:02:30 -0700,Can't send messages,"<p>I recently upgraded my computer and re-installed Thunderbird with my several e-mail accounts. Somewhere, while setting up my various accounts, I used a comma (,) instead of a dot (.) in the account name; i.e. cxxx,xx@comcast.net instead of cxxx.xx@comcast.net. Now, when I try to send a message from that account I get the error message shown below. Receiving messages is not affected. My equipment is a Dell Optiplex 7010, 13th generation i7 CPU (x64), 16 Gb RAM, Windows 11 Pro, Thunderbird 128.1.1esr (64-bit). I cannot find a location or means to correct the comma vs. dot error anywhere in my Comcast account or in Thunderbird. What do you suggest? Thanks...
