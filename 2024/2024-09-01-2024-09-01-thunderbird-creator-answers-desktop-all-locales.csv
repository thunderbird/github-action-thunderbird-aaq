I delete about half of my messages unread, and about one-quarter more after reading/scanning them.  The remainder are then downloaded after I open TB on my Windows PC and select Get Mail (F5).   </p><p>'Until about Aug. 20, everything worked as planned, even though TB was also downloading some of my Sent messages. </p><p>But since then, with no setup changes made by me, TB also includes ALL the messages that I previously deleted at the Gmail site.  So I must delete them again, a tedious, annoying process.  Experimenting, I overcame the problem by permanently deleting the trashed messages at Gmail before launching TB.  It also amount to double deleting, but it is much faster that way.                             </p><p>WHAT MUST I DO to restore the previous functionality of this process?     </p><pre>I'm not a techie, but began using Eudora over 25 years ago, so PLEASE don't replies with guesses. </pre>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",larry41
