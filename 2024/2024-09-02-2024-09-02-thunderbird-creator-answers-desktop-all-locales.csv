It has largely worked well for her.  Until a few days ago.   She uses POP and we have our own domain for email. She wanted to make it easier to find sent messages (currently close to 70,000 messages) so she created a ""Sent pre-2024"" and started dragging and dropping some of the messages from the ""Sent"" folder into the ""Sent pre-2024"" folder.  It has not gone well.   </p><p>Thunderbird now routinely says it cannot send or save newly written and sent messages to the Sent folder.   She has to close Thunderbird and open it again, and then the messages are sent, usually but not always saved in the Sent message folder.   </p><p>In addition, there are now several additional system-created Sent message folders (Sent-1, Sent-2, etc. up to Sent-15 and Sent.msf-1.compact.backup with different numbers and one that  is named sent.msf.compact-backup) that cannot be deleted, or if they are deleted they create themselves again.  Some of these folders have messages in them and some do not.  All of these folders are listed as Local Folders. </p><p>At some point she put all of the messages back in the Sent messges folder. </p><p>We have tried deleting all of the .msf files. We have deleted the global-messages-db.sqlite file and let Thunderbird rebuild the indexes. </p><p>How do we get rid of the extra (Sent-1, Sent-2, etc.) folders and, more importantly, return Thunderbird so when she presses the ""Send"" button, the messages are sent then and stored in the Sent message folder? </p><p>Any help is GREATLY appreciated.

Both of these notifications used to say that the sender was my bank, and continue to do that on my ISP's email portal.  On Thuderbird, however, the first emails indicate that they are from my bank, and the second ones show that they are coming from my friend ""John Smith"" (who happens to be someone who sends me occasional Interac e-transfers).  This has happened about 5 times now, and has done so over the last two months.  This makes me very nervous!  If Thunderbird is inserting someone else's name as the sender, and not my bank, is John Smith notified about anything?  I do not want my private banking actions communicated to anyone other than me and/or my bank.  And why does my ISP's email portal show the sender correctly, and Thunderbird makes up the fact that it is from John Smith?  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

When I open that mailbox, I will get additional copies of emails that have already been downloaded in the previous several days. When I opened this mailbox this morning,  new emails were very slow to load. When eventually the new emails started to arrive, again there were copies of previously received emails coming in also. As of now, I have single copies of emails that are dated today (02 Sept), 01 Sept, 31 Aug, 30 Aug, 29 Aug, and some from 28 Aug. However, also on 28 Aug, I have 5 copies of numerous emails. Emails dated 27 Aug, I also have 5 copies. Emails dated Aug 26, I have 3 copies. Emails dated 25 Aug, I have 3 copies.  This pattern of 3 copies of emails continues back to Aug 17. For Aug 16 and Aug 15, I have only single copies of emails. On Aug 14, I have two copies of each email.  I have tried turning off my anti virus software (TotalAV) and I have tried excluding the Thunderbird\Profiles folder. I still have the same problem. The other mailbox that I have, does not have the same multiple copies problem. It occurs to me that there is one difference between these two mailboxes. The one that does not have the problem, opens automatically because I have saved the login password. The mailbox that has the problem, I have not saved the password and need to enter the password each time. Could this difference in logging in be causing the problem?

This list is called ""Playlist"" (nicknamed ""BCC mail out"") and in the past I have been able to click on that name, in the BCC field and then send after writing in body of email.  Very recently, last week in fact, when I click on that BCC list ""Playlist"" and then try to send, the following message appears: ""BCC Mail out &lt; &gt; is not a valid email address because it is not of the form user@host.  You must correct it before sending the email"". I adopted this method years ago and found it really fast and very convenient, yet now I have to go into address book; highlight all the addresses in ""playlist""; change from To to BCC, then add To (and aslo CC)(for different addresses).  Sending this way still works, but seems a very round-about way of doing it! What has happened in this version of Thunderbird compared to previous versions?  Can it be resolved, please?  Any chance of making it 'backwards' compatible? You all do a great job.
