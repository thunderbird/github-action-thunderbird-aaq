Until a few days ago.   She uses POP and we have our own domain for email. She wanted to make it easier to find sent messages (currently close to 70,000 messages) so she created a ""Sent pre-2024"" and started dragging and dropping some of the messages from the ""Sent"" folder into the ""Sent pre-2024"" folder.  It has not gone well.   </p><p>Thunderbird now routinely says it cannot send or save newly written and sent messages to the Sent folder.   She has to close Thunderbird and open it again, and then the messages are sent, usually but not always saved in the Sent message folder.   </p><p>In addition, there are now several additional system-created Sent message folders (Sent-1, Sent-2, etc. up to Sent-15 and Sent.msf-1.compact.backup with different numbers and one that  is named sent.msf.compact-backup) that cannot be deleted, or if they are deleted they create themselves again.  Some of these folders have messages in them and some do not.  All of these folders are listed as Local Folders. </p><p>At some point she put all of the messages back in the Sent messges folder. </p><p>We have tried deleting all of the .msf files. We have deleted the global-messages-db.sqlite file and let Thunderbird rebuild the indexes. </p><p>How do we get rid of the extra (Sent-1, Sent-2, etc.) folders and, more importantly, return Thunderbird so when she presses the ""Send"" button, the messages are sent then and stored in the Sent message folder? </p><p>Any help is GREATLY appreciated.  Thank you. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1672257;,mark572

Recently (a few months ago) all 4 computers with thunderbird started asking confirm a security exception every morning, its very frustrating and seems nothing we do can fix it on all 4, my email service providor CONETIX helped me with 2 systems which seems to have fixed those but the other 2 at home nothing seems to work&nbsp;! All are Windowes 10, the older computer systems are at home. Some online forums suggest that the anti-virus is most likely the problem, I am NOT computer savy so anything complicated gets beyound my capability, can some one help with an easy to understand FIX for this&nbsp;? The 2nd set of problems only started last week or so only on one of my work systems, I have no idea what caused it none, one morning I statred up as normal and all in incoming email has pictures of a power supply in the main body and any attachments the same, I deleted those and resent them back to myself off the laptop, they worked fine doing that, this has happened twice...................3rd time today I opened an email from April from my realestate and it has a picture of a dirty floor and no message and the attachement has the same picture, I dont even know where that picture came from&nbsp;! Last week I deleted Thunderbird and a folder I found on Program Files and then redown loaded Thunderbird again, clearly theres some sort of screw up in the progam or something, every time I start up Thunderbird in the morning now it opwns up on an email on the inbox from more than a year ago, OK its easy just to scroll / pull down the slide thing to todays date and work in from there.................but if I exit email it starts at the old date all over again when I open it.

1461533,2024-09-01 20:25:48 -0700,2024-09-01 20:34:53 -0700,Wrong Attribution for Interac Notification,"<p>When I send an Interac e-transfer, my bank sends me two email notifications.  The first is that I have sent an Interac e-transfer, and the second tells me that the recipient has accepted it.  Both of these notifications used to say that the sender was my bank, and continue to do that on my ISP's email portal.  On Thuderbird, however, the first emails indicate that they are from my bank, and the second ones show that they are coming from my friend ""John Smith"" (who happens to be someone who sends me occasional Interac e-transfers).  This has happened about 5 times now, and has done so over the last two months.  This makes me very nervous!  If Thunderbird is inserting someone else's name as the sender, and not my bank, is John Smith notified about anything?  I do not want my private banking actions communicated to anyone other than me and/or my bank.  And why does my ISP's email portal show the sender correctly, and Thunderbird makes up the fact that it is from John Smith?  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  I searched this forum for ""Interac"" and didn't find anything similar. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1672267;,alan410

When I open that mailbox, I will get additional copies of emails that have already been downloaded in the previous several days. When I opened this mailbox this morning,  new emails were very slow to load. When eventually the new emails started to arrive, again there were copies of previously received emails coming in also. As of now, I have single copies of emails that are dated today (02 Sept), 01 Sept, 31 Aug, 30 Aug, 29 Aug, and some from 28 Aug. However, also on 28 Aug, I have 5 copies of numerous emails. Emails dated 27 Aug, I also have 5 copies. Emails dated Aug 26, I have 3 copies. Emails dated 25 Aug, I have 3 copies.  This pattern of 3 copies of emails continues back to Aug 17. For Aug 16 and Aug 15, I have only single copies of emails. On Aug 14, I have two copies of each email.  I have tried turning off my anti virus software (TotalAV) and I have tried excluding the Thunderbird\Profiles folder. I still have the same problem. The other mailbox that I have, does not have the same multiple copies problem. It occurs to me that there is one difference between these two mailboxes. The one that does not have the problem, opens automatically because I have saved the login password. The mailbox that has the problem, I have not saved the password and need to enter the password each time. Could this difference in logging in be causing the problem? Anyway, I hope someone can help me resolve this problem. Please reply to:   nikkay@internode.on.net </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",nikkay12345

In particolare, l'ho sempre utilizzato sia per scaricare la posta e sia per gli appuntamenti del calendario tramite un server synology.  La modalità di ricezione della posta è IMAP, con la porta 993, con sicurezza SSL/TLS e password normale, (la configurazione iniziale avviene sempre in modalità automatizzata). </p><p>Recentemente (da circa 1 mese), però, thunderbird quando esegue la sincronizzazione: - rileva cartelle cancellate (vuote) nella cartella ""Archive"";  - sincronizza soltanto una parte delle cartelle utilizzate e per alcune di esse non riesce a caricare le email contenute; - ha difficoltà a creare nuove cartelle in quanto non si sincronizzano con il server synology. </p><p>Il calendario, invece, funziona perfettamente.  </p><p>Preciso che ho testato la ricezione con altre applicazioni (mailbird, emclient, ed altri) e tutto funziona perfettamente senza riscontrare assolutamente i predetti problemi.  </p><p>Ho sempre utilizzato Thunderbird e sarei contento se riuscissi a riprendere la normale fuinzionalità che ormai mi segue da diversi anni.  </p><p>PS ho provato a disinstallare completamente Thunderbird e reinstallarlo ( anche su altri pc) ma il problema persiste. </p><p>Potete aitutarmi?
