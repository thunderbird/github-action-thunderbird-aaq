Until a few days ago.   She uses POP and we have our own domain for email. She wanted to make it easier to find sent messages (currently close to 70,000 messages) so she created a ""Sent pre-2024"" and started dragging and dropping some of the messages from the ""Sent"" folder into the ""Sent pre-2024"" folder.  It has not gone well.   </p><p>Thunderbird now routinely says it cannot send or save newly written and sent messages to the Sent folder.   She has to close Thunderbird and open it again, and then the messages are sent, usually but not always saved in the Sent message folder.   </p><p>In addition, there are now several additional system-created Sent message folders (Sent-1, Sent-2, etc. up to Sent-15 and Sent.msf-1.compact.backup with different numbers and one that  is named sent.msf.compact-backup) that cannot be deleted, or if they are deleted they create themselves again.  Some of these folders have messages in them and some do not.  All of these folders are listed as Local Folders. </p><p>At some point she put all of the messages back in the Sent messges folder. </p><p>We have tried deleting all of the .msf files. We have deleted the global-messages-db.sqlite file and let Thunderbird rebuild the indexes. </p><p>How do we get rid of the extra (Sent-1, Sent-2, etc.) folders and, more importantly, return Thunderbird so when she presses the ""Send"" button, the messages are sent then and stored in the Sent message folder? </p><p>Any help is GREATLY appreciated.  Thank you. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1672257;,mark572

We have 5 computers using thunderbird 2 at home 2 at work and 2 laptop, the laptop has Kasperski as the antivirus and the other 4 has Norton 360. Recently (a few months ago) all 4 computers with thunderbird started asking confirm a security exception every morning, its very frustrating and seems nothing we do can fix it on all 4, my email service providor CONETIX helped me with 2 systems which seems to have fixed those but the other 2 at home nothing seems to work&nbsp;! All are Windowes 10, the older computer systems are at home. Some online forums suggest that the anti-virus is most likely the problem, I am NOT computer savy so anything complicated gets beyound my capability, can some one help with an easy to understand FIX for this&nbsp;? The 2nd set of problems only started last week or so only on one of my work systems, I have no idea what caused it none, one morning I statred up as normal and all in incoming email has pictures of a power supply in the main body and any attachments the same, I deleted those and resent them back to myself off the laptop, they worked fine doing that, this has happened twice...................3rd time today I opened an email from April from my realestate and it has a picture of a dirty floor and no message and the attachement has the same picture, I dont even know where that picture came from&nbsp;! Last week I deleted Thunderbird and a folder I found on Program Files and then redown loaded Thunderbird again, clearly theres some sort of screw up in the progam or something, every time I start up Thunderbird in the morning now it opwns up on an email on the inbox from more than a year ago, OK its easy just to scroll / pull down the slide thing to todays date and work in from there.................but if I exit email it starts at the old date all over again when I open it. PLEASE HELP&nbsp;! I dont know to work your troubleshooter ................. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1672259;,keith72

1461533,2024-09-01 20:25:48 -0700,2024-09-01 20:34:53 -0700,Wrong Attribution for Interac Notification,"<p>When I send an Interac e-transfer, my bank sends me two email notifications.  The first is that I have sent an Interac e-transfer, and the second tells me that the recipient has accepted it.  Both of these notifications used to say that the sender was my bank, and continue to do that on my ISP's email portal.  On Thuderbird, however, the first emails indicate that they are from my bank, and the second ones show that they are coming from my friend ""John Smith"" (who happens to be someone who sends me occasional Interac e-transfers).  This has happened about 5 times now, and has done so over the last two months.  This makes me very nervous!  If Thunderbird is inserting someone else's name as the sender, and not my bank, is John Smith notified about anything?  I do not want my private banking actions communicated to anyone other than me and/or my bank.  And why does my ISP's email portal show the sender correctly, and Thunderbird makes up the fact that it is from John Smith?  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  I searched this forum for ""Interac"" and didn't find anything similar. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1672267;,alan410
