They shot themselves in the foot with that and I doubt it's ever changed back. SO, we have to fix it ourselves. Here is a full set of instructions:  </p><p><br> This is the official (to my knowledge) documentation. Well worth the read <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird</a>   </p><p>Here is my own documentation on threading, duplicating the above, but it may help: You need to highlight each folder and click View&gt;sort by&gt;unthreaded. If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>The above is ONLY for NEW folders you create in the future. </p><p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: This must be done on an account by account basis. - select table view  - the icon just to right of 'quick filter' button above message list pane - select a message folder and apply all desired attributes - View&gt;sort by from menu bar (if not shown, click alt key) - click the icon at right side of column display in message list pane - select the entry near bottom 'Apply current view to...' - highlight 'folder and children' - move mouse left to see account name and move left again to display all account folders. Now CLICK. - a small menu will appear to confirm setting all folders within that account. </p><p>I did a simple (okay, crude) video at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a> </p><p><br> ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:  </p><pre>    // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation     user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); </pre> <p>- install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts	  - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.  </p><p>&lt;/pre&gt; </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
