The fact a web password works on the web is in no way relevant when it comes to the email server and the use of email ports.  If in doubt about that have a look at the ATT/Yahoo offering which requires a mail key not the users password. </p><p>2. Deleting a non functional account actually make recovery much more difficult.  Previously you had an account that did not get mail.  Not you have no account,  so we are trying to add it back.  It did not work before,  there is nothing to suggest anything is going to change,  so it probably will not work once added again. </p><p>3. You removed the incoming account.  Did you remove the outgoing server(SMTP) for the account?  I would guess not as adding the account again is failing,  probably because there is an existing SMTP account with the same name. </p><p>Note the vast majority of ""failure to get mail"" issues stem from antivirus products.  This is closely followed by VPN's and then we get to passwords being invalid.  It is way down the list and only once have I seen the password as set not being accepted by the providers server (it was Microsoft and they required ANSI characters in passwords using mail clients, but not web access)   On rare occasions the issue are incorrect settings in Thunderbird,  but you are saying you have already ruled that out.    This forum has had a spate of folk complaining about certificates post update and they all appear to use Norton antivirus do you? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have in the past had some success with removing accounts and re-adding them.  That is why I did that. </p><p>Can you tell me why ONE of the TWO mail accounts on my server works?  The settings for incoming and outgoing mail servers are identical for both accounts.  The only differences are the username and password. Domain is the same. </p><p>As far as I can tell the way a user is instructed to remove an account does not allow for the SMTP server to be saved. Can I check this in a configuration file somewhere? </p><p>I am using Zonealarm, not Norton.  I have some 30 years software engineering experience and though I am unfamiliar with the guts of mail clients I can potentially help you diagnose if you can explain what you need. </p>",kkaffy,false,0,0

Here are a few things you might want to check and try: </p><p>Server Settings: Ensure that your IMAP/POP settings in Thunderbird are correctly configured for Zoho Mail. Double-check the server addresses, port numbers, and encryption settings. </p><p>Synchronization Settings: In Thunderbird, go to Account Settings &gt; Synchronization &amp; Storage and check your settings for keeping messages for this account on the computer. You might need to adjust the settings to ensure all messages are being downloaded. </p><p>Offline Cache: Sometimes the offline cache can cause issues. Try clearing it by going to Account Settings &gt; Offline &amp; Disk Space and clicking ""Clear Now."" </p><p>Folder Subscriptions: Ensure all relevant folders are subscribed. Right-click on your account name in Thunderbird, choose ""Subscribe,"" and make sure all necessary folders are checked. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Make sure you are using the latest version of Thunderbird. Sometimes bugs are fixed in newer releases. </p><p>Connection Limits: Zoho might be limiting the number of connections. Try adjusting the ""Maximum number of server connections to cache"" setting in Thunderbird under Server Settings &gt; Advanced. </p><p>Check for Errors: Look at the Error Console in Thunderbird (under Tools &gt; Developer Tools) to see if any error messages might provide more insight. </p><p>If none of these suggestions help, it might be worth reaching out to <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Zoho</a> support to see if there are any known issues on their end.

I hope it is helpful.) </p><p>BCC is very extensively used in the EU where individual privacy is <a href=""https://ovic.vic.gov.au/privacy/resources-for-organisations/eu-general-data-protection-regulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">guaranteed by law</a> I have linked to an Australian government web site as it places an international perspective on what is local law in the EU.  BCC  is also a good choice when sending emails a group of associates or friends as it does not disclose any email addresses other than the one in the TO: field. </p><p>To hark back to the ancient (in my memory but considered ancient history by many) paper correspondence with actual carbon paper and typewriters you would address a letter and in a business context optionally include a CC: or BCC: recipient. </p><p>Those letters stood for carbon copy (CC) and blind carbon copy (BCC) and the typist would remove the cover page to the original recipient before adding the BCC entries, thus making the inclusion of the BCC recipient totally blind to the original recipient.  In other circumstances the original and all copies but the one for the Blind recipient copy would be removed before adding that addressing. </p><p>When email came along, obviously what were considered standard communication protocols like original, carbon copy and blind carbon copy were implemented to mimic the paper world that the brave new world of the paperless office was going to replace.  We have not gone paperless,  but the mimicry is still there. </p><p>When an address is included in the BCC list the mail is directed to that address,  but there is nothing in the actual email to indicate it as a recipient address.  It is truly blind.  Google have taken this one step further and actively remove the recipients in the BCC list from the senders sent mail,  so you have no record of even sending the mail to that address. </p><p>At a fairly low level To: is actually not used in submitting an email to the SMTP server for delivery.  The command used is RCPT TO and this is not carried over into the actual email that is sent,  it is just essentially the verbal command to the SMTP server to deliver this message to this person (email address).  The CC list and the TO: as well as the reply-to: data will be sent with the email,  but it is not used to actually send the email for delivery.   </p><p>So as suggested earlier it could be to do with the use of BCC,  but it is not necessarily how the email was sent as in truth BCC only exists in the email you write,  not in the copy that is transmitted to the server.  What can be said is your address was used in the RCPT TO part of the transaction with the server when sending the email.  This is why you can get emails which do not include what you see as any sort of reference to yourself or your email address.  You were mentioned in the equivalent to the paper envelope,  but it is lost on delivery. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
