I have a number of GMail accounts, one of which is a former TELUS email account which was transferred to a corporate GMail account several years ago.  When the account was first transferred I was able to add it to the Thunderbird client on both my PC and my MacBook Pro with no difficulty.  It continues to easily added and to work on the TB client on my MacBook Pro but I have been unable to add it to the more recent versions of Thunderbird on my PC using exactly the same settings.  I have tried allowing TB to fill in the settings and to do a manual install.  In both cases the error message is the same ... that either the account name or password is incorrect, neither of which is the case, since I have tried numerous times. Am I missing something such as an extra step that now needs to be done on the PC version that doesn’t on the Mac version?  Could there a reason the TELUS/GMail account in question could be added on older versions of Thunderbird but not on more recent versions?   Regular GMail accounts can be added with no difficulty. Thanks for any assistance you may provide.  For the moment I have set my GMail account for the TELUS email to be forwarded to one of my regular GMail accounts (which add with no difficulty) on Thunderbird on my PC so I am able to receive the mail but I’m sure there must be a way to have the TB client be able to add the TELUS/GMail account directly. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",harvey.burian
