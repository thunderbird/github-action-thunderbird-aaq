Normally, these automated updates are trouble-free, but this time, my view changed, and I can't figure out how to change it back. </p><p>Each individual message is now in its own mini-window, and takes up 4 (?) times the vertical space that it used to.  The old view was much more useful to me because I could visually scan far more messages in a single pane. </p><p>I have selected view&gt;denstiy&gt;compact, and hamburger&gt;view&gt;layout&gt;classic view, but I still have the big bubbles. </p><p>Is there a way to restore the view in which each massge took only a single line of text? </p><p>Thank You. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1689793;1689795;,grebnellow

I moved all emails from all TB folders (Inbox, trash, etc) to Local folders, deleted the profile.  Redid the profile.  Now TB still doesn't download emails.  I get the message ""The account xxxx@verizon.net is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages.""  AND now I can't send emails either. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jsaklas
