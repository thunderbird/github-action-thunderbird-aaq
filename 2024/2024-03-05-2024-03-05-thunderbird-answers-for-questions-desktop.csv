It seems IMAP is a protocol which accesses emails on the server but leaves them there while POP3 downloads the emails to the user's machine. The article states that ""Server Type: This setting is determined at the time the account is created."" When I checked the type on my version of TBird shows POP3. In another article ""Switch from POP to IMAP account"", it details some steps for creating a new account in the correct IMAP type and then some rather involved steps in transferring all the user's existing emails from the POP3 account to the IMAP account. Has anyone tried this and what happens to all the folders I have on the POP3 account or do I have to recreate each of them? Any words of wisdom will be appreciated. </p>",joe_the_mole,false,0,0

Speaking to reps at Comcast about the problem was counterproductive as they were never clear as why former address to access emails was developing problems but indicated the IMAP address was now preferred for some reason even though I have managed to download emails using my current settings for the <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> server. I believe the problem with the IMAP address is as I indicated due to TBird being set up using the POP3 system and need to try following steps found to create new mail account using IMAP type server and see if that works. Some things I don't understand about the procedure is how user can copy old emails in TBird from POP3 server format to new IMAP format. From the article's description IMAP just accesses emails on the server without downloading them. I prefer using the Get Messages to download emails as I wish rather than having program doing it regularly as sometime in past when I was trying to move TBird from one PC to new one I wanted to avoid downloading emails during process and then having to transfer any new emails specifically.
