After the download, my computer says ""The app you're trying to install isn't a Microsoft-verified app.""  The only way seems to be ""Change my recommendation settings"" but that takes me to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed apps which does not seem to help.  I've downloaded on a new Windows 11 S-mode computer.  I'll hunt around Microsoft Help (generally pretty useless!) but I thought you may have encountered this before and know what to do.  Thanks. </p>",Lindsay13Graham,false,0,0

I'm puzzled about your problem, as I regularly use exe. All I can guess is that the world has changed since that version changed. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The problem was S-mode in Win 11 -- after a few false rabbit holes, I finally found out how to get out of S-mode and into normal Win 11 -- and I've now downloaded and installed Tbird.

That works for POP accounts, but for IMAP accounts, you should first create folders in LocalFolders and copy the messages there first. I also suggest it for POP accounts, as you can then completely remove the old account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
