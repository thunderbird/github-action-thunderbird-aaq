After the download, my computer says ""The app you're trying to install isn't a Microsoft-verified app.""  The only way seems to be ""Change my recommendation settings"" but that takes me to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed apps which does not seem to help.  I've downloaded on a new Windows 11 S-mode computer.  I'll hunt around Microsoft Help (generally pretty useless!) but I thought you may have encountered this before and know what to do.
