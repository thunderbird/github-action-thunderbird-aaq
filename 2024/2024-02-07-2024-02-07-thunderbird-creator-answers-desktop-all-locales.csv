I want to send a group email to all the individuals in my group. I believe that in the past I could click on the group name in the address book and have all the emails within the group come up in the To line of the email. Now I have to click on the group and then on each individual, which sends their email to the To line, but then when I click on the second person, the email is sent to the individual in the To line of a new email. How can I choose at one time all the emails of individuals in the group? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cherimadison
