I pulled the disk and can access it from my new Windows 11 laptop.

I want to send a group email to all the individuals in my group. I believe that in the past I could click on the group name in the address book and have all the emails within the group come up in the To line of the email. Now I have to click on the group and then on each individual, which sends their email to the To line, but then when I click on the second person, the email is sent to the individual in the To line of a new email. How can I choose at one time all the emails of individuals in the group? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cherimadison

I can see new email in my service provider's (Shaw) webmail service.  I downloaded Mailspring and they download to that program.

Its oversized and does not allow reforming it either. When you click on next it goes to another screen that says ----- GOOGLE 400 That's an error.  Then a couple lines later it says  ---  The server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should not be retried. That's all we know. --- ( the dashes I added to break up each line) </p><pre>     So it takes using the ESC key to remove it off the screen, but eventually pops back up. I have to use end task to remove it all together but again when I open mail it returns.  I tried to upload a screen shot to you but it kept giving me an error message.     I hope you can correct this problem. Yes I did reboot incase it was a computer problem. Thank you for your time and I hope you can fix this matter. I seen in the forum some were having similar issues but did not see my exact problem. </pre>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1635465;,purpleribbon
