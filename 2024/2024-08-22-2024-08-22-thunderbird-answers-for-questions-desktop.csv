But I must say it seems a bit byzantine that one would need to do something like that.  One might expect that turning off the vertical lines, or even say, offering an alternative formatting in emails -- such as using a different color -- would be an easily available option.  It seems strange that the devs would be so out of touch on such a simple issue.  Ironically the issue only comes up in my case because I'm using Tbird as an HTML editor cuz it is basically so nicely functional at the level that I need -- just basic stuff. </p>",rayandrews,false,0,0
