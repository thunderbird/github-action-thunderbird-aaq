After trying repair on a folder with a few of these problem emails, all Subjects are now blank and it´s showing attachments as &lt;100kb files, so cleary something broke there. Also, while browsing through these emails, my RAM usage for Thunderbird goes up to 100% until I close it and I have 32GB of RAM. </p>",eljar.tamm,false,0,0
