One might expect that turning off the vertical lines, or even say, offering an alternative formatting in emails -- such as using a different color -- would be an easily available option.  It seems strange that the devs would be so out of touch on such a simple issue.

Click on 'Settings' - the gear shaped icon top right If it only shows a column with some basis stuff - you may need to click on the text near the top 'See all settings' Then it displays 'Settings' with following tabs across the page. General, Labels, Inbox, Accounts and Import, Filters and blocked addresses, <strong>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong>, Add-ons, Chat and Meet, Advanced, Offline, Themes </p><p><br> </p><p><br> <strong>re&nbsp;:So I should do Imap instead of pop? </strong> </p><p>Depends upon what you require. If you need to access server emails from more than one location eg: laptops, desktop computers, phones etc. And you want to auto see exactly the same each no matter what device you are using then<strong> IMAP </strong>will be the best option. </p><p>But please note: Emails are stored on the server and Imap accounts can only display whatever is on the server.  Even if you have downloaded full copies of emails you cannot presume them to be an independent copy on your computer because all imap folders synchronise with server. </p><p>Gmail store all emails, incoming, outgoing,stored, archived etc etc - all are stored in the 'All Mail' folder. Gmail understands stuffing everything in one folder is not exactly user friendly, so it invented a thing called 'labels'. You apply a label - it acts like a special tag - the label for incoming mail would be 'Inbox'. That means that email can be virtually seen in what looks like a more conventional manner - a folder called 'Inbox'. It also means the same email can be seen in more than 'folder' if more than one 'label ' is applied. Thunderbird imap has no knowledge of 'labels', so whatever is in the server 'Inbox' will be  downloaded to an mbox test file called Inbox and is a real copy of email. If you delete email and put it in the server Trash folder then periodically gmail will auto empty the Trash and auto delete email from the 'All Mail' folder. If you delete email by-passing the server Trash then from gmails point of view you are only removing the 'label', so email is still in 'All Mail' - basically gmail archived the email. Useful to use if you have more than one copy in more than one folder and only want to remove one of the copies. </p><p>Any folder you create in an imap account, will also be displayed on server in webmail account. In effect the server and an imap account are like mirror copies of each other. </p><p>IF you delete an email via imap using phone and later use laptop and Thunderbird imap to see emails, you will find that previously deleted email will auto disappear from Thunderbird imap account.  </p><p>Downloaded emails may give a cause for concern regarding the amount of space used on disk drive. But Thunderbird offers quite a choice of options. </p><p>It is advisable you do not synchronise  You have the choice to download full copies in all folders or only selected folders and only download headers in other folders OR you can choose to download full copies for emails eg: 60 days old and all the rest are just headers (you will need to compact more freqently to maintain this).  If you want to create a complete backup then you can download full copies for all folders and then backup the '.thunderbird' or '.mozilla-thunderbird' folder in this location: Linux and Unix OS: Profile folders by default are located here: </p> <ul><li>     ~/.thunderbird/&lt;Profile name&gt;/ </li></ul> <p>However, if you're using a third party build from Debian or Ubuntu, those builds store your profile folder here: </p> <ul><li>     ~/.mozilla-thunderbird/&lt;Profile name&gt;. </li></ul> <p>Mind you, I think Flatpak apps store their data in a different directory, in the case of thunderbird it's ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/cache/thunderbird/ </p><p><br> <strong>POP</strong> accounts can only access and download emails from the server Inbox. If server spam filters move emails into the Spam folder then Thunderbird will not know about them because they are not in the Inbox. Pop accounts can download full copies of emails and because Pop accounts do not synchronise with server, they can be considered completely independent copies of emails on your computer. Best use by people who only access emails from one location, but as there is an option to leave mail  on server, other devices could also use a pop (must select to leave copies on server) or imap account to download emails. Not as convenient because each copy may be different. But having a separate account accessing via imap may help with correctly deleting email off server. </p><p>Otherwise it's advised that you periodically access the webmail account via a browser and remove old mail which you may have already deleted from the pop account. Those emails maybe located in the 'All Mail' folder. Please note - anything you sent via a pop account gmail smtp - gmail will put a copy of sent mail on server, so if you logon to webmail you should see copies of emails you have sent. So be aware that these copies of sent mail will also use up quota. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Grazie. </blockquote> <p>Pare che sia impossibile ripristinare la funzione di ricerca su tutti gli eventi reinstallando Thunderbird 128, proprio perché questa versione (per una ragione che non conosco) è affetta da questo problema. Cercando infatti sul supporto in lingua inglese, come ho già scritto, si può vedere come tale problema sia stato già segnalato agli sviluppatori e come sia prevista la risoluzione con le future versioni (130 o 131). Se a te, con l'estensione ""All Events"", va in blocco Thunderbird ricercando in tutti gli eventi, è possibile che ciò sia dovuto a qualche altra estensione che hai installato. Magari verifica questa cosa disattivando temporaneamente tutte le estensioni tranne ""All Events"". </p>",Linuxpac,false,0,0
