Y por favor no me digan que use kdocker, pues aunque funciona bien (es lo que estoy usando) lo cierto es que esta aplicación no está pensada para esto, me refiero a que por ejemplo en windows cuando llega un correo nuevo el icono del tray cambia para indicarlo, mientras que en linux usando kdocker bastante tiene este programilla con minimizar al tray al thunderbird como para también pedirle que ponga un icono distinto cuando lleguen correos nuevos. </p><p>Entonces lo que necesito es que o bien el propio thunderbird tenga esta funcionalidad (como en windows), que creo que es lo mínimo que se le puede pedir a un gestor de correo, o bien que alguna extensión o algo permita no solo minimizar thunderbird al tray si no que ademas su icono cambie de algún modo cuando lleguen a la bandeja de entrada correos nuevos.

I would like to use Thunderbird with an email account provided by my university. It uses the gmail web client and is provided through google workspace (I believe). The login process involves a redirect to the campus authentication page, with a DUO 2FA ping. Is there a way to add this account to Thunderbird? Programs like Gnome Online Accounts allow me to add this as a google account and then follow the usual process in a web browser window. However, when I try this on Thunderbird, I get as far as granting access through Google's system, but then the system exits with ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" Is there a way to set this up correctly? It looks like it almost works. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1656606;,benogoldman

Recently, my emails are all messed up. When I receive, there are 3 sections: the top shows the From, Subject, and Date as it is supposed to do. The middle section is the problem: it shows all kinds of stuff I'm not interested in, such as Message ID, In reply to, References, User agent, X-Authority-Analysis (which is full of nonsense), and below that all kinds of stuff that makes no sense at all (not English). And the 3rd section is where I respond. How do I get rid of that middle section? All I want is what the writer wrote and what I should reply to. That's it.
