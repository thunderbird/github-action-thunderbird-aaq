Both were running great from the time I set up Thunderbird about 2 weeks ago until yesterday when the gmail account stopped sending and receiving. The Yahoo account is still fine. I have not received a message in Thunderbird in my gmail account since, although I have logged in on the web and confirmed that there are incoming messages in my account. </p><p>When I attempt to send a message from the gmail account I receive an error message - ""Add Security Exception"".  If I click ""View"" nothing happens.  If I click ""Get Certificate"" the section ""Unknown Identity"" changes to ""No Information Available"". However, when I cancelled the message I noticed a new error message appeared - ""Send Error Message"" and when I returned to the main Thunderbird screen I noticed a new tab appeared ""Certificate for <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a>"". </p><p>As you can imagine, I seem to be getting nowhere with this and as I am only an intermediate user with computers I don't know where to go next. Subsequently, I sincerely hope that someone out there is able to help me. Any assistance would be very much appreciated. </p><p>The following are my Thunderbird settings for the gmail account&nbsp;:- Incoming Server Server type&nbsp;:			        IMAP Mail Server Server name&nbsp;:			<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> Port&nbsp;:				        993 User name&nbsp;:			        [myname]@gmail.com Connection security&nbsp;:		SSL/TLS Authentication method&nbsp;:	OAuth2 </p><p>Outgoing server  Description&nbsp;:			        Google Mail Server name&nbsp;:			<a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> Port&nbsp;:				        465 Connection security&nbsp;:		SSL/TLS Authentication method&nbsp;:	OAuth2 User name&nbsp;:			        [myname]@gmail.com </p><p><br> A copy of the error messages as well as the Certificate are attached. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",MikeF48

Very long career in S/W, but 20 years as a Luddite so now trying to catch up. </p><p>3 gmail accs - all good. 3 hotkey accs - receive ok, but cannot send - broken recently. These old legacy accs were taken over by iPrimus but are still visible/SameSameBroken at hotkey webmail. </p><p>1 of the 3 hotkey is set to Default.  It is MORE broken than the other 2. How do I remove this Default? I will choose a gmail account to be the Default.  But how exactly do i unDefault the hotkey acc. </p><p>No, I don't need nor want, to use iPrimus pop/smtp settings. Yes, the broken hotkey smtp issue is probably no biggy - just work in hand. </p><p>Thanks for any assistance...
