Both were running great from the time I set up Thunderbird about 2 weeks ago until yesterday when the gmail account stopped sending and receiving. The Yahoo account is still fine. I have not received a message in Thunderbird in my gmail account since, although I have logged in on the web and confirmed that there are incoming messages in my account. </p><p>When I attempt to send a message from the gmail account I receive an error message - ""Add Security Exception"".  If I click ""View"" nothing happens.  If I click ""Get Certificate"" the section ""Unknown Identity"" changes to ""No Information Available"". However, when I cancelled the message I noticed a new error message appeared - ""Send Error Message"" and when I returned to the main Thunderbird screen I noticed a new tab appeared ""Certificate for <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a>"". </p><p>As you can imagine, I seem to be getting nowhere with this and as I am only an intermediate user with computers I don't know where to go next. Subsequently, I sincerely hope that someone out there is able to help me. Any assistance would be very much appreciated. </p><p>The following are my Thunderbird settings for the gmail account&nbsp;:- Incoming Server Server type&nbsp;:			        IMAP Mail Server Server name&nbsp;:			<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> Port&nbsp;:				        993 User name&nbsp;:			        [myname]@gmail.com Connection security&nbsp;:		SSL/TLS Authentication method&nbsp;:	OAuth2 </p><p>Outgoing server  Description&nbsp;:			        Google Mail Server name&nbsp;:			<a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> Port&nbsp;:				        465 Connection security&nbsp;:		SSL/TLS Authentication method&nbsp;:	OAuth2 User name&nbsp;:			        [myname]@gmail.com </p><p><br> A copy of the error messages as well as the Certificate are attached. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",MikeF48

THat is another topic I want addressed if it is possible to have tow simultaneous email accounts with the same Thunderbird email program, so I can switch back and forth when I need to. </p><p>My main concern is that when I go to add comcast email, it automatically forces me to sign in to the Xfinity website. I also have two-factor authentication where I click on the Xfinity app on my phone giving me permission to sign in.  </p><p>It tries twice even after I click on the Xfinity app to give permission, but it fails. So, Thunderbird is pointless without me being able to successfully add my email client. What say you? And do not in any way point the finger at me, my devices, my phone or Comcast. Please get the solution, without being a narcissist, to fix my problem. I have all I can stand of this in the past. I appreciate it kindly, and thank you. </p><p>And I am not allowed to use any other form to sign in, even a text message because I use the Xfinity app. I am unable to change that, so get this fixed for me. I used Microsoft Outlook in the past with no issues with Xfinity and Gmail. See image screenshot on this post </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",erniemink

Osea en windows hace tiempo que está presente la opción de minimizar thunderbird al tray, pero en linux esa opción parece no llegar nunca, y las extensiones que en su momento facilitaban esto ya dejaron de funcionar hace muchas versiones de thunderbird. </p><p>De modo que mi pregunta es que ¿como puedo minimizar thunderbird al tray en sistemas linux como ubuntu, etc?. Y por favor no me digan que use kdocker, pues aunque funciona bien (es lo que estoy usando) lo cierto es que esta aplicación no está pensada para esto, me refiero a que por ejemplo en windows cuando llega un correo nuevo el icono del tray cambia para indicarlo, mientras que en linux usando kdocker bastante tiene este programilla con minimizar al tray al thunderbird como para también pedirle que ponga un icono distinto cuando lleguen correos nuevos. </p><p>Entonces lo que necesito es que o bien el propio thunderbird tenga esta funcionalidad (como en windows), que creo que es lo mínimo que se le puede pedir a un gestor de correo, o bien que alguna extensión o algo permita no solo minimizar thunderbird al tray si no que ademas su icono cambie de algún modo cuando lleguen a la bandeja de entrada correos nuevos.
