If I click ""View"" nothing happens.  If I click ""Get Certificate"" the section ""Unknown Identity"" changes to ""No Information Available"".

Y por favor no me digan que use kdocker, pues aunque funciona bien (es lo que estoy usando) lo cierto es que esta aplicación no está pensada para esto, me refiero a que por ejemplo en windows cuando llega un correo nuevo el icono del tray cambia para indicarlo, mientras que en linux usando kdocker bastante tiene este programilla con minimizar al tray al thunderbird como para también pedirle que ponga un icono distinto cuando lleguen correos nuevos. </p><p>Entonces lo que necesito es que o bien el propio thunderbird tenga esta funcionalidad (como en windows), que creo que es lo mínimo que se le puede pedir a un gestor de correo, o bien que alguna extensión o algo permita no solo minimizar thunderbird al tray si no que ademas su icono cambie de algún modo cuando lleguen a la bandeja de entrada correos nuevos.
