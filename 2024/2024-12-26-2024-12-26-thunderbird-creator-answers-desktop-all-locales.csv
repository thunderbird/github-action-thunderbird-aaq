All Address Books Personal Address Book -my gmail account- Collected Addresses </p><p>It is POSSIBLE to create other address books? I WANT one named ""Ministry"" for specific activity contacts! Is Thunderbird NOT designed to handle this??? I can see that one might want a number of function/activity-specific books to deal with separately. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",phubert28

I am attempting to use the previously generated app-specific password.  I think I remember that on the laptop I could not key the password, but had to copy and paste.  If I generate another app-specific password, will it invalidate the password presently working on the laptop?  Or am I missing something else? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bob_pierce

The default fonts severely impede Arabic readability, so I went about changing them. I accessed the fonts configuration via the ""Advanced"" button in the ""Language &amp; Appearance"" section. Font settings per writing system (Latin, Arabic, etc.) are ostensibly offered, but I have not observed any such settings take effect after experimenting with the Arabic and Latin settings. </p><p>I have managed to only change the fonts globally (i.e. across all scripts) via ""Other Writing Systems"". Did those per-script font settings become deprecated at some point, or am I interpreting/using it wrong? </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,1697702;,anonymous-vR3wO
