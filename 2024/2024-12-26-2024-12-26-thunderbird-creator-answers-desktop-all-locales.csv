I am attempting to use the previously generated app-specific password.  I think I remember that on the laptop I could not key the password, but had to copy and paste.  If I generate another app-specific password, will it invalidate the password presently working on the laptop?  Or am I missing something else? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bob_pierce
