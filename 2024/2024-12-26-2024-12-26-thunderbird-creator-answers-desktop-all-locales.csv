I am attempting to use the previously generated app-specific password.  I think I remember that on the laptop I could not key the password, but had to copy and paste.  If I generate another app-specific password, will it invalidate the password presently working on the laptop?  Or am I missing something else? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1697723;,bob_pierce

The default fonts severely impede Arabic readability, so I went about changing them. I accessed the fonts configuration via the ""Advanced"" button in the ""Language &amp; Appearance"" section. Font settings per writing system (Latin, Arabic, etc.) are ostensibly offered, but I have not observed any such settings take effect after experimenting with the Arabic and Latin settings. </p><p>I have managed to only change the fonts globally (i.e. across all scripts) via ""Other Writing Systems"".

Nell'impostazione del calendario in Thunderbird è selezionata l'opzione ""preferire la pianificazione delle mail su client"". Come posso risolvere il doppio invio di mail preferendo quella del client a quella di Gmail? Grazie. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,1697740;,vanni.tincani
