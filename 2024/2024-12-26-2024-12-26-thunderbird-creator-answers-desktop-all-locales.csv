Seriously considering Thunderbird after the recent refresh and am super delighted to see your collective contributions.  A big thanks at the outset!  I handle about 100 emails a day (both in and outbound) and have to keep going to the sent box towards the close of the day to delete all emails which i had to respond to but have no future use for.  Could you introduce a feature in Thunderbird where the user is asked whether he/she wishes to save the email just after sending it?  A ""yes"" retains the email in the sent box while a ""no"" does not. That way, i dont have to go to my sent box and go through numerous emails at the end of the day to keep my mailboxes clean. </p><p>Secondly, could you introduce the ability to compose signatures within the application itself please? </p><p>Just wanted to leave these two thoughts here.
