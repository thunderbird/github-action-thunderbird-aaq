Example: from Win95 to Win98, Win98 to Win7, and Win7 to Win10 without incident. This is my first time performing a Thunderbird transfer to Mint although I have performed quite a few Mint installations.   </p><p>Unfortunately, after backing up the Thunderbird profiles and other vitals, and successfully loading Mint, something went terribly wrong. After the final reboot required by Mint, files on an external portable ss drive starting being erased, and then the Mint OS on the C drive of the computer would not start.  </p><p>The computer would not allow me to install Mint again so I loaded Windows7 (since the upgrade to Win10 was done as instructed on the M$ site so I did not have an installation disk or image), and released the secure boot. Then Mint was able to be installed but presented a new challenge. </p><p>The challenge is the Thunderbird structure in Mint is different than the Thunderbird structure in Mint. Although I created one of my email accounts in Thunderbird on Mint, there is not a profile I could locate. Therefore, the profiles from Windows cannot simply be copied and then the pkcs11.txt deleted. Therefore, although I have the data, I do not know how to use it or recreate the email accounts. I dread the thought of purchasing a small computer with Win10 just so I can access my email accounts and numerous folders of email. However, at this time I may not have any choice. Not sure if there are any repair shops that could ""fix"" the problem.  </p><p>In the past I would simple copy one email account at a time, msf files and .sbd sub-folders, but again, I cannot locate a profile or even an email account in Mint for Thunderbird. </p><p>Can this issue I be resolved, or am I trying to go up the creek without a paddle? This is the first time that I can recall not being able a solve a software problem. I have also never had a problem with any Ubuntu or Mint installation although there are always issues with Windows. </p>",DesertOutlaw1,false,0,0
