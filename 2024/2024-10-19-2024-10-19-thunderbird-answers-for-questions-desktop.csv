Example: from Win95 to Win98, Win98 to Win7, and Win7 to Win10 without incident. This is my first time performing a Thunderbird transfer to Mint although I have performed quite a few Mint installations.   </p><p>Unfortunately, after backing up the Thunderbird profiles and other vitals, and successfully loading Mint, something went terribly wrong. After the final reboot required by Mint, files on an external portable ss drive starting being erased, and then the Mint OS on the C drive of the computer would not start.  </p><p>The computer would not allow me to install Mint again so I loaded Windows7 (since the upgrade to Win10 was done as instructed on the M$ site so I did not have an installation disk or image), and released the secure boot. Then Mint was able to be installed but presented a new challenge. </p><p>The challenge is the Thunderbird structure in Mint is different than the Thunderbird structure in Mint. Although I created one of my email accounts in Thunderbird on Mint, there is not a profile I could locate. Therefore, the profiles from Windows cannot simply be copied and then the pkcs11.txt deleted. Therefore, although I have the data, I do not know how to use it or recreate the email accounts. I dread the thought of purchasing a small computer with Win10 just so I can access my email accounts and numerous folders of email. However, at this time I may not have any choice. Not sure if there are any repair shops that could ""fix"" the problem.  </p><p>In the past I would simple copy one email account at a time, msf files and .sbd sub-folders, but again, I cannot locate a profile or even an email account in Mint for Thunderbird. </p><p>Can this issue I be resolved, or am I trying to go up the creek without a paddle? This is the first time that I can recall not being able a solve a software problem.

I know that the settings changed from IMAP to POP, how I don't know, it doesn't matter at this stage.  </blockquote> <p>Actually it does.  Quite a lot really. It is impossible for anyone trying to assist you in recovering to offer well considered advice.  Either they simply do not believe the impossible, which would be me and I think David, in which case you will end up quite frustrated that no one actually believes you.  Or they will be missing critical information and start the diagnostic process based on a complete fallacy.  Again you will be very frustrated because no one is truly helping solve the problem. </p><p>Now lets look at what you have actually said. </p><p>You have a Zip file that is by any measure huge,  some 6Gb in size.  My understanding is there is no limit on the size of a zip file in the apple world.  But as I do not play there I really do not know.  This discussion would indicate the Apple product should read the zip file natively. <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac</a> </p> Then you advise of a very specific apple operating system error. <blockquote>""Unable to expand 'Thunderbird_profile_backup.zip' into 'email backup 2024-10-18'. (Error 1 - Operation not permitted)."" </blockquote> <p>The first google result I got on that error <a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8187518?sortBy=rank"" rel=""nofollow"">was </a> where the most likely in my view suggestion was the file is corrupt.  This would be consistent with the other error messages you posted.  Essentially the file you created is corrupt.  A leading cause of file corruption in the zip world is antivirus products.  Do you have one?  They are very good at corrupting and preventing the copying and expansion of zip files all in the name of ""protecting you"". </p><p>So now can we back way way up to the beginning where I do not believe the story the account changed it's type.  I am not interested in trying to recover a corrupt Zip file.  That is not something this forum nor it's members really have an expertise in.  I see suggestions online that winrar and DiskInternals ZIP Repair may offer repair functionality. But I certainly have no expertise in that. </p><p>Goto the help menu for Troubleshooting information.  About  two thirds of the way down the first block of information there is a show folder button for the profile folder.  Click it and you should be dropped into finder in you Thunderbird profile folder. </p><p>Navigate to the mail folder (where POP mail is stored in a folder named after the mail server.  Do you see your account listed there? </p><p>Now try the ImapMail folder,  is your account shown here? </p><p>The actions to take to recover mail is very different for both of these scenarios,  so please post beck you results of the folder that contains your account. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> Also, a warning did not pop up.

I should mention that, yesterday I was on the phone with my ISP support team because Thunderbird had stopped receiving e-mails. During this session, we changed the Thunderbird email account settings back to IMAP. It was before we took those steps that I exported the Thunderbird emails into what now appears to be a corrupt file. As it happens, my anti-virus is currently offline (another trouble-shooting issue high on my list), so that did not interfere with the process. I am sorry that if it appears that I am being difficult or uncooperative in any way. It's just that I specifically recall setting up Thunderbird with IMAP two years ago. regards, Alison p.s.
