Via Address Book OR 2. via Write window Contacts Sidebar The method you use depend upon what you want to achieve. If you want to add just Mailing List name and send as non disclosed receipients then you always do this via the Write window using Contacts Sidebar. </p><p>When it comes to the 'Address Book' only individual names get inserted regardless of whether they are in the main Address Books or in any sub group - aka 'Mailing List'. They always get inserted into a 'TO' field - which not be desirable. You always select the contacts before composing email. </p><p>The 'Write' window offers the 'Contacts Sidebar' to faciliate with selecting and inserting individual contacts OR the name of 'Mailing List' Please note - in any selected Address Book, all contacts that appear in that Address Books in 'Mailing Lists, also appear in the address book. So in the 'Contacts Sidebar'  this means you can see all the people as individuals and also have the ability to select as a group. </p> <hr> <p>The images shows the 'Address Book' Image shows the 'Personal Address Book' has several 'Mailing Lists' Images show you are talking about 'Mailing Lists'. You seem to have chosen a Mailing List  13 contacts in Mailing List - which you have highlighted as selected. </p><p>To add those names to an email you would now click on 'Write'. </p><p>This method allows you to add the email addresses as separate individual email addreses, but they would auto get added into a TO field. So, you end up having to swap them all to a Bcc - OR be certain that every contact in that list has given you express permission to send their email address to all of the other recipients in that email.  That's why it's better to use the mailing list name itself as made available in the 'Contacts Sidebar'. It does not disclose email addresses. The only real benefit for this method is...what if you wanted to only select 12 of those 13 people in that 'Mailing List' - this method means you can. </p><p>But....You do not 'drag and drop' contacts from the 'Address Book'  into a Write message in another window. The 'Address Book' is a file stored separately in your profile.  That implies you are importing something eg: an attachment. </p><p><br> Otherwise: In Write. Enable'  Contacts Sidebar' if not already enabled. select 'Personal Address Book' It then shows all the names of all the 'Mailing Lists' as well as all the contacts. All the contacts have an icon single head and shoulders And all the Mailing Lists have a double head and shoulders icon. </p><p>When I create my own Mailing Lists - I always make first letter something not frequently used eg: X or Z So I have names like this: X Hobby Group, X TBirds </p><p>Why do that  you may ask - in Contacts Sidebar - I selected the 'Personal Address Book' because it contains the Mailing Lists. Then in Search Contacts  I type X It seriously reduces the list to a few contacts but it includes all my Mailing Lists. You select a Mailing List name and click on 'Add to 'TO'. If there are two you want to use then highlight them and click on 'Add to TO' This will only add the Mailing List name not individual email addresses. So perfect for not disclosing recipients. </p><p>But it does not stop you from selecting individual contacts based on what you see in the Address Book Mailing List as a guide, it's just more cumbersome and the reason for a 'Mailing List is you do not need to select indivual contacts.  However, it does mean you can select several people and use drag and drop into a previously opened Bcc field or just highlight people and click on 'Add to Bcc'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That means you can select more than one group. </p><p>It's designed for you to select eg: Mailing List 1 and 2 and click on 'Add to To'. All inserted in one go. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Thunderbird is an email client program that facilitates the reading of emails and creating of emails plus a few other things. At this point it is empty, it shows no folders because there are no folders etc. </p><p>The first thing you have to do is create a mail account.  You would already have an existing email address with eg: your Internet Provider or maybe a free one eg: with gmail or yahoo etc.  Currently, you may be accessing those emails by using a browser and logging on to your webmail account. The purpose of an email client program like Thunderbird, is to be able to access the server and download emails so you can see them in Thunderbird. It means if you have more than one email address you can see them all in one view.   You can use a Calendar - there is a built in default Calendar, but if you have a gmail calendar then you can hook up to it and display it in Thunderbird. Thunderbird also has Address Books, but obviously they will be empty until you add contacts to it. </p> <ul><li> Click on the Menu app icon (3 lines) </li><li> click on 'New Account'  </li><li> click on 'Email' </li></ul> <p>Type your Name, Email Address and Password. Select the checkbox to Remember PAssword Click on 'Continue' At this point Thunderbird checks for server settings as it knows quite a few of the more popular ones.  It does offer you the chance to manage the settings via 'Manual Configuration' button. You can set up POP or IMAP accounts - but by default Thunderbird will initially look for IMAP settings, so if you want Pop you will have to manually swap the protocol whilst creating the account. </p><p>Once the account is set up, you should check the 'Account Settings' are all set up as desired.  eg: Copies &amp; Folders </p><p>Once account is created: In left Folder Pane - you will see the name of the account/email address and it will have folders below.

Example: from Win95 to Win98, Win98 to Win7, and Win7 to Win10 without incident. This is my first time performing a Thunderbird transfer to Mint although I have performed quite a few Mint installations.   </p><p>Unfortunately, after backing up the Thunderbird profiles and other vitals, and successfully loading Mint, something went terribly wrong. After the final reboot required by Mint, files on an external portable ss drive starting being erased, and then the Mint OS on the C drive of the computer would not start.  </p><p>The computer would not allow me to install Mint again so I loaded Windows7 (since the upgrade to Win10 was done as instructed on the M$ site so I did not have an installation disk or image), and released the secure boot. Then Mint was able to be installed but presented a new challenge. </p><p>The challenge is the Thunderbird structure in Mint is different than the Thunderbird structure in Mint. Although I created one of my email accounts in Thunderbird on Mint, there is not a profile I could locate. Therefore, the profiles from Windows cannot simply be copied and then the pkcs11.txt deleted. Therefore, although I have the data, I do not know how to use it or recreate the email accounts. I dread the thought of purchasing a small computer with Win10 just so I can access my email accounts and numerous folders of email. However, at this time I may not have any choice. Not sure if there are any repair shops that could ""fix"" the problem.  </p><p>In the past I would simple copy one email account at a time, msf files and .sbd sub-folders, but again, I cannot locate a profile or even an email account in Mint for Thunderbird. </p><p>Can this issue I be resolved, or am I trying to go up the creek without a paddle? This is the first time that I can recall not being able a solve a software problem. I have also never had a problem with any Ubuntu or Mint installation although there are always issues with Windows. </p>",DesertOutlaw1,false,0,0

There is still no ""profile"",  as in Windows, to copy my old files into even if I create a new profile using one of my email accounts after installation of the new Thunderbird flatpack, which is necessary just to access it. A profile under Thunderbird in Mint either simply does not exist, is hidden and/or protected, or can be found. Do you know the path and if so can you provide it? </p><p>From my research, Thunderbird profiles and its code are suppose to be the same whether Windows or Linux. However, that does not appear to be the case unless I am looking in the wrong place, or a special app and/or program is needed to view the profile in the Mint structure.  </p><p>FYI, the Thunderbird that was in Windows10 was downloaded from the Mozilla web site and updated and upgraded upon receiving notifications. It worked well with three email accounts from gmx, one from gmail, and one from Spectrum.  Even made a small contribution at one time since I have been using it for years, starting with Netscape.   </p><p>Unfortunately, looking more like I am going to need to purchase a small computer with Windows10, install Thunderbird on it, and then copy the Thunderbird profiles into it so I can access all my old mail.  </p><p>Never would have imagined transferring Thunderbird profiles from Windows 10 to Linux Mint would be so difficult.

I know that the settings changed from IMAP to POP, how I don't know, it doesn't matter at this stage.  </blockquote> <p>Actually it does.  Quite a lot really. It is impossible for anyone trying to assist you in recovering to offer well considered advice.  Either they simply do not believe the impossible, which would be me and I think David, in which case you will end up quite frustrated that no one actually believes you.  Or they will be missing critical information and start the diagnostic process based on a complete fallacy.  Again you will be very frustrated because no one is truly helping solve the problem. </p><p>Now lets look at what you have actually said. </p><p>You have a Zip file that is by any measure huge,  some 6Gb in size.  My understanding is there is no limit on the size of a zip file in the apple world.  But as I do not play there I really do not know.  This discussion would indicate the Apple product should read the zip file natively. <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac</a> </p> Then you advise of a very specific apple operating system error. <blockquote>""Unable to expand 'Thunderbird_profile_backup.zip' into 'email backup 2024-10-18'. (Error 1 - Operation not permitted)."" </blockquote> <p>The first google result I got on that error <a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8187518?sortBy=rank"" rel=""nofollow"">was </a> where the most likely in my view suggestion was the file is corrupt.  This would be consistent with the other error messages you posted.  Essentially the file you created is corrupt.  A leading cause of file corruption in the zip world is antivirus products.  Do you have one?  They are very good at corrupting and preventing the copying and expansion of zip files all in the name of ""protecting you"". </p><p>So now can we back way way up to the beginning where I do not believe the story the account changed it's type.  I am not interested in trying to recover a corrupt Zip file.  That is not something this forum nor it's members really have an expertise in.  I see suggestions online that winrar and DiskInternals ZIP Repair may offer repair functionality. But I certainly have no expertise in that. </p><p>Goto the help menu for Troubleshooting information.  About  two thirds of the way down the first block of information there is a show folder button for the profile folder.  Click it and you should be dropped into finder in you Thunderbird profile folder. </p><p>Navigate to the mail folder (where POP mail is stored in a folder named after the mail server.  Do you see your account listed there? </p><p>Now try the ImapMail folder,  is your account shown here? </p><p>The actions to take to recover mail is very different for both of these scenarios,  so please post beck you results of the folder that contains your account. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> Also, a warning did not pop up.

I should mention that, yesterday I was on the phone with my ISP support team because Thunderbird had stopped receiving e-mails. During this session, we changed the Thunderbird email account settings back to IMAP. It was before we took those steps that I exported the Thunderbird emails into what now appears to be a corrupt file. As it happens, my anti-virus is currently offline (another trouble-shooting issue high on my list), so that did not interfere with the process. I am sorry that if it appears that I am being difficult or uncooperative in any way. It's just that I specifically recall setting up Thunderbird with IMAP two years ago. regards, Alison p.s.

Oct. 18 at 1:32 p.m. This date stamp shows on the mail.[ISP].com.msf file. I have to say that, looking at the relative file sizes, and the first having contained 10-1/2 years of e-mails (compressed periodically, when Thunderbird prompted), this e-mail account must have been set up as POP. I do apologize. It appears my memory went frzzzzt. Does this information help in any way? cheers, Alison p.s.
