When I opened the draft to go over it with her, the draft literally stopped in the middle of a word - and nothing after that had been saved! </p><p>Several carefully-worded paragraphs had simply vanished, even though I saved the draft when the message was complete. <strong>WHY is Thunderbird not saving entire messages when I finish them and hit SAVE???</strong> One can imagine my anger and frustration of trying to recall, word for word, what I had written so I can rewrite it (and it's never as good as the original). I like the idea of Thunderbird and not using the big data-mining email apps out there... but this is ridiculous! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",The_Chief

I think this is happening because the calendar at the webcal link updates to a new file every day, so the specific link that Thunderbird resolves to becomes invalid on a daily basis. Other calendar applications that I use (like the iOS calendar app and the web interface for <a href=""http://mailbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mailbox.org</a>) do not resolve the link (they just leave it as <a rel=""nofollow"">webcal://github.com/othyn/go-calendar/releases/latest/download/gocal__community_day.ics</a>) and they work fine, which is why I think the link resolution is causing the issue. </p><p>Is there a way to get this type of webcal link to work with Thunderbird? </p><p>I also filed a bug report here <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1906077"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1906077</a> </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",coyotecoyotecoyote
