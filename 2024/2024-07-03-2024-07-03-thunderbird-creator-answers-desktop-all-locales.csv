When I opened the draft to go over it with her, the draft literally stopped in the middle of a word - and nothing after that had been saved! </p><p>Several carefully-worded paragraphs had simply vanished, even though I saved the draft when the message was complete. <strong>WHY is Thunderbird not saving entire messages when I finish them and hit SAVE???</strong> One can imagine my anger and frustration of trying to recall, word for word, what I had written so I can rewrite it (and it's never as good as the original). I like the idea of Thunderbird and not using the big data-mining email apps out there... but this is ridiculous! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",The_Chief

My hotmail account it displayed everything and my rogers provider too which is perfect. </p><p>I downloaded a program called EM Email for fun - entered one of my IMAP accounts and it synched and displayed all my folders with zero issues (except for the program limitations unless your purchase it lol) with simply my email address and password - no settings - no complications -  </p><p>Anyone know if this can be fixed? I'm at wits end as a couple days ago my Outlook started holding my emails in my drafts folder for anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes before sending - causing a lot of issues with my work. I've also spend literally the entire afternoon and part of the evening on this. Seems to be a common issues yet sources giving instructions seem to be too old to help. </p><p>I did manually backup my folders and tried to integrate them into thunderbird with error after error no matter what i try </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Ken </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1660136;1660139;1660142;1660143;1660144;,dillenger2006

It seems to work well, except that it will not show my Archive folder (simply named ""Archive"") in the list of folders. I can see from my mail provider's web app that it is there and has my messages in it, and if I use search in thunderbird I can find messages in the Archive folder, but the Archive folder is completely missing from the list of folders. (I <strong>can</strong> see other folders, just not Archive.) </p><p>I did find how I can customize what folders Thunderbird will put Archived messages in, but that's not what I'm looking for. What I want is to be able to see the already existing folder with messages archived by other clients, e.g. the provider's web app. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1660151;,ehn
