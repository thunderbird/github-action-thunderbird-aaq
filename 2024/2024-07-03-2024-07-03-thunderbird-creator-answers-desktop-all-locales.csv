Using the import wizard fails. Tools &gt; Import select Import From Outlook and the following message appears. “Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client can not fulfil the message request”. I’m taken back to the Import from screen with the addition of a red panel with “No Profile Found” on it. Outlook 2003 is the default e-mail client, checked more than once. I’m trying to migrate to thunderbird so I have no account setting, thinking they would be imported. My pst’s files have been moved to a directory on a different partition to the Outlook programme, tried creating a dummy profile using default Outlook storage and still fails. I’ve looked at converting pst files to mbox, but this doesn’t see to include the account settings. But I could add them manually or I can not import the mbox files or directory structure into Thunderbird. I’ve been messing around trying other things but nothing works. Internet searches, Thunderbird forum searches suggests solutions but all fails and the steps don’t match Thunderbird menu, etc in many cases. I’m stuck. Can anyone give any advice on how to migrate from Outlook 2003 to Thunderbird. Tools, Add-Ins or manual methods, anything just to get me up and running. PS I’ve two pst files, one is the default main Outlook.pst and the second a secondary store I created in the folders of Outlokk called Store.pst, beside the none default storage location everything else is standard for Outlook and Thunderbird. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1660593;1660612;1660730;1660734;1660810;1660820;1661855;,Private61

Reading through the forum, I disabled threading by default in the config editor via mailnews.default_view_flags, and manually went through every folder setting ""View"" -&gt; ""Threads"" -&gt; ""Ignore threads"". </p><p>However, it appears that disabling threading is only honored for the inbox.  Setting ""ignore threading"" on any other folder is ignored, and Thunderbird continues to thread. </p><p>For example here is the ""Sent Mail"" folder with ""ignore threads"" set (see screenshot) and it still displays with threading. Apparently, ""ignore threading"" only works with the inbox.  I would like threading disabled on all folders, not just the inbox.  If there was a switch to disable threading universally, that would be easiest for everyone who dislikes threading. </p><p>Thanks in advance.

In particular, it does not show Sent Copies which is  folder I rely on.  </p><p>However, Sent copies and several other subfolders for Local Folders are visible in the All Folders View.   As a workaround, I am currently set the tree view to show both Unnified Folders and All Folders to have access to Sent Copies in local Folders...but this is a pain because it means I have to scroll far, far, down in an excessively long folder tree to find Local Folders/Sent copies.  </p><p>So the solution I'm seeking to number 1: Restore Sent Copies, and other normal subfolders, to the view of Local Folders that appears in the tree when the view is set to Unified Folders. (Closing TB, Deleting the Smart Folders from the Mail folder and re-starting TB  does not solve or have any effect on this problem. See my conjecture at end below).  </p><p>Second problem is: I'm seeing a big handful of duplicate emails showing up in the Unified Folder Sent folder.  I've cleared up most of this problem by deleting Smart Folders from the Mail Folder in the profile...but this repair fixes most, but still permits a handful of duplicates to remain, especially in the Sent folder. I have been running TB happily for maybe 10 years. Current setup is  Windows 10 on a Lenovo desktop....my two mail accounts are Hotmail and Gmail.  </p><p>I'd be very grateful for assistance with these problems.  </p><p>My conjecture about these problems:  They arose in past month while there were a lot of starts and stops and edits of settings for TB in past couple months in order to keep TB connecting to Hotmail.  That finally got solved a week or so gao... but my conjecture is that some program crashes thar arose while editing TB sedttings may have contributed --at least to the missing subfolders n the main or Unified view of Local Folders. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1660291;1660378;1660423;1660439;1660447;1660448;1660455;1660474;,kmartinp
