It has been discussed at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1341300"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1341300</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1422543"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1422543</a>. </p><p>Regardless of whatever truths are mentioned by the moderator(s), the inescapable fact is that no other email client renders those particular emails in plain-text; they appear as HTML. In any case, none of the comments in those two discussions seems to propose any solutions, and hence this is yet another disincentive for using Thunderbird.  </p><p>I also cannot understand why, having set my default display font to Times (for serif) and Helevetica Neue (for sans-serif), emails rendered in HTML consistently display in Segui font (including the one you just sent), and despite having unchecked the box ""Allow messages to use other fonts“ in Fonts &amp; Colours &gt; Advanced. </p><p>What am I missing? </p>",ajlowy,false,0,0

Comparing messages from the same sender with the one rendered in plain text, I now see that the plain-text emails were sent from an iOS device. Those that he sends from his computer at word are rendered in the appropriate HTML format. </p><p>Therefore, while the plain-text rendering is the “fault“ of the sender (and not Thunderbird), it's also true that Outlook and Apple Mail just do a far better job of displaying messages sent by iOS devices (and possibly Android devices) than Thunderbird (<strong>which does a surprisingly poor job at displaying such messages</strong>, being utterly unable to render <em>any</em> part of those messages in HTML.) </p>",ajlowy,false,0,0
