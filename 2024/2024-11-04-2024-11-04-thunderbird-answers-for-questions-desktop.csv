It has been discussed at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1341300"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1341300</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1422543"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1422543</a>. </p><p>Regardless of whatever truths are mentioned by the moderator(s), the inescapable fact is that no other email client renders those particular emails in plain-text; they appear as HTML. In any case, none of the comments in those two discussions seems to propose any solutions, and hence this is yet another disincentive for using Thunderbird.  </p><p>I also cannot understand why, having set my default display font to Times (for serif) and Helevetica Neue (for sans-serif), emails rendered in HTML consistently display in Segui font (including the one you just sent), and despite having unchecked the box ""Allow messages to use other fonts“ in Fonts &amp; Colours &gt; Advanced. </p><p>What am I missing? </p>",ajlowy,false,0,0

Comparing messages from the same sender with the one rendered in plain text, I now see that the plain-text emails were sent from an iOS device. Those that he sends from his computer at word are rendered in the appropriate HTML format. </p><p>Therefore, while the plain-text rendering is the “fault“ of the sender (and not Thunderbird), it's also true that Outlook and Apple Mail just do a far better job of displaying messages sent by iOS devices (and possibly Android devices) than Thunderbird (<strong>which does a surprisingly poor job at displaying such messages</strong>, being utterly unable to render <em>any</em> part of those messages in HTML.) </p>",ajlowy,false,0,0

Assuming that the compose tool bar is the tool bar at the top of the email I'm wanting to compose, how do I tell if I'm ""attaching the messages instead of inserting in compose tool bar"".....? 2.

I changed that to ""Both HTML and Plain Text.

I couldn't find that under any of the headings on the email compose tool bar, i.e. view, help, options, tools etc.  </p><p>I'm hoping you will continue to advise me as my entire Thunderbird format has changed from what it was for so long and I'm now lost in it. I don't know if it's a change that Mozilla TB has made or if I've somehow screwed something up myself. It's important to me to get it back the way it was because I'm a wildlife photographer and I send out emails to many people where I describe my trips and insert captioned photos into the text of my emails. Now, when I go into my Sent Emails it looks like my emails are being sent with all of the text being grouped at the top of the page and all of the photos have been extracted and placed at the bottom of the emails as attachments leaving the captions bunched up in the text portion of the email. In the past, the photos have arrived in the body of the email with captions in place and now the two are separated thus ruining the story's organization and continuity. Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated.  </p><p>Many thanks for your help, Steve </p>",jannu1,false,1,0
