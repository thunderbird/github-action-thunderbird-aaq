My problem is, that after entering new contact name and other details, the entry box for the email address(bottom of the list) is hidden (or the panel which holds those details is too narrow to allow for the email entry box to show.??). With the occasional problems I have, and the time spent sorting them out, I'm starting to think of installing another mail program.  I will appreciate any advice you can give.

Before Yahoo's recent changes, Thunderbird would ask users to enter their password before connecting to the email server. This is no longer the case. Now, when logging into Thunderbird, there is no dialog box popping up for entering a password, Thunderbird just automatically connects. This needs to be corrected. Hopefully someone at Mozilla is listening and will take action. </p><p>So far, the only work-around I have found has been to go into Account Settings, Thuderbird Preferences, Saved Passwords, and deleting the oauth password that was automatically saved when I jumped through Yahoo's hoops to get my email working again after they implemented their recent changes. This has to be done EACH SESSION and, if this is done, then the next time I want to get my email I have to repeat the process of generating a new oauth token by logging into Yahoo by way of my browser, which will then be saved once again in Thunderbird and will, once again, need to be deleted at the end of the session. This is obviously a colossal PITA. </p><p>Someone PLEASE FIX THIS! </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1678208;1678209;1678249;1678250;1678259;1678263;,eric.nordin
