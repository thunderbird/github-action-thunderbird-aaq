I have check with my ISP (Telstra Australia) and there is no fault at their end. The account settings in Thunderbird are correct and I have the latest version. I can receive e mails but cant send any. This problem has only occured in the last couple of days. Can you help please. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",dozdeb

My problem is, that after entering new contact name and other details, the entry box for the email address(bottom of the list) is hidden (or the panel which holds those details is too narrow to allow for the email entry box to show.??). With the occasional problems I have, and the time spent sorting them out, I'm starting to think of installing another mail program.  I will appreciate any advice you can give.
