However, there are the occasional email only partially appears. I see enough of it to know who it is from. As an example, I get a bill from xfinity and only what appears to be the graphic part shows up, but, the details of the body of the email do not appear.  So I don't know what they want to tell me.  All this is in regular Thunderbird.  That being said, when I open Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode the full email is then visible.  I have tried the reset everything and nothing seems to work.  I have taken to only opening Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode as then I am assured of seeing the full emails, text and graphics. Maybe you can help me adjust something to fix this problem.  Oh, I am using windows 10 on a pc. Thanks, Dic Bason </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1670373;,dicbason
