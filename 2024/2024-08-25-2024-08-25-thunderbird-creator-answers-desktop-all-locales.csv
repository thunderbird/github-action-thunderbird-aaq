However, there are the occasional email only partially appears. I see enough of it to know who it is from. As an example, I get a bill from xfinity and only what appears to be the graphic part shows up, but, the details of the body of the email do not appear.  So I don't know what they want to tell me.  All this is in regular Thunderbird.  That being said, when I open Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode the full email is then visible.  I have tried the reset everything and nothing seems to work.  I have taken to only opening Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode as then I am assured of seeing the full emails, text and graphics. Maybe you can help me adjust something to fix this problem.  Oh, I am using windows 10 on a pc. Thanks, Dic Bason </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1670373;,dicbason

I just upgraded Thunderbird from  v102 to v115.14.0.  Now, when I press the PrintScreen key it is suppose to bring up the Snagit capture cross-hair but it doesn't - it always did in TB v102.  The worst part is if I click a dropdown menu then press [PrintScreen] the menu always stays open.  Because I cannot use the [PrintScreen] key clicking on the capture icon in the Snagit menu closes the dropdown menu so I cannot capture it. </p><p>What in the world is Thunderbird doing hijacking the [PrintScreen] key?  Or is it?  Why doesn't the hotkey work for other applications?  Anyone know?  Thanks, </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1670389;1670394;,BPaul_H
