I was trying to target a Thunderbird forum but I get vectored to Mozilla which seems to be more focused on Firefox. Sorry if I'm in the wrong place. </p><p>First, it was my impression that a global Inbox could be POP accts only. But my global Inbox has a POP acct and an IMAP account. I'm not sure but this might have happened when I converted one of my POP accts to IMAP. Am I wrong about this theory? Going forward, I'm going to refer to this IMAP acct as the ""bad"" one.  </p><p>As a result, my bad IMAP acct that appears in the global Inbox has no Inbox of its own under its account. What I'm looking to do is get the bad IMAP Inbox out of the global Inbox and back into its account in my sidebar.  </p><p>There's nothing wrong with my e-mail but I want to keep it that way. I have another IMAP account (aka ""good"") and as a result of my situation, I have to look at the bad Inbox and the good Inbox of the two IMAP accounts in different ways in the interface and it annoys me.   </p><p>I've looked at the account settings. The good IMAP acct has the personal namespace ""INBOX."" whereas the bad IMAP acct has the personal namespace """". I've tried changing the bad personal namespace to ""INBOX."" as well but I also have ""allow server to override these namespaces"" and it won't stick. I don't understand IMAP well enough to be confident about making more changes without getting advice. </p><p>Hope this isn't too confusing. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jeglin
