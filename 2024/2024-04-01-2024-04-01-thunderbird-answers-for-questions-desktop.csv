To revert to the release level, here are basics: - uninstall the beta. there will be a prompt to save or keep data. Click the option to KEEP.  - install the release level. It should immediately recognize all your data. If you receive a message of profile incompatibility, exit thunderbird, click windows file explorer, and delete the compatibility.ini file and then restart thunderbird.  HOWEVER, I always recommend doing a backup prior to doing anything major.  Further, I encourage regular backups (always do backups when thunderbird is not running to be safe). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
