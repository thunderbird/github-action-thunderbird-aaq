BUT email clients typically do not work with a centralized server. When you send a message, the email client (not just Thunderbird) sends the message to the SMTP server and it is out of the sender's control from then on. So, once a message is sent, it cannot be retrieved. Note: When sending a message, there is a 'cancel' button, but that only applies during the brief se.cond that Thunderbird is initiating contact with the SMTP server. </p>",davidsk,false,4,0

If I start in the folder for the one I want to change, will this just be for that address?  From ages ago, I have a memory of all accounts being listed in settings and one chose the account to be worked on.  Which is correct? </p><p>I also had a problem in passwords since it seemed to include the fastmail address that is behaving like a champ and it's only the 2 Cox addresses that need changing.

I missed the change with my old profile and first really head about it when folk started in the support forums. <blockquote> Someone replies to my message, and the thread goes missing from Sent, and appears in Inbox, but not marked as unread - you only see this when you expand the thread. If you reply, it jumps back into Sent. Finding anything is now a time-consuming nightmare. But there also appears to be at least one bug.  </blockquote> <p>That does sound like a bug.  As threading only works on the current folder.  that is inbox messages are threaded,  you have to right click and select open in conversation view to bring in messages from other folders. </p> <blockquote> Suppose I now go into a thread and delete an intervening email. Thunderbird clears the preview panel of emails. If I click on Sent then back in Inbox, they reappear! But if I'm now confused as to exactly what that delete did to how many emails, I click Edit / Undo Delete. What it seemed to do tonight when I hit the Delete was get rid of a big chunk of the large thread, including some emails I hadn't read yet, and some not in this or other threads! They are not in the Deleted folder - they are gone! I think it has also done this before. What a mess! As for evidence, reproducing it is not something I want to do. </blockquote> <p>Well I can not reproduce it.  I can not even get the messages from other folders just appearing in threads,  so please  I can not support your assertion because I can not manage to make Thunderbird do any of the things you say it is doing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If your program can send emails again, it could have been a bad add-on that was hindering your traffic Now try to boot it for your operating system in safe mode for Windows or boot another operating system you are using, just like the situation in the previous topic when troubleshooting for Thunderbird cannot be found on your PC. Try the same thing and see if you can find incorrectly installed software in this case or AV software, firewalls, download software or other scanning programs that get in the way of your other software and prevent email traffic from working properly. Most likely, safe mode or trouble shooting for Thunderbird will automatically solve your problem. If not, you can do this manually. </p><p>To enter troubleshoot mode, keep pressing the f button when starting your software. If you are already in the program itself, you can go to the help options and choose the trouble shoot mode and then press restart in the menu for this. </p><p>You can also look for the option to boot your Win 11 in safe mode. </p><p><br> Greetings Firefox volunteer </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,1
