BUT email clients typically do not work with a centralized server. When you send a message, the email client (not just Thunderbird) sends the message to the SMTP server and it is out of the sender's control from then on. So, once a message is sent, it cannot be retrieved. Note: When sending a message, there is a 'cancel' button, but that only applies during the brief se.cond that Thunderbird is initiating contact with the SMTP server. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If your program can send emails again, it could have been a bad add-on that was hindering your traffic Now try to boot it for your operating system in safe mode for Windows or boot another operating system you are using, just like the situation in the previous topic when troubleshooting for Thunderbird cannot be found on your PC. Try the same thing and see if you can find incorrectly installed software in this case or AV software, firewalls, download software or other scanning programs that get in the way of your other software and prevent email traffic from working properly. Most likely, safe mode or trouble shooting for Thunderbird will automatically solve your problem. If not, you can do this manually. </p><p>To enter troubleshoot mode, keep pressing the f button when starting your software. If you are already in the program itself, you can go to the help options and choose the trouble shoot mode and then press restart in the menu for this. </p><p>You can also look for the option to boot your Win 11 in safe mode. </p><p><br> Greetings Firefox volunteer </p>",Googlethunderbird,false,0,0
