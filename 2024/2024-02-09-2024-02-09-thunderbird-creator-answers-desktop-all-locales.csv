At a loss, nothing appears to fix it.","<p>As of December 1st 2023, one of my gmail accounts in thunderbird stopped working. Every time I check messages, I get the Oauth prompts to allow thunderbird access to the gmail account, I click through without error messages, and I can see the rights were granted to Thunderbird in my account, but Thunderbird is unable to connect. If I check saved passwords, I see it has not saved an OAuth password. </p><p>Things I have done: (1) Verified everything in this article: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20</a> (2) Verified that IMAP was enabled on the gmail account (3) Checked the settings against my other gmail accounts which are all working, I don't see any difference. (And this account was working up until December 1st, along with all my other ones which are still working) </p><p>Anyone have any ideas what might be causing this? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1635824;,st.jfisher

If I had 3 monitors to spread the application across it might be usable to read the emails but as it sits right now, the email preview pane is like a reading a cash register receipt.  </p><p>How can I change the ""theme"" back to the horizontal display of messages and emails with accounts on the left as it was before this update? </p><p>on a personal note, I never understood why software companies feel the desire to force interface changes on their userbase.

Nello stesso tempo, anche sul mio altro account (info@camperandtour.it) non riesco più a ricevere mail, ma facendo l'accesso da un altro dispositivo esse arrivano senza problemi.
