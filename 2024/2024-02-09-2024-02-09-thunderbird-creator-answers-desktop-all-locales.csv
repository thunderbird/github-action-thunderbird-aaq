Bugzilla said to contact you guys. </p><p>I am still on 102, &amp; I don't want to switch to 115 yet. </p><p>Here's the bug which caused me a lot of stress last week... </p><p>I've been getting tons of duplicate emails coming into multiple account's inbox all day for several days &amp; zoho is blocking me because of it since it's pinging their server. </p><p>I am using Zoho &amp; they are all aliases. I pay for 2 emails &amp; they both have different aliases. </p><p>Each account has a filter to filter out the emails from the other addys &amp; only give me the ones for that addy's account. </p><p>It's also duplicating them sometimes 15 times AND they go back 2 weeks each time, so not new emails, but 2 week old emails. </p><p>It even happens with emails I deleted &amp; filed in my folders. </p><p>Help. </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Expected results: </p><p>Just one email in each account. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",news8
