In the latest nightmare, I not only can't find any TRASH or DISCARDED folder, ALL the folders have disappeared except for the inbox. Every single icon is useless when expanded, every link is useless, every single menu, tool and setting is useless, every single search within your menu, and every single reply to every single user in every single one of your 4000 suggested articles is useless ... and impossibly irrelevant.  </p><p>It's like not one person at Thunderbird actually reads one single word of one single user. Heck, maybe that's true. Maybe all the responses are provided by Thunderbird computers. </p><p>This particular layout nightmare follows the experience of finding that, when all the folders used to be displayed, there was absolutely no way to perform the simple act of, you know, like, WRITING AN E-MAIL. As I waded through dozens of web pages, both in and out of your Support, I found absolutely NOTHING of the slightest attempt to actually furnish that information or reply. I'm really good at finding info on the net, and it took me almost 30 minutes and dozens of keyword combos before I got that simple info .. and not from you people, either. </p><p>How is it possible to make anything this simple and important so impossible? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1635985;1636130;1636142;1636318;1636328;,scottycrawford19761

The three bars in the upper right if I hover over it says ""Display the Thunderbird Menu"" and if I click or right click it does nothing.  On the other side there's Quick Filter and Filter these messages and that's it.  I saw on a question and answer it was stated to Uncheck the Box to get rid of the Welcome To Thunderbird page so where is this box to uncheck?  I've been using Thunderbird for a long time and I've never seen anything like this, I guess it's time to look for another email client because Thunderbird just isn't working.  I guess what I'm trying to say is HELP!  Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1635937;1635952;1636007;,dmcgoo33

But unfortunately, when I opened Thunderbird, all the tags that had my name disappeared, and I don't think I removed them, as other tags from other people are still there, which doesn't make sense if by chance I had removed all the tags. Would there be a way to get around this problem? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1636008;1636011;,adailtonsurian
