If you are using a VPN with Fedora,  get rid of it as a test. Google and VPNs is just a mess really </p><p>You might also want to have a look in the password manager to make sure your google oauth password is there for the account and delete any IMAP or SMTP entries as they are not used in the oauth process,  but are not removed when you change over. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down left side to 'profiles' and click 'about:profile"" button - the next pane shows known profiles to thunderbird. If there is more than one, click to try it - if that doesn't work, try this:  - repeat the help&gt;troubleshootininformation - this time, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - if there is more than one folder, yours may be one. look at content and dates. IMAP accouts would be in Imapmail folder and POP accounts in the Mail folder and local folders in the Mail\Local Folder folder and the addressbook would be abook.sqlite and history.sqlite. - all of those can be salvaged. Let me know what you find. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The IMAP folders will automatically repopulate when you recreate the account. If you had messages in Local Folders, you can copy, in File Explorer with Thunderbird not running, to the Mail\Local Folders folder on the active profile. That saves them. If you have a POP account, I suggest multiple steps:  start thunderbird and click  and setup the account WITHOUT password and then exit and copy all message folders and other files to the active profile's Mail folder to match the setup. An important file is popstate.dat - it has info on the most recently downloaded message. You need that and other files in place so that the first time you retrieve messages, you will not have lost any. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
