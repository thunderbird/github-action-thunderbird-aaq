If you are using a VPN with Fedora,  get rid of it as a test. Google and VPNs is just a mess really </p><p>You might also want to have a look in the password manager to make sure your google oauth password is there for the account and delete any IMAP or SMTP entries as they are not used in the oauth process,  but are not removed when you change over. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down left side to 'profiles' and click 'about:profile"" button - the next pane shows known profiles to thunderbird. If there is more than one, click to try it - if that doesn't work, try this:  - repeat the help&gt;troubleshootininformation - this time, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - if there is more than one folder, yours may be one. look at content and dates. IMAP accouts would be in Imapmail folder and POP accounts in the Mail folder and local folders in the Mail\Local Folder folder and the addressbook would be abook.sqlite and history.sqlite. - all of those can be salvaged. Let me know what you find. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
