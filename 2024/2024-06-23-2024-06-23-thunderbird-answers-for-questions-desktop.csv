IMAP accouts would be in Imapmail folder and POP accounts in the Mail folder and local folders in the Mail\Local Folder folder and the addressbook would be abook.sqlite and history.sqlite. - all of those can be salvaged.

The IMAP folders will automatically repopulate when you recreate the account. If you had messages in Local Folders, you can copy, in File Explorer with Thunderbird not running, to the Mail\Local Folders folder on the active profile. That saves them. If you have a POP account, I suggest multiple steps:  start thunderbird and click  and setup the account WITHOUT password and then exit and copy all message folders and other files to the active profile's Mail folder to match the setup. An important file is popstate.dat - it has info on the most recently downloaded message. You need that and other files in place so that the first time you retrieve messages, you will not have lost any. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

There is no requirement in the mail specifications for a return receipt to be sent when mail is received.  I do not send them and really do not know of anyone that does.

For a discussion on the backscatter problem that really saw the demise of delivery notifications see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_(email)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_(email)</a> </p><p>So if you are looking for an old style signed delivery ala the paper postal service,  none exists.   Email delivery is simply not well suited to legal situations where proof of the recipients receipt of a notice is important. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

But I can follow directions. Can you suggest something that can be done in TB that will allow me to just download all of the emails into a separate folder on my computer so that I can then delete the folder, without messing up all the TB folders I currently have running in TB?   </p><p>Thank you. </p>",attcbf1,false,0,0
