The IMAP folders will automatically repopulate when you recreate the account. If you had messages in Local Folders, you can copy, in File Explorer with Thunderbird not running, to the Mail\Local Folders folder on the active profile. That saves them. If you have a POP account, I suggest multiple steps:  start thunderbird and click  and setup the account WITHOUT password and then exit and copy all message folders and other files to the active profile's Mail folder to match the setup. An important file is popstate.dat - it has info on the most recently downloaded message. You need that and other files in place so that the first time you retrieve messages, you will not have lost any. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

But I can follow directions. Can you suggest something that can be done in TB that will allow me to just download all of the emails into a separate folder on my computer so that I can then delete the folder, without messing up all the TB folders I currently have running in TB?   </p><p>Thank you. </p>",attcbf1,false,0,0
