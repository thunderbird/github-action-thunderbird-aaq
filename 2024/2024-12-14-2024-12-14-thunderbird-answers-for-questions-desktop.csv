It's not the settings, which are correct, but the authentication, that was forced after this morning's mandatory password change.  When you connect to a gmail account, TB opens a window using it's own browser to a page of accounts.google where you can enter your username. Normally you would then proceed to another google page where you would enter password. Enterprise accounts can modify this behavior. In the case of NYU, after you enter your username, you are redirected to NYU's MFA page. It's at this point that I get the 403 code. Since I can reach the MFA from other browsers without a problem, I can only conclude that the certificate issue is what's keeping TB's browser to connect properly and I can't figure out to reset that. Even a different profile and starting from scratch does not seem to work. </p>",valerio3,false,0,0

I uninstalled Thunderbird, moved the profile to another folder (as suggested elsewhere), then reinstalled Thunderbird and re-added my mail account. Since I use IMAP, all my emails were synced from the server. I also imported my address book from the old profile. </p><p>Now, everything is back to normal, and Thunderbird is running smoothly again. </p><p>That said, the way Thunderbird was hanging before was really frustrating. Something clearly wasn’t working as expected, and I suspect there’s a timeout issue involved. At some point, waiting indefinitely just isn’t a viable solution. </p><p>Best regards, Daniel </p>",JustinCase,false,0,0
