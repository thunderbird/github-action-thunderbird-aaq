Apparently when I checked your suggestion I found my AV lapsed so I renewed my BitDefender and that took care of the issue.

You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent-####@att.net"" </p><p>A few years ago <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> farmed out the admin of their free legacy <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> email accounts to Yahoo who admins them on a ""<a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a>"" webmail site.

And then you're into looking into Windows security features to disable viewing the program files directory. It's a stack of dominoes.  The above mentioned steps may work, depending on how desperately the people want the passwords. Another solution, if availalble, would be to use app passwords that are unique to the PC, eliminating entire problem. I'm think of Gmail, but there are others. Good luck.
