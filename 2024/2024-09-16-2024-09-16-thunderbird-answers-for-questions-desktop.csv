Apparently when I checked your suggestion I found my AV lapsed so I renewed my BitDefender and that took care of the issue.  A BIG thanks! </p><p>Since you seem to be email auth knowledgeable, I have another similar question that has been going on for some time ...  years actually I am embarassed to admit... unlike my gmail issue which was only a week old </p><p>My original two email accts in my life were paid dial-in accts on <a href=""http://ATT.net"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.net</a> and while I have switched mostly to gmail I still have those two <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> accts which some of my old contacts still use now and then so I also have them set up in TBird. </p><p>And for the most part they work... they send and receive.  but every time there is a download /receive command generated for those accts I get a irritating ""Enter your password for ####@att.net on <a href=""http://imap.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.att.net</a> etc etc"" error message that pops up </p><p>If I send from one of the <a href=""http://ATT.net"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.net</a> accts I get a ""Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors.   You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent-####@att.net"" </p><p>A few years ago <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> farmed out the admin of their free legacy <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> email accounts to Yahoo who admins them on a ""<a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a>"" webmail site.   And at that time when setting them up in a Thunderbird client on Win you had to Generate a passkey to make it work.    </p><p>( ATT Passkey Instructions: <a href=""https://www.att.com/support/article/email-support/KM1240308"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.att.com/support/article/email-support/KM1240308</a> ) </p><p>Which I did a back then but then after a while these error messages started popping up and there literally is no accessible tech support at either <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> or yahoo either for those now free legacy accts (beyond those instructions) so I have just lived with the constant irritation of the constant popup errors. </p><p>It must be some kind of auth issue ... but its not an AV one... it seems to be a config or auth issue... but I don't know how to figure it out. </p><p>Offhand with your savvy experience, do you recognize what it might be?  </p><p>Not to worry if you don't ... u solved my critical problem with gmail... which was WAY more important. </p><p>Much thanks, </p><p>Dan </p>",dbotas,false,0,0
