Only way to get reasonable sizes fonts was to downgrade TB to what I had previously and re-load the add-on. It was probably the add-on that enabled me to get good size fonts, not TB. The fact that I have 'default' and that satisfies what I want is irrelevant. I checked this out now by removing the add-on, and fonts went bad again. Re-installed add on and all back to how I want it (even if that happens to be default). So that is why kept old version of TB and the add-on. Thus I need it (with my old version of TB). </p><p>Now, If you say that TB has sorted out all it's font size problems that it had many years ago, necessitating someone creating an add on to solve the problems, I will give it a try..... but be prepared to get another message if it does not get me back to how it is at present. </p>",dogdogonholiday,false,0,0

I left my Yahoo account alone and only deleted and re-added the Outlook account.  </p><p>It seems we use TB a little differently. Maybe you can backup/copy/save your local folders and address book before deleting.  Also, you may want to wait a while. You do have a few months.
