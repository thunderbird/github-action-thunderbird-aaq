All of the largest mail providers are changing to some form of oauth authentication and your Thunderbird just does not support those protocols as implemented now.   There are, and will not be, instructions for version 60.  It went out of support some 5 years ago. </p><p>Theme and font size changer is, as you are aware obsolete, and has been for years.  You do not need it,  you just want it.  Thunderbird has all the scaling settings you need built in an has had variations available for some years now with regard to density and font size.  Although I note in your image that all of the settings are set to default, including scaling, so it is doing nothing anyway. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-06-27-17-07-42-4b9fb8.png""> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If the current verion of Thunderbird has all the font size changes NOW, that it did not have THEN, then great, I will upgrade, BUT don't tell me that ""You do not need it,  you just want it"" and "" it is doing nothing anyway"". </p><p>This is just plain wrong and rude! </p><p>When I did my last upgrade, and I could not use the add-on, my font sizes went all wrong, and I could not change it back to any size I could read by any Thunderbird control, and I had to search how to put my version back to a previous version and re-install the add-on to get a screen that I could read. So I DID need it (even if most of controls are at default - without the add-on and the lastest version then, I could not read the fonts as they were too small). </p><p>I was not the only person to have this problem at the time, and solution (revert back to previos version) was posted on your own help forum. </p><p>I would appreciate if you would just answer questions as posed, and not add any of your own personal and rude comments. </p>",dogdogonholiday,false,0,0

There is the image you posted.   What exactly is it doing to adjust your settings?  Everything is in it's default state.  Ergo it is doing nothing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
