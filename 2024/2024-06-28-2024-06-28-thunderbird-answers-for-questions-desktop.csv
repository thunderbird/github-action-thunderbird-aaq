Only way to get reasonable sizes fonts was to downgrade TB to what I had previously and re-load the add-on. It was probably the add-on that enabled me to get good size fonts, not TB. The fact that I have 'default' and that satisfies what I want is irrelevant. I checked this out now by removing the add-on, and fonts went bad again. Re-installed add on and all back to how I want it (even if that happens to be default). So that is why kept old version of TB and the add-on. Thus I need it (with my old version of TB). </p><p>Now, If you say that TB has sorted out all it's font size problems that it had many years ago, necessitating someone creating an add on to solve the problems, I will give it a try..... but be prepared to get another message if it does not get me back to how it is at present. </p>",dogdogonholiday,false,0,0

I deleted my hotmail account in Thunderbird, leaving the 'delete mailboxes/messages' unchecked just in case.

(fk that!) - Longwinded, faffy, unhelpful &amp; ultimately didn't work anyway - still couldn't retrieve mail from the server.

My first suggestion is to see if there are prior profiles. Try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' in left sidebar and click 'open folder'  - you are now in the profile, back up one folder so that you are in the Profiles folder.  - that may show multiple profiles. Only the one you are using is active; the others are dead weight - click to each of them. For POP account info, try the Mail folder to see if your account is there, and look in Mail\Local Folders to check for an local folders  - check in each profile. If you find some account info that appears recent, post a screenshot of the message folders and we can assist in recovering them. thanks. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Within my profile folder there was a file called prefs.js and also a lot of other similar files with a preceding number such as 43.prefs.js, which I assumed were backups.  I opened the prefs.js and compared it with the most recent backup and found that the backup had all kinds of information that pointed to my missing accounts. I just renamed the prefs.js to something else, then renamed the most recent backup to prefs.js, reopened Thunderbird and everything was back to normal. </p>",sbbolson,false,2,0
