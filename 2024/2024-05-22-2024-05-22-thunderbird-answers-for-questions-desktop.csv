Sync'ing only recent number of days can help and you can also set which folders are NOT to be accessed offline. If the account already exists, another option is to exit thunderbird and, in windows file explorer (assuming windows), delete the folder and it's .msf entry. restart thunderbird and folder will repopulate according to the settings. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
