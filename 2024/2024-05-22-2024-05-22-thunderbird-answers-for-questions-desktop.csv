Globa is a rather unique feature of thunderbird, — this is perhaps one of the top features why we're still with thunderbird despite a few serious bugs which bothers us for 15+ years. Like mailbox (index?) corruption resulting in message filters constantly stopping working, or like duplicating messages in (old) folders - resulting in having 50k dups and counting in a folder with only 5k actual msgs — these are very old bugs reported in bugzilla.  This is why we tried to switch to IMAP - thunderbird with local mail storage is barely usable.

But in a corporate environment file contention comes from many other sources.  Thunderbird was originally written to run in a single process environment it does not handle file contention at all really.  So to maximize reliability things have to be configured around it to try and reduce contention to Zero.  So, no streaming backups, no cloud synchronization.  Take extreme care when storing profile data anywhere but on a local disk,  but above all prevent antivirus programs from scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder ""on demand"". I recommend an exception in antivirus product for the Thunderbird profile folder.  Likewise an third party toolbars in Thunderbird usually result in at least index corruption.  Especially those scam and spam tools. </p><p>Yes they are old bugs,  but most of them are not going to be fixed until the maildir like store becomes the default store.  Multi gigabyte storage files per folder are the real issue for most of the bugs, exacerbated by external factors. </p><p>Personally I use Thunderbird on a single PC with a 40Gb profile folder collection and it works pretty well.  I can not even begin to say it is barely usable as you claim.   </p><p>I am positively tired of it hanging all the time in V115.  I hope V128 has fixed that.  They say they have fixed most of the issues. We will see.   </p><p>But the topics you mention are mostly manageable,  but it does require doubting the lies antivirus vendors promote about what are real risks v's what are potential ones,  but I got used to doubting everyone 20+ years ago when Microsoft started their total cost of ownership stuff which was largely fiction and fear. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

We had thunderbird mail store on a file server (samba) - this is to avoid it being in windows user profile where it does not belong at all.  But I watch very carefully for the users to never run two instances of thunderbird with the same mail storage — for this I only allow users to log in to a single PC.  There's *zero* contention, and we had thunderbird mail storage folders added to AV exclusions many years ago too. </p><p>Both problems I mentioned in the previous message only occurs when email is on the network drive though, — and the bugs in bugzilla also mentions network drive (tried to find them once again - I remember finding them a few times in the past - but can't currently). We have this setup for backup purposes (backups are done on server only) and to be able to switch to another PC, so mail location is not dependent on the PC the user is working on, just like windows roaming profiles (eg, to replace a PC and have the same setup for users). </p><p>When the whole thing is on local drive everything seems to be fine (except maybe another issue which sometimes bothers us — with thunderbird doubling the leading ""&gt;"" and hence sometimes corrupting program code embedded in text messages — I also hoped this will be fixed by switching to IMAP, but since it has to download all mesages into mbox files anyway for globa to work, this issue wont be fixed anyway). </p><p>I don't know if this is a prob in samba or windows file client, or something else. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>/mjt </p>",mjt,false,0,0

Why TB is ""indexing"" all the messages when Gloda is enabled but Message Syncronizing is not?  It definitely fetches all message *bodies* in this case, - I looked at IMAP conversation.  First it downloads all headers to build folder index, and next it downloads whole messages in each folder, ""Activity Manager"" window shows ""Indexing messages in $Folder"" at this time.  It seems such downloading is useless since the results aren't used anyway. </p><p>2. Shouldn't the ""Include messages in this folder in Global Search results"" checkbox in the folder properties be disabled (and unchecked) if ""Select this folder for offline use"" (which is a folder-level form of ""Message Syncronizing"" checkbox) is unchecked?  This checkbox is definitely confusing, - if this folder is not selected for offline use, but ""Include this folder in Gloda"" is checked (by default!), it's surely expected that the folder to be searched in. </p><p>Both of these 2 questions are the reasons why I started this thread: it looks like TB should be indexing all messages in Gloda even if ""Message Syncronizing"" is turned off, and it seems to be indexing them and each folder is included in Gloda in folder properties.
