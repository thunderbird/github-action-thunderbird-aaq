I did what you so carefully described, but nothing happened! I made one mistake and perhaps you can tell me if it was fatal. When you said ""Exit Thunderbird now. This is important"" I closed the Thunderbird window, but I did not quit the program. I now realise when you said Exit, this is what you meant. So I have the folder in my profile and the userChrome.css file saved in it. But by leaving Thunderbird open I may have failed to link it to the program. Is there a short cut now to making it work, or should I start over and move the folder to trash? Thanks for all your help. Clive </p>",clivechafer,false,0,0

Initially i thought it was me clicking the wrong account when emailing. Then i began slowing down and checking and it happens everytime. When i take the Gmail account out, all the remaining 4 email accounts go direct to trash for the 4 remaining emails.
