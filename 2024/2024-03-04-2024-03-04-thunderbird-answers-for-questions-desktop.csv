The gmail account is a rarely used account, but seems to be priorotised . All accounts are set to imap and 993port.  Thinking back, it worked fine up till covid time then it began. Initially i thought it was me clicking the wrong account when emailing. Then i began slowing down and checking and it happens everytime. When i take the Gmail account out, all the remaining 4 email accounts go direct to trash for the 4 remaining emails.  I just have to remember to double check each  email, but sometimes i miss it, Iis frustrating. </p>",mgcm10,false,0,0
