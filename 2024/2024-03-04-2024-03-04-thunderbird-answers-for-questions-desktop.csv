However, apart from the position of the chrome folder, everything else seems right. I have put it in the sy8519es.default-release folder and restarted, but nothing has changed. As far as the .css suffix is concerned, I'm baffled. I created the text file in TextEdit, the Mac equivalent of Notepad I believe, and then saved it as userChrome.css. It automatically added .txt, so I removed the extra suffix, and it asked me if I was sure I wanted to rename it .css, to which I said yes. When I look at the information on the file (screenshot attached), it still says it is a text file, but it is also a Firefox file and shows not other extension but .css. How do I change it from what it is to a ""genuine"" .css file, if that's the issue? Thanks. </p>",clivechafer,false,0,0

I went back and put the code you had given me into a new TextEdit doc and put this in chromeUser.css, and hey presto, it works! - sorta. What I had asked was whether I could change the background to a colour for unread messages. This has changed the colour of the type, and I still find it hard to distinguish between read and unread messages. My eye simply doesn't pick up the type colour any better than it did the boldface font, (which is partly because the size of font used in the message list is smaller than I would like). But now we have got the process sorted out, is there a different command I can put in the userChrome doc to change the fill colour rather than that of the type? If not, can I change the font size in the message list to make it bigger? Thanks again for all your help. </p>",clivechafer,false,0,0

Io non ti obbligo ad aiutarmi, se vuoi farlo, ti ringrazio e mi darai modo di continuare ad usare Thunderbird, altrimenti lo lascerò stare perché non funziona e non c'è verso di farlo funzionare per un utente medio che di lavoro fa altro.

Non so discernere fra quella che per te potrebbe essere un'informazione importante e quella che non lo è, quindi cerco di darti più informazioni possibili. Fatta questa necessaria premessa perché voglio essere gentile e voglio essere trattato con gentilezza, ti rispondo provando, come  mi chiedi tu a sintetizzare: 1 - se scarico la posta non succede niente i messaggi non entrano e rimane per qualche minuto la scritta in basso info@disilvestrogentile.it Controllo della funzionalità del server di posta 2- andando subito dopo in menu &gt; strumenti &gt; registro attività si apre una finestra (Registro attività) vuota </p><p>Ieri, seguendo il tuo consiglio sono andato su <a href=""https://forum.mozillaitalia.org/index.php?topic=77943.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forum.mozillaitalia.org/index.php?topic=77943.0</a> ed ho provato a riparare la casella posta in arrivo. Da allora la casella si è  svuotata, ma sempre solo su quel PC, dagli altri tutto funziona correttamente. Ho provato a disinstallare sia Mozilla , sia Mozilla Maintenance Service e reinstallare Thunderbird. Quando poi sono andato su scarica messaggi mi è comparso un messaggio di eccezione di sicurezza che ti allego, simile a quelli che mi aveva chiesto dalle altre postazioni prima di riprendere a funzionare.
