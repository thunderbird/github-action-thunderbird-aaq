I contacted Papamail support and they gave me instructions, but it still wouldn't connect, so they escalated it to an email specialist and will get back to me with a solution. In the mean time, I decided to move all 74,000 emails in the inbox in Thunderbird to a separate folder and that is taking a long time - like 5 hours to move 12,000 emails so far.  I was thinking that Thunderbird does get connected, I'll have a clean inbox for the downloading emails from my account at Papamail. Am I doing the right thing regarding being a new account? Thanks for you help. Regards, Brooks </p>",brooks3,false,0,0

So, if you're moving messages with Thunderbird, then you already have an account. Is this a POP account or IMAP? More details are needed in order to give a better response.
