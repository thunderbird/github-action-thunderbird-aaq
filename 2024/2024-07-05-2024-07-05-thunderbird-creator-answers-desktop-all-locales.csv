For many years I have ordered my emails by using subfolders, with a large one called 'Archives'. When another folder such as 'EE' becomes non-current I simply drag and drop it to the 'Archives' folder.  However now the archives folder is so large and irrelevant that when searching for emails, I get thousands of results from up to 15 years ago.  So, how can I archive emails so that they are easily accessible, but so they don't come up in an all encompassing ""All folders"" search? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",addyjustforregistering
