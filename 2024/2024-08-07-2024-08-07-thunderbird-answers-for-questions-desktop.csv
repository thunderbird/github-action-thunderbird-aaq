Only html, txt and picture files are allowed."" </p><pre> My digital knowledge is minimal; I find that often times folks such as yourself presume you are speaking with folks whose experience is somewhere near yours, and that is not so in this instance.  Finally, fed up with the issue I went to the settings page of Thunderbird. In a box on the settings page was a &gt;Signature text&lt; section. Below it was &gt;Attach the signature from a file instead (text, HTML, or image): with a file link that we did not enter, to wit &gt; C:\Users\dchrn\OneDrive\Pictures\ControlCenter4\Scan\Bipap Compliance 11.8.22 - 12.7.22.pdf </pre> <p>The box next to that file reference was checked.
