My current email is via my ISP who have outsourced their email to Gmail - I am using IMAP. This setup is in Outlook 2007 on my old PC. I have setup Thunderbird to obtain all of my current email from the IMAP server at Gmail. This went successfully. </p><p>I now wish to move all of my off-line stored emails from this old Outlook installation and also my calendar. When I started the import process on Thunderbird and selected Outlook as a source all I really wanted to do was to find out what Thunderbird would ask for in the way of files containing my data. But, as per other postings that I have found on this site it came up with the ""No profile found"" .  </p><p>However Outlook is NOT installed on the Windows 11 computer and nor have I created any pst files or any other files and moved them to the Windows 11 PC. So the 32bit vs 64bit answer does not yet apply to my situation. </p><p>So what process should I follow to move my data from the old Outlook 32bit installation on my old Windows 10 PC to the new Thunderbird 64bit setup? </p><p>Thanks for any advice </p>",install-and-update;,thunderbird,install-and-update,en-US,"",paul89895
