My current email is via my ISP who have outsourced their email to Gmail - I am using IMAP. This setup is in Outlook 2007 on my old PC.

This went successfully. </p><p>I now wish to move all of my off-line stored emails from this old Outlook installation and also my calendar. When I started the import process on Thunderbird and selected Outlook as a source all I really wanted to do was to find out what Thunderbird would ask for in the way of files containing my data. But, as per other postings that I have found on this site it came up with the ""No profile found"" .  </p><p>However Outlook is NOT installed on the Windows 11 computer and nor have I created any pst files or any other files and moved them to the Windows 11 PC. So the 32bit vs 64bit answer does not yet apply to my situation. </p><p>So what process should I follow to move my data from the old Outlook 32bit installation on my old Windows 10 PC to the new Thunderbird 64bit setup? </p><p>Thanks for any advice </p>",install-and-update;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",paul89895

Eventually I elected to uninstall TB and rename the folder under users/user/appdata/roaming/...etc. Basically start fresh. This is my boss's TB and he has had all sorts of issues since switching from POP3 to imap. It was working fine for a few days, then he got that original message about the possible impersonating server. Anyways, so I started fresh and got it all re-setup and it was working again. Inbound came in and sent went out no problem. Then TB updated to the more recent version 128 and then a new error occurred. First, "" Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent."" So I chose not to save because it was just a test email. Then I doubled checked everything (nothing looked wrong) and I tried a new test email immediately after and another new error came up. ""Sending of the message failed. Unable to communicate securely with peer: requested domain name does not match the server's certificate. The configuration related to must be corrected."" I have tried getting and exception but it says that I don't need one. The certificate seems fine, though I only know enough about the certificates to be dangerous.  </p><p>One more problem is I cannot get all of the old local folders onto TB as they were before. I know where the file is, however, TB will not import it, nor can I just move the folder into the mail/local folders folder in the profile. I was hoping that would fix it, but it indeed did not. This problem I know is unrelated to the connection issues, but it is an issue needing resolved that I have not found a solution for on the TB help site yet.  </p><p>Thank you in advance to whomever can help in these matters.

I am very frustrated by the result. </p><p>Downloaded and started new Thunderbird, and I have several questions: </p><p>This is a serious inquiry; I am desperate for information &amp; help. </p><p>1. What happened to my address book? How can I get it back? A hundred or more addresses just disappeared. </p><p>2. What happened to all of my saved messages? How can I get them back? I used to have a neatly organized file of saved messages. If I was still using Tbird for my business, I would be looking for a lawyer. As it is, I am simply looking for something as useful as the old Tbird. </p><p>3. How can I save a message to a specific category or off line file? I used to have several hundred categorized files in my data base for saved messages. </p><p>4. Why does my effort to use a help request not respond to my mouse clicks? It seems to always want more donations. </p><p>5. Can I go back to the old version? It was easier to use and more straightforward. </p><p>6. What am I missing in this ""new and improved"" version? Is there another email application that would give me the nice features of the old Thunderbird? </p><p>7. Can I revert back to the old Tbird and recover the extensive lost addresses and saved messages? </p><p>8. If I decide the ""new and improved"" Tbird will not provide the features the old one did, how can I get a refund of my contribution? </p><p>Your early response will be appreciated. </p><p>Jon Wilson, </p>",install-and-update;needsinfo;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1667561;,jonswilson

I use IMAP and I have multiple accounts in my Thunderbird configuration.  I have Google Workspace for our business which I can received and read email by IMAP, but I cannot send.  I also have a personal Gmail account and that can send and receive. </p><p>Yesterday Google experienced a global outage and as best I can tell it has somehow screwed up the OAuth2 Session / Tokens for some Thunderbird clients.  Over on Reddit there are other users reporting the issue and it appears to be a bigger issue on  Workspace accounts.  It does not affect the entire Workspace domain.  In our business, I have other users who are on Thunderbird and can still send/receive email on the same Workspace hosted domain that I am having issues with. </p><p>I have gone into Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Saved Passwords and removed the entries for the account that I'm having problems with.  That did cause Thunderbird to spawn the browser window to Google to carry through with OAuth2 token approval.  That got me back into receiving email, but I still can't send via SMTP. </p><p>When trying to send I get the following dialog, but clicking Enter New Password just does nothing and the Dialog just reloads again.  I attempted to add a new SMTP Server in Thunderbird, but that never prompts a new OAuth2 dialog for that new server and same Dialog box appears. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1667458;1667476;1667494;1667505;1667662;1667671;1667829;1667861;1667892;1667894;,spacemanspiff
