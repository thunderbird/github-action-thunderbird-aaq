This went successfully. </p><p>I now wish to move all of my off-line stored emails from this old Outlook installation and also my calendar. When I started the import process on Thunderbird and selected Outlook as a source all I really wanted to do was to find out what Thunderbird would ask for in the way of files containing my data. But, as per other postings that I have found on this site it came up with the ""No profile found"" .  </p><p>However Outlook is NOT installed on the Windows 11 computer and nor have I created any pst files or any other files and moved them to the Windows 11 PC. So the 32bit vs 64bit answer does not yet apply to my situation. </p><p>So what process should I follow to move my data from the old Outlook 32bit installation on my old Windows 10 PC to the new Thunderbird 64bit setup? </p><p>Thanks for any advice </p>",install-and-update;,thunderbird,install-and-update,en-US,"",paul89895

Someone could be trying to impersonate the server and you should not..."" I tried to make everything right on the settings for both smpt and the imap server settings. Nothing fixed it. Eventually I elected to uninstall TB and rename the folder under users/user/appdata/roaming/...etc. Basically start fresh. This is my boss's TB and he has had all sorts of issues since switching from POP3 to imap. It was working fine for a few days, then he got that original message about the possible impersonating server. Anyways, so I started fresh and got it all re-setup and it was working again. Inbound came in and sent went out no problem. Then TB updated to the more recent version 128 and then a new error occurred. First, "" Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent."" So I chose not to save because it was just a test email. Then I doubled checked everything (nothing looked wrong) and I tried a new test email immediately after and another new error came up. ""Sending of the message failed. Unable to communicate securely with peer: requested domain name does not match the server's certificate. The configuration related to must be corrected."" I have tried getting and exception but it says that I don't need one. The certificate seems fine, though I only know enough about the certificates to be dangerous.  </p><p>One more problem is I cannot get all of the old local folders onto TB as they were before. I know where the file is, however, TB will not import it, nor can I just move the folder into the mail/local folders folder in the profile. I was hoping that would fix it, but it indeed did not. This problem I know is unrelated to the connection issues, but it is an issue needing resolved that I have not found a solution for on the TB help site yet.  </p><p>Thank you in advance to whomever can help in these matters.
