This went successfully. </p><p>I now wish to move all of my off-line stored emails from this old Outlook installation and also my calendar.

But, as per other postings that I have found on this site it came up with the ""No profile found"" .  </p><p>However Outlook is NOT installed on the Windows 11 computer and nor have I created any pst files or any other files and moved them to the Windows 11 PC.

A couple of days ago, my granny account started getting the attached message. It's the only gmail account that gets this. All of the settings are exactly the same for all accounts. I tried sending a test text from one of my other accounts - twice. They finally came in about 10 minutes later, so apparently messages CAN get to the account eventually. However, when I try to get all messages - or even just for this account - I get the attached message. This has been going on for at least 2 days. I can sign in just fine to this account if I sign in through my computer and go to the account online.  Also, if I try to SEND an email from this account through Thunderbird, I get the message that the login failed and to enter a new password. When I click to enter a new password, the email goes through without any further action by me. I get the same message when hitting reply to the test message that finally was delivered. I'm at my wits end! Please help!! Thank you!!! </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",granny48
