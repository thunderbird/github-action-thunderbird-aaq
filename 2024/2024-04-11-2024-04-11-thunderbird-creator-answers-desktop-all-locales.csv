So far I've created a new profile on a the new computer's G: drive and the program is also installed in a different folder on the G: Drive.  (I'm planning to have two copies of Thunderbird on the computer).   The other copy for different mailboxes will be on the C: Drive.   I copied the profile from the old computer to the new computer's G: Drive in a separate location.   When I open Thunderbird it lists all my email accounts in the moved profile but when I go into the inboxes they are all blank.   I noticed if I left click on the inbox and go to properties it's showing the inbox location as the F: drive (which is where it was on the old computer)  for example mailbox:///F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/.........  I don't see a way to edit the inbox location.   How can I change that so it's looking for the mailboxes on the G: Drive instead of the F: Drive?  The path is also a little different between the two computers.   The old computer was: F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/........   and the new computer is  G:/Thunderbird Data/Profiles/......... </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p><br> Also I don't know if this makes any difference...On the old computer a 32 bit version of Thunderbird was running even though it is a 64 bit computer.    The new computer is running the 64 bit version.  They are both updated to the latest Thunderbird release.   </p><p>Thanks </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1646798;,junkmmc

Took me a bit to get used to the new look-and-feel, but I do like it. Just noticed a change in how the compacting looks. With my old version, each time I did the compacting, I could see the progress down on the status toolbar, where it showed each folder as it was compacted on the left side and on the right side, a progress bar.  I'm not seeing that now.  In fact, I don't see any indication of the compacting progress at all. Am I missing something obvious? Thank you </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",johnmsch

Clicking next takes you to a new screen that reads ""Google 400, the server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should not be retried.

Closing the main window doesn't help (or any other open window for that matter). I can still type and some of the buttons still work (tested Save and Send) but I can't edit recipients and I can't close the window (attempting to closes other open windows instead). </p><p>Things that were recommended elsewhere and that I tried to no avail: - clearing the cache - updating thunderbird and my system (already up to date) - moving the window to another workspace/closing all other open windows - restarting (duh) </p><p>I think this problem is with Thunderbird because I don't experience focusing issues with other programs. </p><p>I am also happy to provide additional info if someone wants to write an actual bug report.
