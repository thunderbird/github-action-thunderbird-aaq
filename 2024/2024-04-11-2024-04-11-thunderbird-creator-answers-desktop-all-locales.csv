So far I've created a new profile on a the new computer's G: drive and the program is also installed in a different folder on the G: Drive.  (I'm planning to have two copies of Thunderbird on the computer).   The other copy for different mailboxes will be on the C: Drive.   I copied the profile from the old computer to the new computer's G: Drive in a separate location.   When I open Thunderbird it lists all my email accounts in the moved profile but when I go into the inboxes they are all blank.   I noticed if I left click on the inbox and go to properties it's showing the inbox location as the F: drive (which is where it was on the old computer)  for example mailbox:///F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/.........  I don't see a way to edit the inbox location.   How can I change that so it's looking for the mailboxes on the G: Drive instead of the F: Drive?  The path is also a little different between the two computers.   The old computer was: F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/........   and the new computer is  G:/Thunderbird Data/Profiles/......... </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p><br> Also I don't know if this makes any difference...On the old computer a 32 bit version of Thunderbird was running even though it is a 64 bit computer.    The new computer is running the 64 bit version.  They are both updated to the latest Thunderbird release.   </p><p>Thanks </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1646798;1646874;1646880;,junkmmc

I'm not seeing that now.  In fact, I don't see any indication of the compacting progress at all. Am I missing something obvious?

Yesterday, I accidentally clicked ""Run Filters on Folder"", and the actions for my filter rules ran on every folder in my account, <em>including my Archive folder</em>. I could not find a way to stop the action once it started, so hundreds of archived emails were pulled out of the Archive folder and repopulated into my two specified folders. In each of these specified folders, I had a handful of emails stored in order to be able to come back to them as reference or to deal with later; I remember what some of these emails were, but I don't necessarily remember all of them, and now they're mixed in with the hundreds of emails that were brought back from the archive. </p><p>So, I have two main questions: </p><p>1.

I have been forced by Rogers in Canada to migrate my internet service from their legacy internet service to Rogers Ignite with its Ignite (Comcast) gateway.  My email accounts were supposed to be migrated automatically, but, for reasons unknown, were not, and a tech support representative had to migrate them from the old legacy service to Ignite.  After that was done, I opened Thunderbird, and was asked to authenticate my 2 Rogers/Yahoo email accounts, one of which is my primary account, the other a secondary account.  I was asked to authenticate the secondary account first, which went well.  I then clicked on my primary account in the left-hand pane and was again asked to authenticate, but the dialogue box showed it was for the secondary account.  Thinking that this secondary account authentication was just being repeated for no particular reason, and not thinking that the email address in the authentication request box could be changed, I clicked Agree.  My primary account is now showing the exact same emails as are listed in the secondary account, and I'm extremely concerned that I will not be able to recover all of the thousands of emails in my primary account, many of which are business-related.  When I log into my primary account on the Rogers/Yahoo mail website, the emails in the primary account are still showing, so I know they are still on the Rogers IMAP server.  However, I really want to continue to use my primary account on Thunderbird.  I'm not sure if I should delete the primary account and recreate it - the Rogers support tech said that deleting the account may result in an issue where my current password for a re-created primary account may not be recognized, so I'm leaving things as they are until I hear back.  It the advice is to not delete and recreate the account, what steps can I take to recover the emails on my primary account in Thunderbird.
