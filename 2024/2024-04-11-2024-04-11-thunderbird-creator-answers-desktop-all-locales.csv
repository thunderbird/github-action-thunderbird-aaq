So far I've created a new profile on a the new computer's G: drive and the program is also installed in a different folder on the G: Drive.  (I'm planning to have two copies of Thunderbird on the computer).   The other copy for different mailboxes will be on the C: Drive.   I copied the profile from the old computer to the new computer's G: Drive in a separate location.   When I open Thunderbird it lists all my email accounts in the moved profile but when I go into the inboxes they are all blank.   I noticed if I left click on the inbox and go to properties it's showing the inbox location as the F: drive (which is where it was on the old computer)  for example mailbox:///F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/.........  I don't see a way to edit the inbox location.   How can I change that so it's looking for the mailboxes on the G: Drive instead of the F: Drive?  The path is also a little different between the two computers.   The old computer was: F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/........   and the new computer is  G:/Thunderbird Data/Profiles/......... </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p><br> Also I don't know if this makes any difference...On the old computer a 32 bit version of Thunderbird was running even though it is a 64 bit computer.

It’s free, (open source?), private, secure, feature rich, streamlined, and (of course) it’s Mozilla.  I would like to utilize this with my website and to eventually roll out the app version to my team.  I’m hoping to define rules to automate moving e-mails to specific folders and to automate flagging/painting specific e-mails, notes, tasks, and calendar events.  I suppose that it’s always easier to ask for things/stuff, but I hope that all of this makes enough sense to you that you were already working on plans for such a development/project.  Perhaps GitHub’s resources could ease the burden.  Who knows, perhaps you will add appointment setting and VoIP hosting to your software offerings.  (I have been looking for a feasible (freesible), private, and secure way to implement such resources in my website.  Also, I sincerely hope that Mozilla will partner with BlackBerry to do more big things. </p><p>I utilize Bluehost, Concrete CMS, osTicket, Elkarte, Church CMS, and PrestaShop.

As we try to help people to live more charitable, God-honoring, effective, efficient, informed, and resourceful lives from business to society to socializing to recreation to academia to health to procreation to philanthropy, we aim to tell others about Mozilla, BlackBerry, Apple, Linux, Microsoft, GitHub, and so on.  We aim to help connect the dots for small businesses to establish, to streamline, to network, to market, and to make our marketplace more of a success than a struggle in ways that don’t require choosing between beliefs and business (i.e., one’s way of life and how one makes a living). </p><p>Thanks for my soapbox moment.

I have been forced by Rogers in Canada to migrate my internet service from their legacy internet service to Rogers Ignite with its Ignite (Comcast) gateway.  My email accounts were supposed to be migrated automatically, but, for reasons unknown, were not, and a tech support representative had to migrate them from the old legacy service to Ignite.  After that was done, I opened Thunderbird, and was asked to authenticate my 2 Rogers/Yahoo email accounts, one of which is my primary account, the other a secondary account.  I was asked to authenticate the secondary account first, which went well.  I then clicked on my primary account in the left-hand pane and was again asked to authenticate, but the dialogue box showed it was for the secondary account.  Thinking that this secondary account authentication was just being repeated for no particular reason, and not thinking that the email address in the authentication request box could be changed, I clicked Agree.  My primary account is now showing the exact same emails as are listed in the secondary account, and I'm extremely concerned that I will not be able to recover all of the thousands of emails in my primary account, many of which are business-related.  When I log into my primary account on the Rogers/Yahoo mail website, the emails in the primary account are still showing, so I know they are still on the Rogers IMAP server.  However, I really want to continue to use my primary account on Thunderbird.  I'm not sure if I should delete the primary account and recreate it - the Rogers support tech said that deleting the account may result in an issue where my current password for a re-created primary account may not be recognized, so I'm leaving things as they are until I hear back.  It the advice is to not delete and recreate the account, what steps can I take to recover the emails on my primary account in Thunderbird.  Thanks in advance for any help and advice that can be provided.
