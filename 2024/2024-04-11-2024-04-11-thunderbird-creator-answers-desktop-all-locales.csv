So far I've created a new profile on a the new computer's G: drive and the program is also installed in a different folder on the G: Drive.  (I'm planning to have two copies of Thunderbird on the computer).   The other copy for different mailboxes will be on the C: Drive.   I copied the profile from the old computer to the new computer's G: Drive in a separate location.   When I open Thunderbird it lists all my email accounts in the moved profile but when I go into the inboxes they are all blank.   I noticed if I left click on the inbox and go to properties it's showing the inbox location as the F: drive (which is where it was on the old computer)  for example mailbox:///F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/.........  I don't see a way to edit the inbox location.   How can I change that so it's looking for the mailboxes on the G: Drive instead of the F: Drive?  The path is also a little different between the two computers.   The old computer was: F:/Thunderbird/Profiles/........   and the new computer is  G:/Thunderbird Data/Profiles/......... </p><p><br> Also I don't know if this makes any difference...On the old computer a 32 bit version of Thunderbird was running even though it is a 64 bit computer.    The new computer is running the 64 bit version.  They are both updated to the latest Thunderbird release.   </p><p>Thanks </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",junkmmc

Took me a bit to get used to the new look-and-feel, but I do like it. Just noticed a change in how the compacting looks. With my old version, each time I did the compacting, I could see the progress down on the status toolbar, where it showed each folder as it was compacted on the left side and on the right side, a progress bar.  I'm not seeing that now.  In fact, I don't see any indication of the compacting progress at all. Am I missing something obvious? Thank you </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",johnmsch
