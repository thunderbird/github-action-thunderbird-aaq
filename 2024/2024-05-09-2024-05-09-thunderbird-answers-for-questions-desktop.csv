The Bayesian spam filter does a remarkable job for most people and as it learns it get better.  But if you simply don't use it,  you will never know if it will do the job for you or not. </p><p>You have decided you ignore the automated learning response and are now looking for manual tools.  Tools that simply do not exist because the emphasis of filtering is on managing mail,  not managing spam.  There is another tool for that, in the Bayesian spam filter. If there are any resources available for enhanced spam filtering, it is in the algorithms used by the spam filter that they will be deployed. Not in filtering on font name or style name. </p><p>So no you can not filter on body formatting.  Nor any of the underlying HTML in the message body.  You can only filter on the content as displayed. </p><p>Yes there is a customize filter option.  It allows you to add additional message headers to be filtered on.  For example I have filters that use the yahoo junk header X-YahooFilteredBulk among other manual additions and a few from the filtaquilla addon. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filtaquilla/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filtaquilla/</a> </p><p>See below for my extended list of filter actions. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-05-10-22-56-37-a83a5f.png""> </p><p>None of that makes the message body source available as it is simply not in the data available to filters to act on.  Filters get access to the data stored in the MSF database files which load the user interface information,  not the message source. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

This spammer puts his subject lines is italics bold so they stand out easily...as spam. </p><p>2) The available spam filters didn't work well for me long before this question. Turned it on, and every message was marked junk. After hours of correcting, it was a royal waste of my time.  Glad it works for others but I made a choice based on experience, not arrogance or stupidity.  I also had my system in place from long before the built-in was provided, yet I still tried it out. </p><p>3) Meanwhile using my spam filters, nearly every spam is caught and importantly zero real messages. With very little effort on my part. </p><p>4) The put-down tone was not necessary. Good ideas come out of USER experiences. If it was easy to add checking formatting such as font, it'd be a great addition! Not just for spam, but real emails sometimes use formatting and could be sorted. </p><p>5) I didn't respond sooner because I spotted another feature and the problem is relatively solved. Every 'from' is ended in .time, .work or a few other non-existent "".word""s. So it's been easy to set up filters. </p><p>6) Only real problem is that I view my email in other clients (on my cell), before thunderbird's seen my email and filtered it.  But thunderbird's built-in wouldn't solve that either. </p><p>7) Thank you for the filtaquilla addon idea. That looks very interesting. I filter my regular messages too; maybe I'll find a use that way too. </p>",cheri3,false,0,0

I have included their response so you can see for yourself:- </p><p><em>""To help you with your concern about emails possibly being deleted from your Thunderbird inbox by Bitdefender, let's start by checking the Bitdefender scan log for any actions taken on email files. The scan log will provide us with details about any detected threats and the actions Bitdefender might have taken. </em> </p><p>Here's how you can check the Bitdefender scan log: </p><pre>   Open Bitdefender and click on ""Notifications"" in the menu on the left-hand side.    In the ""Critical"" tab, look for the latest Bitdefender scan event and expand it.    Click on ""View log"" to see the scan results, including any actions taken on email files. </pre> <p>Could you follow these steps and let me know if you find any entries related to deleted emails in the scan log? This information will help us proceed with the next steps to address your issue. </p><p>Additionally, please note that your computer is safe and clean of any malware since nothing was found in the BDSYS log you previously sent us. It is likely that this is a technical issue and if you don't find anything in the log result related to Bitdefender deleting all of your emails from Thunderbird, I recommend reinstalling the Thunderbird email client as the application itself might be the cause of these issues. </p><p>Please let me know how it goes. I am looking forward to hearing from you.""<em></em> </p>",peter838,false,0,0
