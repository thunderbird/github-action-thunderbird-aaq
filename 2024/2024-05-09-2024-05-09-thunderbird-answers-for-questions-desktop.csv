The price is free, although we survive only by user donations.  I believe you will lose that email address when the provider drops service and will need a different one. There are many alternatives available, with some free (such as <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> and <a href=""http://gmx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.com</a>), and fee-based (such as <a href=""http://fastmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">fastmail.com</a>).
