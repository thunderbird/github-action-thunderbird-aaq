The Bayesian spam filter does a remarkable job for most people and as it learns it get better.  But if you simply don't use it,  you will never know if it will do the job for you or not. </p><p>You have decided you ignore the automated learning response and are now looking for manual tools.  Tools that simply do not exist because the emphasis of filtering is on managing mail,  not managing spam.  There is another tool for that, in the Bayesian spam filter. If there are any resources available for enhanced spam filtering, it is in the algorithms used by the spam filter that they will be deployed. Not in filtering on font name or style name. </p><p>So no you can not filter on body formatting.  Nor any of the underlying HTML in the message body.  You can only filter on the content as displayed. </p><p>Yes there is a customize filter option.  It allows you to add additional message headers to be filtered on.  For example I have filters that use the yahoo junk header X-YahooFilteredBulk among other manual additions and a few from the filtaquilla addon. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filtaquilla/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filtaquilla/</a> </p><p>See below for my extended list of filter actions. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-05-10-22-56-37-a83a5f.png""> </p><p>None of that makes the message body source available as it is simply not in the data available to filters to act on.  Filters get access to the data stored in the MSF database files which load the user interface information,  not the message source. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

To reinstall Thunderbird, begin by backing up your profile data, which includes your emails, settings, and accounts. Uninstall Thunderbird through your system's control panel or settings menu <a href=""https://buyozempiconlineuk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://buyozempiconlineuk.org/</a>. Once uninstalled, download the latest version of Thunderbird from the official website and follow the installation instructions. After reinstalling, restore your profile data to regain access to your previous emails and settings. This process can help ensure a fresh start and potentially fix persistent issues, providing a smoother and more reliable email experience. </p>",kerolenalena,true,0,0

If I could delete the old account maybe it would solve the other problem. Note that both the email address, name and password are the same for both accounts, only the server address is different (and the port nubers maybe as well). And could the second problem be to do with the security settings of my browser or os? (brave browser, linux zorin os).  Sorry rather a long post! Hope someone can help me!

I think you've got me part way there but not quite, as when I get into my home folder I'm finding a slightly different scene and so I'm still a bit lost. In the .thunderbird folder there's 2 default folders and 2 default-release folders  (see first screenshot - sorry can't see a way of embedding the image). The one starting 32b8... (second screenshot) has one prefs.js in it (and also various other folders one of which (ImapMail) references both mail.mail emails and <a href=""http://iomartcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">iomartcloud.com</a> emails).  The one starting edyq.... just contains one file - times.json The default-release folders each have one prefs.js file in them amongst many other things. However no single folder has more than one prefs.js file in it. The three prefs.js files I've found all have different content but I can't find anything in them to identify which one relates to which profile. </p><p>Finally I don't have any antivirus on this os just a basic firewall. Is there any other way I could remove the cause of my profile generating multiple copies of the settings file? </p><p>Cheers Justin </p>",acuteoakdecline,false,0,0
