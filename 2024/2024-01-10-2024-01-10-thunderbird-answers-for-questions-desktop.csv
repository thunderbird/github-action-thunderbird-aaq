For example, popstate.dat is a file that keeps track of the last downloaded POP message. If you encounter older POP messages being downloaded, that is a sign that the popstat.dat file is corrupted or missing. Possibly, if you post a screenshot of your profile folder, plus your Mail folder, someone here may have suggestions to help clean up your profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It's an access token that's issued to Thunderbird as a result of the Oauth2 authentication process. If you try to use this token to sign in to your Hotmail account via a browser, it won't work. Likewise, your Hotmail password won't work with OAuth2 authentication in Thunderbird, or any other email client that supports OAuth2 (modern) authentication. Thunderbird has no facility or capability to change your Microsoft account password. All major email service providers are moving to modern authentication methods (e.g OAuth2) away from the old legacy basic authentication methods that used to insecurely transmit your account password. </p><p>So, let Thunderbird save that token in its password vault and leave it be. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0
