For example, popstate.dat is a file that keeps track of the last downloaded POP message. If you encounter older POP messages being downloaded, that is a sign that the popstat.dat file is corrupted or missing. Possibly, if you post a screenshot of your profile folder, plus your Mail folder, someone here may have suggestions to help clean up your profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My suggestion is to not attempt to customize it until you are more familiar with the features. For example, rightclick on the new unified tool bar and an extensive set of options appear that can be assigned there. If there are menus that you are having trouble locating, please just ask. CSS customizations are not supported and there was extensive new code and replacement of old code in 115, so CSS that worked in 102 may not work in 115. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It's an access token that's issued to Thunderbird as a result of the Oauth2 authentication process. If you try to use this token to sign in to your Hotmail account via a browser, it won't work. Likewise, your Hotmail password won't work with OAuth2 authentication in Thunderbird, or any other email client that supports OAuth2 (modern) authentication. Thunderbird has no facility or capability to change your Microsoft account password. All major email service providers are moving to modern authentication methods (e.g OAuth2) away from the old legacy basic authentication methods that used to insecurely transmit your account password. </p><p>So, let Thunderbird save that token in its password vault and leave it be. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

My installations of Thunderbird 115.6.1 on multiple PCs are not facing this issue, so we can rule out a bug in the product's core code. Can you recall what transpired right before this started happening, say a Thunderbird upgrade? Create a new Thunderbird profile and see if this persists.

I don't recommend it, as you're forcing your font on recipients. One-time changes can be done in compose window or for all messages from settings&gt;composition.
