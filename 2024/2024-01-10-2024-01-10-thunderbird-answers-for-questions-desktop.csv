It's an access token that's issued to Thunderbird as a result of the Oauth2 authentication process. If you try to use this token to sign in to your Hotmail account via a browser, it won't work. Likewise, your Hotmail password won't work with OAuth2 authentication in Thunderbird, or any other email client that supports OAuth2 (modern) authentication. Thunderbird has no facility or capability to change your Microsoft account password. All major email service providers are moving to modern authentication methods (e.g OAuth2) away from the old legacy basic authentication methods that used to insecurely transmit your account password. </p><p>So, let Thunderbird save that token in its password vault and leave it be. </p>",stancestans,false,1,0

You are using the portable product that has a wrapper that fools the program into thinking it is installed and certain folders are not where they are in reality.  The portable version has it's own issues on occasion and no one here supports it because it is not the <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> product.  It is mostly the same,  but once you get to oddities all bets are off as to the source of the issue. </p><p>This link is to what they claim are the modifications to the base product them make <a href=""https://portableapps.com/support/thunderbird_portable#modifications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com/support/thunderbird_portable#modifications</a> </p><p>They also have their own support for Thunderbird here. <a href=""https://portableapps.com/forums/support/thunderbird_portable"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com/forums/support/thunderbird_portable</a> </p><p>It may also be you have a corrupt file.  Traditionally the cache of folders is stored in the foldertree.json file and today when I checked I also now have a foldercache.json file.  I would suggest you delete both of those with Thunderbird not running and allow the folder pane to simply rebuild itself. </p><p>As the issue is in the unified folders,  you can delete the ""smart folders"" folder from the mail directory in your profile folder.  This will force a complete rebuild of the unified folders </p><p>I am making these suggestions as data corrupt is quite often present in USB drives when the application that is writing to them closes and the drive is removed before all writes are completed. As Thunderbird continues to run (some time for minutes) after all windows have been pulled down  it is particularly susceptible to early disconnection of the drive. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

They are still the primary failure point in email connections.  Generally I recommend disabling all mail scanning to test if that might be an issue,  and even all scanning for a time to test that.  Basically antivirus programs tend to use hacking to do their scanning and this extends to untrusted self signed certificates.  So using unencrypted connection setting will reduce your security,  but eliminate this certificate issue.  You might try it an see if that helps. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In such cases, Thunderbird creates a new profile, but it does not delete the old one. So, if you browse in the area of c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles, you may see the older profile, complete with your accounts and folders. If the profile isn't corrupted you can recover it. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Otro motivo es que el Router/Firewall o Gateway este manteniendo las conexiones con el anterior Thunderbird, logico si ambos Thunderbird estan en el misma red, este problema es muy raro pero puedes probar reiniciando el Router </p><p>Saludos </p>",pcp04,false,0,0
