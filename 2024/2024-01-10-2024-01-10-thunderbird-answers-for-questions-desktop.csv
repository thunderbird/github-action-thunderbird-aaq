Likewise, your Hotmail password won't work with OAuth2 authentication in Thunderbird, or any other email client that supports OAuth2 (modern) authentication. Thunderbird has no facility or capability to change your Microsoft account password.

Steps are as follows: </p> <ol><li><strong>Right-click</strong> your Hotmail account in Thunderbird's <em>Folder Pane</em> (left pane) then select <strong>Settings</strong>. This will open the <strong>Account Settings</strong> tab, with your Hotmail account highlighted on the left pane. On the main pane, you should various settings for your account, such as the <em>Account Name, Default Identity</em> etc. </li><li>Scroll to the bottom of the main pane and click the <strong>Edit SMTP Server</strong> button. </li><li>In the <em>SMTP Server</em> dialog box that opens, under the <strong>Security and Authentication</strong> heading, click the drop-down field next to <strong>Authentication method</strong> and select <strong>OAuth2</strong>. This changes settings for your account's outgoing (SMTP) server. Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the dialog box and return to the Account Settings tab. </li><li>On the left pane of the Account Settings tab, immediately below your Hotmail account, click on <strong>Server Settings</strong>. Your current incoming server settings will appear on the main pane. </li><li>Under the <strong>Security Settings</strong> heading, next to Authentication method, click the drop-down field that currently has ""Normal Password"" and select ""OAuth2"" instead. This changes the Authentication Method for the incoming server (IMAP or POP). </li><li>Close the Acocunt Settings tab, <strong>Quit </strong>Thunderbird <strong>via its menu</strong> then relaunch it.  </li></ol> <p>When Thunderbird opens, it will attemp to sign in and fetch messages from your Hotmail account. Instead of the old ""enter password"" prompt, a browser window will open asking you to sign in to your Hotmail account. This is part of the OAuth2 authentication process. Sign in like you normally would in a browser, then proceed with the prompt to allow/authorize Thunderbird to connect to your Hotmail account. You will get a similar prompt when you send a message from your Hotmail account in Thunderbird. </p><p>These steps are confirmed to work on Thunderbird version 115. If you are not on version 115 yet, they may not work as is. </p>",stancestans,false,0,1

You are using the portable product that has a wrapper that fools the program into thinking it is installed and certain folders are not where they are in reality.  The portable version has it's own issues on occasion and no one here supports it because it is not the <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> product.  It is mostly the same,  but once you get to oddities all bets are off as to the source of the issue. </p><p>This link is to what they claim are the modifications to the base product them make <a href=""https://portableapps.com/support/thunderbird_portable#modifications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com/support/thunderbird_portable#modifications</a> </p><p>They also have their own support for Thunderbird here. <a href=""https://portableapps.com/forums/support/thunderbird_portable"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com/forums/support/thunderbird_portable</a> </p><p>It may also be you have a corrupt file.  Traditionally the cache of folders is stored in the foldertree.json file and today when I checked I also now have a foldercache.json file.  I would suggest you delete both of those with Thunderbird not running and allow the folder pane to simply rebuild itself. </p><p>As the issue is in the unified folders,  you can delete the ""smart folders"" folder from the mail directory in your profile folder.  This will force a complete rebuild of the unified folders </p><p>I am making these suggestions as data corrupt is quite often present in USB drives when the application that is writing to them closes and the drive is removed before all writes are completed.

For clarity, my first suggestion is to edit the Description field for each with the email id it is for. That eliminates ambiguity. With two the same name, it is impossible to know which one is attached to an account. After changing all the description fields, go through each account pane to verify/adjust that it is pointing to correct SMTP server. You also show the respence2 account set to use port 587 and STARTTLS. Those are output settings. Change to port 993 and SSL/TLS and it should work. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

They are still the primary failure point in email connections.  Generally I recommend disabling all mail scanning to test if that might be an issue,  and even all scanning for a time to test that.  Basically antivirus programs tend to use hacking to do their scanning and this extends to untrusted self signed certificates.  So using unencrypted connection setting will reduce your security,  but eliminate this certificate issue.  You might try it an see if that helps. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In such cases, Thunderbird creates a new profile, but it does not delete the old one.
