Thunderbird composing is designed in such a way that it should be able to be read by various OS and by people with various reading requirements and set up. Not everyone has the same fonts nor uses the same font sizes. So keeping it simple is actually a massive benefit. Believe it or not, the email you compose will look different on other peoples screens. Most of the code Microsoft insert into emails is just bloat and alot of it cannot be read by anything that's not Microsoft. It may look good to the composer using Outlook, but that doesn't mean the recipient is seeing the same. </p><p>Check settings and let us know what you are currently set up to use. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Scroll to bottom </li><li> Click on 'Config Editor' </li><li> In top search type: wrap </li><li> Post an image showing what you see. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If you don't understand the problem, it will be impossible to get some tips for the investigations. . .  Sorry for the wrong description... I'll try to explain it better: The weird behaviour is that the e-mails loaded into the local Thunderbird installation are deleted from the server area, without any manual action of the receiver.  The right way should be ""loading messages"" only and ""deleting it only when the receiver deletes it manually from the the local inbox"".  The automatic deletion of e-mails from the server area is a possible settings of the POP communication. But the settings are defined with IMAP link.  It that more clear in this way?

The normal setting is to download the message and automatically delete from server. That appears to be what you are experiencing. If you do not want the messages deleted, you can adjust the setting at the account's server setting to keep on server until deleted. You should also review the 'disk space' setting. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My suggestion is to create filters for the major spammers, as that causes the detritus to be destroyed as it comes in, minimizing the need for massive deletes. My personal preference is the separate product, mailwasher, which is free for one account. I start it first thing in the morning and it deletes spammers immediately and I can add to the list of known spammers and know it's a one-time thing to do. But filters do the same thing; just set them up for the main ones, and life gets better. this also lets you delete them, not just move to trash. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
