Possibly knowing more about your settings may prove helpful. Word wrap is the default, so I'm surprised that it isn't working for you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you don't understand the problem, it will be impossible to get some tips for the investigations. . .  Sorry for the wrong description... I'll try to explain it better: The weird behaviour is that the e-mails loaded into the local Thunderbird installation are deleted from the server area, without any manual action of the receiver.  The right way should be ""loading messages"" only and ""deleting it only when the receiver deletes it manually from the the local inbox"".  The automatic deletion of e-mails from the server area is a possible settings of the POP communication. But the settings are defined with IMAP link.  It that more clear in this way?  Best regards,  Bernard </p>",Bernye00,false,0,0

The normal setting is to download the message and automatically delete from server. That appears to be what you are experiencing. If you do not want the messages deleted, you can adjust the setting at the account's server setting to keep on server until deleted. You should also review the 'disk space' setting. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

However, in using any software product, the user needs to take ownership of any data that may be affected. My suggestion is to do a profile backup periodically and always before a major update. Most errors of substance occur when anti-virus software interrupts Thunderbird updates. Managing one's anti-virus software is an important aspect. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
