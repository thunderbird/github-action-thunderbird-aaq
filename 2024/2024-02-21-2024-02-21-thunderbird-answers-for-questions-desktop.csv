Thunderbird composing is designed in such a way that it should be able to be read by various OS and by people with various reading requirements and set up. Not everyone has the same fonts nor uses the same font sizes. So keeping it simple is actually a massive benefit. Believe it or not, the email you compose will look different on other peoples screens. Most of the code Microsoft insert into emails is just bloat and alot of it cannot be read by anything that's not Microsoft.

If you don't understand the problem, it will be impossible to get some tips for the investigations. . .  Sorry for the wrong description... I'll try to explain it better: The weird behaviour is that the e-mails loaded into the local Thunderbird installation are deleted from the server area, without any manual action of the receiver.  The right way should be ""loading messages"" only and ""deleting it only when the receiver deletes it manually from the the local inbox"".  The automatic deletion of e-mails from the server area is a possible settings of the POP communication. But the settings are defined with IMAP link.  It that more clear in this way?

I start it first thing in the morning and it deletes spammers immediately and I can add to the list of known spammers and know it's a one-time thing to do.

It's all corrupted when I open them. Okay, learned to live with it. </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately Eudora was quite content with a garbage store.  It was robust in it;s error handling of corrupt emails and generally just ""coped"".  Makes it hard to import them though as the old computer adage of garbage in garbage out still applied. </p><p>This <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Importing_from_Eudora_-_Thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a>,  which is nearly as venerable as Eudora offers pointers for importing Eudora to Thunderbird.  The Eudora rescue utility was invaluable in fixing the mess Eudora was able to function in for many so their data could be imported.  Personally I also think using Thunderbird V3 to import Eudora is perhaps the cleanest way to import to Thunderbird as that is the build that Eudora OSE was using with it's Penelope addon to claim to be Eudora OSE. So anyone moving to OSE needed to use that import to get their Eudora into Thunderbird. </p> <blockquote> Then recently I had to change drive number on some of my hard disks. When I rebooted Thunderbird was empty as if I just had installed it. </blockquote> <p>I would suggest simply reverting the drive change until you got your Thunderbird house in order.  But that is obviously not a choice. </p> <blockquote> I know one way to solve it is to go through the pain of re-configuring everything from scratch and locate the old mail folders, and tweak the program as I want it, etc.  </blockquote> <p>Or you could manually edit the profiles.ini file to show the new drive letter to the profile folder.  That is fairly straightforward change of a single character,  but I would guess from subsequent reading you have changed the local directories on some of your account and I can not help you undo that.  You just have to reverse what you have done. </p><p>The profile.ini file is stored in the hidden appdata roaming folder on windows. Open the file manager/explorer and type %appdata%\Thunderbird into the address/location bar and press enter once you have removed what was already there. Open the profiles.ini file in a text editor (notepad will do, but not a word processor) Make the relevant drive letter change,  save the file and exit. All done. </p> <blockquote> But... is it not possible to edit the registry by only changing the drive letter so that it becomes exactly like before? </blockquote> <p>Of course it is possible,  but not by messing in the registry.  Thunderbird is a multi platform application and neither Linux nor Apple have a registry.  So Thunderbird does not use it except to integrate operating system functions like default mail client. </p> <blockquote> Without messing with the registry, is there somewhere I can change the location of where it reads the data to know the configurations, mail setting, mail folders, etc, so that it becomes like before? </blockquote> <p>See my earlier comments about using notepad. </p> <blockquote> I use Windows 7 by the way (yes I know, but I'm tweaking and maintaining it with stuff like Optach, it works like a charm). </blockquote> <p>Windows 3.1 is much faster and boots in mere seconds. My son installed in on DOS 6 just recently and it was fun to play with.  It functions as it always did and can now crash faster than ever. It also still asks if it is OK that it crashed and lost all my data that I can still see on the screen.  It is also a security nightmare that is fundamentally broken when it comes to encrypted connections because the world has moved on.  I learned to love windows 7 in the day.  But it's day is gone. I upgraded to Widnows 11 not because I wanted to,  but Microsoft is not putting any effort of to older versions.  This (version 115 ESR) is also the last major version of any Mozilla platform based products that will run on Windows 7. So either find a new email client that supports your chosen platform going forward, or start planning an upgrade. </p> <blockquote> I'm getting desperate as there's important emails pending, so I defer to the online oracle! </blockquote> <p><strong>Note </strong>that the profiles ini file is a standard windows layout INI file with a separate block for each profile the prfile manager knows about.  An example from mine is below.  You should only need to edit the actual drive letter,  but by now the path might be anywhere and more importantly the IsRelative  mus be set to 0 (Zero).  This indicates of the path given in the Path line is relative to the location of the profiles.ini file and in programming 0 is False </p><pre>[Profile12] Name=Hasbro IsRelative=0 Path=D:\TBIRD\Profiles\k6iwodna.default </pre> <p>Fundamentally if you are using USB drives to store your profile use the portable version of Thunderbird from portable apps because the actual drive letters issued by Windows are really a lottery.  I do not recommend using Thunderbird on removable media at all.  But in the end it is your choice. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
