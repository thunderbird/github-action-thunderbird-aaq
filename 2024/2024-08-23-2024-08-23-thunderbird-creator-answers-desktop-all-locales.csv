I use POP3 so all my emails are downloaded to my computer. I keep two years of incoming and sent emails in Local Folders as follows: email account 1 year 2023 &gt; Folders and subfolders organized per topic year 2022 &gt; Folders and subfolders organized per topic The same for three other accounts. These occupy a lot of disk space, so I want to archive each email account with its folders and subfolders and move them to an external drive. Is this possible with Thunderbird?
