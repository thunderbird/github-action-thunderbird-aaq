I use POP3 so all my emails are downloaded to my computer. I keep two years of incoming and sent emails in Local Folders as follows: email account 1 year 2023 &gt; Folders and subfolders organized per topic year 2022 &gt; Folders and subfolders organized per topic The same for three other accounts. These occupy a lot of disk space, so I want to archive each email account with its folders and subfolders and move them to an external drive. Is this possible with Thunderbird?

Ho impostato l'account di posta elettronica con IMAP e scaricato tutti i messaggi presenti nel server. Ho impostato la sincronizzazione in modo da lasciare una copia dei messaggi sul server quando li scarico su Thinderbird. Ora per√≤, ho bisogno che la sincronizzazione mi consenta di lasciare i messaggi su Thunderbird quando li cancello dal server (ci sono molti messaggi vecchi che voglio conservare nel mio hard disc, ma che mi occupano troppo spazio nel server), mentre, invece va bene che vengano cancellati anche nel server se li cancello da Thunderbird. Come posso fare? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,it,1670012;,leogioffre

I am a New York Times digital subscriber.  As such I am allowed to gift a certain number of articles each month.  Today when I tried to do that I was given a choice of paths for sending articles, Gmail and a few more with an option for other.  But I don't know what to tell the New York Times as to how I want to be hooked to Thunderbird as the vehicle for gifting my allotted articles to others.  Can someone help?

I save this in Thunderbird 3) I then get a new message from (email@x) which asks me again to send the information in my previous email.

I then want to attach the email which I sent previously in 2). </p><p>I cannot click on attach and select the email sent in 2) (which is saved in Thunderbird).
