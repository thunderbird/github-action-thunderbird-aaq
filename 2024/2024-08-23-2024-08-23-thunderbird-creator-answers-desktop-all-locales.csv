Ora però, ho bisogno che la sincronizzazione mi consenta di lasciare i messaggi su Thunderbird quando li cancello dal server (ci sono molti messaggi vecchi che voglio conservare nel mio hard disc, ma che mi occupano troppo spazio nel server), mentre, invece va bene che vengano cancellati anche nel server se li cancello da Thunderbird.
