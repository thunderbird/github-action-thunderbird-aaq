This happens maybe once a week or so, and it can take a few hours for me to notice, because it simply looks as if no new emails would be coming in - which is perfectly possible. But then someone tells me they sent me an email two hours ago, or I shut down the computer, and when I reboot it later, several emails I retrieved that should have been in my inbox much earlier. Once I notice the malfunction, closing Thunderbird and launching it again will fix the problem. But I'm a freelancer, I could miss important emails or job offers, so I need my email client to be reliable. Is this a known issue? Any idea what I could do? </p><p>I have Windows 10, by the way. </p><p>Thanks </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1670242;1670253;1670261;1670321;,wallcityrocker
