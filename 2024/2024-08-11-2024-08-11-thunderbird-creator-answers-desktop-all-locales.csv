Since their decision is final, Mozilla Thunderbird must adapt by changing the email programming before August 24th. </p><p>So, Mozilla, what are you going to do and why has this been kept quiet?  <strong>It seems that Microsoft will still cooperate but forget Google. </strong> </p><p>Andy </p>",install-and-update;,thunderbird,install-and-update,en-US,1667692;1667695;,adbeng

The layout is unlike anything I've seen before and I can't find a way to restore the layout I am used to and greatly prefer. Most obviously there are no column headers and no separate ""From"" column. I have seen several references to similar problems and a couple of them referred to ""card view"" vs. ""table view,"" but I see no reference to those settings anywhere in my installation and the pages mentioning them do not seem to be describing TB for Mac.  </p><p>This problem means I have no way of sorting messages by sender. (I can of course search for a given sender but that is hardly the same thing.) This problem has me thinking for the first time in years of looking for another email client. I hope there is a solution. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",drewtrott
