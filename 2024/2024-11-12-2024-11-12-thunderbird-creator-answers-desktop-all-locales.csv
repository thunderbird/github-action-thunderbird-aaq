My old email address under Shaw was matthew2523@shaw.ca .  My new email address is matthew4246@telus.net .  Also, with Telus I was able to establish Thunderbird on this computer through Google gmail which Telus uses for its email program.   </p><p>However, when I installed Thunderbird on my other computer it was still connected with the Shaw system and therefore, I could not get into Thunderbird to make the necessary changes that I did with this computer.  And so, I don't know what to do to solve this problem. </p><p>Do you have any ideas? </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Allen Wild </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",matthew4246

Double clicking to select the word and then the whole sentence does not work.  </p><p>I had a dig through the Help Site but couldn't find a reference to this issue/setting.  </p><p>How do I stop Thunderbird from swiping between emails so I can select text to copy? </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;:) </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",emily26

The sending function pops up a box saying it is sending the email but the send times out after about 30 seconds. If I keep hitting the SEND button after each timeout it eventually works. Receiving new emails works without issue.  </p><p>I am running a current Windows 10 pro using Thunderbird 128.4.2esr 64 bit with a basic Windows firewall and AVAST antivirus. </p><p>There are two different email providers, Gmail and Bell Sympatico, so I have two outgoing SMTP servers defined. This has been my setup for many years and I haven't knowingly changed anything in Thunderbird settings related to this issue. I think the last change I made was to set the OAUTH option for GMAIL a couple of years ago. I am attaching two screen shots to show the outgoing SMTP server settings. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",hepgugl56
