My email was downloading very slowly and so I closed the entire Thunderbird application. When I re-opened it, the folder was gone. Everything else is there as before - all other folders, my inbox etc. </p><p>I have no idea what happened or where the folder went. I can't find anything online that addresses the problem or how to solve it. I'm very much a tech novice. I need a solution that a 5 year old could navigate lol </p><p>This is happening on my laptop, Windows operating system. I don't have any email managers on my phone. </p><p>S.O.S.

I’ve installed Thunderbird and set up my account on the new machine. I created a backup of my profile folder and attempted to use the import function for the (very) large file, but I keep encountering numerous errors related to hostname connectivity. Here’s the issue: My email address is still @teleport.com, but since Teleport has transitioned to Earthlink, my incoming and outgoing hostnames have changed to include ""earthlink"" instead of ""teleport."" How can I successfully import my old profile onto my new computer when the hostnames no longer match? </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",kerrifnussbaum

Recently, I needed to delete about 3,000 messages I had mistakenly downloaded through Yahoo. Thunderbird just crashed.  I usually just download a new version and reinstall Tbird.  However, it did not work this time.  So I copied the entire profile and subfolders to a stick. I uninstalled TBird and then I copied the profile folder back to where it was.  Unfortunately that didn't do it.  TBird started but no files, no index no nothing just an empty Bird. </p><p>So essentially I hired someone to fix the profile which seems to have been corrupted somehow, seemingly with too many sub folders, but I don't have the skills for that.  He took the largest of the numerous profiles and somehow got Thunderbird to open.  However, the folders opened in T-Bird, yet they contained no files.  He tried for hours to populate the files to no avail. </p><p>Supposedly, every email folder, mailbox, contact etc is somewhere inside the group of ""The Profile"" files.   I need some expert help me to get these files to show.  I am willing to pay for this help. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",fr33dom1971
