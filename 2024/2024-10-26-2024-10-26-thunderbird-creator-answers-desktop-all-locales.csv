Recently, I needed to delete about 3,000 messages I had mistakenly downloaded through Yahoo. Thunderbird just crashed.  I usually just download a new version and reinstall Tbird.  However, it did not work this time.  So I copied the entire profile and subfolders to a stick. I uninstalled TBird and then I copied the profile folder back to where it was.  Unfortunately that didn't do it.  TBird started but no files, no index no nothing just an empty Bird. </p><p>So essentially I hired someone to fix the profile which seems to have been corrupted somehow, seemingly with too many sub folders, but I don't have the skills for that.  He took the largest of the numerous profiles and somehow got Thunderbird to open.  However, the folders opened in T-Bird, yet they contained no files.  He tried for hours to populate the files to no avail. </p><p>Supposedly, every email folder, mailbox, contact etc is somewhere inside the group of ""The Profile"" files.   I need some expert help me to get these files to show.

And multiple prefs.js files - prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js (win10) CAUSE: McAfee","<p>Problem: newly added account disappears when TB is closed. Thunderbird on this PC (Dell Latitude 6540) has held a Verizon account for years. The ""new"" account is a different, equally old Verizon account kept on TB in an identical PC I no longer use. When added to TB on the present PC it tests and works fine until TB is closed. Repeated numerous times.  Having read thread # 1286437 I did what follows , to no avail: 1. tried TB in troubleshoot mode; 2. tried in Windows safe mode; 3. cleared startup cache; 4. drastically pruned old emails; 5. looked up profile folder under troubleshooting info. Folder qxxxxxxd ( size 1.18 GB before adding new account) holds one folder tree, one directory tree, but NO prefs.js file. Instead, twenty-two prefs-xx.js files from 1 to 22; removed all to a thumb drive except prefs-1.js which I dared not rename as prefs.js; 6. found two profile folders, both labeled default. One is the above holding 1.18 GB, the other holds 685 MB (probably harmless and related to an old university account no longer extant). I copied both profile folders to a thumb drive. Note: profile folder qxxxxxxd is clearly engaged in what I am attempting. When TB is open with the added new account working -- which is the case as I am writing --, profile folder size increases from 1.18 to 1.20 GB and the number of folders increases by one (under ""Mail"" the list of <a href=""http://pop.verizon-xx.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.verizon-xx.net</a> sub-folders increases from 17 to 18).
