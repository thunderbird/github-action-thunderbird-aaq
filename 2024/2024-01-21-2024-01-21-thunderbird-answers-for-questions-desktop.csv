My thoughts:  - abook.sqlite, and message folders are good if they are POP. If IMAP, they will be recreated.  - if any POP accounts, there is a popstate.dat file in the account folder. That contains the last downloaded message. copy that in after setting up account or the account will download from the beginning.  - message filters are in msgfilterules.dat and are embedded in the account info for each account. Those can be copied directly to the same places in a new profile. - customizations in profile will have suffix that includes the letters 'json', such as extensions.json. I'm not smart enough (as some are on this forum) to know if some may not work, but I suggest looking for all that have those letters somewhere in suffix and copying.  - look also for folders with 'extension' in the name.

I decided to go back over the instructions that you gave me. And I did what you told me I shouldn't do.  You told me that I shouldn't make the font size larger than 14, for fear of making the font size  too large for the recipient, which I fully understand.  But after spending weeks straining my eyes with 6pt type - and my temper, being only able to set the font size temporarily larger with View&gt;Zoom, View&gt;Fontsize, and/or using the hamburger menu to, again only temporarily make the font readable.  I went back to edit settings.  I have set my basic font size to 30pt.  I have changed my output choice to html.  Oh, the change is wonderful.  It's unfair to you that I didn't tell you that I have Advanced, Wet, Macular Degeneration.  And struggling with the 6pt size, I was beginning to have such trouble with my eyesight, I was afraid I was going to have to tell my doctor that there was permanent deterioration in my vision. But with the font change, my vision is ok again.  It's only been a couple of days, but I haven't had any complaints from anyone about the size of the font. To be honest,  I don't think the enlarged font looks that large.  I don't know what's causing the font to look smaller than the designated size but I think it's a critical factor in handling font change.  If there are enough people with this problem, it might be worth a study of the combination of Thunderbird vs. whatever is contributed by the computer operating system.  I love my Linux, but it doesn't operate like a Windows or a Mac.  So I hope what I'm reporting provides useful information to you when helping other people in my situation.

We had some minor misunderstandings, as my post stated to use your desired font and font size, but no harm. I will work to be more clear in helping others, so that is good feedback.
