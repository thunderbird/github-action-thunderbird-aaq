In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font.

That doesn't 'fix' anything but can confirm that Thunderbird is looking at the right profile. If so, there is a button in upper right to restart with addons disabled. Worth a try?  From my experience with many posts on the forum about backed-up profiles, proprietary backups have failed more often than expected, and I do not know why that happens, other than possibly creating the backup while Thunderbird is running, which can cause a backup to be incomplete. If nothing works, you can still salvage the message folders and addressbook (abook.sqlite) to paste into a new profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
