That contains the last downloaded message. copy that in after setting up account or the account will download from the beginning.  - message filters are in msgfilterules.dat and are embedded in the account info for each account. Those can be copied directly to the same places in a new profile. - customizations in profile will have suffix that includes the letters 'json', such as extensions.json. I'm not smart enough (as some are on this forum) to know if some may not work, but I suggest looking for all that have those letters somewhere in suffix and copying.  - look also for folders with 'extension' in the name.
