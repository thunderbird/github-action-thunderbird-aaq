What I'm talking here is about manually compacting folders via the folders panel context menu. </p><p>I know Thunderbird is trying to compact subfolders because of the status bar message. I have been able to stop it, but I do not want to play those tricks or risking committing a mistake in the future. Maybe some of the old folders aren't compacted, but, as I said in my original post, I consider them read-only and do not want them to be modified in any way. And, anyway, I have not found a way of stop compacting short of closing Thunderbird (and comparing the affected files with the profile backup, see bellow), which is too risky for archive material, and do not want to rely on always remembering I have to do that. </p><p>What I'm asking for is a way to control the compaction, in a way that it only applies to selected folders, or at least excludes the ""archive"" ones. A best practice in data preservation is not modifying it unless it's absolutely necessary, if at all. </p><p>I do have a complete up-to-date backup of my Thunderbird profile, which currently weights in about 24 GB. The backup is in a separate hard drive, and it is updated daily. So you can see that I do take the possibility of data loss very seriously. The profile contains all my mail since 2000, back when I used Netscape Communicator, thanks to the backwards compatibility of the mailbox file format. </p>",ajgelado,false,0,0
