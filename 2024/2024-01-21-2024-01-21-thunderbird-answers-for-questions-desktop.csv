To verify the profile, I suggest help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profile' . That doesn't 'fix' anything but can confirm that Thunderbird is looking at the right profile. If so, there is a button in upper right to restart with addons disabled. Worth a try?  From my experience with many posts on the forum about backed-up profiles, proprietary backups have failed more often than expected, and I do not know why that happens, other than possibly creating the backup while Thunderbird is running, which can cause a backup to be incomplete. If nothing works, you can still salvage the message folders and addressbook (abook.sqlite) to paste into a new profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My thoughts:  - abook.sqlite, and message folders are good if they are POP. If IMAP, they will be recreated.  - if any POP accounts, there is a popstate.dat file in the account folder. That contains the last downloaded message. copy that in after setting up account or the account will download from the beginning.  - message filters are in msgfilterules.dat and are embedded in the account info for each account. Those can be copied directly to the same places in a new profile. - customizations in profile will have suffix that includes the letters 'json', such as extensions.json. I'm not smart enough (as some are on this forum) to know if some may not work, but I suggest looking for all that have those letters somewhere in suffix and copying.  - look also for folders with 'extension' in the name.

Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. And don't forget to set MINIMUM font size.  - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0
