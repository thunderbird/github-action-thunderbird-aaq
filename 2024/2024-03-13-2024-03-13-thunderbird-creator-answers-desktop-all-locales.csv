I put the drive of the OLD computer into an USB drive and plugged it into the new computer. I can browse from the new computer to the OLD drive appdata/roaming/thunderbird without any problem. I launch Thunderbird and created a profile because as far as I know you can't do anything else until a profile has been created. </p><p>I launch the importer. I select Thunderbird profile, click next and select the path to the OLD drive where the profile lives. It fails and says something about an error log I can't find. </p><p>Take two: I copy the profile folder from the OLD drive to the new computer's desktop. I choose Thunderbird import and I select to use a different folder. I point it to the folders on the NEW computer desktop, and it fails with the same error. </p><p>It shouldn't be this difficult. I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong, and if so I need someone to please tell me what. I have time sensitive information in my Thunderbird email. Maybe someone has a ""step-by-step"" procedure for doing this and can explain it to me like I am 5 years old, I would appreciate it. </p><p>Thanks, Peeps </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",pdxmusicalliance

In TB102 the folders view was very practical as all 3 were shown in Inbox, Sent or Trash atc... As can be seen here. But in TB115 they don't show that way and they are all mixed up. How I can get TB115 look like 102? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",adid1

It was not totally relieble before but at least with a few tries I could do it. I thoutgh that the problem was in the website that I was using. But it appears that the problem resides on thunderbird or firefox because in my Linux machine I have been able to drag in from thunderbird to firefox without problems at all.  On another side I have been testing, thunderbird appear to upload without problems files to edge or file explorer, in addition firefox accepts files from the explorer without problems too. And I have been testing with a totally new profile on both, thunderbird and firefox to see if there was problems from some user config.  </p><p>To sum up, on windows, firefox accepts files from explorer, explorer and MS edge accepts files from thunderbird but directly from thunderbird to firefox is not possible since some update I suppose, before was working but not totally relieble. In Linux I have not problems with wayland enabled on both sides. If you need something more tell me, but I think you shoul reproduce this without problems... It's windows+empty profiles on both sides, thunderbird and firefox... </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,es,"",alberto.gomez3.external
