I put the drive of the OLD computer into an USB drive and plugged it into the new computer. I can browse from the new computer to the OLD drive appdata/roaming/thunderbird without any problem. I launch Thunderbird and created a profile because as far as I know you can't do anything else until a profile has been created. </p><p>I launch the importer. I select Thunderbird profile, click next and select the path to the OLD drive where the profile lives. It fails and says something about an error log I can't find. </p><p>Take two: I copy the profile folder from the OLD drive to the new computer's desktop. I choose Thunderbird import and I select to use a different folder. I point it to the folders on the NEW computer desktop, and it fails with the same error. </p><p>It shouldn't be this difficult. I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong, and if so I need someone to please tell me what. I have time sensitive information in my Thunderbird email. Maybe someone has a ""step-by-step"" procedure for doing this and can explain it to me like I am 5 years old, I would appreciate it. </p><p>Thanks, Peeps </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",pdxmusicalliance
