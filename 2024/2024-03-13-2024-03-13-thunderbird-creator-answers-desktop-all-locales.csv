On another side I have been testing, thunderbird appear to upload without problems files to edge or file explorer, in addition firefox accepts files from the explorer without problems too. And I have been testing with a totally new profile on both, thunderbird and firefox to see if there was problems from some user config.  </p><p>To sum up, on windows, firefox accepts files from explorer, explorer and MS edge accepts files from thunderbird but directly from thunderbird to firefox is not possible since some update I suppose, before was working but not totally relieble.
