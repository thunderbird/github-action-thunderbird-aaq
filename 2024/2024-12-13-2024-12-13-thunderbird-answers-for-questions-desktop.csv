I have also upset a lot of Eudora folk that will not accept that Eudora has some major weaknesses and this is one of the major reasons importing from it is so prone to failure. </p><p>Before you enter into using Thunderbird there are some thing I think need to be crystal clear. </p> <ol><li> Thunderbird is not Eudora.  Things are done differently and layouts are different. If you think you can make Thunderbird look like Eudora you probably need to go off and have a look at the resurrected Eudora project using the source Qualcomm released. </li><li> Changing the default directory on a per account basis,  while offered in account settings is a recipe for future failure.  Do not do it. </li><li> Do not try and place mail data in your documents, pictures or other system folder or the root of any drive.  There is a high probability you will loose data when your antivurs of Microsoft backup corrupts the mail store. </li></ol> <p>Do not meddle in the Thunderbird profile folder with the mail storage.  Again data loss is the most common outcome.  Even I do not touch that stuff with Thunderbird running in the task manager. (the absence of a window does not mean that application is not still running) </p><p>Thunderbird stores mail in profiles. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> it is via the profile manager you change the drive to use and the folders.  A full location for the profile structure is what you set.  But I do not recommend doing so until you have your data imported. </p><p>Do not install the Microsoft Store version of Thunderbird if you are gong to change the profile location.  Personally I think it is poorly tested and no one really has the details of what the windows sandbox for store apps does to Thunderbird.  They only think they do.  I have seen no explicit testing involving the store version,m just an anjnouncement5 that it was released. </p><p>IMAP essentially does not have a local store worth mentioning.  It caches copies locally,  but as soon as there is a problem verifying the local copy with the server the local copy is deleted. So do not get caught. </p><p>The official docs,  such as they were, were basically deleted when Qualcomm abandoned the Eudora OSE implementation.  There are none and as you are over 10 years late getting to the party, there are few that actually were involved in support back then to even offer ideas.  Thunderbird does not have any Eudora import code any longer,  that has been purged from the code base probably about V34 f I recall correctly.  However if you get an old enough version from here <a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/</a> Perhaps V30 or 3.1 installing it on a system with a functional Eudora will see things just imported.  Then you can update to a more recent version as those old versions do not work with major mail p0roviders any better than Eudora does.  Mostly with regard to Oauth authentication and TLS encryption bnut you will not be able to get mail from Yahoo, Hotmail or Gmail with V3.1 any longer I do not think. </p><p>This information <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Importing_from_Eudora_-_Thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.mozillazine.org/Importing_from_Eudora_-_Thunderbird</a> is still Germaine and the reference to Eudora rescue is often very relevant,  not that I know if it is available anywhere on the web any longer.  Despite a loyal user base, Eudora was really sloppy with it's stores and tolerant of errors caused by incorrect file edits.  Something that sort of goes with an application that encourages manual file editing. Nothing since has even considered accepting a Eudora level of inherent corruption without major issues. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,0

A lot of the blame falls with lax standards in Eudora and Eudora fans do not accept criticism of their chosen mail client well.  They profer Eudora and have been determined in the past hat Thunderbird had to be changed to do it the Eudora way. </p><p>The longer after the demise of Eudora that transition occurs the more they appear to expect a robust well documented process.  The reality is it is about exactly the reverse of that. The less folk other than them that even remembers Eudora. </p><p>So I come in hard and somewhat aggressively in the hope of defusing the agro that goes with folk hearing ""No"" in this world today, where even facts can be ""alternative"". </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

(I didn't expect to not be) Let's hit your points: I'm not a Eudora defender, I just want to move on.  I don't expect a Eudora look alike. In fact I like the TB UX so far over the Eudora. </p><p>I'm not interesting in importing Eudora everything automatically.  (I shiver before hitting an ""import"" button in any app) I have some interest in importing old Eudora mailboxes to facilitate archive searches, but if it's not advised, I don't need to do it. I've been happy with smtp and POP, don't need IMAP, just curious about it. You seem to be very shy of moving folders.  I can see that an AV can wreak havoc if it finds suspects in the mail file, but:  </p><pre>  I don't run aftermarket AV.  Just defender.   In either case, I wouldn't allow automatic 'quarantine' or deletion.   Whatever harm it might do, it would presumably do in whatever folder mail was stored. </pre> <p>I'm not opposed to using Profiles, just don't see the need as I'm not switching users nor user 'postures'. I only kept my eudora data in Documents for ease of backup, but if there's a reason to keep elsewhere, I can modify my backup script. I don't use MS Backup (is that a program?) or any other app.  I use a script that kills relevant processes than xcopy to various destinations, one of which is a <a href=""http://sync.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sync.com</a> folder that copies to their cloud. No backup or sync entity touches my base data.  (I don't like anything that does 'magic' behind the scenes-) I presume I'm normally okay, with multiple copies in different places, and if the worst happens I'm willing to recover manually, step by step, with due care.  (BTW, Moz Profiles are a bit like my comment about behind the scenes, and I certainly wouldn't do surgery (unless life saving emergency) in those folders!) </p><p>So with that operating posture, would you like to (please) extend and revise your remarks? &nbsp;:) </p><p>Thanks again, Tom </p>",tdaly,false,0,0

Now you have to use 'Authenticated Method: OAuth However, they have also altered what password to use and what email address can use the SMTP. Read on: </p><p><strong>1.</strong> Your microsoft account and your hotmail/outlook/msn/live accounts all need to have the same password. So all your microsoft accounts need to be using same password. Info at this link says:  </p> <ul><li>     <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-sign-in-to-hotmail-c378938b-c0eb-40c1-b99e-338dd9e776a8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-sign-in-to-hotmail-c378938b-c0eb-40c1-b99e-338dd9e776a8</a>  </li></ul> <p><em>Can't sign in to Hotmail or <a href=""http://Outlook.com?"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com?</a></em> <em>Notes: Your Hotmail or <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> password is the same as your Microsoft Account password.</em> </p><p>You must logon to the webmail account via  browser to sort it out.  Once all your accounts are using same password..... </p><p><strong>2.</strong> In microsoft account accessed via a browser If you have more email addresses or hotmail addresses etc , microsoft now regard one is 'primary' and all others are alias to the account. This is not a problem when it comes to receiving mail, but can be an issues when you want to send. When it comes to 'sending' - that is smtp in  Thunderbird - it can only send using the 'primary' email address.  You can choose what you want to be set as 'primary', but whatever email address you set up as 'primary' - only that email address/username can be used for SMTP. So if you want to send using a specific 'outlook' email address then make sure it is set up as the primary email address. But then if you have another <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account as well, it will only be able to send using whatever you setup as  primary email address. So choose the email address which you want to set up as 'primary'. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> In Thunderbird, Cookies must be enabled in order to set up Oauth. </p> <ul><li>     Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li>     Check under Web Content - </li><li>     Select: 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Accept third party cookies' 'Always' </li><li>     Click on 'Exceptions' button next to Accept cookies from sites to make sure you are not blocking cookies from Microsoft sites, such as&nbsp;:<a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">office365.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.live.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.msn.com</a>  </li></ul> <p><strong>4.</strong> In Thunderbird....When creating account or if account is created but you need to check server settings: Account Settings must use the following: Server Type: <strong> POP</strong> Mail Server </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port 995 </li><li>     User Name: xxxx@outlook.com </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/LTS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2  </li></ul> <p>Server Type:  <strong>IMAP</strong> Mail Server </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port 993 </li><li>     User Name: xxxx@outlook.com </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/LTS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2  </li></ul> <p><strong>SMTP:</strong> </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port: 587 </li><li>     Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li>     Authentication method: OAuth2 </li><li>     User Name: example@outlook.com (Please note this must be whatever email address is set up as the 'primary' email address)  </li></ul> <p>Once you have all these settings and got the password sorted. </p><p>Restart Thunderbird When you get the Microsoft pop up window asking for password, type it in and click on 'Sign in'.

So server may deny access. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> If you use a program which uses the 'localhost' eg: Apache Xampp then switch it off whilst setting up the Oauth token. You can switch it back on once account is set up and running ok. To set up the acceptance of allowing Thunderbird access to server it needs to use the localhost, hence switch off anything using it. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> Access the Firewall (this might be default one which came with coputer or may be controlled by an Anti-Virus product you installed).

The same flag is used to set the icon, so checking the icon is a visual way to confirm the folder is actually correctly designated.
