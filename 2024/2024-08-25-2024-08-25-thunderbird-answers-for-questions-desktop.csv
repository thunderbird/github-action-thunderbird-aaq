Your graphics are set to a default value which is in essence the setting ""hardware acceleration"" disabled. Addons are disabled. The user interface is largely returned to its default </p><p>Those later two can be made more permanent by using the reset button that comes up when you start in Troubleshooting mode.  I really don't think those are your issue,  but please try them anyway, including going into settings and disabling hardware acceleration. </p><p>Finally antivirus/security suites have these ""things"" they claim to offer like anti scam and anti spam tools which they inject into the Thunderbird running process instead of using the normal addon route.  Just like the malware they claim to be defeating really.  When this goes wrong, there is no way to block these insidious worms within Thunderbird,  like disable an addon.  But safe mode blocks all addons and it is the addon interface that the antivirus vendors exploit for their malware er tools.  So go to your antivirus product and disable an toolbar or scan or spam tools (it used to be trend in particular but these days most of the products are owned by about two or three companies so the name on the package is somewhat irrelevant. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However, as soon as I give Thunderbird focus the hotkey ceases to work.  It makes me think Thunderbird is using [PrintScreen] for something else, but I can't find any reference to it on the Internet. </p><p>You are correct about some Windows thing (I've never used) when I press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[PrintScreen], which shows a cross-hair.  But Snagit no longer works when TB has focus (fine when something else has focus).  I've sent a support request into them but I'm not sure how that's going to go when it works with any other application open (having focus). </p>",BPaul_H,false,0,0

But I kept searching and realised that the old Your Name had been put into the address folders with that email address.  I just deleted that, checked that I had the correct name in the address folder with that  address, and all is fixed.  Seems that the system was using that name from the address folder rather than the name I had put into the account details.  Anyway, I'll close the question now. Colin </p>",colinfryer,false,0,0

Under ""Forwarding and POP/IMAP"", ""Disable IMAP"" is selected (""Enable IMAP"" is selected in another account that is working well). 2. Under ""Labels"", there's no option to choose whether folders are available via IMAP. The option does appear on my other account that has IMAP enabled. </p><p>So, I'll enable IMAP on the Google side of my ""faulty"" account, and take it from there. I'm surprised Thunderbird and my iPhone have been able to link this account in IMAP mode if Gmail is set to Disable IMAP (and without so much as an error message). </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>- Martin </p>",gamin1,false,0,0

Some 30 years ago in the early days of windows I was told at a developer forum that French for instance requires about 30% more space to hold translated information that the English original.
