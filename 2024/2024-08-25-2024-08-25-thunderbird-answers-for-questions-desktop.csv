If it's an authentication issue, it might be caused by something like a VPN, if you use one, as they obscure location, which in turn can block authentication.  Also, some antivirus apps become incompatible after a TB update.  Running Windows in safe mode is one way to test the possible effects of such startup apps. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
