Under ""Forwarding and POP/IMAP"", ""Disable IMAP"" is selected (""Enable IMAP"" is selected in another account that is working well). 2. Under ""Labels"", there's no option to choose whether folders are available via IMAP. The option does appear on my other account that has IMAP enabled. </p><p>So, I'll enable IMAP on the Google side of my ""faulty"" account, and take it from there.
