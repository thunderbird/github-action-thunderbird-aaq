You should be able to delete original and -1 and rename the -2 to the original. You may wish to copy all first -- although, if IMAP, thunderbird repopulates any missing data. Thunderbird has a setting to allow antivirus to check messages; it's the scanning of the thunderbird files that is the issue. On your profile name, you have a future 'problem' that may burn you. When moving to another PC, you would need to modify the profiles.ini on new setup but may forget. My suggestion is this:  - exit thunderbird first - move profile to c:\users\paulkinz\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles where the original was  - edit the profiles.ini in the thunderbird profile to point to the profile in its new location  This is to get the two in sync - profiles.ini pointing to the profile, both within thunderbird folder What this achieves is that, when you move to a new pc, all you will need to do is  - install thunderbird and exit - copy the thunderbird folder you copied from old PC  - paste the copied thunderbird folder at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the installed default - you will not be able to start thunderbird and everything will be in place  </p><p>as an aside, this makes for easy backups periodically. Just exit thunderbird (IMPORTANT) and copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media  then, if the world explodes, you can quickly restore normalcy by - installing and exiting thunderbird - copy the thunderbird profile to overlay the one at the ...appdata\roaming location works EVERY TIME. </p><p>Make mine a cheeseburger with extra fries.

What you might, over time, experience is a growth in the Imap folder as the account continues to create -x entries. Thunderbird keeps adjusting.

The issue is when you first install Tbird and create a profile, it creates that random name instead of always creating the same. I don't see why they would need to do that, it's very irritating.

The -1 file is a safe bet because thunderbird already knew the other file. The profile, on the other hand, must be unique, as thunderbird does not have the logic to keep trying for a unique name. But, since you are familiar with changing it, all is well.   All the best to you in your future pursuits.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
