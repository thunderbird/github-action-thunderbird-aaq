You should be able to delete original and -1 and rename the -2 to the original. You may wish to copy all first -- although, if IMAP, thunderbird repopulates any missing data. Thunderbird has a setting to allow antivirus to check messages; it's the scanning of the thunderbird files that is the issue. On your profile name, you have a future 'problem' that may burn you. When moving to another PC, you would need to modify the profiles.ini on new setup but may forget. My suggestion is this:  - exit thunderbird first - move profile to c:\users\paulkinz\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles where the original was  - edit the profiles.ini in the thunderbird profile to point to the profile in its new location  This is to get the two in sync - profiles.ini pointing to the profile, both within thunderbird folder What this achieves is that, when you move to a new pc, all you will need to do is  - install thunderbird and exit - copy the thunderbird folder you copied from old PC  - paste the copied thunderbird folder at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the installed default - you will not be able to start thunderbird and everything will be in place  </p><p>as an aside, this makes for easy backups periodically. Just exit thunderbird (IMPORTANT) and copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media  then, if the world explodes, you can quickly restore normalcy by - installing and exiting thunderbird - copy the thunderbird profile to overlay the one at the ...appdata\roaming location works EVERY TIME. </p><p>Make mine a cheeseburger with extra fries.

What you might, over time, experience is a growth in the Imap folder as the account continues to create -x entries. Thunderbird keeps adjusting. These interruptions sometimes also show in the profile itself, with the prefs.js having multiple copies. Yes, that was the antivirus box I was thinking of. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Would it be a good idea to delete them? </p><p>And any idea why my Archive folders get used? I've never archived anything,  and I even tried unchecking all ""Keep message archives in"" boxes for all mailboxes, but I still get *some* email being archived. And I never type ""A"" when reading a message. And sometimes, the archives get several blank messages dated 1969 appearing, and sometimes they're gone. And I can't delete them. They kind of come and go too. I even tried Mailbox | right-click | Repair Folder on all the folders. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",paul92,false,0,0

On the prefs.js issue, there are a few here with expertise there. Check the date of prefs.js-16 (or whichever is highest). If it is current, I would delete all the others and rename that as prefs.js. But SAVE the others in another folder until thunderbird restarts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I will share what I do:  - I install thunderbird to c:\tbird and I place the profile at c:\tbird\profile   and I backup c:\tbird to zip. That guarantees that I can not only restore my profile, but also the version of thunderbird I'm using in short order.
