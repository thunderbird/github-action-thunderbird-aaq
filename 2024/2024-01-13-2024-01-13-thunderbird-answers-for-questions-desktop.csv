That is probably why this issue rarely surfaces. So, is it a bug that a logically unneeded SMTP server cannot be created, or is it a bug that the setting of the SMTP server exists at all within the Identity pane? I would open a bug, but I'm hesitant to toss this conundrum to the developers to scratch their heads over. </p><p>In this case, an SMTP server could be defined via the Outgoing Server SMTP pane, and then linked by selecting from within the Identities pane. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What possibly happened to your wife's PC is that an antivirus program may have interrupted a routine Thunderbird update. Does she use an antivirus product? Which one?   Anyway, by being interrupted, Thunderbird started a fresh profile and asked for email info again. And that caused the account to download as though a new account. I suggest you look at her profile, as there may be multiple occurrences of prefs.js, and advise on that.  Ideally, she can eventually get back to having just one of the various files. To locate lost folders, she should exit thunderbird and use Windows File Explorer to look inside the Local Folders to see if she sees any lost message folders (which can be saved) and in the <a href=""http://mail.comcast.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.com</a> folder to compare with contents of <a href=""http://mail.comcast.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.com</a>-1. She should also, in thunderbird, look at account page and bottom line to see which folder is being referenced. My guess is it is <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a>-1. BUT, if she is using an antivirus product, I first suggest investigating to see if it has settings to not be involved with email. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I’m sorry to say that I think this response might be as wordy as my original post. Re antivirus programs. My wife and I have used Malewarebytes for many years with no problems that I can remember. Nevertheless, shortly after the TB problem, I decided to change antivirus programs. So I am unable to look for any possible connection between Malewarebytes and TB upgrades. </p><p>There are two occurrences of prefs.js in my wife’s profile. One is in the .default folder and the date modified is today 1/14/24. The other profs.js, date modified 12/23/23, is in .default\chrome-debugger-profile.

In <a href=""http://mail.comcast-1.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast-1.net</a>, there are pairs of files, one in each pair with the extension .msf. (Ex.
