That is clear, as only 'edit' is available, and only to predefined SMTP servers. That can be confirmed immediately. However, I see no logical reason for a different SMTP server, since identities are aliases that are dependent on the core account, and therefore would use the existing SMTP server. That is probably why this issue rarely surfaces. So, is it a bug that a logically unneeded SMTP server cannot be created, or is it a bug that the setting of the SMTP server exists at all within the Identity pane? I would open a bug, but I'm hesitant to toss this conundrum to the developers to scratch their heads over. </p><p>In this case, an SMTP server could be defined via the Outgoing Server SMTP pane, and then linked by selecting from within the Identities pane. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What possibly happened to your wife's PC is that an antivirus program may have interrupted a routine Thunderbird update. Does she use an antivirus product? Which one?   Anyway, by being interrupted, Thunderbird started a fresh profile and asked for email info again. And that caused the account to download as though a new account. I suggest you look at her profile, as there may be multiple occurrences of prefs.js, and advise on that.  Ideally, she can eventually get back to having just one of the various files. To locate lost folders, she should exit thunderbird and use Windows File Explorer to look inside the Local Folders to see if she sees any lost message folders (which can be saved) and in the <a href=""http://mail.comcast.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.com</a> folder to compare with contents of <a href=""http://mail.comcast.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.com</a>-1. She should also, in thunderbird, look at account page and bottom line to see which folder is being referenced.

The second screenshot shows an Archives (Call it ArchA) folder holding the 2023 and 2024 content mentioned above. The third screenshot shows another Archives folder (ArchB) containing content from several other years, as well as ABM, mentioned in an earlier message. ArchB is stored separate from Profiles. </p><p>So, my questions:  Can I simply copy the files from ArchB into ArchA and expect/hope them to then appear on the TB home page? If so, then there might still be one additional hitch: there is a 2023 file in both ArchA and ArchB. Can they somehow be combined into a single 2023 file stored in ArchA? If not, can I simply rename the 2023 file from ArchB, and store it in ArchA, thus creating a new archive? </p><p>Thanks again. </p>",I_Rufus,false,0,0

The only notification I get is that when TB goes to move a message into the folder it claims it can't find it. The icon for the ""missing"" folder is still there, but a darker color. I check the properties and the ""Location"" is blank. Clicking ""Repair folder"" does nothing. I check and the ""foldername"" and ""foldername.msf"" files are still there and seem to be intact. When this first happened I was using another machine, so thought it was just another symptom of it getting old. Now it's doing the same on my brand new shiny machine as well.  It's all SSD . Windows 11.  Any suggestions? TIA Mike </p>",mezmo,false,0,0

After formatting and reinstalling I initially tried just putting the data from the backup folder into the new profiles folder without any success.

However, the message folders can be saved (e.g., inbox, inbox.msf) by copying them to Mail\Local folders of a new profile. The addressbook (abook.sqlite) can also be salvaged. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
