This is where the nightmare started several days ago.  To free up SSD space I had searched for huge files and two files like the ones in the screenshot popped up; 9gb and 8gb respectively.  As the second was identified as being an NSTMP-3 file, I deleted it expecting to find 8gb freed up. Much to my horror, revisiting disk space I saw that after the file deletion 30gb had been freed up!!! Looking under the nstmp-3 tag my heart sank when I saw the FULL filename: .....\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles </p><p>I've been hoping against hope that the deleted file might still be recoverable on the SSD but multiple runs of EaseUS, Disk Drill, and testdisk-7.2 have left me more confused than ever. </p><p>Is it time for seppuku? </p>",dpfreedman,false,0,0
