You mentioned historic emails. If these were on an IMAP account, they can be accessed, but if it was a POP account, they would have been lost unless consciously saved when rebuilding or replacing the PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I propose that is not Thunderbird's responsibility and I, as a user, would not want to see developer resources spent fixing a problem for Outlook users. However, that's not my call. You're welcome to suggest that at <a href=""http://connect.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">connect.mozilla.org</a> in the IDEAS section to see if fixing Outlook should be attempted. On the contrary, I think bugs in Outlook might encourage some of them to transfer to Thunderbird. I do not suggest reporting in Bugzilla, as this not a bug. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
