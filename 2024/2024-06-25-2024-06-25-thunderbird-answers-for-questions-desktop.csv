L'unico difetto di Colored Folders è che il colore non viene in alcun modo salvato, per cui devo fare il lavoro su ognuno dei 4 computer che uso abitualmente. Basterebbe permettere di esportare e reimportare la colorazione delle cartelle in un file, che potrei inviarmi per posta e avere facilmente disponibile per ogni aggiornamento da un computer all'altro. </p><p>Tempo fa chiesi allo sviluppatore, ma senza risultato, anche perché scrisse che da una certa versione di Thunderbird in poi era diventato molto più complesso scrivere le estensioni. </p>",Datmann,false,0,0
