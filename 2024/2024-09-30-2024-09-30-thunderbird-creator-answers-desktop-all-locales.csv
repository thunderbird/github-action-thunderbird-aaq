I clicked the Get Messages button in Thunderbird and it said there were no messages - I knew there had to be some. So I shut down Thunderbird and restarted it. Again tried Get Messages.

I clicked OK in that notification and then it immediately started downloading messages, counting up to 27 - everything looked normal. However, nothing appeared in the inbox. Unfortunately, I had the pop3 setup to delete messages from the server once downloaded (I have since changed that), so when I checked the server, there was nothing there. So it appears that everything worked as expected except that the messages did not appear in the inbox. I checked other folders and do not see them. Where could they have gone?

I have tried to find out what is in the non-displayed message, and to force TB to focus on the offending message, but have had no success. From the message subject and header, some of these messages are important to me. How can I force TB to display them like it does the other messages. NOTE: Nothing in the message header indicates the messages with this problem are any different from the messages that are properly displayed. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1678007;,clpodyssey

Following one list of instructions, I made a link to a pastebin page.  <a href=""https://pastebin.mozilla.org/VQJJM8Md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.mozilla.org/VQJJM8Md</a> In Troubleshooting mode, TB looks more or less as I expect. That is, I can access all emails. There was another question to answer, but I lost the conversation while rummaging around. </p><p>Should I continue to work on this, or wait for the next update? In the meantime, I am emailing from my Earthlink page, but I really prefer TB's flexibility. </p><p>Thanks for any suggestions. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",gbpos
