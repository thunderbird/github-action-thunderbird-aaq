I have several email addresses in my T-bird account but my primary address is sorokespso@outlook.com.  I don't know where it came up with pennysorokes@gmail.com.

When I used to click on a link in an email, I was taken to Firefox where the link was opened in a tab for viewing. Now, I have to manually switch to Firefox using CTRL-F2 (F2 is location of the workspace where I have Firefox). </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",tyropublishing

I have computer backups going back for 6 months so I can reinstall my lost profile which has the lost folder. My question is how do I extract that folder from my profile from the back up so that when I reinstall my current profile I can add (or whatever) the lost folder? </p>,thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1677820;,keithinoz1

When I try to log in using my Comcast password I get a screen that shows ""Access Denied You don't have permission to access ""<a href=""http://login.xfinity.com/login"" rel=""nofollow"">http://login.xfinity.com/login</a>"" on this server.  Reference #18.321c2e17.1727662977.283cff2b <a href=""https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.321c2e17.1727662977.283cff2b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.321c2e17.1727662977.283cff2b</a>. I have allowed access to third party apps on my Comcast account and I am able to access my email on the Comcast website with no problem.  I saw something about disabling IPV6 but it said to go to Preferences or Options in the Settings menu.   My version of Thunderbird (latest) doesn't have these menu options.  I have tried various IMAP and SMTP Port settings I found on the internet and nothing works.  </p><p>What are the settings for Comcast email in Thunderbird? </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1677811;,jwhorvath

From one time to the next, I can't remember how I restored it.  It just happened again. I tried restarting (which I believe worked in the past) but no luck.  I think what caused the problem this time -- and possibly last time too -- is clicking on a link in a particular message from a specific sender, linking to a document found inside a password-protected portal.  I just want my message pane back! (and to prevent this from happening again if possible).  What do I need to do? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",karlab31
