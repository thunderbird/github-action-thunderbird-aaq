From one time to the next, I can't remember how I restored it.  It just happened again. I tried restarting (which I believe worked in the past) but no luck.  I think what caused the problem this time -- and possibly last time too -- is clicking on a link in a particular message from a specific sender, linking to a document found inside a password-protected portal.  I just want my message pane back! (and to prevent this from happening again if possible).
