I have computer backups going back for 6 months so I can reinstall my lost profile which has the lost folder. My question is how do I extract that folder from my profile from the back up so that when I reinstall my current profile I can add (or whatever) the lost folder? </p>,thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",keithinoz1
