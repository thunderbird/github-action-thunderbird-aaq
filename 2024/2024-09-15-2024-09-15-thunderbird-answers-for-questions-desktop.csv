I went to the Gmail website and for each label, I moved all the messages to a brand new label, then moved them back to the original one. This seemed to recreate the label structure, and Thunderbird re-downloaded everything as expected. It was a hassle, but it seemed to work. </p>",teaandowls,false,0,0

Was that in backup you did of the profile prior to the reformat? Did you do a backup? If you did a backup and that is the source of the five years of sent mail and the deleted mail, then more information is needed on how you got where you are. Messages received previously would depend on your account's seup, such as POP or IMAP, and your settings for the account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

All the emails that I referred to appeared when I reinstalled Thunderbird, not immediately but in the space of 30 minutes.

All messages there should appear on Thunderbird. You may need to check account settings, but the default settings are usually okay. If you had a large number of messages there, it may just be a matter of time for the repopulation to happen. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
