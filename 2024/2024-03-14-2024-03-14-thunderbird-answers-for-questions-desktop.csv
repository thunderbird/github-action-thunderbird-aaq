But if you have all expanded and you collapse one or two, you will find when you restart it does not remember the individual email setting. </p><p>If you find your session data etc is not being saved/remembered correctly: First check to see what programs you have got installed which are allowed to scan your thunderbird profile folders.  Many Anti-Virus and other clean-up software like CCleaner or Wisecleaner should not have any access to your Profile folders because they can delete session, password etc files and if Anti-Virus can scan files, it will cause a slow down in processes. If you let a AV scan your profile then if it finds a problem never let it fix it because you stand a good chance of losing a lot of emails. If you do want to use those types of products then I would suggest you make Thunderbird profile folder exempt from scanning. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I might be under the wrong impression that this primairy password blocks all access. That is what I expect from a password as such. As you can see I had this configured (sorry it's all Dutch) but when changing it, it says that it protects other passwords and so on, not that is blocks all access to the program as I expect it to do.  -&gt; so end conclusion, my mistake for expecting too much. Maybe reconsider if ""password"" is the right word to use in this context. Should it be ""security code for all passwords"" or something that does not give the impression your texts are safe for all other eyes than your own, like I have been thinking for years!!! </p>",EvDijk,false,0,0
