Many Anti-Virus and other clean-up software like CCleaner or Wisecleaner should not have any access to your Profile folders because they can delete session, password etc files and if Anti-Virus can scan files, it will cause a slow down in processes. If you let a AV scan your profile then if it finds a problem never let it fix it because you stand a good chance of losing a lot of emails. If you do want to use those types of products then I would suggest you make Thunderbird profile folder exempt from scanning. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I might be under the wrong impression that this primairy password blocks all access. That is what I expect from a password as such.

Maybe reconsider if ""password"" is the right word to use in this context.

My approach on the draft folder, for example, would be to log on to the online account and create a draft there, and then (assuming IMAP), see in what draft folder it appears in Thunderbird. Then, I would change the Thunderbird setting to use that Draft folder. Now, I would delete the folders from online account and restart thunderbird and delete them there. That has worked for me. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
