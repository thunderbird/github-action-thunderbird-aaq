Many Anti-Virus and other clean-up software like CCleaner or Wisecleaner should not have any access to your Profile folders because they can delete session, password etc files and if Anti-Virus can scan files, it will cause a slow down in processes.

I tried installing the same version that's on my desktop on my Macbook. I tried a super old version 60. I tried deleting all profiles then creating a brand new one. I tried installing on a 2nd windows desktop computer and the same result as the Macbook. I tried copying via a flash drive and via a usb hard drive. I tried using the export function but it only works up to 2gb. My profile is 2.7gb. </p>,deniselopes,false,0,0

Now that I have that figured out I'm still having mostly the same issue. I've figured out that the emails I want to access are under the ImapMail folder inside the profile. Inside Thunderbird I finally can see the local folders but just trash and outbox are there. There's no Inbox. I thought I saw that erasing the .msf files in there might rebuild the local folders... </p>,deniselopes,false,0,0
