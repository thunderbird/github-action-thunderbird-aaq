That removes password for the account - now try to retrieve mail and Google should prompt you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What happened is that it created a new account with the name bjvande@gmail.com (IMAP).   My email seems to work here, however the original account, bjvande@gmail.com is still in Thunderbird, and gives me this error message still.   Perhaps I need to delete the bjvande@gmail.com account&nbsp;?  Heading out to work, thanks for the suggestion though! </p>",bjvande,false,0,0

Tieni conto che molti provider bloccano l'accesso se registrano anomalie ad esempio sull'IP di connessione. </p><p>Una possibile soluzione è passare attraverso una VPN con server di uscita in Italia (anche Mozilla ne propone una -&gt; <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/it/products/vpn/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/it/products/vpn/</a>) Una seconda è attivare una procedura di verifica a 2 fattori (cosa che però complica notevolmente l'accesso tramite client come Thunderbird) </p>",@next,false,0,0

The next time you start up Thunderbird it should auto remember that set up. </p><p>So it should remember whether all are set as expanded or all set as collapsed. But if you have all expanded and you collapse one or two, you will find when you restart it does not remember the individual email setting. </p><p>If you find your session data etc is not being saved/remembered correctly: First check to see what programs you have got installed which are allowed to scan your thunderbird profile folders.  Many Anti-Virus and other clean-up software like CCleaner or Wisecleaner should not have any access to your Profile folders because they can delete session, password etc files and if Anti-Virus can scan files, it will cause a slow down in processes. If you let a AV scan your profile then if it finds a problem never let it fix it because you stand a good chance of losing a lot of emails. If you do want to use those types of products then I would suggest you make Thunderbird profile folder exempt from scanning. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
