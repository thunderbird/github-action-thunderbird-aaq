I recently noticed that none of the tool tips that I am accustomed to seeing in the message list display are appearing.  After some investigation I found that these tool tips reappear if I switch the message list display options to ""cards view"" (I normally have it set to ""table view""). This happens both in and out of troubleshoot mode.  This feature is extremely useful to me because I don't have to open the message to see what the subject is or who sent it. For example, one message I have displays a subject of ""Re: Allen Family P..."", from ""Carolyn Allen-Sch..."" to ""'Chris-', Karen All..."" on ""2/30/3035, 10:32..."".  Here I've chosen the worst offender in my list, to show just how much information is missing from the message list pane. Something that might be a little more important would be the message whose subject shows up as ""Receipt for Your Pa..."" from ""service@paypal.co..."" For obvious reasons, that might be a message that I just wanna delete without reading but I can't tell without the tool tips. </p><p>Obviously, I can just switch the display options to card view but then there's no quick and easy way to mark a message ""unread"" or more importantly, ""junk."" </p><p>Is there an option in config that will allow me to see these tool tips again (a quick search did not reveal any)? If not, is this a bug that needs to be fixed or a feature that will be reintroduced at some point? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1634881;,AuntieDiva
