I have just been through a thread from 11/23 full of similar problems but no solution that I could figure out.  I am ignorant.  Can anyone provide some instructions for an ignorant 88 year old to follow for at least a better diagnosis.   (I guess I'm saying that many words need definitions for me.)

We've had our <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> email accounts on Thunderbird for years, but now it doesn't get our emails because of the transfer to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a>.  We don't like yahoo.  Is there any possible way to get our cox emails from yahoo to Thunderbird?  (our email accounts didn't change). </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1658565;,boba5920

This window has been popping up today for no apparent reason. If I dismiss it, it comes back in a few minutes. It seems to be a TB process. I'm on Windows 7. I do have W10 &amp; 11 on laptops, haven't checked yet to see whether this nastiness occurs on them. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1658555;,schadel

I have to say I am not impressed. I forgot how much better TB was with the extensions. </p><p>My first question is how do I get to sort the order of items I see in TB? I want News &amp; Feeds to be displayed above my email accounts. It would seem that this would be easy but I cannot find a way of doing it. What am I not understanding? Surely this should be simple? I want to choose the order of everything. </p><p>I also customised the interface with better scrollbars etc. None of the add-ons I used to use seem to work with the latest TB. At the moment the new install of TB is incredibily ugly. How do I change that? </p>,customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1658553;,Leo.Levosky1
