1450479,2024-06-20 19:40:28 -0700,2024-06-20 21:38:38 -0700,Thunderbird stopped downloading my att email on 6-16-24,"<p>Thunderbird could not get to the att server starting Sunday; it's now Thursday night.  (Everything else inexplicably went down:  landline, internet, cell phone, even the printer.)  Now it's all back except a working Thunderbird.  Today I finally made contact with someone at att who could show me that my password was working and went through all the account variables in Thunderbird, testing them out to no avail.  Her conclusion was that the problem was on the Thunderbird side.  But I need my 30 years of files.  I have just been through a thread from 11/23 full of similar problems but no solution that I could figure out.  I am ignorant.  Can anyone provide some instructions for an ignorant 88 year old to follow for at least a better diagnosis.   (I guess I'm saying that many words need definitions for me.)  I hope I've bookmarked that long discussion with varying ideas so I can look at it again when I recover from this week.  Thanks for any help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1658398;,mskinsey
