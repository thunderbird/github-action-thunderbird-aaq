(Everything else inexplicably went down:  landline, internet, cell phone, even the printer.)  Now it's all back except a working Thunderbird.  Today I finally made contact with someone at att who could show me that my password was working and went through all the account variables in Thunderbird, testing them out to no avail.  Her conclusion was that the problem was on the Thunderbird side.  But I need my 30 years of files.  I have just been through a thread from 11/23 full of similar problems but no solution that I could figure out.  I am ignorant.  Can anyone provide some instructions for an ignorant 88 year old to follow for at least a better diagnosis.   (I guess I'm saying that many words need definitions for me.)  I hope I've bookmarked that long discussion with varying ideas so I can look at it again when I recover from this week.  Thanks for any help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1658398;,mskinsey

IMAP and SMTP seem to be retained ok.  Additionally, if we just skip past the prompts (we are using around 5 different calendars), and just go and click the ""Enable"" button....they open just fine and we don't get any prompts, until we close and re-open Thunderbird.  We're running 115.12.1 on Windows 10, 11 and Server 2022 Datacenter.  It's not a devastating problem, but a little tedious for some of our users that open and close their Thunderbird a lot during the day.  We are running ""Smartermail"" V8909 from Smarter Tools as our mail server.  Thanks in advance! </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",twortman
