For some reason, although I am supposed to be on the esr release schedule, a beta version, 131.0.1 was downloaded to my computer on Oct 22nd.  Then last night, the 128.4.0esr version was downloaded.  So indeed, there had been a newer version (or at least higher number) release on my computer, so the 128.4.0esr version didn't like the profile. I used time machine to get my latest profile with a 128 release, and that basically fixed it. But there does seem to have been an error on Mozilla's part, because I never signed up for the beta program. </p>",Lynn.Kistler,false,1,0
