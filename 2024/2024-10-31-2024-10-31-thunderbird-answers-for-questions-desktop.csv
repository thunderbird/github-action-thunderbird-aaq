For some reason, although I am supposed to be on the esr release schedule, a beta version, 131.0.1 was downloaded to my computer on Oct 22nd.  Then last night, the 128.4.0esr version was downloaded.  So indeed, there had been a newer version (or at least higher number) release on my computer, so the 128.4.0esr version didn't like the profile. I used time machine to get my latest profile with a 128 release, and that basically fixed it.

1689799,1472141,2024-11-23 23:48:12 -0800,2024-11-23 23:48:12 -0800,"<p>I'm adding to this question since I've had exactly the same problem. (I'm using Mac Sequoia 15.0.1, Thunderbird 128.4.3esr (64-bit) that is up to date). </p><p>On a Mac you can close all the Thunderbird windows yet leave the application open, i.e., the menu bar can still be accessed when no windows are open. When Thunderbird is in this state, there is no way to directly open the <em><strong>Mail &amp; Newsgroups</strong></em> window from within Thunderbird. As was said, it's possible to click the Thunderbird icon in the Mac dock to open the window. But unlike Windows, a fair number of Mac users may never use the dock, since there are other ways to start/activate applications that are often easier, especially if one prefers using the keyboard. (There was quite a fuss when Apple introduced the dock by many users who found that it would get in the way when doing certain things, such as trying to grab the bottom of a window that is close to the bottom of the screen.)  </p><p>I rarely open the dock and have been looking for the missing menu item to open the <em><strong>Mailbox</strong></em> window for a long time, only discovering that it could be opened using the dock today when Google Gemini posted a note at the top of a search suggesting it. Until now I've resorted to quitting Thunderbird and reopening it. All that is to say that using the icon in the dock to perform such a basic action in Thunderbird does seem like a bug. I think that whoever decided that the dock would be the way to do this was taking a cue from the Windows version where reopening a window using the dock is much more natural. </p><p>To make matters worse, there actually is a round-a-bout way to open the <em><strong>Mailbox</strong></em> window using Thunderbird's menus and/or shortcuts. If you open a new message (by using <em><strong>File–&gt;New–&gt;Message</strong></em> or <em><strong>Command-N</strong></em>), a mail composition window will be opened. After that, the <em><strong>Tools</strong></em> menu will contain <em><strong>Mail &amp; Newsgroups</strong></em> as the first item (and also show <em><strong>Command-1</strong></em> as a shortcut). Either of those methods will open the Mailbox window. The reason I say that it's ""worse"" is because last night, I must have had a message open when I decide to try again to find a menu item to reopen the <em><strong>Mailbox</strong></em> window and did find it in the <em><strong>Tools</strong></em> menu. I thought ""How could I possibly have missed that??"" Then today, when I needed to reopen the <em><strong>Mailbox</strong></em> window, I knew to go to the <em><strong>Tools</strong></em> menu…but it wasn't there! (The shortcut <em><strong>Command-1</strong></em> also won't work unless the command is shown in a menu.) Very confusing and very frustrating! (Screen shots of each state are attached.) Anyway, that led to my Google search which finally led me here. </p><p>So, at some point, someone decided that it would be good to have a menu item in the <em><strong>Tools</strong></em> menu to open the <em><strong>Mailbox</strong></em> window. But the idea didn't get carried over to the the items of the <em><strong>Tools</strong></em> menu when it is shown with no open windows, even though it would probably make more sense than being available when a message window is open. That's the reason I consider this to be a bug. </p><p>I think this helps explain the confusion that occurred between the people who discussed it in this series of posts. I expect that I'll open a bug report on Bugzilla, but hope this helps explain some of misunderstandings that occurred, as well as helping others who encounter the same issue themselves. </p>",zhoravdb,false,0,0

A silent failure Other things that can be implicated are.  Outlook overloading their servers and not making updates as they say they will in a timely manner.  Some years ago Hotmail moved deleted mail to a POP deleted folder,   but they failed to do it sometimes for days and the result was the same mail reappearing in Thunderbird. Some folk think their mail client is on some sort of instantaneous server connection and have it checking mail every few minutes.  This can lead to outlook simple dropping connection attempts.  This is bad is the mail client is trying to delete messages using the connection. On a similar line,  outlook limits the total connections to their server for an account to I think 5.  Thunderbird will try and use those,  but sometime a tablet and a phone will also be using connections,  so things just slow down. </p><p>The fact you say 10,000+ emails sounds like you might be attempting to do a major house cleaning. Exactly how are you deleting these mails? (generally deleted messages go to the trash folder.  Are you saying they never get there? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
