I have used the old V2 profile and works, but, I use 8 pop accounts and under V2 you just had a single joint inbox (and single folder for the rest) for all the accounts.  Worked fine and therefore didn't have a long list on the left hand pane.   Still works but IF i try to edit any of the accounts in \tools\account settings it brings up error:- ""The Local Directory path ""F:\Users\?????\Mail"" is not suitable for message storage. Please choose another directory.""   I know this mixed setting was removed back in the earlier versions, but why?   If I make changes, then they do stick...I can also edit the entries directly in prefs.js but if I want to add an account, then I have to use the profile in V2, (and delete the .msf files otherwise does od things), then add the new account then move the profile back to V115. </p><p>This seems very long winded and have no idea why this great feature was removed...any one know how to get back? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",firefox2030
