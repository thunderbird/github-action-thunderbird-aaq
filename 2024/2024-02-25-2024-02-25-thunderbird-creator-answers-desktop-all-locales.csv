But its purely by luck and with no connection to how it didn't break that time around. </p><p>I saw a post saying to change the names of the server but that's no longer working, and one saying to use '<a href=""http://smtp-mail.office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp-mail.office.com</a>' for one, '<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>' for the other nut no matter in which order ior amount i use those servers its still not working. </p><p>Is it possible that Thunderbird sandboxes the accounts properly, and it actually doesn't use the same SMTP server from another account? </p><p>Does anyone have any solution to this? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1638535;,otegaid

I need to use categories for this, as far as I know. </p><p>Now the question is, how do I <strong>select all events in one calendar</strong>, <strong>assign all of them a certain category</strong> and then <strong>move all of them</strong> to one new ""Merged"" calendar? </p><p>I tried asking AI and it seems like Thunderbird doesn't support it. If it was correct, are there some workarounds to do this, for example, some open-source scripts to modify the exported ICS files and set the categories in them? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,cs,"",ShadyMedic
