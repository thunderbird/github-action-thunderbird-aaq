I get a message that says this version is incompatible with the last.  I pay over 20 bills from folders I created in it the applications inbox, house billing info and passes and links to the pages and responses, etc.  This is a MUST for me that this thing works and works well.  Until this morning it was flawless in that capacity.  My only fix after extensive research has been to download the newest version from the website, install it and it starts fine...until I close it, then it fails  to restart with the same identifier.  Each of the two times I have closed it I go through the same thing upon an opening attempt.  Im now looking at different mail options as Im on SSI and have one  shot at paying bills a month and cant afford to be any later than ssi already makes me, though my creditors have been thus far understanding.  I now have to keep my computer on and the app open until Im paid on the 9th so I can be sure to be able to pay my bills.  I dont know what you folks are shooting for by tinkering with an already flawless system but you missed this time I m afraid.  Leave it alone or let us keep our working system while you offer ""new and improved"" to those who like to play with new toys.  Give me back my old working system  before Im forced to look elsewhere for a way to do my monthly duty to my creditors.

This sometimes leads to the situation where, in the Windows taskbar, there is no blue Thunderbird icon visible, but there are Thunderbird Write icons visible (the black-coloured fat pencil icon). The problem is that the ""Launched"" or ""Home"" icon can vanish from the Taskbar even when the Thunderbird program is open, such as for writing an email. </p><p>This person's workflow requires the blue icon to be stable - it should never disappear from the Taskbar, even if certain Thunderbird windows are closed.

A large chunk of old messages vanished, but not the oldest, and when she deletes a message it vanishes instead of going into a Deleted file. The old messages are still on the server, but Thunderbird will not download them again, I assume because it thinks she already has them.  They are there, though.  I installed her email on my version of Thunderbird and it promptly downloaded all 330 of them. I assumed something went wrong in the update so I thought if I uninstalled Thunderbird and reinstalled it, all would go back to normal.  I have done so with both a warm and a cold reboot after uninstalling and in both cases when I open Thunderbird, there is her account, faults and all. So the question is ""How do I get rid of Thunderbird completely, so that it needs the mail-box reloaded as well?"" It is beyond me why what I have done doesn't work.  Is there some other way to get the program working like it used to?  My wife is about as technophobic as they come and takes a long time to learn something new so please can we go back to the way we were?  We are both in our 80s so new tech is sometimes a challenge. Any help you can give us, in simple language please, would be appreciated.  I don't want to convert her to Access as I have never used it and wouldn't know how to teach her.
