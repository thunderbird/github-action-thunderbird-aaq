I get a message that says this version is incompatible with the last.  I pay over 20 bills from folders I created in it the applications inbox, house billing info and passes and links to the pages and responses, etc.  This is a MUST for me that this thing works and works well.  Until this morning it was flawless in that capacity.  My only fix after extensive research has been to download the newest version from the website, install it and it starts fine...until I close it, then it fails  to restart with the same identifier.  Each of the two times I have closed it I go through the same thing upon an opening attempt.  Im now looking at different mail options as Im on SSI and have one  shot at paying bills a month and cant afford to be any later than ssi already makes me, though my creditors have been thus far understanding.  I now have to keep my computer on and the app open until Im paid on the 9th so I can be sure to be able to pay my bills.  I dont know what you folks are shooting for by tinkering with an already flawless system but you missed this time I m afraid.  Leave it alone or let us keep our working system while you offer ""new and improved"" to those who like to play with new toys.  Give me back my old working system  before Im forced to look elsewhere for a way to do my monthly duty to my creditors.

This is only a nuisance, having to close the tab each time I start tbird. </p><p>I didn't post about this immediately, as I figured others would experience the same issue (or related) and devs would fix the problem.  But it has been several months now and this does get to be annoying.   I know that merely clicking a close button shouldn't be that big a deal, but I don't understand why this would become the default; moreover, why there doesn't seem to be any way to disable the calendar or at least modify this new behavior. </p><p>I've been using tbird for at least a decade and found it to be reasonably simple to use.  I use the calendar function, but only for some installations.  I would appreciate being able to change the behavior of the startup or maybe just disable calendar altogether where it isn't needed. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1665965;,systemdlete
