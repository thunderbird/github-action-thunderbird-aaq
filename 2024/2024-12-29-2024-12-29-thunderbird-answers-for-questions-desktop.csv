But you can set up a PIN for access into the Windows OS which, I guess, is what you must have done and it's this that you would use to log in at the lock screen. This is what you would enter in the TB field asking for your PIN. </p>",arlev,false,0,0

But without extensive knowledge of what security you have allowed and what privacy invasions you have permitted encouraged by Microsoft and their deceptive login dialogs there is no real way to guess what your operating system password/PIN is.  Needless to say you must be using it in other places like office365 so you should know what the procedure is. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
