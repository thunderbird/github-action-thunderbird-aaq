(to me ðŸ˜œ)  Now IÂ have at least 10 accounts and hundreds of folders and everything was fine until I started archiving some old messages in one account, and TBÂ began creating new archive folders like YYYY/YYYY-MM which were being included in the Global Search/indexer by default.  So I went to the properties of each folder and unchecked the option to include it in the Global Search results.  I could see in the Activity Monitor the indexing of that folder would stop and go on to the next one, until I disabled all 12.  Now TB is indexing over 100,000 messages but it doesn't say what folder these are in, I can't seem to find it.   </p><p>What I did find is the global-messages-db.sqlite database which, after closing TB, I made a backup of, then I found the folderLocations table with hundreds of rows and the IndexingPriority column which had various values of: -1, 20, 40, 50, and 60.  I set them all to -1 and TB is still trying to index over 100,000 messages somewhere.  Where? and how to stop its madness?! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1641259;1641282;,scarlion
