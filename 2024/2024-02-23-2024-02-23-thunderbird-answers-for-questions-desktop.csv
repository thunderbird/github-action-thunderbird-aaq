These spectrum folk have become very picky about the user name and the email address matching and you certainly can not send mail from say you@gmail.com from your Spectrum account. </p><p>Spectrum require you to be connected to the internet using their service to send mail.  Something charter folk have been complaining about while in Florida for years. (apparently Charter was not in Florida.  As I am in Australia it is all conjecture).  Given that a VPN hides you original IP address (how you provider decides you are signing into the network using their system) it will not work with their mail system to send mail as you are not accessing the internet via their system.  You may well also see issues with Google and Facebook as well as Ebay as they routinely use your IP address to determine if you are logging in from a new location.  A VPN could replort you location as Russia now and Bloemfonteinon the next connect.  Great if you are hiding your location.  but something of a bust of you are only using websites you have told where you live, like Facebook,Google, Outlook, Ebay Amazon etc.  Although sometimes they can then determine you have been hacked and start asking questions before they will sign you in or allow purchases. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If you see that, the duplicates can be deleted, but you would first need to look at the account 'server settings' pane to verify which folder was being accessed.  - if the person uses the AllMail folder, which is a full duplicate of everything, I encourage people to unsubscribe from it, since it serves no real purpose on the PC. Whatever messages are there are also in other folders.  - if you have server available, the account can be offloaded there and still work fine, e.g., drive E or G. The location is set at the account's 'server setting' pane.  - for backup, thunderbird uses a profile with accounts and settings. backup the full profile when Thunderbird is not running for best results. The profile folder is the one that includes the Imapmail folder </p><p>I am NOT the superguru here, and others may offer better suggestions. but what i mention does work. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
