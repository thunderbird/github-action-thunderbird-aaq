If you see that, the duplicates can be deleted, but you would first need to look at the account 'server settings' pane to verify which folder was being accessed.  - if the person uses the AllMail folder, which is a full duplicate of everything, I encourage people to unsubscribe from it, since it serves no real purpose on the PC. Whatever messages are there are also in other folders.  - if you have server available, the account can be offloaded there and still work fine, e.g., drive E or G. The location is set at the account's 'server setting' pane.  - for backup, thunderbird uses a profile with accounts and settings. backup the full profile when Thunderbird is not running for best results. The profile folder is the one that includes the Imapmail folder </p><p>I am NOT the superguru here, and others may offer better suggestions. but what i mention does work. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
