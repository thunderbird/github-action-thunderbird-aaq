Installed Thunderbird and connected to gmail using IMAP easy enough.  Used ReliefJet Essentials to convert a PST file to MBOX.  That process appeared to go well.  Folders were created during the process and folder structures corresponded to the folder structures in the original PST.  Each folder also contained corresponding *.mbox files.  .mbox file contents looked appropriate when opening with notepad.  Problem begins here.  My intention was to access the those messages under  ""Local Folders.""  Under local folders account settings, I pointed Message Storage 'local directly' to the folder where the directories and .mbox files are stored.  After a restart, Thunderbird sees the folders BUT NOT the individuals messages in the folders.  What have a done wrong...? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1698987;,lee.pinson

I decided to move from Pop to Imap which fixed the problem.  Somewhere in creating the new IMAP account, it asked me if I want to have messages moved to another account, to which I said yes, which would keep me from having to move all of those folders and re-create the inbox structure.  Well, that somehow removed that default profile.   I backup regularly, but just found out that the appdata branch is a hidden folder and did not get picked up.   Okay, fine.   However, my email folders are on a data drive and are fully backed up.  I have all of the data, i just need to re-establish the profile.   If I go to appdata .... profiles ... , that account is in there.   I can't import it.   I can't even import the messages.   Can you guide me to getting my default account visible again.   I'm sure there are already articles and answers, and I browsed but could not find the right one in the many, many answers provided.   I'm very tech savvy, so I'm sure I can follow the guidance given. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",Tom490
