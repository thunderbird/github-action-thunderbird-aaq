Installed Thunderbird and connected to gmail using IMAP easy enough.  Used ReliefJet Essentials to convert a PST file to MBOX.  That process appeared to go well.  Folders were created during the process and folder structures corresponded to the folder structures in the original PST.  Each folder also contained corresponding *.mbox files.  .mbox file contents looked appropriate when opening with notepad.  Problem begins here.  My intention was to access the those messages under  ""Local Folders.""  Under local folders account settings, I pointed Message Storage 'local directly' to the folder where the directories and .mbox files are stored.  After a restart, Thunderbird sees the folders BUT NOT the individuals messages in the folders.  What have a done wrong...? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lee.pinson

There is a blank spot where I would think it would give what the reminder was..
