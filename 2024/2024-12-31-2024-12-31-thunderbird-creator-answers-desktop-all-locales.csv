Installed Thunderbird and connected to gmail using IMAP easy enough.  Used ReliefJet Essentials to convert a PST file to MBOX.  That process appeared to go well.  Folders were created during the process and folder structures corresponded to the folder structures in the original PST.  Each folder also contained corresponding *.mbox files.  .mbox file contents looked appropriate when opening with notepad.  Problem begins here.  My intention was to access the those messages under  ""Local Folders.""  Under local folders account settings, I pointed Message Storage 'local directly' to the folder where the directories and .mbox files are stored.  After a restart, Thunderbird sees the folders BUT NOT the individuals messages in the folders.

Since my e-mail server is not connected to Microsoft, I was able to continue using Thunderbird without issue. However, after having signed in to my Xbox account after not accessing it for several months, I became unable to login to my e-mail server, as it failed to accept my password or any other I put in. </p><p>After searching for solutions, the general consensus I found was that Thunderbird was attempting to connect to Microsoft's servers, but couldn't because its authentication method was set to 'Normal Password'. I've tried changing my authentication method, but changing my authentication method to anything other than 'Normal Password' gives me a 'Your e-mail provider does not support this authentication method' message. </p><p>I've had this problem before (see <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1432194"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1432194</a>), which happened after I set up two-step verification initially, but i don't know how I solved the problem before, and obviously it wasn't a permanent solution.   </p><p>What I find strange is that, since I don't use an Outlook account, this issue either shouldn't be happening at all, or I shouldn't have been able to regain access in the first place. </p><p>I'm not sure what to do next. Since my provider apparently doesn't support OAuth2, is there anything I can do about this, or am I pretty much sunk? Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Specs: E-mail provider: Spectrum (Listed as ""Roadrunner/TWC"") E-mail server: <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>, IMAP, SSL/TLS, Port 993, Normal Password Outgoing server: <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>, IMAP, STARTTLS, Port 587, Normal Password ISP Provider: Charter Communications OS: Windows 10 Thunderbird version: 128 </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",Plasmius
