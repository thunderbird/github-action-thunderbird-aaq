I created my own installation path, as permitted by the Thunderbird installation instruction which included a ""Local Folders"" folder as a placeholder for all of my wife mail folders. But after copying all of her mail folder to C:Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\Local Folders - Thunderbird can't find them . The installation app gave no warning of impending doom. Any ideas about what might have gone wrong? I installed Thunderbird several times into slightly different paths - but not the default because I do my own backups and need to know where my files are located. Even though I am the administrator of the system I also got some messages telling me I wasn't an authorized user. Thanks for any tips, ideas or even complete solutions are appreciated.

I have configured my Gmail account to be used on TB using IMAP. I am noticing that TB is downloading all my emails from my Gmail. I do not want this. I only want to see the header of the emails, and if I click on the email, then it can download it. I don't want TB to take up a lot of space on my laptop. </p><p>Do you have any suggestions on how I can do this?
