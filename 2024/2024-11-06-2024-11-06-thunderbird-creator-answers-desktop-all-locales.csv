So I logged in on-line to Outlook and found if I added email addresses to the on-line Outlook Contact list (address book) that usually they would then come through. I had to add hundreds of emails, but many are still not downloading. Some would pop up and ask to be added to a safe sender's list (all in the on-line office 365/outlook).  </p><p>Do you know what is going on and why all my emails will not download? Also I can no longer access the spam folder in Thunderbird. It shows that there is spam, there is a number on the folder, but I can only view those spam messages by logging into Office365 and using the on-line Outlook.  </p><p>I know that I am not the only one with this issue as I have talked to others who also are experiencing this even people using Outlook and not Thunderbird. I do not have any issue with my <a href=""http://Earthlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Earthlink.net</a> email accounts, so I know it is a Microsoft created issue.  </p><p>Please let me know if you know a work-a-round for this issue.

About 2 months ago, I tried it a first time and had an issue that prevented me from sending emails from my Hotmail email accounts. I gave up after a week of troubleshooting. </p><p>Outlook has come up with more bugs and shenanigans, so I tried again, convinced that there had to be a solution. And I found one. If anyone is interested, I was getting the error ""Login to server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> with username &lt;...&gt; failed"", and the way I fixed it was by replacing ""<a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>"" with ""<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>"" in the server settings. However, not all is fixed yet. </p><p><strong>Current problem</strong> I noticed that the messages in my Outlook mail (other than the inbox) are not syncing properly. When I start TB, it appears to sync folders because I have seen new emails in subfolders already. However, if new emails come in while TB is open, it only syncs them if they are in my inbox. </p><p>I have looked around already and found that when I right-click that email account and I choose ""Subscribe..."", it presents me with an empty list and I can't see or enable/disable any folder subscriptions (refresh does nothing). This is strange because of 2 reasons: 1. All my subfolders are there, and they seem to sync when I start up TB. But even if I immediately open the subscribe window, the list is empty. 2. I have a total of 4 email accounts configured, 2 Outlook and 2 Gmail. All except for 1 Outlook account show me the list of folders in the subscribe window, so that made me think it was something in my Outlook account settings. However, nothing I can find there seems to be helpful. </p><p>Does anyone have an idea on how to fix this? I'd rather not close and re-open my TB app each time I want to check for new messages. I really want to give TB an honest chance but it's not making it easy for me to like it right now. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1686316;,jef.van_laer
