For some reason all of my existing filters stopped working along with the logs. I can type in a filter then manually run it ok which works but it does not log.

So I logged in on-line to Outlook and found if I added email addresses to the on-line Outlook Contact list (address book) that usually they would then come through. I had to add hundreds of emails, but many are still not downloading. Some would pop up and ask to be added to a safe sender's list (all in the on-line office 365/outlook).  </p><p>Do you know what is going on and why all my emails will not download? Also I can no longer access the spam folder in Thunderbird. It shows that there is spam, there is a number on the folder, but I can only view those spam messages by logging into Office365 and using the on-line Outlook.  </p><p>I know that I am not the only one with this issue as I have talked to others who also are experiencing this even people using Outlook and not Thunderbird. I do not have any issue with my <a href=""http://Earthlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Earthlink.net</a> email accounts, so I know it is a Microsoft created issue.  </p><p>Please let me know if you know a work-a-round for this issue.
