It shows the total messages, as well as counts of ones that are new and ones that are filtered out.  These are all on my PC.  I have compared messages to what is on the server directly and have not seen an issue.  Maybe its only an issue of the way TB counts but it raises concerns that messages are disappearing in the ether somewhere.  As a software engineer, I understand how counts can be off but it is very concerning and if I have to always check emails directly, it kind of removes the reason to use TB at all.  As a software person, I also know firsthand that simple mistakes in a process can result in inaccurate answers; hopefully, this is only a cosmetic issue (counts) but I can't imagine that this only effects me, so others would have had a similar experience. </p><p>The above is on a Windows 10 pc.  I converted an older pc to linux and installed TB there.  I don't normally have this one up (I brought it up so others in the family can see if they want to shift.  My local servers are all Linux.) I see the total message count, which exactly matches the downloaded count.  This is a new install and has NO filtering being done. </p><p>Maybe if I can remove all the filtering and start over the counts will even out.  What method do I use to remove ALL the filtering?  After that, we'll see where we stand. </p>",dmatusow,false,0,0

Leaving unticked will leave the message files, but will NOT be visible within Thunderbird (but are there to see in windows file manager.)  My suggestion, since you want to be fully safe, is this: - install importexporttools-NG if not already done. - in Local Folder, create a new folder with name of account (or whatever you wish). for my example, I will call it XXX - now, highlight one of the folders in account to be deleted. Press cntl, hold down while dragging folder to the XXX folder - repeat for all other folders.  - now, pause and review that all is well. If you're a bit paranoid, exit thunderbird and restart  just for sanity.  - at this time, you should have all POP message folders in Local folders, and can now delete the account. You can now tick the box to remove all account data.  - final step is to do backup:  - exit thunderbird (IMPORTANT) - using windows file explorer, copy the full profile to external media, possibly to two separate media if messages are vital.  - if you're unsure where profile is, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down left side to 'profile folder' , click 'open folder', and then EXIT thunderbird, you are now in the profile. click the back arrow two folders so that you're at the folder named 'Thunderbird.'

I do not have a retired email address. I own Domain A. Domain A used to redirect through Domain B and Google Workspaces. Once I decided to move away from Google Workspaces, I installed Thunderbird. I set up email account with Domain A. Connected it to Google, downloaded all the emails from the Workspace to local drive. Changed all the information in the account (mail servers, etc. to go through the hosting and directly through Domain A). It worked perfectly until now: no prompts to log in, nothing. Then, correlating with Thunderbird updating to 128.0.1, I started getting prompts. My first guess was that there was some old setting somewhere that was overridden by my new settings but never deleted, and the new update reactivated it and is trying to simultaneously connect to both, but I can't find any trace of that domain anywhere in my settings. </p> <blockquote>So let's see what account Thunderbird thinks you have that it will be trying to connect to.
