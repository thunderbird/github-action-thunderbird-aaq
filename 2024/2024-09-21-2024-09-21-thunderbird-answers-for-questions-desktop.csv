It is not set by default for Junk/Spam and deleted/trash folders by default so your unified folder is probably not getting a ""refresh when you delete because of it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

When you receive it in Inbox, put email into the suitable folder 'TBirdHelp' </p><p>OR if you want to create a note for yourself use the current system available but do not want to send a loadof emails. Click on 'Write' and compose the info like you are writing an email The 'Subject' can be a good reference eg: Subscribe info  then save it as a Template. File &gt; Save as &gt; Template </p><p>Now normally Templates are emails that you create to reuse so they save time. Maybe that is a folder you have not used much, so you can use it for something more useful for you. There's nothing stopping you from using the same folder for storing helpful notes. Then it would be easy to search as well. Sort by Subject so it's alphabetical and easy to scan over. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
