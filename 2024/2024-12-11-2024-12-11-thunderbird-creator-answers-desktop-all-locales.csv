I could still log in to <em><a href=""https://outlook.live.com/owa/?realm=hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?realm=hotmail.com</a></em> from the Firefox browser. I tried adjusting Account Settings (e.g. Server Name, Server Type [POP], Security/Authentication, etc. to no avail. I downloaded the current version of Thunderbird (128?) and tried installing per directions found here. Tried using the Flatpak path.  The direct Command Line path yielded the same result. </p><p><em>dave@Sequimer:~$ sudo flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.Thunderbird </em> [sudo] password for dave:           Skipping: org.mozilla.Thunderbird/x86_64/stable is already installed<em> </em> </p><p>I've done a backup and moved to  lesser machine which works but it is slow and I want to get back to the original configuration.  Now I'm accumulating saved emails on this backup machine while prior emails are saved on the original machine.  I'll want to merge them when the login problem is resolved. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your attention to this. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",diplomatdave88
