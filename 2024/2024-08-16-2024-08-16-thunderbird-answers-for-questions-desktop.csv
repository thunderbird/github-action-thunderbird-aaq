Okay, end of homily.  </p><p>Okay, this may sound strange, but here is the real way to set fonts on Thunderbird. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. If you like large fonts for your viewing, I suggest starting with 18.  - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) NOTE: You will still see message in BellMT if that is what you set in Latin and Otherwritingsystems, but the compose window will show 'Variable Width'). - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. You will see the fonts in your preferred size, and recipients will see in their own preferred size.  This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 40 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

No one said they were servers.  </p><p>Each folder you mention is the 'mail account name' folder used to store all files to do specifically with mail storage for the account. When you have accounts that use the same server settings, the 'mail account name' folders may have same name as the server but additional ones will have a number appended so you can differentiate. AS in your case you use the Yahoo server.  The yahoo server states you must use this incoming 'Server name': <a href=""http://imap.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.yahoo.com</a> If this is a second yahoo mail account/email address you have created then you will see a 'folder' created in the profile for account storage of emails and it will append a number eg: <a href=""http://imap.mail.yahoo-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.yahoo-1.com</a> Notice it uses the server name as part of the folder name. </p><p>When you are in the Account Settings and select 'Server Settings', at the bottom on the right in 'Local directory:..' you will see at the very end the name of the mail account folder and this tells you which profile and mail account folder that particular mail account is using for it's storage. AS you have shown in your image it uses the account name folder&nbsp;: <a href=""http://imap.mail.yahoo-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.yahoo-1.com</a> </p><p>The Section at the top of the Account Settings &gt; Server Settings - where it says 'Server name:'  this is the name of the server which the account/email address will use to access the server.  It is not an account name and it is not a folder and the 'Server name' data is not pointing to any folder even if it looks like a folder name displayed in the profile. In the image you supplied - that 'Server name'&nbsp;: was incorrect and you correctly edited it. An incorrect 'Server name' will mean you cannot access server with that bad name. </p><p>This additional information has been posted because for anyone reading this question, they may need to understand exactly what is a 'mail account', a 'mail account folder',  that the  'Local directory' is where a mail account points to a folder being used to store emails etc and that the 'Server name' is not a folder, it is the name of the incoming server as dictated by the server which in this instance is Yahoo. </p><p>In the original question and I quote the person who posted the question ""both accounts were pointing to one folder"" That would mean both yahoo mail accounts the  'Local directory' information was pointing to same one folder. However, the issue was not about anything pointing to a folder. It was a Server Setting - in particular the 'Server Name' which was incorrect. </p><p>The postee of question was correct to say this needing to be edited and fixed, but incorrect in stating that information was 'pointing to one folder'.  Hence causing some intial confusion. </p><p>As a heads up - do not use capital letters when you post comments as it implies shouting which is rude, unecessary and not encouraged in the forum - it's all to do with etiquette.  After all, why would anyone want to be rude to someone they do not know and who offers help or advise or information which is freely offered in a voluntary unpaid capacity. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I inferred that Thunderbird wasn't starting and that you wanted to save the local mail messages and start over. Although that works, it would be easier in such a situation to just create a new profile and copy the messages in afterwards. But that doesn't seem to be the real problem, as you mentioned the account as IMAP. So, a clearer definition may help. Is it that there are messages in the IMAP account that you need, but Thunderbird becomes unresponsive before you can copy them?  </p><p>My thoughts now are on 'why' thunderbird becomes responsive. Is it a large message file? If so, TB may be struggling with sync'ing all the messages, in which case there would be little value in copying what is on the PC. Until the messages are sync'd, you would have only headers. Is it that there are other accounts in the profile that are competing for the same resources? If so, it may be worthwhile to create an additional profile with just the one account so TB will have to focus on just that task to download. In summary, for IMAP, I wouldn't feel safe copying message folder without a full sync and clicking File&gt;offline&gt;download if in doubt.

I  ran Thunderbird/Tools/Export. 2. I chose to export to a zip file as my total messages are nothing like 2GB. 3. Once the export had completed I I deleted a mail message from one of my Local Folders. 4. I then ran Thunderbird Import and chose the exported file. Hey presto the deleted message in 3. was now there. This strikes me as being a neat and simple way to do back-up and restore. However, could there be some issues with this solution which I have no encountered.  You mentioned in your other replies about restoring to the same version of Thunderbird from which back-ups were made.

Surely a newer version should handle older mail messages etc?</em> </p><p>The option I mentioned about accessing and getting a copy of the 'Thunderbird' folder&nbsp;: That Thunderbird folder contains everything. It's not just a backup of emails. It contains the 'profiles.ini' file - Thunderbird uses this file to detect profiles. It will contain all your profile name folders - ok most people may only use one - I have three - one is the main one used in Thunderbird version 115.14.0 and another is used by a beta version 130.0b1, the third  - well I created a backup as just in case&nbsp;! It contains all the various mail accounts and all the emails. So you can use it just to reimport those files. It contains all the address books and everything to do with Calendar. Backing up that 'Thunderbird' folder is more than just being able to use to restore mbox files or a single profile. It can also be used to restore address books etc.  But if you were moving from computer A to computer B then that 'Thunderbird' folder means you can quickly and easilly move everything in one go and all is set up. </p><p>Knowing the version which the backup last used may be important. It should be able to be used if you are using the next updated version.  It can also be used in some previous versions. Sometimes you may need to delete a particular file - eg: compatibility.ini  to force Thunderbird to work with a different version.  Sometimes, a backup which is a bit older may not be using the same file format as newer versions. But knowing which version last worked can be helpful as old versions can still be downloaded and installed. Indeed I did have a person who used an old profile backup - they installed the correct version - got the profile working and then proceeded to install specific versions to get all their files properly updated to new formats.  </p><p>So, there is no real issue if you use a complete backup just to recover emails - it can work in any version. It's more to do with moving the entire Thunderbird set up or completely reinstalling the lot then it may prove handy to know the version. If things go wrong then you know what version will definitely work and can move forward. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p> <pre>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0 =unthreaded    Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.    ------------ 	 To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: This must be done on an account by account basis. - select table view  - the icon just to right of 'quick filter' button above message list pane - select a message folder and apply all desired attributes - View&gt;sort by from menu bar (if not shown, click alt key) - click the icon at right side of column display in message list pane - select the entry near bottom 'Apply current view to...' - highlight 'folder and children' - move mouse left to see account name and move left again to display all account folders. Now CLICK. - a small menu will appear to confirm setting all folders within that account.  I did a simple (okay, crude) video at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts	  - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

It must be frustrating, especially when important emails are involved. </p><p>Based on what you've described, it sounds like there could be a few potential causes for the problem: </p><p>Corrupted Index Files: Sometimes, after an update, the index files that Thunderbird uses to keep track of emails can become corrupted. You can try rebuilding the index for the affected folders by right-clicking on the folder, selecting ""Properties,"" and then clicking ""Repair Folder."" This might help Thunderbird properly display the contents of those emails. </p><p>Compact Folders: If the inbox or sent items folder has become too large, even after moving emails to archive folders, you might need to compact the folders. Right-click on the folder and select ""Compact"" to clear out space and possibly resolve the issue. </p><p>Profile Integrity: The Thunderbird profile might have some integrity issues due to the recent update. Creating a new profile and importing the emails from the old profile could be a solution if other methods don't work. </p><p>Add-ons and Extensions: Sometimes, add-ons or extensions can cause conflicts after an update. Try disabling any add-ons or extensions to see if that resolves the problem. </p><p>Your situation reminds me of how essential it is to keep everything in order, whether it's managing emails or finding the right item on the McDonald's <a href=""https://mcdonadmenu.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">menu in the UK</a> menu in the UK. Just like you rely on Thunderbird to organize and access important messages, customers rely on clear and accessible information to make their dining choices. Ensuring everything is in the right place—whether in an inbox or on a menu—makes all the difference. </p><p>I hope one of these steps helps you resolve the issue. If the problem persists, reaching out to Thunderbird’s support team for more detailed assistance might be the next best step. </p>",emanfatima81997,true,0,0
