It frustrates you and can be annoying to recipients who receive messages from you in YOUR font and in YOUR chosen font size. I suggest letting recipients pick their own fonts and sizes. Okay, end of homily.  </p><p>Okay, this may sound strange, but here is the real way to set fonts on Thunderbird. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. If you like large fonts for your viewing, I suggest starting with 18.  - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) NOTE: You will still see message in BellMT if that is what you set in Latin and Otherwritingsystems, but the compose window will show 'Variable Width'). - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. You will see the fonts in your preferred size, and recipients will see in their own preferred size.  This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 40 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Right clickon folder and select 'Compact'  - it should offer info in the bottom Status bar. </p><p>If you are using an imap account then there is a lot of jibber jabber between imap account and server.

All too frequently, the AV program causes all sorts of slow down.  If you have an AV scanning every file that gets opened and every file that gets uploaded etc then it will slow down the process.  I would start by stopping Anti-Virus from scanning your profile files each time they get opened. </p><p>If you have your profile in the default location then this is the 'Thunderbird'  folder you need to make exempt from scanning that folder or any of it's folders and files contained therein.

If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p> <pre>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0 =unthreaded    Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.    ------------ 	 To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: This must be done on an account by account basis. - select table view  - the icon just to right of 'quick filter' button above message list pane - select a message folder and apply all desired attributes - View&gt;sort by from menu bar (if not shown, click alt key) - click the icon at right side of column display in message list pane - select the entry near bottom 'Apply current view to...' - highlight 'folder and children' - move mouse left to see account name and move left again to display all account folders. Now CLICK. - a small menu will appear to confirm setting all folders within that account.  I did a simple (okay, crude) video at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts	  - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.
