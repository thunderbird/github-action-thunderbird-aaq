Maybe it was an Xfinity/comcast problem.  At least it seems to be working, albiet slowly. </p><p>Well, now it quit working again. </p>",JudsonMcCranie,false,0,0

MircroSoft only allows five simultaneous connections and by default Thunderbird uses all five.  So if you've also got a smartphone or something checking your e-mail you're in trouble. </p><p>Go to Account Settings &gt; Server Settings and and click the Advanced box.  In that change <em>Maximum number of server connections to cache</em> to 1. </p>,thepillenwerfer,false,0,0

With Firefox the ESR channel versions was more for Enterprise users in mind as they like to have long term stability. Though they have been used to help support older OS's for a extended time currently and in past like for example <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-support-windows-xp-and-vista"" rel=""nofollow"">Fx 52 ESR and WinXP/Vista</a>.  </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-128-nebula-faq#w_why-is-thunderbird-128-labeled-as-128-0esr-when-previous-versions-were-not-called-esr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-128-nebula-faq#w_why-is-thunderbird-128-labeled-as-128-0esr-when-previous-versions-were-not-called-esr</a> </p><p>The Thunderbird releases were being released in a ESR like fashion already and not rapid release like with Firefox releases as you can see by scrolling down <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/releases/</a>. It looks like the Thunderbird devs and community is going to have rapid release again along with ESR channel and the existing Beta and Daily channels builds.  </p><p>Though the older Tb 115 ESR is coming to an end with Tb 115.15.0esr in September perhaps being the last update along side the Firefox 115.15.0esr. I have seen talk of perhaps extending updates with Thunderbird and or Firefox 115 in order to support Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and macOS 10.12, 10.13, 10.14 users a while longer. as Tb/Fx 116.0 or later requirs Win10/11 and macOS 10.15 or later to run. </p>",James,false,0,0
