If your account is IMAP,  then have you set the filter to run after classification? </p><p>Most filter actions only apply to the header of the email and filter execute as early in the download as possible. Knowing when the body is actually available post download to filter against can be a problem and something which appear to affect IMAP accounts more than POP ones.  Moving the filter execution to after classification means that the body must be there as it is used in junk filtering and generally it fixes issues where the body is not initially there when the filter would normally execute. </p><p>Personally I just run filters after classification as it make them just a little more reliable. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I promptly install updates for Firefox and all my other applications. For my operating system, I have Apple install security updates automatically.  For other OS updates, if I am in the middle of an important project, I often check Tidbits first, and usually then finish up my work and install the update.  </p><p>The only exceptions are when I really must finish something before taking the risk of an update.  I'm a software architect with forty years of experience, so I am well aware of all the different classes of security risks.   (As you will expect, I am also well aware of the risks to my work of making any update. I do my best to strike the proper balance. And I do accept responsibility for my decisions.) </p><p>Of course, I want to keep my mail reader right up to date with security updates.  And with Thunderbird, I used to always install updates either immediately, or before shutting down.  Thus, I promptly installed SuperNova when it was offered.  </p><p>I tried to live with SuperNova, but it is simply not possible for me.   </p><p>One example:  I work on cases for years at a time, and keep messages in a single folder.  I have been doing this with Thunderbird for twenty years.  But when I scroll down for a ways and select a message, SuperNova scrolls the display back up a ways, hiding the context of the the message I just selected among the other messages right before and after it in time. </p><p>(I can think of no reason for scrolling a list when someone selects an item in that list. That must be a failure in UI testing.) </p><p>I lived with this for a long time, because I thought I the Thunderbird Project gave me no other choice. Then I decided it made my work far too difficult; that I had no choice but to switch to another mail reader.   While considering the choices, I discovered that the Thunderbird workers provide us users a way to switch back to an earlier version. Hurrah!  </p><p>Then, in a couple of weeks of frequent interruptions and clicks to not-update, I made a mistake.  Heads down in work, and having stepped away from the machine for a short time, just as I returned the update request popped up and--somehow thinking it was the application I was working in, ... ... I stupidly clicked [Update].  Then I had to take time away from work to do the downgrade again. </p><p>Please continue to help me.  What are one or more non-supported methods? </p><p>Just as an example:  What about adding to the profile the distribution folder with the policies.json script? </p><p>Thanks again and much. </p>",joaquin.oakland,false,0,0

Intrigued you might say. </p><p>In latest version there has been much improvement in the control of font size, allowing users to set different font size for UI and another for Reading /Writing emails. It use to be quite awkward but now all can be done via Menus and Settings. </p><p>Are you aware that you can set a default font size to be used in the general UI via: Menu app icon &gt; Font Size </p><p>In addition, you can set a default size for what would be referred to as 'Medium' to be used in the Message Pane and in the composing area when writing emails&nbsp;? </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Scroll down to 'Languages &amp; Appearance' </li><li> click on 'Advanced' </li></ul> <ul><li> Fonts for 'Latin' to set up western encoding </li><li> Set Proportional Size, Monospace Size and then Minimium font size (which must not be larger than the other sizes.) </li></ul> <p>whatever you set up for Proportional will be what Thunderbird uses as 'Medium'. </p><p>then select&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> Fonts for: 'Other Writing Systems' to set up unicode encoding </li><li> Set all the same identical sizes as you did for the 'Latin' </li></ul> <p>then reset fonts for back to 'Latin' if that was your initial setting. </p><p>Repeat the above for any other options you use such as Cyrillic </p><p>Click on Ok </p><p>In Settings &gt; Composition Size: choose 'Medium' </p><p>Then when you compose emails if you set up Proportional as 14, then 14px will be Medium - the default size. If you wish to increase or decrease text then use the Formatting bar options. </p><p>The huge benefit of using the above means whatever you like to be as medium will suit you, but if your recipient has medium set up to be much larger because they might not have as good  eyesight, then whatever they use as Mediun over rides it. This basically means you are sending emails which are user friendly. </p><p>Many people do not seem to realise that just because they set specific sizes in their emails, it does not mean their recipients will see the same.  That also includes when people choose to set a specific font. Not all computers and all Operating Systems have the same font.  </p><p>Any email sent to me uses the font I choose and the size I dictate. So your line that uses Bookman Old Style and font size of 6 would be replaced by Arial and font size 12.   So, I'm wondering why you still feel it's necessary. I use the html editing if I need to highlight text, but that's on rare occasions. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

I would almost guarantee the issue is Norton. </p><p>My last disastrous encounter with Norton (years in the past now) I was trying to add a new account for a friend.  I had to disable something called SONAR, the mail scanner and scanning of encrypted connections before anything started working. </p><p>Fundamentally Norton is a huge blocking tool.  It was probably 15 years ago the CEO if Symantec came out and said that virus scanning was not going to work and that Norton would be pivoting to allowing known software.  The result is Thunderbird updates from say 102.0.1 to 102.0.2 and Norton looses the plot and refused to allow access to the internet.  So checking the firewall requires more than a name is required a precise version number for each application is used.  Most Nortons users have issues for a day or two until Nortons gets a message from home there is a new version and the problem fixes itself.  But the product should no be just blocking stuff waiting for someone from the vendor to approve it.  It should be asking you. </p><p>Using Outlook,  this is not such an issue as they come out with a new version every other year or longer.  Market share also means Nortons are more prepared for Outlooks updates. </p><p>Check that you have no VPN.  For various reasons, they are basically a death knell for email clients.  Not the least of which is providers like Google know where your phone is via the email app and you then try and connect from somewhere else,  another country often, so the ""you have been hacked"" stuff kicks in.  Very inconvenient and most unnecessary. </p><p>Now that Norton is in the same Gen Digital stable as Avast, LifeLock, Avira, AVG, ReputationDefender and CCleaner I would wonder if they are all going to start doing essentially the same thing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
