All of my emails in the Hotmail folder were marked as read.  After searching online and trying some of the solutions (I do not have Bitdefender), I finally turned off automatic marking as read.  However, when I marked the email I was reading in the preview pane, all the emails before and after it were marked as read.  Even weirder, after manually marking a group of emails as unread, after a while, I sat and watched those emails get marked as read (un-bold) and then marked as unread again (bold).  So, at this point, I have no viable solution. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Thespian

In Windows Live Mail, I could write a message and hit send, which then put it in the outbox. Then, but only then, I could either manually send the message (send and receive) or have the program do so automatically every x minutes.  In TB, when I hit send, it simply sends the message.  Is there a way to store messages in the outbox until I'm ready for them to be sent?  Do I need to go offline and then back online to do that?  If so, I assume that means that when I'm offline, I can't receive any messages. If there are messages in the outbox and I go online, do they get sent when I hit ""get messages?"" </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1663619;1663621;,jsg11
