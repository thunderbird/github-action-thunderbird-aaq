All of my emails in the Hotmail folder were marked as read.  After searching online and trying some of the solutions (I do not have Bitdefender), I finally turned off automatic marking as read.  However, when I marked the email I was reading in the preview pane, all the emails before and after it were marked as read.  Even weirder, after manually marking a group of emails as unread, after a while, I sat and watched those emails get marked as read (un-bold) and then marked as unread again (bold).

Unfortunately, nobody was able to help me. A senior forum member told me that this problem was known, but that nobody was looking into it. Now to my problem: According to their help pages for Thunderbird, you can search partial expressions and complete expressions in the global search. To do this, you put the complete expression in inverted commas. I have tried this several times with different expressions. Unfortunately, no matter whether with or without inverted commas, only the partial expression is searched for. Example: ""D-Link"" Thunderbird searches for Link and not for D-Link. I have also restarted the search indexing. Unfortunately without any improvement. So my question is: are you aware of the problem? If so, are you endeavouring to rectify the error?

TB displays in 1 window with 4 tabs (Mail, calendar, address book, tasks). In the Address Book (AB) tab when I double click on a contact to edit or view it, a new window used to open. I found that most useful. For a while now, the contact opens in a pane in the address book tab:  -Either a large pane to the right of the existing AB panes, requiring the TB window to be widened such that it takes up most of my 27"" display (when table layout is not chosen).  -Or a new pane at the bottom of the address book tab which makes a small area to edit, and a small area to view the list of contacts (when Table Layout is not chosen). Question:  Can TB Contacts be configured to open a contact in a new window (or new tab) instead of a new pane in the AB tab? Thanks!!! </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1664247;,KenOgle1
