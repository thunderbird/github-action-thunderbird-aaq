All of my emails in the Hotmail folder were marked as read.  After searching online and trying some of the solutions (I do not have Bitdefender), I finally turned off automatic marking as read.  However, when I marked the email I was reading in the preview pane, all the emails before and after it were marked as read.  Even weirder, after manually marking a group of emails as unread, after a while, I sat and watched those emails get marked as read (un-bold) and then marked as unread again (bold).  So, at this point, I have no viable solution. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Thespian

In Windows Live Mail, I could write a message and hit send, which then put it in the outbox. Then, but only then, I could either manually send the message (send and receive) or have the program do so automatically every x minutes.  In TB, when I hit send, it simply sends the message.  Is there a way to store messages in the outbox until I'm ready for them to be sent?  Do I need to go offline and then back online to do that?  If so, I assume that means that when I'm offline, I can't receive any messages. If there are messages in the outbox and I go online, do they get sent when I hit ""get messages?"" </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1663619;1663621;1663629;1663638;,jsg11

Initially was able to receive messages from his side without any issues. Last week I observed that all messages received from this sender move to spam folder. I have already marked sender as not junk, add sender address to my personal address book and supposedly Thunderbird will not mark message as junk if is in your personal address book, I have also  reset Junk training data. However although sender emails marked as not junk and moved to inbox after short time return to spam folder. Is it something that I am missing? FYI I have already search for a solution but nothing worked.  Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mastoras1969

If you can help me with the following problem, I’ll be grateful. </p><p>I added three already-existing Gmail accounts to Thunderbird using IMAP, and everything was working fine. But when a week later I added a fourth account (once again with IMAP) -- not a <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> account this time, but one hosted by Gmail -- Thunderbird did strange things with the downloading of all the messages. It seemed at first to be working fine: downloading first all the message headers, then the messages in the Inbox, then those in the All Mail folder and in various other folders. I began using the new account, and everything seemed good. </p><p>But later on it started downloading all the Inbox messages again (only for this new account), but this time progressively more slowly. In fact, it slowed Thunderbird down so much that it became unusable. </p><p>I quit Thunderbird and restarted, but that didn’t help: It began once again to download inbox messages, very slowly, making Thunderbird once again unusably slow. </p><p>At this point I deleted the new account (including all the message data), then added it once again. But I ran into the same problem. </p><p>The Inbox in Gmail has about 37,000 messages, and the All Mail folder, about 47,000. There are no messages in the Trash. </p><p>Thanks very much for any help you can give me. </p><p>All the best, Alan </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",aheubert1

This has caused me to have to go edit dozens of rules to get filters working again. </p><p>I have seen this with two scenarios: 1. Expired certificate on my mail server 2. Flaky (as in really flaky) WiFi in the hotel I am currently staying in </p><p>Both of these are a big problem.  Network errors should not cause problems with filter definitions and deleting the targets is a really bad idea.  I'm okay with having to rerun the filters, but not having to spend minutes to hours repairing the filter rules. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",technoronin
