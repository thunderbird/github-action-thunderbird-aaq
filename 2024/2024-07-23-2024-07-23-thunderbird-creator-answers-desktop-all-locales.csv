All of my emails in the Hotmail folder were marked as read.  After searching online and trying some of the solutions (I do not have Bitdefender), I finally turned off automatic marking as read.  However, when I marked the email I was reading in the preview pane, all the emails before and after it were marked as read.  Even weirder, after manually marking a group of emails as unread, after a while, I sat and watched those emails get marked as read (un-bold) and then marked as unread again (bold).

Unfortunately, nobody was able to help me. A senior forum member told me that this problem was known, but that nobody was looking into it. Now to my problem: According to their help pages for Thunderbird, you can search partial expressions and complete expressions in the global search. To do this, you put the complete expression in inverted commas. I have tried this several times with different expressions. Unfortunately, no matter whether with or without inverted commas, only the partial expression is searched for. Example: ""D-Link"" Thunderbird searches for Link and not for D-Link. I have also restarted the search indexing. Unfortunately without any improvement. So my question is: are you aware of the problem? If so, are you endeavouring to rectify the error? If so, when? </p><p>with kind regards Jürgen Huber </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",butch.triathlet
