Delete all the very old mail - after all you should have a copy on computer in profile. Empty the server Spam folder. Empty the server TRash folder. This should free up some space on server, so new mail can be received. </p><p>If you were using an <strong>IMAP</strong> mail account&nbsp;: If there are no new emails in webmail account, then nothing can get downloaded.  Please note: Anything you delete from  webmail account will get deleted from an imap account, because imap accounts can only show whatever is on the server. So be careful what you delete. Empty the server Spam folder and Empty the Server TRash. </p><p>IF in Thunderbird, the Inbox Properties Quota said it was full, then you need to fix in Thunderbird. Copy important emails into a suitably named folder in 'Local Folders' mail account. Please double check you can still read that copied email. If copy is good then delete the original from the Imap folder. Repeat for all important emails. Finally... Right click on imap folder and select 'Compact' to remove all the old traces of moved emails from file. This should free up some space. You can check how much space is available via Properties &gt; Quota. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1

That is a dropdown menu and click the one with the right description. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I thought that's what I needed but couldn't find the right button to click -- and no wonder -- it was at the top of the page in plain sight.  &nbsp;:) </p><p>I'm up and running again on all computers but am curious how that could have happened on all three computers (two of which did not have TB running when I got the power outage. Roadrunner assured me by phone that they haven't recently changed their login policies and so the only other thing I can think of is that TB just now updated to a version that will no longer support the concept of a &lt;Default&gt; SMPTE server. That would not explain, however, why this help board is not flooded with similar complaints. Would appreciate your thoughts just to satisfy my curiosity. Thanks again. </p>",joehimself,false,0,0

This is happening because email providers are increasing security by demanding that users of their servers be customers and the SMTP authentication does that. In your case, I wonder if you found several SMTP servers already there on that screen. DId you? Or was there just one when you added the others?  My 'guess' is that thunderbird allocated the right SMTP server but, since there was no name in description field, when you reactivated thunderbird, things went kerflooey (pardon the technical term...)  This is enforced by the email host, not thunderbird.  Anyway, I'm glad all is well. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

(??) </p><p>My 4 other accounts had no SMPTE entries at all.  Again, this happened on all 3 computers and I fixed them all by giving each one their own (passworded) SMPTE URLS. (Which I made sure the passwords of each account matched on all computers). </p><p>Cheers. </p>",joehimself,false,0,0
