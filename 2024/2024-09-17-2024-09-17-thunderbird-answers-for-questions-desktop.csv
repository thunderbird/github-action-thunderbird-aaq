Basically server is not receiving new mail so Thunderbird cannot download something that does  not exist. But you would need to access your webmail account to find out if there are new mail. Access your webmail account via a browser using the password you found in Thunderbird. If it does not work, you will see a 'forgotten password' link which you have to use and then follow instructions to get access to your webmail account. </p><p>If you were using a <strong>POP</strong> mail account&nbsp;: If there are no new emails in webmail account, then nothing can get downloaded.  Delete all the very old mail - after all you should have a copy on computer in profile. Empty the server Spam folder. Empty the server TRash folder. This should free up some space on server, so new mail can be received. </p><p>If you were using an <strong>IMAP</strong> mail account&nbsp;: If there are no new emails in webmail account, then nothing can get downloaded.  Please note: Anything you delete from  webmail account will get deleted from an imap account, because imap accounts can only show whatever is on the server. So be careful what you delete. Empty the server Spam folder and Empty the Server TRash. </p><p>IF in Thunderbird, the Inbox Properties Quota said it was full, then you need to fix in Thunderbird. Copy important emails into a suitably named folder in 'Local Folders' mail account. Please double check you can still read that copied email. If copy is good then delete the original from the Imap folder. Repeat for all important emails. Finally... Right click on imap folder and select 'Compact' to remove all the old traces of moved emails from file. This should free up some space. You can check how much space is available via Properties &gt; Quota. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
