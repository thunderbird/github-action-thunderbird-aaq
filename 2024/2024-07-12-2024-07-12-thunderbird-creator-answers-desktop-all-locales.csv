Or is this just an artifact of having an IMAP option as well? There is no such thing as a downloaded Trash item, right? So in a logical sense, shouldn't the Trash folder in non-local be removable on POP, or just automatically disappear when POP is selected? There are no other folders duplicated between local and non-local, so the duplication just looks odd and confusing, even though it may be of little or no functional consequence. Is there no way to eliminate one of these two folders, perhaps the non-local one? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1661523;1661535;,Quenchoo

The Yahoo rep told me that my problem is that ""Whenever the generated app password from Yahoo is entered, sending emails works, but it only stays like that until the computer gets restarted.  The app password is not saved.""  The rep told me that many Thunderbird users who had their email systems transferred to Yahoo are having the same problem.
