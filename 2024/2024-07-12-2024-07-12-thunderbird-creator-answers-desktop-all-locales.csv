Your article shows me what to do and I am keen to try. My point of contention is ""Administrator approval"". I have no Administrator. On my PC I am the administrator. Can you elaborate on what I have to do. I do not have a {tenant-ID}. 2. Do I have to do the administrator approval for each mail account separately? Hope you can help.

Or is this just an artifact of having an IMAP option as well? There is no such thing as a downloaded Trash item, right? So in a logical sense, shouldn't the Trash folder in non-local be removable on POP, or just automatically disappear when POP is selected? There are no other folders duplicated between local and non-local, so the duplication just looks odd and confusing, even though it may be of little or no functional consequence. Is there no way to eliminate one of these two folders, perhaps the non-local one? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",Quenchoo
