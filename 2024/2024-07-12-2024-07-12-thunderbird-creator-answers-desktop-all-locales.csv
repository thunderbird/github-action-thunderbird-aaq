Or is this just an artifact of having an IMAP option as well? There is no such thing as a downloaded Trash item, right? So in a logical sense, shouldn't the Trash folder in non-local be removable on POP, or just automatically disappear when POP is selected? There are no other folders duplicated between local and non-local, so the duplication just looks odd and confusing, even though it may be of little or no functional consequence. Is there no way to eliminate one of these two folders, perhaps the non-local one? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1661523;1661535;,Quenchoo
