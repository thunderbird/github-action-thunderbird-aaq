In Windows Safe mode it was still deleting the saved passwords. I have however made progress by completely uninstalling Thunderbird and deleting all Mozilla files that remained on the C drive (an SSD). Then I moved my profile from the NAS to the C drive, reinstalled Thunderbird, pointed it at my copied profile on C. Interestingly, moving the profile took a very long time; the old profile had 2234 files in 140 folders taking 855mbytes, including hundreds of very small files which slowed it down (a lot of them may have been empty files in very many archive folders). The new profile has 771 files in 124 folders taking up 841mbytes. Now T is working pretty fast in opening. loading and deleting emails and so far it has not deleted my passwords. I have added T as an exclusion in the MS antivirus but it was fast enough before and no faster after.  There still seem to be a lot of redeundant files in the profile - for example there are 17 prefs.js files; all but the first are dated in 2020 only prefs.js is dated today. There are several abook.sqlite files. There were several blocklist files taking up 1.6mbytes (dated 2017 to 2020)  - out of date?; but now there is a blocklists folder dated today needing 1.1mbytes. There is a file AlanProfile dated 2011 pointng to a D: drive which I no longer have. These redundant files may not affect performance but it would be nice to get to a clean profile; but it contains all my emails (in the ImapMail and Mail folders and possibly elsewhere) so may not be easy to do. I will look further on the forum and perhaps raise a new question/topic. Many thanks for your help. </p>",work37,false,0,0
