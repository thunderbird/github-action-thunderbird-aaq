1455721,2024-07-31 17:23:40 -0700,2024-07-31 17:23:40 -0700,Local Folders disappeared,"<p>A new Thunderbird icon appeared on my Windows desktop. I unpinned the icon in the bottom pop up bar, and dragged the new icon to the bar. When I clicked on the icon, Thunderbird ran me through a new account set up routine, and when I got through that, all of the local folders - in which I had stored a virtual library of emails from different sources that I use for reference and education - had disappeared.  No, I do not have a current backup of the folders... Is there some other way to retrieve these, or are they simply gone forever? Thanks for your input, Jeff </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",stickneyjp
