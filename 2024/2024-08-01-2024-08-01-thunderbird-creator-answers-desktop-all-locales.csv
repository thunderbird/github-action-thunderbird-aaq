I unpinned the icon in the bottom pop up bar, and dragged the new icon to the bar. When I clicked on the icon, Thunderbird ran me through a new account set up routine, and when I got through that, all of the local folders - in which I had stored a virtual library of emails from different sources that I use for reference and education - had disappeared.  No, I do not have a current backup of the folders... Is there some other way to retrieve these, or are they simply gone forever? Thanks for your input, Jeff </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",stickneyjp

Even if the person does not know my email password, they can just cancel out of the password box and all the emails stored on computer are available!   </p><p>Also, I read some online post saying that Thunderbird does not store the emails in any encrypted way on the computer!   </p><p>Multiple people can use a computer, or the user may be wary of whatever kind of access somehow, simply want it secured. </p><p>Is there no way for Thunderbird to do this after so many years? An extension or anything? I want to back up email account from online account, store on computer in secure private way but this program seems against that!? </p>",protect-your-privacy;,thunderbird,protect-your-privacy,en-US,"",xry1
