When it restarted, all of my accounts were gone along with my address book was gone as well. Thunderbird asked me to create an account. I recreated one my accounts hoping that it would pick up the other 5 accounts, it did not. So since I did not like look and feel of the new version, I uninstalled it and went back to 115.13, again hoping to get my accounts back. That is when I got a message saying this profile is for a newer version. I wasn't aware that Thunderbird changes the profile(s) in a way that makes it not backwards compatible.  Now being aware of that If I ever decide to update again, I will make a copy of my profile(s) to save the info and make it easier to recoup my data.  I have been using FireFox and Thunderbird since the very beginning. However I don't think I will be updating Thunderbird. I did not use 128.01 very long, however It seems that Thunderbird is going in a direction that does not appeal to me.  Thunderbird is trying to be a everything program, Chat, Calendar and Email. I do not use the chat feature. Again I didn't use it long, I found it too busy and trying to push the calendar and chat features, just MHO. </p>",shorts,false,0,0
