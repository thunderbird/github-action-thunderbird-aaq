When it restarted, all of my accounts were gone along with my address book was gone as well. Thunderbird asked me to create an account. I recreated one my accounts hoping that it would pick up the other 5 accounts, it did not. So since I did not like look and feel of the new version, I uninstalled it and went back to 115.13, again hoping to get my accounts back. That is when I got a message saying this profile is for a newer version. I wasn't aware that Thunderbird changes the profile(s) in a way that makes it not backwards compatible.  Now being aware of that If I ever decide to update again, I will make a copy of my profile(s) to save the info and make it easier to recoup my data.  I have been using FireFox and Thunderbird since the very beginning. However I don't think I will be updating Thunderbird. I did not use 128.01 very long, however It seems that Thunderbird is going in a direction that does not appeal to me.  Thunderbird is trying to be a everything program, Chat, Calendar and Email. I do not use the chat feature. Again I didn't use it long, I found it too busy and trying to push the calendar and chat features, just MHO. </p>",shorts,false,0,0

It really is that simple.  Although I understand that some folk have two factor authentication on their Microsoft account and that requires a pin.  Microsoft also refuses access to mail accounts using that authentication method and instead requires the authentication method use to be oAuth.  Not normal password.  They have issues a lot of emails in recent weeks about the change and a September date was suggested in the forum,  but personally I have not received anything from them. </p> <blockquote> The password is related to my Microsoft Account, but when the password is entered it is not recognized, even although when I enter my Microsoft account from out with Thunderbird there is no problem with the password. </blockquote> <p>I see a possible conflating of two completely different things into one and the result is you are not having any success. </p><p>Thunderbird uses your Microsoft account/local password when you try and access the stored passwords.  SO that password is whatever you enter into Windows when it asks you if you want to allow whatever program to make changes to your system.  It has nothing as such to do with mail or retrieving mail.  It may however be a Microsoft office365 or other password for accessing Microsoft online tools like word. </p><p>Your mail password,  which you are also apparently having issues with is probably ok and your issue is your antivirus as decided Thunderbird needs to be blocked from getting mail because it has a new version number.

You can do that by  - clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down left side to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - then exit thunderbird  - you are now in folder. click the Imapmail folder and see if there are any remnants of the account. if so, delete them.  - restart thunderbird and you should be able to recreate the  account. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I didn't want to do that. I then deleted the profiles and restored them from a 3-day-old backup copy. The program now started (in slow motion) but still issuing the ""summary file"" errors. I had to go to each account and select the directory it was already pointing to. I did have to delete and recreate 2 accounts. Some more nonsense to get the unified View to work. Now re-setup my extensions (address book sync) again re-selection the same directory that it already points to. </p><p>When I came to my workstation now, the Thunderbird panel is totally blank. My cursor is spinning and the program is using massive amounts of CPU. I had to manually kill it. The restart takes 90 seconds. What's your opinion?

It happened when I cancelled the sending of the test email bc I knew based on prior attempts it was not going through - took too long. Anyway, I have one other smtp for a hotmail account, shown in the attached image. I've tried all kinds of variations on settings, but still have not been able to send via the new (""office 365 for Foundation) account.

First, select the rotary account in the left pane of Account Settings, then look at Outgoing Server (SMTP) in the right pane.  You should have the rotary account sending on the 'Office365 for foundation' smtp server, not the '<a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> (Microsoft)' smtp.  If the correct smtp is already selected, I think with O365 domain accounts you have to enable SMTP in the O365 admin settings. </p><p><a href=""https://mailtrap.io/blog/office-365-smtp/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mailtrap.io/blog/office-365-smtp/</a> </p>",sfhowes,false,0,1

If that's not the case and you still can't send, try adding the account to a new profile and see if it works.  Help/Troubleshooting Info, about:profiles.  The current profile is unaffected, and if the new one works, data can be transferred from the old to the new.  If you only have the one account with OAuth2 in the new profile, I can't see how the mistaken prompt can appear. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
