When it restarted, all of my accounts were gone along with my address book was gone as well. Thunderbird asked me to create an account. I recreated one my accounts hoping that it would pick up the other 5 accounts, it did not. So since I did not like look and feel of the new version, I uninstalled it and went back to 115.13, again hoping to get my accounts back. That is when I got a message saying this profile is for a newer version. I wasn't aware that Thunderbird changes the profile(s) in a way that makes it not backwards compatible.  Now being aware of that If I ever decide to update again, I will make a copy of my profile(s) to save the info and make it easier to recoup my data.  I have been using FireFox and Thunderbird since the very beginning. However I don't think I will be updating Thunderbird. I did not use 128.01 very long, however It seems that Thunderbird is going in a direction that does not appeal to me.  Thunderbird is trying to be a everything program, Chat, Calendar and Email. I do not use the chat feature. Again I didn't use it long, I found it too busy and trying to push the calendar and chat features, just MHO. </p>",shorts,false,0,0

Thunderbird basically wouldn't start issuing dozens of ""invalid IMAP locations"" and ""Unable to open the summary file for..."". I never got it to actually start. I uninstalled and reinstalled 128.0.1 - same results. I suppose that one solution would have been to delete the profile and re-setup all my email accounts(about 6) and 20+ RSS feeds. I didn't want to do that. I then deleted the profiles and restored them from a 3-day-old backup copy. The program now started (in slow motion) but still issuing the ""summary file"" errors. I had to go to each account and select the directory it was already pointing to. I did have to delete and recreate 2 accounts. Some more nonsense to get the unified View to work. Now re-setup my extensions (address book sync) again re-selection the same directory that it already points to. </p><p>When I came to my workstation now, the Thunderbird panel is totally blank. My cursor is spinning and the program is using massive amounts of CPU. I had to manually kill it. The restart takes 90 seconds. What's your opinion? I am a professional software engineer so I see this ""upgrade"" as a real flop. </p><p>Regards, Bob </p>",rjm764,false,0,0

A number of things are still stored as absolute paths. You will always have issues. </p><p>However you forgot to mention the most important part of your setup relevant to this issue. Ubuntu 24 moves to snap packages and those are sand boxed.  What local resources you have access to is strictly controlled by the sandbox.  My guess is you only have read access to the NTFS volume from the SNAP.  You will also see folk here unable to send mail, access their files to add attachments and any number of other minor and truly annoying inconveniences. </p><p>My guess is you will not have any issues if you install the Linux download from the Thunderbird site. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
