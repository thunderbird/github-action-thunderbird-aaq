When it restarted, all of my accounts were gone along with my address book was gone as well. Thunderbird asked me to create an account. I recreated one my accounts hoping that it would pick up the other 5 accounts, it did not. So since I did not like look and feel of the new version, I uninstalled it and went back to 115.13, again hoping to get my accounts back. That is when I got a message saying this profile is for a newer version. I wasn't aware that Thunderbird changes the profile(s) in a way that makes it not backwards compatible.  Now being aware of that If I ever decide to update again, I will make a copy of my profile(s) to save the info and make it easier to recoup my data.  I have been using FireFox and Thunderbird since the very beginning. However I don't think I will be updating Thunderbird. I did not use 128.01 very long, however It seems that Thunderbird is going in a direction that does not appeal to me.  Thunderbird is trying to be a everything program, Chat, Calendar and Email. I do not use the chat feature. Again I didn't use it long, I found it too busy and trying to push the calendar and chat features, just MHO. </p>",shorts,false,0,0

Thunderbird basically wouldn't start issuing dozens of ""invalid IMAP locations"" and ""Unable to open the summary file for..."". I never got it to actually start. I uninstalled and reinstalled 128.0.1 - same results. I suppose that one solution would have been to delete the profile and re-setup all my email accounts(about 6) and 20+ RSS feeds. I didn't want to do that. I then deleted the profiles and restored them from a 3-day-old backup copy. The program now started (in slow motion) but still issuing the ""summary file"" errors. I had to go to each account and select the directory it was already pointing to. I did have to delete and recreate 2 accounts. Some more nonsense to get the unified View to work. Now re-setup my extensions (address book sync) again re-selection the same directory that it already points to. </p><p>When I came to my workstation now, the Thunderbird panel is totally blank. My cursor is spinning and the program is using massive amounts of CPU. I had to manually kill it. The restart takes 90 seconds. What's your opinion? I am a professional software engineer so I see this ""upgrade"" as a real flop. </p><p>Regards, Bob </p>",rjm764,false,0,0
