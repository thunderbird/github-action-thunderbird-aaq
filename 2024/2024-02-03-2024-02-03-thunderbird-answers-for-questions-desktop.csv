The lines would indicate to me that local copies of the files are simply not made.  Given exchange takes attachments and stores them in a different location to the email they belong to.  Got to love folk who treat an email store as a database and pull the email apart so different bits can be stored in their own tables.  I would guess there is an issue with OWL, in how they access the attachments,  or it might be you have to specifically download them to the email somehow.. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

More importantly check for a load of them with numbers in them.  IF they exist is is a symptom of Thunderbird failing to be able to save it's settings on shut down.  The usual problem is an antivirus product poking around and getting all excited when it finds a .JS file (JavaScript).  The solution is exclude the antivirus product form the profile folder. </p><p>There are other causes,  just the antivirus is most common.  Others include the disk space occupied by the prefs.js file being damaged so unable to be written. Chkdsk is the checker of choice on Windows. The power to the computer going out before the disk write on shutdown is complete can see setting not saved,  but not the numbered files. This is generally folk turning off a power strip on their way out or some sort of all lights and power off switch that is flicked when the door is locked for the night. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However I don't think that is the issue there a plenty of prefs.js files however the last one that shows an update is March of 2022. This problem only began last December. I also noticed that is did create new MFS files are there a several there corresponding to the date I created them.

Your other screenshots imply that, although you can see it, you cannot load it. True? More details are usually helpful. Had you changed anything? If not, and if the profile cannot be loaded, an option is to exit Thunderbird, copy useful files (such as addressbook and message folders), and then create a new profile and copy the saved message files to Mail\local folders and the addressbook to the profile root, restart TB, and then recreate accounts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
