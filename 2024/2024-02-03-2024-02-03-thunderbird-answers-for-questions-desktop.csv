This is where TB came in a few weeks ago (see original 3 attachments, wh/ I've reattached here--numbered 1, 2 and 3 in the top-right). I'm not sure about TB terminology, but I thought the tech (not at all a TB user!) I was working with created _1 TB Profile with 2 subcomponent profiles_. I put the Gmail subprofile (3 emails) first, so perhaps TB only recognized this one, and automatically deleted the other Rogers subprofile for some reason (4 emails).  </p><p>See also the attached scan of the intact 3 Gmail emails in the TB Gmail subprofile (4th attachment). </p><p>I just spoke with Rogers, and to respond to your question, they use an IMAP Email folder system (the newer system compared to POP). </p><p>As per your instructions, I've now deleted 13 foldercache files. But I'm not seeing any folders with the names of my 4 Rogers emails (leaving them out for confidentiality reasons online, but all end with ""@rogers.com""). Across the 4 emails, there would be 100s of Rogers emails there, but I don't see anything like this in this Gmail subprofile in TB ... which probably makes sense, although worth a shot. </p><p>The folders in the Gmail subfolder that might have previous Rogers emails would likely be in a large folder, and there's only a few folders that I note (see 3 attachments from previous post): favicons.sqlite (5,120 kb), global-messages-db.sqlite (289,824 kb), places.sqlite-(5,120 kb), and a few other smaller ones. Would the Rogers email potentially be in these folders? Or do we need to move on to another alternative, and ultimately a solution to this problem! </p><p>Also, it's not that important that I have the Gmail accounts in TB--since they're already in Outlook (seemed a backup was important at the time)--but I DO need access to my 4 Rogers accounts, which I'm weeks behind in checking b/c of this lost TB Rogers subprofile!! </p><p>Given that you didn't have a positive reaction after my last email w/ 3 attachments of the folders/files in the TB Gmail subprofile, I'm starting to feel that a new Rogers Profile in TB will have to be created.  </p><p>If so, would you be able to help with this?

I am very inexperienced using such an online tech support system, so am now concerned that I posted my personal cell # last time! Can this be removed so it doesn't fall into irresponsible hands somewhere around the world??!! </p>",macleanp77,false,0,0

The Rogers mail account would be in a folder named Mail if POP and in a folder named Imapmail if IMAP. I can find no screenshots of that information. The profiles are normally in c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles. Look in each one to view the Mail and Imapmap folders and post back. Also, if you post and need to make a correction, there is an edit button by the post to allow changes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
