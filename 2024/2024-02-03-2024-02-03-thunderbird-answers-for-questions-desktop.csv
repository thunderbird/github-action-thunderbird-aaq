Now I have to figure out how to recover from that -- protonsupport has the details on how; I just need to see if I can.  Sorry for the trouble.  My bad. </p>,roesenerofidaho,false,0,0

The lines would indicate to me that local copies of the files are simply not made.  Given exchange takes attachments and stores them in a different location to the email they belong to.  Got to love folk who treat an email store as a database and pull the email apart so different bits can be stored in their own tables.  I would guess there is an issue with OWL, in how they access the attachments,  or it might be you have to specifically download them to the email somehow.. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
