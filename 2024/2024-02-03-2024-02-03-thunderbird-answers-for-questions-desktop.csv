This is where TB came in a few weeks ago (see original 3 attachments, wh/ I've reattached here--numbered 1, 2 and 3 in the top-right). I'm not sure about TB terminology, but I thought the tech (not at all a TB user!) I was working with created _1 TB Profile with 2 subcomponent profiles_. I put the Gmail subprofile (3 emails) first, so perhaps TB only recognized this one, and automatically deleted the other Rogers subprofile for some reason (4 emails).  </p><p>See also the attached scan of the intact 3 Gmail emails in the TB Gmail subprofile (4th attachment). </p><p>I just spoke with Rogers, and to respond to your question, they use an IMAP Email folder system (the newer system compared to POP). </p><p>As per your instructions, I've now deleted 13 foldercache files. But I'm not seeing any folders with the names of my 4 Rogers emails (leaving them out for confidentiality reasons online, but all end with ""@rogers.com""). Across the 4 emails, there would be 100s of Rogers emails there, but I don't see anything like this in this Gmail subprofile in TB ... which probably makes sense, although worth a shot. </p><p>The folders in the Gmail subfolder that might have previous Rogers emails would likely be in a large folder, and there's only a few folders that I note (see 3 attachments from previous post): favicons.sqlite (5,120 kb), global-messages-db.sqlite (289,824 kb), places.sqlite-(5,120 kb), and a few other smaller ones. Would the Rogers email potentially be in these folders? Or do we need to move on to another alternative, and ultimately a solution to this problem! </p><p>Also, it's not that important that I have the Gmail accounts in TB--since they're already in Outlook (seemed a backup was important at the time)--but I DO need access to my 4 Rogers accounts, which I'm weeks behind in checking b/c of this lost TB Rogers subprofile!! </p><p>Given that you didn't have a positive reaction after my last email w/ 3 attachments of the folders/files in the TB Gmail subprofile, I'm starting to feel that a new Rogers Profile in TB will have to be created.  </p><p>If so, would you be able to help with this? I expect it's very easy for you to do after much specialized practice! If so, I perhaps should be available since I'll likely have some input re order of the 4 emails, etc.  </p><p>Would you be comfortable sharing the times that you would be most available, so I can try to respond more promptly to your emails, and perhaps put this problem to rest sooner than later. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",macleanp77,false,0,0

The Rogers mail account would be in a folder named Mail if POP and in a folder named Imapmail if IMAP. I can find no screenshots of that information. The profiles are normally in c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles. Look in each one to view the Mail and Imapmap folders and post back. Also, if you post and need to make a correction, there is an edit button by the post to allow changes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Second, if you think the profile may still be out there, you can do a search for a common file, such as abook.sqlite, to be sure. There is an awesome little freeware program called 'everything' at <a href=""http://voidtools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">voidtools.com</a> that does a full pc search in under a second. So, if those alternate profiles were created in other than the default locations, this would find them.  Third, to have this removed from active listing, just respond with any comment, such as 'problem not resolved, so I recreated profile. and then mark your comment with 'solved.' </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
