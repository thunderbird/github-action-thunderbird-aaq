I accidentally deleted all gmail from my thunderbird (w11p, v 115.7.0). These were in my ""all mail"" location. Looking online, it appears that I had set gmail on web to not keep anything there (gmail's own server), once I delete from t-bird, it appears all gone, permanently. I looked in t-bird trash, and all are gone there.  -I did look at 2 pgs of ""answers"" to this issue here at moz sppt, 1 said ""choose 'subscribe' . the ""all mail folder was already subscribed. Do I unclick that? Would that (unsubscribe ""all mail"")  keep the ""all mail"" stuff still on the gmail server? Other workarounds? Thank you. </p><p>P.S.: I am aware that for ""security purposes"" google keeps ALL. I not only do not know how to access that world, I also don't have any such security ok, nor wish to have. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1632762;,linusr
