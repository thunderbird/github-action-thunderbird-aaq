This worked well until today.  All email imported to TB (using ""google takeouts"", imapi) works great.  But when sync'd to my new gmail account, all old emails are showing the current date, rather than the actual dates. Please help me correct this new issue. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",brucebenjaminlevin

This is running on a Mac.  Cmd-1 in any of the windows did NOT display the Inbox.  AND THERE AREN'T ANY MENU OPTIONS THAT ARE APPARENT TO BRING UP THE MAIN WINDOW!  What?!  Can someone tell me how I'm supposed to bring up the main window with my message list if it isn't already showing?  (And please don't tell me to go to Settings.  That worked, indirectly, but it's the least intuitive approach I think I've ever seen.) </p><p>Seriously, this was frustrating and embarrassing, since I recommended Thunderbird to her. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ken217

They used to be an option on the Window tab, but now I can't find them anywhere. An existing one still works if I send to it, but I can't find it to edit (add/remove members).

When I click ""Add to Thunderbird"", a window pops up requesting that I confirm the install. I click on the blue ""Add"" button, but nothing happens. The extension isn't installed and the confirmation window doesn't go away. I also tried to install from downloaded XPI files but the same issue occurred. This happened with several add-ons so far including the following:  </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/?src=cb-dl-users"" rel=""nofollow"">Thunderbird Conversations</a>  </li><li> <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/cardbook/?src=cb-dl-users"" rel=""nofollow"">CardBook</a> </li></ul> <p>I attempted to follow the following support articles: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">Troubleshoot Mode Thunderbird</a>  </li><li> <a href=""/en-US/kb/unable-install-add-on-extension-theme-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">Unable to install add-ons (extensions or themes) in Thunderbird</a>  </li></ul> <p>I don't think the issue is due to an add-on incompatibility, but I'm not sure as I don't see any errors. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",tim279
