This worked well until today.  All email imported to TB (using ""google takeouts"", imapi) works great.  But when sync'd to my new gmail account, all old emails are showing the current date, rather than the actual dates. Please help me correct this new issue. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1632585;,brucebenjaminlevin

This is running on a Mac.  Cmd-1 in any of the windows did NOT display the Inbox.  AND THERE AREN'T ANY MENU OPTIONS THAT ARE APPARENT TO BRING UP THE MAIN WINDOW!  What?!  Can someone tell me how I'm supposed to bring up the main window with my message list if it isn't already showing?  (And please don't tell me to go to Settings.  That worked, indirectly, but it's the least intuitive approach I think I've ever seen.) </p><p>Seriously, this was frustrating and embarrassing, since I recommended Thunderbird to her. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1632584;,ken217
