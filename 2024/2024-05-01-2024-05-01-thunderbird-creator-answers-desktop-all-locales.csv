Desperate for help with Thunderbird lost all my emails - again!,"<p>Urgent Help Please as lost ALL EMAILS - I cannot get to post in Thunderbird: 1) I've now spent 4 hours, (from what was trying to sort a 'simple' problem on the server), as I couldn't send or receive any emails, as they think I've 6.5Gb of data on it, in spite of my deleting all my emails off it.  So they allowed some extra space to temp sort it again. It's been an issue for about 3mths now. But I deleted everything just the other day having confirmed that was not deleting them off my laptop and that the previously lost emails 2 yrs ago weren't still on their server.  </p><p>But now checked back on my email client Thunderbird, and I've no emails. They're all GONE bar the odd few I've put into folders (I stopped using folders years back as that lost all my emails way back then!), so I'd been keeping them all in the Inbox.  Although I've a few old Inbox files with previous old old emails in so I can access them if I need to. But at least their there! But now again I've just lost everything. This is such a disaster.   </p><p>Over the last 2yrs it's been going OK until today.  Now it's LOST ALL MY EMAILS.  I'm as per usual up to my eyes and have to travel this friday for meetings next week. The last thing I needed today was this.  I've lost so much data and info in those emails it's doesn't bare thinking about.  From show tickets that I need, medical info and data, to flight details to all sorts of crucial data.  My ONLY saving grace is that anything I've replied to, I have a copy in the sent folder.  </p><p>So Please Forgive this being in Firefox, as I can't even add it to Thunderbird help area!!  I've had to reset my pw too just to sign in.  Sadly right now it all feels so very upsetting I'm thinking I'll have to just have to start using another email client! If every 2 yrs I lose all my emails then this is just not acceptable.  I hope you can move this to the Thunderbird threads.  If you do please send me a link to it so I can try and find it.  </p><p>What's so upsetting is had I saved the Inbox file when I saw the 13Gb file size, a bit eariler then, I think I could have saved them.  I fear though that the remote server people deleted something, that was somehow still linked to my system and that's meant they've deleted my emails off my laptop too! Terrifying!  (Perhaps that is what happened before back in '22.&nbsp;???) I did look at a 'Sync' settings but not sure what they did so cancelled back out of them. </p><p>Running on Win 10 Pro 64Bit i7core 8Gb Ram Thunderbird 115.10.1 (64-bit) </p><p>Any and all help will be most gratefully received.  </p><p>Sub issue to get help&nbsp;:  2) Error to Sumbit to Thunderbird: Sadly I've gone around and around your system saying Ask Question when nothing answers my query on the Thunderbird email questions.

I have an iCloud e-mail address registered in my Thunderbird mail manager and it was working fine since I initiated it with Thunderbird about 3 months ago. In setting it up, I had to log-in to my AppleID and ask for an ""App-specific-password"", which I did back when I set it up. Strangely, 2 days ago when I opened Thunderbird, I immediately received a small pop-up window asking that I sign-in to the imap server with the password. After trying to close this out several times, I decided to enter the app-specific-password that was provided back when I set it up. This did nothing and I continued to get the pop-up messages which inhibited me from accessing whatever iCloud e-mails I had received up to that point. I am able to cancel out the window message and if I immediately open one of my 4 other e-mail addresses also within Thunderbird, I can use them and with no issues receiving or sending. So last night, I signed into my AppleID again and asked for another app-specific-password and entered the new one into the pop-up message window related to the iCloud e-mail address on Thunderbird. This then held and I was able to receive whatever was scheduled to come in. But this morning, it is back asking for a password again and the one I received last night doesn't seem to work. Am I now going to need to obtain an app-specific-password for only the iCloud e-mail account everytime I want to access that address? And I have tried using the check-off box in the pop-up message window that provides for saving the password. It makes no difference. This is very frustrating, and I am now thinking that using this open-source manager requires advanced operational skills and time-consuming adjustments and baby-sitting of the software, which I do not have the patience for. Any guidance would be helpful and most appreciated. I moved over to this to get away from Outlook and the ever-changing updates which always seem to be driving at getting by your privacy to access web preferences and communication resources. It seems everytime Windows updates, I need to visit every privacy control and insure they are set where I want them. Thanks for any help! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",outhouseengineering

So would it be possible to provide a means of selecting contacts for a given list as a function of contact data? For some purposes this could be simply the position in the alphabet of peoples' names. We would use in addition the 'custom properties' fields (which seem to be limited to 4 when manually editing a contact). While this approach is identical to the one we use routinely with spreadsheets, I'm aware that spreadsheets are or should be banned for managing lists of contact data. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1650543;1650688;1650694;,crl207
