1446291,2024-05-01 08:09:30 -0700,2024-05-01 08:09:30 -0700,Thunderbird E-Mail Address,"<p>Hello. I have an iCloud e-mail address registered in my Thunderbird mail manager and it was working fine since I initiated it with Thunderbird about 3 months ago. In setting it up, I had to log-in to my AppleID and ask for an ""App-specific-password"", which I did back when I set it up. Strangely, 2 days ago when I opened Thunderbird, I immediately received a small pop-up window asking that I sign-in to the imap server with the password. After trying to close this out several times, I decided to enter the app-specific-password that was provided back when I set it up. This did nothing and I continued to get the pop-up messages which inhibited me from accessing whatever iCloud e-mails I had received up to that point. I am able to cancel out the window message and if I immediately open one of my 4 other e-mail addresses also within Thunderbird, I can use them and with no issues receiving or sending. So last night, I signed into my AppleID again and asked for another app-specific-password and entered the new one into the pop-up message window related to the iCloud e-mail address on Thunderbird. This then held and I was able to receive whatever was scheduled to come in. But this morning, it is back asking for a password again and the one I received last night doesn't seem to work. Am I now going to need to obtain an app-specific-password for only the iCloud e-mail account everytime I want to access that address? And I have tried using the check-off box in the pop-up message window that provides for saving the password. It makes no difference. This is very frustrating, and I am now thinking that using this open-source manager requires advanced operational skills and time-consuming adjustments and baby-sitting of the software, which I do not have the patience for. Any guidance would be helpful and most appreciated. I moved over to this to get away from Outlook and the ever-changing updates which always seem to be driving at getting by your privacy to access web preferences and communication resources. It seems everytime Windows updates, I need to visit every privacy control and insure they are set where I want them. Thanks for any help! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",outhouseengineering
