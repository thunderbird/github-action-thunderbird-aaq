Now in Thunderbird ""Use Primary Password"" is clicked so I can't reset primary P/W.  Previous P/W doesn't work because there is no P/W there as far as I can see.

At first it worked OK...then I was no longer able to get emails and the new company took me through and reset Thunderbird setup,,,once that was done all my folder structure disappeared, and all the info stored in the folders... I have been trying to sort it out, but the company has not been able to do so...and today they suggested to contact Thunderbird to see if they could help... Thank you in anticipation Franco </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",franco.compass
