What you might want to pursue will be  separate process, converting eml messages to pdf or doc format. A simple web search for 'eml to doc' or 'eml to pdf' will show many products, none of which we have tested  or can comment on. If you pursue this direction, the addon, importexporttools, can readily export messages to eml for you. Then, you would have just a few steps: export to eml, execute the third-party product, and you would then have all of your messsages in your preferred format. Good luck . </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
