What you might want to pursue will be  separate process, converting eml messages to pdf or doc format. A simple web search for 'eml to doc' or 'eml to pdf' will show many products, none of which we have tested  or can comment on. If you pursue this direction, the addon, importexporttools, can readily export messages to eml for you. Then, you would have just a few steps: export to eml, execute the third-party product, and you would then have all of your messsages in your preferred format. Good luck . </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Please do the following so we have a clear view of your status:  </p> <ol><li> click to the SMTP server pane, and click Edit for each one and Change DESCRIPTION field for each to be unique, such as the email address for that smtp server. Currently, i think they both have same description, </li><li> now, click 'account settings' and look at account pane bottom line where it links to an SMTP server. Adjust to apply to the correct one.  </li><li> now, try sending email from each one and then report error message.   </li></ol> <p>The above steps to to ensure that the SMTP server for info is the one used by the info account and the one for elainemarie is using its specific SMTP server. My concern was heightened when your first screenshot was for info and your second for elainemarie. The changes I recommended may not be the solution, but will at minimum give us proper messages. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Unfortunately, the older letters appeared wrong, but not the new ones. I tried what you suggested, but it didn't work even after restarting the program.
