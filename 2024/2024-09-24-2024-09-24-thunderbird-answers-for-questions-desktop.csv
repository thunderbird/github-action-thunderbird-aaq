The files are likely there and it offered steps for recovery, so I think I'm good. I will post back if I run into problems. </p>",terri_walker,false,0,0

What you might want to pursue will be  separate process, converting eml messages to pdf or doc format. A simple web search for 'eml to doc' or 'eml to pdf' will show many products, none of which we have tested  or can comment on. If you pursue this direction, the addon, importexporttools, can readily export messages to eml for you. Then, you would have just a few steps: export to eml, execute the third-party product, and you would then have all of your messsages in your preferred format. Good luck . </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Unfortunately, the older letters appeared wrong, but not the new ones. I tried what you suggested, but it didn't work even after restarting the program. It is an old pop3 server by the way. </p>",bernacron1977,false,0,0
