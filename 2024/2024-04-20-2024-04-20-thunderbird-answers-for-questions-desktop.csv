Since there are several, I suggest reviewing last update date of each, as they may each contain different messages. To salvage the messages, you could - install the importexport addon if not already done - create a new folder in Local Folders for each of the accounts - highlight each new folder, rightclick and select the importexport tool and select import mbox file and then select one of the inbox files (but not the .msf file) and it will bring the messages into thunderbird.  - when done, you will have all the messages locally. my next suggestion would be to delete the account and create again. You will then have messages in the account's inbox, plus the local folders. I do not suggest simply moving them all to one folder, as that may place an overload on the process and leave some messages corrupted. If you really wanted them all as one, you could use the importexport tool to then export each folder as eml files and then click the account inbox and import each as eml files. That would get them all together and then add the addon that removes duplicates and you would be mostly back to normal. This is a common problem for crashed POP accounts.

Many thanks! </p><p>Actually, I do recall asking Tbird to archive a message a couple of weeks back, but then deleted it.  So Tbird must have created that folder on its own and, of course, doesn't presume to delete the folder once it's empty, because it doesn't know that it was just a temporary situation. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

You could delete that file, plus key4.db and cert9.db (with thunderbird not running) and try again. Another option would be to click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security and click saved passwords and then show passwords and if there are any shown to delete the rows completely. Exit and restart to verify that your change took place and then try password again. To repeat, this is just a possible explanation. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Worth checking it out. </p><p>Are the 'deleted' emails actually on the server - which you can access via webmail account in a browser&nbsp;? If no then that explains why you cannot see them in an imap mail account. Imap account can only show what is on server. </p><p>re&nbsp;:Luckily our local support were able to restore the affected folders.  </p><p>If they 'restored' the effected folders (mbox files) within the imap account in profile, then when you start Thunderbird, it checks with server and will auto remove emails that were 'restored' because they were not restored to server. </p><p>Suggest you get the 'restored' mbox files put into the 'Local Folders' folder in profile whilst Thunderbird is not running. Then start Thunderbird and you should see emails in 'Local Folders' mail account. You can then 'Copy' batches of emails into the imap folders to get them uploaded back onto the server. There may be a limit on how much you can upload within a given period. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
