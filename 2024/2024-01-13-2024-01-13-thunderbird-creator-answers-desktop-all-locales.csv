Prior to the most recent update 115 (currently 115.6.1 (32-bit)) accounts that I check infrequently would not popup a password prompt.

The problem is that if I add a new mailbox it seems to work fine downloading messages but the outgoing smtp settings overwrite a previous one. The limit seems to be 48 I'm on TB ver 115.6.0 (64-bit) on Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon. Looking through prefs.js the highest number in the smtp server list is 49.  Is it a bug or is there some setting that limits new identities? </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",thunderbird23
