The problem is that if I add a new mailbox it seems to work fine downloading messages but the outgoing smtp settings overwrite a previous one. The limit seems to be 48 I'm on TB ver 115.6.0 (64-bit) on Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon. Looking through prefs.js the highest number in the smtp server list is 49.
