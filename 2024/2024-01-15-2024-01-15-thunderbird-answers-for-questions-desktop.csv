In fact, I have never had it turned on, as I prefer to compact folders manually when I deem it necessary.

You need to force Thunderbird to use your converted profile folder using the -allow-downgraded command line argument.  Anything in the profile that was ""converted to a new file format"" will be lost. </p><p>I to have issues with random stoppages. Rebuilding the global index helped but was not in itself a cure.  With loads of Ram (32Gb) and a terabyte SSD under the hood, Thunderbird should fly.  But it just chugs along grinds,  gets hung up deciding what to index and is generally very pedestrian. Upgrading to windows 11 did not fix it. Going back to 102 is <strong>not </strong>in my future.  I would be more likely to change applications that try and go back. The outcome of downgrading is just so much in the lap of the gods. It might be Ok,  it might not. </p><p>I should note to be fair it is not just Thunderbird.  Firefox is no better with the little naps and the missed keystrokes, so there is probably a fundamental issue in the Mozilla core both are built on.  It got so bad am back to a wired keyboard and mouse to eliminate that as a possible cause.  I do agree 115 is more prone to having a nap that 102 ever was.  But it was not golden by any reasonable standard. </p><p>Perhaps it is the non intel processor or something.  I am somewhat at a loss really and just do not have time to devote to the issue.  I think a much more likely issue is the indexing code is more than 10 years old and is simply not efficient enough for the much larger profiles of mail and RSS feeds that exist now than did a decade ago.  Unfortunately I rely on search,  so can't really drop it.  But my daily profile which only has two account and very few email does not suffer from the dropping off at anything like the level my main profile does. </p><p><br> Processor	AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 4750G with Radeon Graphics   3.60 GHz Installed RAM	32.0 GB (31.4 GB usable) System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,1

I have used Google Takeout to an extent in the past but have been put off by the sheer size of the files created - for example, a mail folder of 120 emails, when downloaded gave me an mbox file of 165Mb (127 when compressed), nor did I find it a particularly speedy process. </blockquote> <p>When you are tediously trying to work out which mails you ""missed"" in your imap backup you will decide the Google process is positively rocket powered. </p><p>The storage file system in Thunderbird is exactly the same as the google one for mail takeout.  So if you thought their files were large,  they will be exactly the same size as your Thunderbird ones. </p> <blockquote> I don't really understand the sizing &amp; structures.

The Google One storage page indicates that gmail is taking just 1.68Gb of my Drive. </blockquote> <p>Just how does google store an email?  I do not know.  I do know Microsoft outlook has always pulled it to bits,  converted attachments back to files and lumped them all in a database format in the PST file.  It is quite probable Google do something different. One of the realities of mail attachments is they are around thirty percent larger that their file equivalents.  It is a side effect of the MIME encoding of the binary data. </p> <blockquote>  I am also coming to the view that I should perhaps pay for private and secure email and move away from free services like Gmail that monetize my personal data.

The bridge is basically a local mail server as far as mail clients are concerned,  plenty of those with issues on this forum  for you to research.  Or you could check out the issues their git hub site for development of the bridge. <a href=""https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues</a> </p><p>Add to that they offer to send encrypted mail even to those that do not have encryption certificates,  and you find they email a link to a web page on their server because the thing about symmetric encryption is both parties need to have and use their own certificates. So anyone claiming to do it without is mostly not doing what they lead you to think they are doing. </p><p>You might be better served by mailfence, I personally did a trial of their service and it appeared Ok, I failed to sign up for the paid account,  but it was closer to a paid reality I felt and you get your own domain with the paid tiers. <a href=""https://mailfence.com/#pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mailfence.com/#pricing</a>  If you sign up for it via Thunderbird the project gets a few cents as well, but that is not why I suggest them. </p> <blockquote> <em><p>jvwhyte <a href=""#answer-1630712"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <p>When I navigate from 'Home' to '.thunderbird', click on 'xxx..xxx.default-release', there is a folder 'Imapmail' containing just an '.msf' file.   </p> </blockquote> <p>Check that the account is set to actually store messages remotely.

Mailfence looks rather complex and maybe a bit too technical for me.  I have read a lot of the user guide type info on Fastmail, and given they operate a free 30 days before ""cashing in"", I may well give that a try when I have worked with Thunderbird for a week or so.   </p><p>I have been retired for 18 years now and do struggle a bit with many technical terms.  I've been using Linux off + on for a while but have to confess that I have not made much progress.        Day to day, I use a MacBook Air M1 along with my iPhone &amp; iPad but to keep the brain cells ticking over I have an antique iMAC (2009 model) running Linux Mint which has loads of disc space and is helping to wean me off too much reliance on online storage from the dreaded Google and some others.

I have re-created individual email accounts in the profile, replaced the mail folders in each individually and set up smtp servers for each.  I have lots of my old mail back, including sent emails.

The 'skin' is difficult in win 10 the menu bars for instance are the same color as everything else, there is no delineations to note and the handling of the list of email feels unfamiliar, I think it has something to do with the way they are marked as currently viewing vs cursor position that seems opposite from the previous setup in win7.
