I do know Microsoft outlook has always pulled it to bits,  converted attachments back to files and lumped them all in a database format in the PST file.  It is quite probable Google do something different. One of the realities of mail attachments is they are around thirty percent larger that their file equivalents.

The bridge is basically a local mail server as far as mail clients are concerned,  plenty of those with issues on this forum  for you to research.  Or you could check out the issues their git hub site for development of the bridge. <a href=""https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues</a> </p><p>Add to that they offer to send encrypted mail even to those that do not have encryption certificates,  and you find they email a link to a web page on their server because the thing about symmetric encryption is both parties need to have and use their own certificates. So anyone claiming to do it without is mostly not doing what they lead you to think they are doing. </p><p>You might be better served by mailfence, I personally did a trial of their service and it appeared Ok, I failed to sign up for the paid account,  but it was closer to a paid reality I felt and you get your own domain with the paid tiers. <a href=""https://mailfence.com/#pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mailfence.com/#pricing</a>  If you sign up for it via Thunderbird the project gets a few cents as well, but that is not why I suggest them. </p> <blockquote> <em><p>jvwhyte <a href=""#answer-1630712"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <p>When I navigate from 'Home' to '.thunderbird', click on 'xxx..xxx.default-release', there is a folder 'Imapmail' containing just an '.msf' file.   </p> </blockquote> <p>Check that the account is set to actually store messages remotely.
