I thought I'd previously found lots of posts on this topic and I wanted to check them but I can't see to find them now. I use Thunderbird for my work email account. I receive invitations to Teams meetings through email. When I use Outlook on my phone I can see an attached .ics file. When I use the web based email client provided by my ISP I can see an attached .ics file. When I use Thunderbird there's a message that says: ""No writable calendars are configured for invitations, please check the calendar properties."" and it claims there are no attachments. I don't care if it can't find a writable calendar, I want to download the .ics file. Where is the .ics file? I can download it from the other two clients and then import it into Thunderbird calendar fine. But that's a complete pain in the neck, having to log into a seperate email client to do that. If it's attached file, as the other two clients treat it as, why won't Thunderbird let me download it? Windows 10 Thunderbird 115.13.0 (64-bit) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mozilla613
