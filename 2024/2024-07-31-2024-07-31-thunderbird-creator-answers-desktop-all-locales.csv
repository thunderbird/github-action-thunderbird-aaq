I only seem to be able to see a customized reply arrow, and a small dot in the 'From' line. In the screenshots on your introductory page the background of the card is accented and bordered. Is this only for Linux, or will it work in Windows 11 also? If so, where can this be set? </p><p>I actually prefer the line view rather than the cards in the Inbox pane, and would also like the color accent to be applied to the current selection highlight/background. Here for example (see screenshot) I would like the purple color (you can see it in the reply arrow) to be applied also to the background highlight of the middle email, where it is currently dark grey.  </p><p>Many thanks in advance </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1665455;,asmwent

I thought I'd previously found lots of posts on this topic and I wanted to check them but I can't see to find them now. I use Thunderbird for my work email account. I receive invitations to Teams meetings through email. When I use Outlook on my phone I can see an attached .ics file. When I use the web based email client provided by my ISP I can see an attached .ics file. When I use Thunderbird there's a message that says: ""No writable calendars are configured for invitations, please check the calendar properties."" and it claims there are no attachments. I don't care if it can't find a writable calendar, I want to download the .ics file. Where is the .ics file? I can download it from the other two clients and then import it into Thunderbird calendar fine. But that's a complete pain in the neck, having to log into a seperate email client to do that. If it's attached file, as the other two clients treat it as, why won't Thunderbird let me download it? Windows 10 Thunderbird 115.13.0 (64-bit) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mozilla613
