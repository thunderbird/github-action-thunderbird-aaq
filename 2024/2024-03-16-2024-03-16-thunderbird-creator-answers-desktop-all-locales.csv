However, two days ago I stopped getting new mail.  I decided to try and use the fix inbox option in the pull-down and it ended up deleting my existing messages (received before my problem).  I contacted IONOS and my mail server is working fine, I can go directly to that server and read my e-mail.  I tried uninstalling TB and reinstalling it but still can not receive my messages.  There also seems to be a problem when I send the message does not get copied to my ""Sent"" folder.  Spent about 3 hours on the phone with IONOS and tried everything they could come up with and still no mail.  I have sense tried to add another mail account but get the message that ""the incoming account already exists"".  Removed existing accounts, uninstalled TB and tried again.  TB automatically remembered my accounts and added them back and I get the ""already exists"" message again.  Tried a couple more uninstall combinations and still no mail from the IONOS server.  Help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cddunn100

My friend has a newly set up Windows 11 laptop and Thunderbird for email. ISP is BT and email is <a href=""http://btinternet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">btinternet.com</a>. Incoming IMAP email works fine but outgoing SMTP keeps failing on authentication. Rebooting the router, which changes the wan ip address, fixes the problem for a time (less than 12 hours). Tested with Telnet. Same rejection. I'm wondering if the problem may be something to do with Thunderbird polling the server too frequently. Outgoing email on my friend's iPhone works fine but I don't know how it connects to the internet. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",e_james
