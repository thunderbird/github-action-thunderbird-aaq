Sometime last winter, Comcast had a system security issue, forcing all users to change their passwords. As it turns out, they apparently changed their method of authentication, but didn't inform users of settings changes. Basically, their system requires a ""Primary"" email account for account maintenance, then secondary users can be added and maintained. Some background details that probably don't apply to this issue, but I moved out of the Comcast service area 6 years ago, but was able to maintain my email account(s) as long as they're in use. I was able to change my Primary password, but was locked out of making changes to the secondary accounts. I also get the message, ""This account is no longer active."", but it still is. At that time, all my accounts continued to work. </p><p>In any case, TB has worked without issues for years on both my Comcast and Gmail accounts (Gmail still works fine) up until the Comcast security issue. A few weeks ago, Comcast stopped working, asking to reenter my password, but re-entering it did not work. I eventually talked to Comcast email tech support (lol, after about 20 minutes of navigating their phone system). I was told that I should DELETE my (primary) email account and then recreate it. I did that, but in that process, I lost all my message rules (but I eventually retrieved a backup version of ""msgFilterRules.dat"". </p><p>In that process of re-creating my account, the Authentication method was changed from ""Normal Password"" to ""OAuth2"" (same used with Gmail). With that change, I no longer get an ""Enter a new password"" message, to ""Unable to connect"" (see attached image). I also get an ""Authentication failure"" message, and an occasional ""My IP address has been temporary blacklisted"", probably of my multiple attempts to re-connect. I should note that Comcast email still works from my Android Samsung S22 email app. See my current TB Server Settings in the attached image. </p><p>Well after many fruitless hours, on a whim, I opened my old and trusty Outlook (Office) 2007 (that I've never used for email), and with their settings with the <em>same ''</em>Port numbers, but slightly different ""Encryption"" (Connection security) settings, Outlook works! The difference between Outlook is that Outlook only uses SSL, whereas TB uses SSL/TLS (no option for SSL alone). </p><p>So, herein lies the problem. I WANT to keep using TB for my Comcast accounts, but I'm locked out (NO sending or receiving). I could just use Outlook, BUT I loose all my rules (moving incoming emails to their respective folders. As expected, Outlook uses a proprietary binary rules file format (rwz) which is unreadable and uneditable. From my research, their are no filter programs or file structure descriptions for the Outlook rules file. </p><p>I can use Xfinity's (Comcast) web based email client, but again, NO RULES possible (after 20+ years of use, I have almost 200 email sources that use my primary Comcast email address). I tried over time to migrate new sources to my Gmail accounts, but not my existing ones. I fear however that this is an internal TB issue, that has no easy solution, if at all. </p><p>So, I asking you to <em>please </em>help me resolve this issue. It would be gratefully appreciated. </p><p>Thanks, Bill </p><p>P.S. After talking to Comcast the last time, they essentially said that they won't support TB, and it's not their problem to fix. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",willy6560
