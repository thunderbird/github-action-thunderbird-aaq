(I wish there was some way of finding my own previous posts!) Anyway it seems that the Linux versions are broken and it can't be done.  AH!  but it can!  As previously mentioned , the thing hangs at the point where the 'Cancel/Add' dialogue box shows up.  Someone suggested using the TAB key to cycle round to the dialogue but that didn't work.  BUT ... if you click back to your inbox, THEN the TAB key does work.  TAB till you get to the 'Add' button, hit ENTER, and voila, you have added an add-on&nbsp;:-) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",rayandrews

Have included picture of Server settings and Error message after trying to send. Not sure if it matters. Many technicians mention I.map and Pop. I have Pop.

I currently have three email accounts with godaddy and unfortunately the email has to be through office 365.    So far, I have switched two of them over to Thunderbird.  Currently I can get two of those emails on both o365 and on Thunderbird, with the third account still only on o365 (because it's a biz account, I can't afford to mess it up).  Question: If I drop / stop the Microsoft 365 service on those two email accounts, will they still come through to Thunderbird. .. Question 2:  how do I migrate all of the sub folders over from o365 to Thunderbird.  They didn't all come over to Thunderbird.
