(I wish there was some way of finding my own previous posts!) Anyway it seems that the Linux versions are broken and it can't be done.  AH!  but it can!  As previously mentioned , the thing hangs at the point where the 'Cancel/Add' dialogue box shows up.  Someone suggested using the TAB key to cycle round to the dialogue but that didn't work.  BUT ... if you click back to your inbox, THEN the TAB key does work.  TAB till you get to the 'Add' button, hit ENTER, and voila, you have added an add-on&nbsp;:-) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",rayandrews
