(I wish there was some way of finding my own previous posts!) Anyway it seems that the Linux versions are broken and it can't be done.  AH!  but it can!  As previously mentioned , the thing hangs at the point where the 'Cancel/Add' dialogue box shows up.  Someone suggested using the TAB key to cycle round to the dialogue but that didn't work.  BUT ... if you click back to your inbox, THEN the TAB key does work.  TAB till you get to the 'Add' button, hit ENTER, and voila, you have added an add-on&nbsp;:-) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",rayandrews

Windows 10, and current version 115.6.0 No problem with incoming emails or other features in Thunderbird.  About 15 conversations with technical support at Cox, including level 3 investigation, and paid support. Cox took over computer remotely and performed every suggestion on Thunderbird support page. Have included picture of Server settings and Error message after trying to send. Not sure if it matters. Many technicians mention I.map and Pop. I have Pop. Not sure if they said that Cox no longer supports Pop??? I have used Thunderbird for 15 plus years. Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",gtgmd
