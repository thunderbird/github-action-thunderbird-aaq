As previously mentioned , the thing hangs at the point where the 'Cancel/Add' dialogue box shows up.  Someone suggested using the TAB key to cycle round to the dialogue but that didn't work.  BUT ... if you click back to your inbox, THEN the TAB key does work.  TAB till you get to the 'Add' button, hit ENTER, and voila, you have added an add-on&nbsp;:-) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1628400;1628461;,rayandrews

There are 3 email accounts in the installation and the ""Server Settings"" for each account specify that the LOCAL DIRECTORY is on  D:\Eudora(Thunderbird)Mail\Mail\pop.earthlink??.net There's over 30GB of mail there! So the method given in ""Moving Thunderbird..."" cannot possibly work. It does not account for the fact that the account settings can redirect the location where mail is stored!  So, it seems that after doing the ""Moving Thunderbird..."" process, I will have to  1. Create a new folder on the laptop LocalMail 2. Select all files and directories in D:\Eudora...(Mail)\Mail on the working installation and copy them to LocalMail on the laptop 3. Go into Account Settings/Server Settings on each account in the laptop and change the directory to C:\LocalMail\<a href=""http://pop.earthlinkXX.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.earthlinkXX.net</a> </p><p>Will this work? </p><p>I will certainly pare the directory tree of mail folders on the laptop to eliminate messages over 4 years old, most of which are in large archive folders. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1628370;,jpetzing
