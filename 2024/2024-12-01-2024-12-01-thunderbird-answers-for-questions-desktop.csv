This is as I understand it from reading a lot of items about it. </p><p>It seems that Google assesses every mail that they process for everyone, to see if it is spam. If you receive one of those messages, it goes in the spam folder. Fine. </p><p>If you mark a message in your Inbox as spam, it gets put in your spam folder, and Gmail blocks all messages from that address to you. Afaics, it *does not* assess the content of the message so it will not recognise similar messages in future, perhaps from different addresses. But all messages from that sender in future will end up in the spam folder. </p><p>If a message is in your spam folder and you mark it as not spam, Gmail will usually move it back to your Inbox, but sometimes it will end up in All Mail or Trash. And sometimes it will disappear completely, never to be seen again. All new messages from that sender will now be put in your Inbox even if they are spam. </p><p>One difficulty here is that often spam is sent from a faked e-mail address which corresponds to a real e-mail address. So if you get a message from the spoofed address and mark it as spam, all genuine messages from that address will also be treated as spam. </p><p>Another difficulty is that real spammers do not generally send from the same address, but use a different address each time. So blocking the sender's address is often pointless. </p><p>It is not clear whether the messages you mark as spam go into that global pool of messages that determine the contents to be spam. It is also not clear whether just moving a message to the spam folder has this effect. Some mail clients do not have a method to *mark* a message as spam, but just move it to the spam folder. </p>",davidmorrisonann,false,0,0
