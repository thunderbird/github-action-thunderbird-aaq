This is as I understand it from reading a lot of items about it. </p><p>It seems that Google assesses every mail that they process for everyone, to see if it is spam. If you receive one of those messages, it goes in the spam folder. Fine. </p><p>If you mark a message in your Inbox as spam, it gets put in your spam folder, and Gmail blocks all messages from that address to you. Afaics, it *does not* assess the content of the message so it will not recognise similar messages in future, perhaps from different addresses. But all messages from that sender in future will end up in the spam folder. </p><p>If a message is in your spam folder and you mark it as not spam, Gmail will usually move it back to your Inbox, but sometimes it will end up in All Mail or Trash. And sometimes it will disappear completely, never to be seen again. All new messages from that sender will now be put in your Inbox even if they are spam. </p><p>One difficulty here is that often spam is sent from a faked e-mail address which corresponds to a real e-mail address. So if you get a message from the spoofed address and mark it as spam, all genuine messages from that address will also be treated as spam. </p><p>Another difficulty is that real spammers do not generally send from the same address, but use a different address each time. So blocking the sender's address is often pointless. </p><p>It is not clear whether the messages you mark as spam go into that global pool of messages that determine the contents to be spam. It is also not clear whether just moving a message to the spam folder has this effect. Some mail clients do not have a method to *mark* a message as spam, but just move it to the spam folder. </p>",davidmorrisonann,false,0,0

Secondly I was quite happily using Thunderbird up until the most recent update when the issue first appeared. Thirdly there is a plethora of similar complaints regarding this particular issue (no longer able to send an email). Your answer does not address the issue that the latest Thunderbird update is responsible for this issue appearing. Re the VPN, Thunderbird has apparently happily managed the VPN issue in the past.  I was able to pin down my problem but there are thousands who have no idea why Thunderbird suddenly stopped sending emails. In my case, all I received was a garbled BS message saying only that Thunderbird could not send the email. For someone not IT savvy, Thunderbird no longer works and they would not have a clue why or what to do next. Your supercilious reply would mean nothing to them.
