That is probably where the large size is. Just delete it. There is also a small set at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\local\thunerbird, which can also be deleted.  Thunderbird, itself, is either in program files or program files(x32). Just delete it. Your system may have used different drives, but I hope this helps you remove it. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
