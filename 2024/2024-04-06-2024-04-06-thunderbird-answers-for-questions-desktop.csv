All your data such as messages, passwords and user preferences, and changes made while you use Thunderbird, are stored in a special folder called a profile. Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there. It also means that you can uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall without losing your settings and data. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> </p> <blockquote> Since Thunderbird accesses my email server it requires the correct Port settings, correct protocol and security settings and of course password for both incoming and outgoing. </blockquote> <p>Your server settings look good to me. </p> <blockquote> I think by mistake I deleted all of my emails BUT I have selected IMAP so my emails I want are still on my service providers server. </blockquote> <p>I have no idea how one can delete all emails by mistake. If you did this while Thunderbird was running, you possibly also deleted everything on the server. If you did this while Thunderbird was not running, your messages on the server should still be there. Having said that, using IMAP with all messages on the server is no replacement for a local backup. </p> <blockquote> I removed my account (I think) and go through the motions of reinstalling my account and get a pop-up indicating the server already exists which puzzles me. </blockquote> <p>I have no idea what you did, but you it may have messed up your profile. Create a new profile using profile manager. Start Thunderbird with the new profile also using profile manager, and re-create your account. Does it work then? <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/using-multiple-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/using-multiple-profiles</a> </p>",christ1,false,0,0

Usernames and passwords are not desirable. neither are complicated instructions. She just lost her brand new desktop and data to hardware failure. So while I'm setting everything up again, I want to get that sorted. I've already moved her profile on to an external drive, and configured a second local profile. I just need it to fail over to the local copy if the external copy is either not connected or lost.

I've switched to using the -profile switch. which uses a profile at a specified location even if thunderbird profile manager isn't aware of the profile.
