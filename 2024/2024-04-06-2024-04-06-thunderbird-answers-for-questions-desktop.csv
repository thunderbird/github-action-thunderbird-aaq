I had seen the file R/O set while TB was running and stuck, by selecting the email folders and viewing Properties.  I expect that TB does this while running to keep other programs from screwing up the files somehow, or that it was an effect of a buffer overrun.  </p><p>I had been able to get ONE email to slowly download at a time, and noticed that it was always the same one.  At first, I thought that the emails were not being deleted on the server, but tracking what email it was and how large made me suspect duplication.  And indeed it seems to have been! </p><p>So I spent yesterday breaking up an email logjam one at a time, apparently created by inadvertently emailing quite a few copies, like 20 or 30, of a 50 MB email containing several big jpeg photos from my phone.   I think that TB experienced a buffer overrun from all that crap and locked up. Once I pulled out the last unwanted copy, it was like a dam bursting and presto, suddenly my inbox had 185 emails in it! So it wasn't TB's fault, it was mine.  Seemingly a result of a twitchy forefinger on the phone's SEND button. </p>",donmohle,false,0,0

All your data such as messages, passwords and user preferences, and changes made while you use Thunderbird, are stored in a special folder called a profile. Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there.

First of all being used on Ubuntu Linux I posted on the Ubuntu forum as well and they made similar suggestions.  WHEN you have settings that worked before including the fact I have VPN and that raised suspicion so I disabled it even though THE SYSTEM WORKED BEFORE WITH VPN!.  I contacted Sasktel BEFORE I removed it because I was working on a proper removal and FULL PURGE of this questionable software. I asked them about password security which raised questions in my mind because it is slightly different vs Outlook on my 2007 Office Pro. I experimented with NORMAL PASSWORD and AUTO DETECT which did not work and Sasktel tech support mentioned BOTH WILL WORK JUST FINE. ALL my settings were correct BUT it kept popping up the enter password window WITH CORRECT PASSWORD or REMEMBER PASSWORD SELECTED. My removal attempts would not remove it completely so this resulted in the reinstall attempt being again corrupted.  IF YOUR SETTINGS ARE CORRECT and you get this repeated password rejection and IF you are using Linux and in my case UBUNTU 22.4.0 FOLLOW THESE STEPS!

This NOW MADE MY MOZILLA FOLDER APPEAR. This was before I used his above posted link and I went one step further and copied my entire mail. <a href=""http://sasktel.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sasktel.net</a> folder and anything else I thought would be important!

I kept installing with same password rejection fault! I went to .home directory and all of my earlier 2018 and later folders were still there </p><p>Go back again to .home directory: ""Check in your home directory with {Ctrl + h} reveals hidden folders and in .mozilla folder look for thunderbird to see if anything remains."" BEWARE of one fact about using control H with hidden folders!! Below my now visible Mozilla and Thunderbird folders appeared these folders but they were faint and lower contrast: </p><p>examples.desktop .bash_history .bash_logout .bashrc .ICEauthority .profile .sudo_as_admin_successful </p><p>These are likely important system files SO LEAVE THEM ALONE.

What you did was essentially not read my statement indicating Thunderbird WOULD NOT let me create a new profile🤔. Removing my ENTIRE account and reentering it WOULD NOT WORK including totally redoing my server settings, and this should not be required to have to do in the first place simply to replace a password????  2 months ago I was forced to do this and that is the ONLY way I could change my password! This time, at the present time,  it would not work and continued to reject a password that works on OTHER email clients including on the Sasktel server! Your statement will only lead others down the wrong path for a software installation that is defective due to corrupted software and this could have been due to an update gone wrong.  You most certainly should not have to rip out your profile to change a password?????? How long does it take me to change a password (used on my Sasktel server) on my Outloook on Office 2007, or on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra, or other devices and even my account password on my Sasktel server?  Step one) Enter settings, after opening the email client and locate server settings Step two) head over to password and back space or delete the characters and then reenter a new password and finally select save and it is done The same applies to ALL port and security settings on my Outlook and on my phone and even my Sasktel account using a web browser. </p><p>A friend of mine had his email account hacked and taken over by a flake commiting fraud by using his email account to send out emails to all of his contacts requesting the contact go out and purchase gift cards for a sick friend and I phoned him up and advised him his email account was hacked.  For security reasons it is advised to change your password on a regular basis. My friends account was hacked 2 months ago prompting me to change my password as well and then the fun began and now repeated but to a worse degree presently. At least I was able to use Terminal and terminal commands and remove it along with looking in my Home directory and cleaning it out. A novice computer user unable to diagnose, remove, and reinstall this software would be unable and I know a number of people unable to do this.  </p><p>Having to TOTALLY remove my account from the email client is totally unnecessary and IF this has to be done all the time on Thunderbird, it is a lousy design! It is a TOTALLY LOUSY DESIGN OR DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE?  Again having to do all of this (removing my account as in the email address and my entire account worked 2 months ago but not at the current/present time!  At the current time I had to TOTALLY PURGE EVERYTHING including going into my .home directory and use Control H to expose hidden folders and literally ferret out everything related to Thunderbird and reinstall and this clearly indicates something wrong within the folders that didn't purge. </p><p>During my search while attempting to find out what was wrong, I discovered another forum with another poster, posting identical symptoms as mine with all of his port settings correct like mine. His problem was also Thunderbird but also back in 2018. If you cannot replace a password with all port and server settings correct, including having to totally remove your account profile and 🙏, rip it out, purge it out and reinstall🤣. Next time I change my password and if this occurs I will do auto install and purge and look for another client.
