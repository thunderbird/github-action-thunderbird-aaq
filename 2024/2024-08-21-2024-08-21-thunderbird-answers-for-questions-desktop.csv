If they are on the <a href=""http://xtra.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">xtra.co.nz</a> account, then I presume you were accessing the account via web interface, since you imply you used no email client. If that is true, then YES, you need an IMAP account, and the POP account is going to make it more difficult to combine the two - but still doable. I suggest you set up an IMAP account alongside the POP account in Thunderbird and that should show the other folders. The first screen on setup includes the option to specify IMAP.
