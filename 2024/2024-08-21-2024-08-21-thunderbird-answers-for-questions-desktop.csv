On the <a href=""http://xtra.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">xtra.co.nz</a> server or on your PC? If they are on the <a href=""http://xtra.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">xtra.co.nz</a> account, then I presume you were accessing the account via web interface, since you imply you used no email client. If that is true, then YES, you need an IMAP account, and the POP account is going to make it more difficult to combine the two - but still doable. I suggest you set up an IMAP account alongside the POP account in Thunderbird and that should show the other folders. The first screen on setup includes the option to specify IMAP. There is still work to salvage the accounts, but this should help you get started </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

When I tried to reinstall my original hotmail account,  when I fill in the info and hit continue a new box shows up ""your login"" with the ability to enter 'YOURDOMAIN\your user name.

When I do the exact same thing with the brand new outlook email account I get the could no get issuer message above and when I change to normal password I get the different message 'unable to log in at server'.  Strange - the old and the new accounts at <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> get different error messages when I follow the exactly same steps.
