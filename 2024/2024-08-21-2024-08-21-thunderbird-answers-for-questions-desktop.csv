I suggest you set up an IMAP account alongside the POP account in Thunderbird and that should show the other folders. The first screen on setup includes the option to specify IMAP.

I speculate that the intended ""make a new profile"" thing intends construction of a new folder in ...\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles, but I have no idea as to how to trigger that behavior ... I imagine it is not specifying a folder locations in the ""new profile"" dialog. </p><p>4.

(and obviously - used the desktop unit when the laptop was not using TBird).   8) The laptop seemed stable, but reverted to bad behavior 24 hours later.  Specifically the round tumbler appeared while entering the text for a new e-mail. Tbird was unresponsive; task manager showed only 1% CPU usage, other applications were responsive to keyboard input.  I waited a minute, clicked the ""x"" in the top bar of the Tbird window. Eventually Tbird closed. - Now it has been a while since I have programmed Windows message queue processing, but I think that means Tbird issued a ""Wait Event"" system call for something that was never going to happen, so Tbird could not process incoming posts to its message queue.  The ""x"" in the upper right-hand corner just puts a ""Close"" request in the message queue, and after a short time with no pulls from the message queue, the OS deallocates related task resources. </p><p>And, just for the sake of a ""complete record"" 1) Laptop is only running Windows Defender (and not any of the usual anti-virus culprits - McAfee or Norton) 2) When it was happening, address book failure looks like (i) autocomplete suggests nothing and (ii)  Ctl-shft-B or menu item click brings up address book dialog with no entries </p><p>Thanks Jonathan </p>",JonathanWexler,false,0,0
