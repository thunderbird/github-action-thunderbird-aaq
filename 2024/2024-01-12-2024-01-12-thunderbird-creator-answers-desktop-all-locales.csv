My current Linux Mint system and Thunderbird are both current on updates.  Thunderbird has been experiencing hang for several weeks (maybe more like a couple months) I have been living with it as it will recover if I wait a minute or so.  Today when I started looking the issue I  was more than a little disturbed to find the profile being used was located in mt home folder instead of on the server I had been using it on (I thought) for several years.  Upon further examination it appears I have FOUR profile showing up and the one on the server has not been used in over a year.  Why would my default profile not be where I expect it to be living???  I guessing I have a bunch personal folders data now scattered out across in at least three places and only one of them is getting backed up.  NOT a very happy camper here today. . .  See attached info: I didn't see anything in the log file, but then the hangs seem to recover when I wait them out. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",davedrumm41
