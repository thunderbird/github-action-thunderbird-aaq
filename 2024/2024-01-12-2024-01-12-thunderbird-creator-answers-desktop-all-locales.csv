My current Linux Mint system and Thunderbird are both current on updates.  Thunderbird has been experiencing hang for several weeks (maybe more like a couple months) I have been living with it as it will recover if I wait a minute or so.  Today when I started looking the issue I  was more than a little disturbed to find the profile being used was located in mt home folder instead of on the server I had been using it on (I thought) for several years.  Upon further examination it appears I have FOUR profile showing up and the one on the server has not been used in over a year.  Why would my default profile not be where I expect it to be living???  I guessing I have a bunch personal folders data now scattered out across in at least three places and only one of them is getting backed up.  NOT a very happy camper here today. . .  See attached info: I didn't see anything in the log file, but then the hangs seem to recover when I wait them out. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1630283;,davedrumm41

Moving the message from the inbox to another folder via the web browser interface and then moving it back to the inbox via the same interface restores the content. </p><p>I cannot provide a full example because of the potential to expose confidential information in content that might be decoded by someone else, but attached is a partial example of what I see. Note the subject in the list view versus the lack of subject in the message header and the completely different subject in the message body. </p><p>--&gt;BEGIN TROUBLESHOOTING INFO&lt;-- Application Basics Name 	Thunderbird Version 	115.6.1 Build ID 	20240105183125 Distribution ID 	 Update Channel 	release User Agent 	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:115.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/115.6.1 OS 	Windows_NT 10.0 22621 Launcher Process 	Enabled Multiprocess Windows 	0/0 Fission Windows 	0/0 Enabled by default Remote Processes 	1 Enterprise Policies 	Inactive Google Location Service Key 	Missing Google Safebrowsing Key 	Missing Mozilla Location Service Key 	Missing Safe Mode 	false Memory Size (RAM) 	15.4 GB Disk Space Available 	335 GB Mail and News Accounts ID 		Incoming server 	Outgoing servers Name 	Connection security 	Authentication method 		Name 	Connection security 	Authentication method 	Default? account1		(imap) <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com:993</a>	3	3		<a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com:465</a>	3	3	true account2		(none) Local Folders	0	3 account3		(imap) <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com:993</a>	3	10		<a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com:465</a>	3	10	true account4		(imap) <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com:993</a>	3	10		<a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com:465"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com:465</a>	3	10	true Libraries Library 	Status 	Expected minimum version 	Version in use 	Path RNP (OpenPGP) 				 Calendar Settings </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>@****.org Name 	Value </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Name 	 Type 	caldav Disabled 	 Username 	 URI 	 Refresh Interval 	30 Read-only 	false Suppress Alarms 	false Cache Enabled 	false iMIP Identity 	id1 iMIP Disabled 	 iMIP Account 	 Organizer Id 	 Force Email Scheduling 	 Popup Alarms Supported 	 Alarms on Invitation Supported 	 Max Alarms Per Event 	 Attachment Supported 	 Max Categories 	 Privacy State Supported 	 Priority Supported 	 Event Supported 	true Task Supported 	true Local Time Supported 	 UTC/GMT Supported 	 Auto-Scheduling Supported 	false Home Name 	Value Name 	 Type 	storage Disabled 	false Username 	 URI 	 Refresh Interval 	 Read-only 	 Suppress Alarms 	 Cache Enabled 	 iMIP Identity 	id1 iMIP Disabled 	 iMIP Account 	 Organizer Id 	 Force Email Scheduling 	 Popup Alarms Supported 	 Alarms on Invitation Supported 	 Max Alarms Per Event 	 Attachment Supported 	 Max Categories 	 Privacy State Supported 	 Priority Supported 	true Event Supported 	 Task Supported 	 Local Time Supported 	 UTC/GMT Supported 	 Auto-Scheduling Supported 	 Crash Reports for the Last 3 Days Report ID 	Submitted Remote Processes Type 	Count GPU	1 Add-ons Name 	Type 	Version 	Enabled 	ID <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>	extension	1.1	true	amazondotcom@search.mozilla.org Bing	extension	1.0	true	bing@search.mozilla.org DuckDuckGo	extension	1.0	true	ddg@search.mozilla.org Google	extension	1.0	true	google@search.mozilla.org Wikipedia (en)	extension	1.0	true	wikipedia@search.mozilla.org XNote++	extension	4.1.12	false	xnote@froihofer.net Security Software Type 	Name Antivirus 	Microsoft Defender Antivirus Antispyware 	 Firewall 	Windows Firewall Graphics Features Compositing	WebRender Asynchronous Pan/Zoom	wheel input enabled; scrollbar drag enabled; keyboard enabled; autoscroll enabled; smooth pinch-zoom enabled WebGL 1 Driver WSI Info	EGL_VENDOR: Google Inc.

I would like to totally wipe the installation from my computer and start over.   </p><p>When I uninstall using the built-in installer in Windows apps, some of the features are removed, but apparently not all, because when I re-download and reinstall, my old emails pop right back up.   That tells me that info. about that installation is still lurking on my computer somewhere.  I want a completely fresh installation that requires me to recreate my Thunderbird profile, etc. and requires me to re-link  Thunderbird to my G-mail account. </p><p>Is there a way to accomplish this erasure? </p><p>Thanks a mil. </p><p>GAS </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1630207;1630212;1630261;,gstring1940
