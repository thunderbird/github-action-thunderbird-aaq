After my Windows 11 update my gmail folder set works as it did before (inbox, spam, sent, etc.) but now nothing shows up in my local folders set like (inbox, spam, sent, etc.) </p><p>In my local folders I have an additional 15 folders which contain miscellaneous email that I have saved over the years and continue to hold mail that I want to save. (See the image I included) </p><p>Are my local folders not supposed to have links to inbox, spam, sent, etc.? Now these icons do nothing when I click them. If these icons are supposed to be a working part of Thunderbird how do I make them work? </p><p>I know that there are a lot of other Thunderbird users who have problems that are much more important it just seems like all of the settings that I have enjoyed for many years have decided to rise up against me. LOL I really appreciate your help. </p>",cohall46,false,0,0

The normal process is to receive messages in just the one inbox, as you are now experiencing. Others here may have better information on that. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
