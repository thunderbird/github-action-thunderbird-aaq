Recently cox transitioned to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> with their email and users had to transition over.  I was able to do this for 5 accounts - no problem.  My <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> was a bit more of a challenge but I was able to get it to work.  Last week I started getting sign-in errors.  Nothing worked and I deleted my <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> address in Thunderbird figuring it would be better to just start over - wrong choice.  Now I cannot even install my <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> account on my Thunderbird. </p><p>I first tried the straightforward approach.  Get an app password from my Microsoft account.  Nest I it account actions, add email account.  I added my name, email address and app password.  When I hit ok a message quickly flashed saying configuration doesn't work.  When I done I get a message that server already exists.  I tried going to manual configuration and changed to normal password but got the message again that server exists.  I went to the Outgoing server (SMTP) list but the outlook server doesn't show up.I tried using the hotmail password instead og the app password with same results.  Finally I logged out of Thunderbird, turned off the two party requirement in Outlook and again tried to add the account to Thunderbird.  Now I get the message 'could not get issuer fot oauth2 authentication'.  I next went into manual configuration, turned authentication to 'normal password' the the hotmail account installed. </p><p>I closed Thunderbird and started again.  sent a message to the hotmail account and had to reenter the password - works.  Tried to send a message and was asked againgn for the app password - then it works.  So all is good except when I check the server settings for smtp and IMAP, ot shows 'normal password'  After strugglig for two hours I do not want to risk  changing them to oauth2.  Checked under 'saved logins' and the app password is shown.  Is it likely that I have arrived at a stable solution? What am I risking by having the 'normal password' authentication? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1660688;1660690;,duhnel
