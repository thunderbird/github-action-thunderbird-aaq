Recently cox transitioned to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> with their email and users had to transition over.  I was able to do this for 5 accounts - no problem.  My <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> was a bit more of a challenge but I was able to get it to work.  Last week I started getting sign-in errors.  Nothing worked and I deleted my <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> address in Thunderbird figuring it would be better to just start over - wrong choice.  Now I cannot even install my <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> account on my Thunderbird. </p><p>I first tried the straightforward approach.  Get an app password from my Microsoft account.  Nest I it account actions, add email account.  I added my name, email address and app password.  When I hit ok a message quickly flashed saying configuration doesn't work.  When I done I get a message that server already exists.  I tried going to manual configuration and changed to normal password but got the message again that server exists.  I went to the Outgoing server (SMTP) list but the outlook server doesn't show up.I tried using the hotmail password instead og the app password with same results.  Finally I logged out of Thunderbird, turned off the two party requirement in Outlook and again tried to add the account to Thunderbird.  Now I get the message 'could not get issuer fot oauth2 authentication'.  I next went into manual configuration, turned authentication to 'normal password' the the hotmail account installed. </p><p>I closed Thunderbird and started again.  sent a message to the hotmail account and had to reenter the password - works.  Tried to send a message and was asked againgn for the app password - then it works.  So all is good except when I check the server settings for smtp and IMAP, ot shows 'normal password'  After strugglig for two hours I do not want to risk  changing them to oauth2.  Checked under 'saved logins' and the app password is shown.  Is it likely that I have arrived at a stable solution? What am I risking by having the 'normal password' authentication? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1660688;1660690;1660731;,duhnel

Hosting email server has 2966 emails that I would like to recover. Started process of downloading them and got to 1895 when it failed with the error message ""Unable to write email to mailbox"" Check the settings. Tried removing the account and recreating it. Removed the 1895 emails that I have downloaded and got the same result. It seems to be broken some where between Thunderbird and the hosting mailserver as I can login via webmail and see and read the balance of 1071 emails. Techs at the hosting server company have no idea what could be causing the problem. Any help would be appreciated. Regards, Richard </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1660706;,freedom13

On a previous computer I had both providers working side by side without difficulty.  However my attempted download  of Thunderbird is thwarted by the message ""you are about to override how Thunderbird identifies with this site. Legitimate banks, stores and other sites will not ask you to do this"". </p><p>My further investigations online suggest I should ""check where my email is posted  (My broadband connection is with Shell Energy) and if in the same domain as the mail server, create the security exception"".  </p><p>I am not sufficiently computer literate to understand all this and Shell Energy say they cannot advise me. I do not wish to lose my existing email access via Zimbra and wish to continue using my email address. Would creating the security exception solve the problem and enable me to get  both email services together?   </p><pre>With thanks, Patrick Palmer </pre>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",patrick.palmer
