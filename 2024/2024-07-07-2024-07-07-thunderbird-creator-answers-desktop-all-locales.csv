Recently cox transitioned to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> with their email and users had to transition over.  I was able to do this for 5 accounts - no problem.  My <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> was a bit more of a challenge but I was able to get it to work.  Last week I started getting sign-in errors.  Nothing worked and I deleted my <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> address in Thunderbird figuring it would be better to just start over - wrong choice.  Now I cannot even install my <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> account on my Thunderbird. </p><p>I first tried the straightforward approach.  Get an app password from my Microsoft account.  Nest I it account actions, add email account.  I added my name, email address and app password.  When I hit ok a message quickly flashed saying configuration doesn't work.  When I done I get a message that server already exists.  I tried going to manual configuration and changed to normal password but got the message again that server exists.  I went to the Outgoing server (SMTP) list but the outlook server doesn't show up.I tried using the hotmail password instead og the app password with same results.  Finally I logged out of Thunderbird, turned off the two party requirement in Outlook and again tried to add the account to Thunderbird.  Now I get the message 'could not get issuer fot oauth2 authentication'.  I next went into manual configuration, turned authentication to 'normal password' the the hotmail account installed. </p><p>I closed Thunderbird and started again.  sent a message to the hotmail account and had to reenter the password - works.  Tried to send a message and was asked againgn for the app password - then it works.  So all is good except when I check the server settings for smtp and IMAP, ot shows 'normal password'  After strugglig for two hours I do not want to risk  changing them to oauth2.  Checked under 'saved logins' and the app password is shown.  Is it likely that I have arrived at a stable solution? What am I risking by having the 'normal password' authentication? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1660688;1660690;1660731;,duhnel

Hosting email server has 2966 emails that I would like to recover.

Pro predstavu mam podpis ""A"" a ""B"" a ja si dokazu nastavit aby se mi podpis A nebo B vkladal do mailu ale mohu tam mit jen jeden. Ale ja bych potreboval mezi nimi umet prepinat. Napriklad standartne pisu mail s podpisem A ale vyjimecne napisu mail treba v jinem jazyce a potrebuji tam vlozit podpis B. Mam vlastni velikost, styl a barvu pisma a pod tim vlozeny obrazek. Pro predstavu prikladam oba podpisy. Zkusil jsem doplnek Quicktext ale nepodarilo se mi do nej dat presne tyto podpisy. Jde to nejak? A jeste jeden dotaz. Jde nastavit aby pozadi odeslaneho mailu nebylo bile ale cerne? Aby kazdy komu mail poslu mel cerne pozadi a bily text a ne obracene? Diky. </p><p>__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ </p><p>Hi, I have a request. I have switched from outlook to thunderbird but somehow I can't set up signature switching. To give you an idea, I have a signature ""A"" and ""B"" and I can set the signature A or B to be inserted in my mail but I can only have one. But I would need to be able to switch between them. For example, I normally write mail with signature A but exceptionally I write mail in another language and I need to insert signature B. I have my own font size, style and color and a picture underneath. For an idea I attach both signatures. I have tried Quicktext addon but I couldn't get these signatures into it. Is there any way? And one more question. Is it possible to set the background of the sent mail to black instead of white? So that everyone to whom I send mail has a black background and white text and not reversed? Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,cs,1660751;1660753;,Farkpoint
