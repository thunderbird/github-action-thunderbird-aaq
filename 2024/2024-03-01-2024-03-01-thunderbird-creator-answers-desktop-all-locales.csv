En cada equipo está instalado thunderbird con una casilla de correo de uso común del servicio.  Ahora, por ejemplo, para un usuario en particular, usando el mismo perfil de winodws o linux, deseo crearle un perfil con clave de acceso que tenga embebido una casilla personal.  Eso lo logré iniciando, por ejemplo, en windows, ""thunderbird -p"". Eso me llevó a la configuración de perfiles, generé uno nuevo, definí la casilla por imap, etc.  Estando ya con el perfil abierto le definí una clave maestra para ese perfil, entonces, al iniciar thunderbird, me consulta que perfil quiero usar; puedo acceder a alguno que no tenga clave maestra o al que sí.  El tema es que, estando en el administrador de perfiles, por más que el perfil tenga clave maestra, un usuario cualquiera puede borrar un perfil y no le pregunta nada. También puede realizarse esa acción a propósito. No veo seguridad al administrar perfiles.  Les consulto: hay alguna forma que NO se pueda borrar el perfil sin seguridad, es decir, que no se pueda borrar alegremente sin ninguna restricción de seguridad?
