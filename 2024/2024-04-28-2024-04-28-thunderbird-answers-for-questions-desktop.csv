I have a few questions about the quoted portion of our post: I'm not sure what you mean by ""Compact the POP"". I'm guessing you're referring to the server (webmail) and not the Thunderbird inbox, but I don't know what compact means. </p><p>The biggest comment has to do with your remark about the 'older than xxxx days' being irrelevant on POP accounts. I am not disputing this, but is this documented somewhere? I would actually hope that when I chose this option for a POP account I should get a warning message.    </p><p>Last but not least: I want to make absolutely sure I understand the distinction between your use of ""POP account"" vs. POP server. Are you saying that the  'older than xxxx days' option refers to deleting emails from the Thunderbird email account and not from the POP server? That seems strange since this is an option under ""Leave messages on <strong>server</strong> "" This is crucial. I have always been under the impression that deleting emails from the Thunderbird client was something explicit, i.e. the user had to select/mark one or more emails and then manually delete them.  </p><p>If this is what you are saying, then there are only 2 ways to delete emails from a POP server: 1. Manually delete them from the server using a browser and the webmail server. 2. Delete them from Thunderbird and have the 'until I delete them' option delete them from the server the next time I download new emails. This is completely counterintuitive.  </p><p>Sorry to hammer these points, but I must be sure I understand what you're saying. This is especially aggravating since in another question I asked a while back, I was told by another contributor that my method of manually deleting emails from the server was inefficient, and told me to use the 'older than xxxx days' option! Hopefully you can see how frustrating this is. </p>",TampaTom,false,0,0

Corruption usually occurs when an Anti-Virus or Malware program tries to scan it or fix something. It can also occur if regular housekeeping eg: compacting of folder is not performed. </p><p>If you are using an Imap account then everything is stored on the server, so it would a simple case of Removing the imap mail account and any previosuly downloaded data via 'Account Settings'.

Check all your Account Settings are as set up as required. New files would be created and emails will get downloaded again. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Tried that, but the delete program (which was going for everything in the gmail folder, not just inbox) halted, messaging that the file was in use by another program, which seems implausible.
