By default your computer 'Windows Security' asks for the computer User Account password. What is meant by 'computer User Account' password:  When you start up computer, the first thing that happens is you get asked to logon to computer User Account because at this point you cannot see desktop - that is the password you enter - it has nothing to do with Thunderbird or mail accounts, there is no old or new involved - if you can see your desktop and run various programs like Thunderbird then you must have already logged on the computer User Account. It's asking for the computer User login password. </p><p>However, if you have set up a 'Primary Password' previously called 'Master Password' then it acts like a Master key and you need to enter that password. How do you find out if you have set up a 'Primary Password': In 'Settings' &gt; 'Privacy &amp; Security' scroll down to Passwords section Is this checkbox selected&nbsp;: 'Use a Primary Password'&nbsp;? If yes, then it wants the Primary Password you set up - that has nothing to do with mail account passwords.

A nice feature is that it lets you temporarily disable the anti-virus with automatic return after x minutes. That's what I did per your suggestion.
