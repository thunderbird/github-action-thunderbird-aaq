You create an account and it works fine, and it's not there on a restart. That happens because Thunderbird was unable to update the prefs.js file. Further proof is that you have many prefs files. I don't know if it's an antivirus, VPN, or what, but there is an interruption to Thunderbird that is causing this. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Puzzling, as I have a GMX account and can see folders. You might try highlighting account, rightclick and click 'subscribe.' The other person found that didn't work either. This might be somehow tied to something done by GMC -- but I have no idea. What interested me is seeing the same issue posted in the same 24-hr period.
