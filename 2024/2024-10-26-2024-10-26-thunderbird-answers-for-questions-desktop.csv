By default your computer 'Windows Security' asks for the computer User Account password. What is meant by 'computer User Account' password:  When you start up computer, the first thing that happens is you get asked to logon to computer User Account because at this point you cannot see desktop - that is the password you enter - it has nothing to do with Thunderbird or mail accounts, there is no old or new involved - if you can see your desktop and run various programs like Thunderbird then you must have already logged on the computer User Account. It's asking for the computer User login password. </p><p>However, if you have set up a 'Primary Password' previously called 'Master Password' then it acts like a Master key and you need to enter that password. How do you find out if you have set up a 'Primary Password': In 'Settings' &gt; 'Privacy &amp; Security' scroll down to Passwords section Is this checkbox selected&nbsp;: 'Use a Primary Password'&nbsp;? If yes, then it wants the Primary Password you set up - that has nothing to do with mail account passwords.

If the addon is causing an issue then this is not a Thunderbird problem because the addon extension belongs to the author and it is their responsibility to ensure their product works with Thunderbird. </p><p>As updates in Thunderbird occur, modifications may occur in the code and as you are aware there has been a total rewrite of Thunderbird and modifications continue. This makes it quite a job for those who write addon extensions to keep up with the different versions.  </p><p>If you experience an issue and you can reproduce the problem, then I advise you contact the author and let them know all about it.  Please remember, the author of the addon is independent of Thunderbird (Mozilla is not Thunderbird either - they are the ones who do Firefox etc)  and authors rely on donations by users to help with maintenance etc of addons. </p><p>Maybe you did not have the most recent version of Expression Search - NG?
