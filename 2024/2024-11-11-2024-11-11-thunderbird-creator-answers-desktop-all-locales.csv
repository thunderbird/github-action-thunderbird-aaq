I prefer to use single spacing but in order to do this I have to type all the way to the end of the page and then it will automatically go to the next paragraph and will then use single spacing.  I would really like to be able to format my emails with single spacing and different margins other than what I have to use now (i.e.using the entire width of the message).  I cannot find any way to change this automatic double spacing and change the width of the paragraph at the same time.  From the drop down list  directly above the body of the message, I have tried changing from Body Text to Paragraph and back again, but nothing works.  Thanks very much for your help. </p><p>P. S.  I am using Windows 10 with Thunderbird version 128.4.2 esr.  I had the same problem in more recent versions but not in older versions. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1687200;,c.evansandrews

This also happened a couple of weeks ago, and was resolved with Optus Tech support by updating the SMTP settings, but they don't seem to be able to help this time. What settings do you recommend?

Thunderbird seemed to read my profiles folder correctly, as all my accounts and RSS feeds were present after I copied the old profile to folder to my new .thunderbird directory. However, after downloading the header files for the emails I have received since switching computers, it then tries to download all 60,000 emails or so on my gmail account even though most of these emails should be included in the profile folder already - it looks like have 6 GB INBOX file within this profile.  </p><p>Is there a way to get thunderbird to read the profile without redownloading all the messages from my accounts? I unfortunately no longer have access to my old windows machine that this profile is from, just the profile folder itself. Let me know if there is anything I can do! </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",utheriwagura
