I prefer to use single spacing but in order to do this I have to type all the way to the end of the page and then it will automatically go to the next paragraph and will then use single spacing.  I would really like to be able to format my emails with single spacing and different margins other than what I have to use now (i.e.using the entire width of the message).  I cannot find any way to change this automatic double spacing and change the width of the paragraph at the same time.  From the drop down list  directly above the body of the message, I have tried changing from Body Text to Paragraph and back again, but nothing works.  Thanks very much for your help. </p><p>P. S.  I am using Windows 10 with Thunderbird version 128.4.2 esr.  I had the same problem in more recent versions but not in older versions. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1687200;,c.evansandrews
