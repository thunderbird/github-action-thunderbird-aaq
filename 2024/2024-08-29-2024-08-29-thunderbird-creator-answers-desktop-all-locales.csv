(Yes again!),"<p>I want to add my voice to the myriad complaints that have already been posted about the way Thunderbird has started threading messages! </p><p>I <strong>loathe</strong> threading!  </p><p>Like many others, I do not understand why there is not a simple menu option, or something in the settings, that lets me turn OFF threading, permanently, in every folder of every account. </p><p>There are so many complaints about this that I just had to stop reading them after half an hour.  I agree with most of them, so I won't reiterate every single point.  I couldn't see any poster defending threading, and I couldn't see anything from a developer explaining why this is forced on users.  Is it simply a matter of the developers themselves liking it, and not caring what the user base thinks?  I respect the developers.  I respect Linus Torvalds too, but I don't hesitate to call him out when he says something really dumb, which he does depressingly often.  Being a developer gives you the right to control a product, but it does not make you right. </p><p>I am a monthly financial contributor to Thunderbird.  I have used it for many years.  But this is a deal-breaker for me.  If a solution to this problem isn't forthcoming, *soon*, I will abandon ship. The withdrawal of my small monthly financial support won't hurt the team.  I only mention it to establish that I have been a committed Thunderbird user who demonstrates that commitment in practical terms. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",mozilla411

Versione di thunderbird aggiornata 128.1.1esr. In pratica quando vado a visualizzare (cercare) tra la posta in arrivo, per cercare delle mail precedenti ma importanti, mi sono ritrovata a non visualizzare più il testo della mail, ossia compare tutto bianco anche se nell'elenco compare sia mittente e oggetto mail, ma quando mi sposto ed evidenzio la mail (classica barretta blu per la selezione) ecco che non compare più nulla, visualizza nell'anteprima ancora mittente ed oggetto dell'ultima mail che avevo selezionato (e che riesco a vedere il testo) e basta. Se provo ad aprire il messaggio in una nuova finestra zero assoluto tutto bianco (come messo nell'immagine). Questo succede per mail ricevuto in un arco di tempo anche dell'ultimo anno, poi ad un certo ponto mail precedenti riesco a leggerle e quelle recenti degli ultimi due giorni anche.
