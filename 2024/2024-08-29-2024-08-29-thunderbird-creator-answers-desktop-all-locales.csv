(Yes again!),"<p>I want to add my voice to the myriad complaints that have already been posted about the way Thunderbird has started threading messages! </p><p>I <strong>loathe</strong> threading!  </p><p>Like many others, I do not understand why there is not a simple menu option, or something in the settings, that lets me turn OFF threading, permanently, in every folder of every account. </p><p>There are so many complaints about this that I just had to stop reading them after half an hour.  I agree with most of them, so I won't reiterate every single point.  I couldn't see any poster defending threading, and I couldn't see anything from a developer explaining why this is forced on users.  Is it simply a matter of the developers themselves liking it, and not caring what the user base thinks?  I respect the developers.  I respect Linus Torvalds too, but I don't hesitate to call him out when he says something really dumb, which he does depressingly often.  Being a developer gives you the right to control a product, but it does not make you right. </p><p>I am a monthly financial contributor to Thunderbird.  I have used it for many years.  But this is a deal-breaker for me.  If a solution to this problem isn't forthcoming, *soon*, I will abandon ship. The withdrawal of my small monthly financial support won't hurt the team.  I only mention it to establish that I have been a committed Thunderbird user who demonstrates that commitment in practical terms. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",mozilla411
