A personal one (<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>) and a business one (<a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>).  I have set them both up on Thunderbird and they seem to be coming through without any problems.  BUT, I am now the only one who gets the <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a> emails (through to my laptop via Thunderbird).  Yesterday I alerted my husband that he had a couple of business emails to deal with which he does on his ipad via the mail app, and when he opened it, he had absolutely nothing there where there are normally quite a lot of emails there due to all of the mailing lists that our business has ended up on.  He is not very happy about losing access to his emails and wants me to get rid of Thunderbird which I really dont want to do.  Has anyone got any idea why this is happening please? I have spent hours reading about things that say to tick a box that says to leave messages on the server, but I feel I have looked everywhere multiple times and just cant find this box.  Thanks in advance. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",traci1503
