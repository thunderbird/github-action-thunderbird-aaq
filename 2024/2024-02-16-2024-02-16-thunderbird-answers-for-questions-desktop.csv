Generally Thunderbird issues an expunge with a compact of IMAP accounts and also on exit for the inbox.  But the expunge on exit needs to be selected and I have seen folk disable it because they do not know what it is.  I also see a lot of folk with failed compacts because their antivirus gets in on the process and causes failure before completion.  This usually leaves NSTMP folders in the all folders view, but not always. </p><p>So if your compacts are working I have no real Idea.  but I am guessing the expunge part of the process is not.

Here are some possibilities and solutions: 1.	Windows 10 Dark Mode: •	If you have Windows 10 in dark mode, it can affect the appearance of applications, including Thunderbird. •	To check and adjust this, go to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors and ensure that the ""Choose your color"" setting is set to either ""Light"" or ""Dark"" based on your preference. 2.	Thunderbird Theme Settings: •	Thunderbird itself has theme settings that might be affecting the appearance. •	Open Thunderbird and go to Options/Preferences &gt; General &gt; Theme. Check if ""Default"" is selected. You can also choose a specific theme and see if the issue persists. 3.	Add-ons or Extensions: •	Some add-ons or extensions in Thunderbird might be changing the theme dynamically. •	Go to Tools &gt; Add-ons and review the installed extensions. Disable them one by one and see if the issue persists after each disable. This will help identify if any particular extension is causing the problem. 4.	Windows 10 Accent Color: •	Windows 10 allows you to set an accent color, and some applications, including Thunderbird, may use this color in their interface. •	Check your Windows 10 accent color settings: Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors. Try changing the accent color and see if it affects Thunderbird. 5.	Check for Thunderbird Updates: •	Ensure that you are using the latest version of Thunderbird. Updates may include bug fixes that could address this issue. 6.	Operating System Updates: •	Make sure your Windows operating system is up-to-date. Some issues may be resolved by installing the latest updates from Microsoft. If the issue persists after trying these steps, you might want to check Thunderbird support forums or contact their support for further assistance, as there could be specific issues related to your Thunderbird version or system configuration. </p>",musiclady1949,false,1,0
