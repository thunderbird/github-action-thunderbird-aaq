After I imported, I had my emails, but every one of the accounts keeps constantly putting up messages that the passwords weren’t accepted. Also, the total appearance of Thunderbird is far more basic. I can’t even get at my Profiles in my Macrium backup, as it claims I don’t have access! </p><p>Edit: Sorted the passwords and started getting the general appearance back to normal, then made the mistake of trying to unify my messages from all accounts and managed to wipe them all out. Tried reinstalling TB several times and importing again  -still no messages. At this point, TB no longer appeared under Settings/Apps. Am currently restoring my backup, going back to my pre-clean installation days…Going to bed </p>",Tombarkas,false,0,0

Also check to see if you have any extension addons that set dark mode. These are the usual two areas for dark mode.
