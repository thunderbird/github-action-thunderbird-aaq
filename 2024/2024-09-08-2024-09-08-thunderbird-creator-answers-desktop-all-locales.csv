I was under the impression that the archive within MSH could be run against a stand-alone PST file (that is, Outlook is not installed). When I select Archive Email as per instructions on other posts, and specify the location of the PST file and then run, I get an error: ""This feature requires Microsoft Outlook XP/2003 or higher"". Does it require Outlook to be installed, or am I doing something wrong?  Also I am a bit unclear of the run sequence with MSH - do I run Archive Email followed by Export Email and what is the connection between the two?  Refer to image attached. Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",sep
