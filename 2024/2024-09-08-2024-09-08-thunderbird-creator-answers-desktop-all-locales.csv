When I select Archive Email as per instructions on other posts, and specify the location of the PST file and then run, I get an error: ""This feature requires Microsoft Outlook XP/2003 or higher"". Does it require Outlook to be installed, or am I doing something wrong?

Several months ago, Tbird changed my Inbox view (running Windows 11 Pro) from Classic to something else.  With help from somebody (?David?) on this Forum, I was able to get back to Classic view by pressing the F8 function key.  </p><p>But last night, the view changed again  and F8 doesn't work.  All F8 seems to do is toggle the # of messages displayed between 7 and 14.   On this gawdawful new view (shown in Screenshot 01), instead of having the CONTENT of the highlighted message displayed at the bottom of the screen, in order to actually READ a message, I must click on it, and then it appears in a separate window.  Thus deleting the endless number of messages asking for money is a HUGE time-waster. </p><p>PLEASE can somebody give me a RELIABLE way to get back to Classic view?  (Even better, can you tell me if there was something I mistakenly did to cause the view to change, so that I will take care not to do it again? </p><p>All the existing advice I've found on this Forum seems to relate to prior versions.  That is, when I try to follow the advice, the screenshots don't match what I see on my screen.   I've included a couple of screenshots that show one of the places that I looked for possible remedies.   Screenshot 02 shows what appears when you hover the mouse over a weird little icon that theoretically governs ""Message List Display Options"".  Screenshot 03 shows what appears when you click on that icon, offering mysterious options like ""Table View"" and ""Card View"".
