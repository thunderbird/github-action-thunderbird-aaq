Thus deleting the endless number of messages asking for money is a HUGE time-waster. </p><p>PLEASE can somebody give me a RELIABLE way to get back to Classic view?

I have also added this .vcf file to My Contacts in Windows and they can be accessed in and individual or list format in the File Explorer. Thunderbird should be able to read this folder with no need for imports. Appreciate any  comments in this matter. </p><p>Ramon Arriaza ramarrie @gmail.com </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",eudoro
