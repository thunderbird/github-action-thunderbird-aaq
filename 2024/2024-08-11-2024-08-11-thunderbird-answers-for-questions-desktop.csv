Some e-mails are directed to a box named ""spam.""  All other e-mails show up in a box entitled ""in"" [containing unknown e-mail addresses].  Sometimes I want to save an unknown e-mail from the ""in"" box.  For years I have been able to highlight the address of the unknown e-mail and drag and drop it into my ""save"" box and it remains there.  I can also then register that unknown address so that in the future it automatically is directed to my ""save"" box.  About 2 months ago, when I dragged an unknown e-mail address [from ""in""] to the ""save"" box, it completely disappeared.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  [It did not go to spam nor to trash.]    I thought that I had too many stored e-mails.  So, I deleted a lot of e-mails and also transferred a lot of e-mails to my local folders.  But that didn't help at all.  Do you have any ideas? </p>",joanmiller,false,0,0

That way at the beginning of the day it's easy to scan through the list of new email and delete those you know you don't want to read, like promotions and so on.  The table view compresses the reading pane from above, and is somewhat useless in vertical view because all of the columns are truncated. </p><p>Screens are generally wider than they are tall, so I find that it's a better use of space having the message list on the side instead of above, and having adjacent to the folder list makes it function somewhat like an expanding folder list in a file manager.  You get to see the folder, the messages it contains, and view the contents of the message you've selected. </p><p>The having the current delete button functionality that's available in table view also available in card view would be a big win for me efficiency-wise.
