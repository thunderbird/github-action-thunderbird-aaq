Some e-mails are directed to a box named ""spam.""  All other e-mails show up in a box entitled ""in"" [containing unknown e-mail addresses].  Sometimes I want to save an unknown e-mail from the ""in"" box.  For years I have been able to highlight the address of the unknown e-mail and drag and drop it into my ""save"" box and it remains there.  I can also then register that unknown address so that in the future it automatically is directed to my ""save"" box.  About 2 months ago, when I dragged an unknown e-mail address [from ""in""] to the ""save"" box, it completely disappeared.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  [It did not go to spam nor to trash.]    I thought that I had too many stored e-mails.  So, I deleted a lot of e-mails and also transferred a lot of e-mails to my local folders.  But that didn't help at all.  Do you have any ideas? </p>",joanmiller,false,0,0

As far as I know there is nothing but some changes to DKIM, DMARC and SPF requirements at Google and Yahoo in the wind and they have nothing to do with email clients, only servers. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
