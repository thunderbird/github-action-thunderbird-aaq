Some e-mails are directed to a box named ""spam.""  All other e-mails show up in a box entitled ""in"" [containing unknown e-mail addresses].  Sometimes I want to save an unknown e-mail from the ""in"" box.  For years I have been able to highlight the address of the unknown e-mail and drag and drop it into my ""save"" box and it remains there.  I can also then register that unknown address so that in the future it automatically is directed to my ""save"" box.  About 2 months ago, when I dragged an unknown e-mail address [from ""in""] to the ""save"" box, it completely disappeared.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  [It did not go to spam nor to trash.]    I thought that I had too many stored e-mails.  So, I deleted a lot of e-mails and also transferred a lot of e-mails to my local folders.  But that didn't help at all.  Do you have any ideas? </p>",joanmiller,false,0,0
