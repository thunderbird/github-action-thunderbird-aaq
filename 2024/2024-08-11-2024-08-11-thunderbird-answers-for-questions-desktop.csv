Some e-mails are directed to a box named ""spam.""  All other e-mails show up in a box entitled ""in"" [containing unknown e-mail addresses].  Sometimes I want to save an unknown e-mail from the ""in"" box.  For years I have been able to highlight the address of the unknown e-mail and drag and drop it into my ""save"" box and it remains there.  I can also then register that unknown address so that in the future it automatically is directed to my ""save"" box.  About 2 months ago, when I dragged an unknown e-mail address [from ""in""] to the ""save"" box, it completely disappeared.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  [It did not go to spam nor to trash.]    I thought that I had too many stored e-mails.  So, I deleted a lot of e-mails and also transferred a lot of e-mails to my local folders.  But that didn't help at all.  Do you have any ideas? </p>",joanmiller,false,0,0

As far as I know there is nothing but some changes to DKIM, DMARC and SPF requirements at Google and Yahoo in the wind and they have nothing to do with email clients, only servers. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Below is the email that MS sent me:  </p><p><em><strong>Update your sign-in technology before September 16th, 2024 to maintain email access.</strong></em> </p><p>The safety and security of your information is top priority for Microsoft. To help keep your account secure, Microsoft will no longer support the use of third-party email and calendar apps which ask you to sign in with only your Microsoft Account username and password. To keep you safe you will need to use a mail or calendar app which supports Microsoftâ€™s modern authentication methods. If you do not act, your third-party email apps will no longer be able to access your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, Hotmail or <a href=""http://Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Live.com</a> email address on September 16th. </p><p><br>  </p><p>What do you need to do? </p><p>If you are receiving this email, you are currently using an email or calendar app that uses a less secure authentication method to connect to your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> email account. You will need to upgrade your third-party mail and calendar app to a version which supports modern authentication methods. </p><p><br>  </p><p>Microsoft provides free versions of Outlook for your PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices which can be easily downloaded and connect to your email account. Using an updated version of an Outlook application will ensure you are connecting in the most secure way. </p><p><br>  </p><p>How can you set up your Gmail, Apple Mail, or other third-party mail application? </p><p>Various non-Microsoft applications will have their own steps for connecting to your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> email account using modern authentication methods. See our help article - Modern Authentication Methods now needed to continue syncing Outlook Email in non-Microsoft email apps. However, you may need to contact the creators of those applications to provide you with instructions. In many cases, simply removing and re-adding your account with the latest version of that application will configure it to use modern authentication methods. </p><p>This is a mandatory service communication.
