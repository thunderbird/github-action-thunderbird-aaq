I have a dead email account I would like to delete.  The company deleted their email server.  I can delete my account but when Thunderbird gets shut down for any reason, the email account shows up again.  I have even logged in as administrator and deleted the account.  The account returned.   If I log out of Thunderbird and log back in, the account returns.  If I have a power failure, when I log back in, the account has returned.  If I log out to do a re-start, the account returns. The second question is similar.  I have an account that I can add and it works very well but if Thunderbird is shut down, it disappears.  Then I have to put it back in.  Putting the account in as ""admin"" does not help either.  Yes, I can put it in as ""admin"", but it will disappear if Thunderbird is shut down.   I have thought about changing all the information in the one account that I cannot delete to the information in the other account that I cannot keep to see if this is a workaround.
