However, my PC has a small solid state drive (128 GB) and Thunderbird is creating very large files.  The first time this happened I uninstalled Thunderbird and then reinstalled it and picked up about 20 GB on the hard drive.  I have always installed it with the standard selections. When space became short again, I started deleting or moving files and applications.  I would free up 15 GB, but the next time I booted up, that space would be gone. Using  WinDirStat, I found a folder in my Users/myname/appdata/roaming/Thunderbird that was 70GB, more than 1/2 my drive.  As info, the total space used for email on the Gmail server was only 13GB.  I uninstalled Thunderbird but only picked up a small amount of space.  I manually deleted the Thunderbird folder and picked up 70 GB in storage.  Outlook seems to have no such folder, I also learned that deleting an email message in my inbox folder does not delete it from my Important or from my All Mail folders and most importantly the Gmail server.  I was suprised to find that the all mail folder on the server contained nearly 200,000 messages.  The only way to delete them was going to gmail using a browser and deleting them directly on the server. I would like to return to Thunderbird if these problems can be resolved. </p>",lanejm47;sfhowes;wsmwk;,true,false,false,";category:other;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird",2,0,0,,,

If I hit the cloud button in the upper left corner of my Tbird window, it shows my email at the bottom of the screen, says downloading from host.  It sometimes just shuts down, or will show how many messages there are to download and then shuts down, or shows the number of messages to download with the blue light bar at the right at the bottom of the page just scrolling without downloading the messages.  Usually it just shows it has contacted the host, shows the number of messages it is going to download and just turns off in a few seconds.  I tried clearing out messages from the Earthlink Webmail, in case there was a message causing the error, cleared a bunch of messages out of my Tbird inbox, deleted the messages built up in trash, cleared the caches of both Tbird and Firefox.  I've used Tbird for years on the same computer I'm using now.
