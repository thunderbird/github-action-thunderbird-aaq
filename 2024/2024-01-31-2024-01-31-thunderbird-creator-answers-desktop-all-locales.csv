I've read dozens and dozens of support threads about that.  This problem has nothing to do with that.  </p><p>Issue: There does not seem to be a way to force TB to use a default user-defined column view. The way *I* set up my columns is: Star/Attachments/From/Recipient/Thread/Subject/Received/Size.  Other users will have their own preference on which columns to display in which order. I know I can change the displayed columns and replicate that to existing folders, cascading down for the account view. That's great. </p><p>However, whenever I create a new folder or change the name of a folder it will revert back to showing the columns TB used before. Same when I move a folder from one subfolder to another (which I suppose amounts to changing the name, in a way) </p><p>I wish there were a default I could set so that ANY new folder I create wherever in the account will have the same columns displayed. And that the columns displayed will stay the same when I change name of a folder. </p><p>I've also looked for an add-on that might accomplish this but could not find. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",rkuipers1
