I've read dozens and dozens of support threads about that.  This problem has nothing to do with that.  </p><p>Issue: There does not seem to be a way to force TB to use a default user-defined column view. The way *I* set up my columns is: Star/Attachments/From/Recipient/Thread/Subject/Received/Size.  Other users will have their own preference on which columns to display in which order. I know I can change the displayed columns and replicate that to existing folders, cascading down for the account view. That's great. </p><p>However, whenever I create a new folder or change the name of a folder it will revert back to showing the columns TB used before. Same when I move a folder from one subfolder to another (which I suppose amounts to changing the name, in a way) </p><p>I wish there were a default I could set so that ANY new folder I create wherever in the account will have the same columns displayed. And that the columns displayed will stay the same when I change name of a folder. </p><p>I've also looked for an add-on that might accomplish this but could not find. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",rkuipers1

All the programs reinstalled properly with the exception of my Thunderbird email account. I attempted to log on and was told my log on credentials were incorrect. I contacted Frontier at least 10 times, speaking with serving techs to refuse to help. I have given them my account number, past phone numbers, email address and password but they refuse to help stating I have a ""email only"" account. My business was sold 2 1/2 years ago and the phone number were closed at that time. I've had my email account for approximately 30 yrears and can't afford to lose all of my contacts. Can someone help restore this. [removed phone# from public support forum] </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1634341;,alandebuono656

However, my PC has a small solid state drive (128 GB) and Thunderbird is creating very large files.  The first time this happened I uninstalled Thunderbird and then reinstalled it and picked up about 20 GB on the hard drive.  I have always installed it with the standard selections. When space became short again, I started deleting or moving files and applications.  I would free up 15 GB, but the next time I booted up, that space would be gone. Using  WinDirStat, I found a folder in my Users/myname/appdata/roaming/Thunderbird that was 70GB, more than 1/2 my drive.  As info, the total space used for email on the Gmail server was only 13GB.  I uninstalled Thunderbird but only picked up a small amount of space.  I manually deleted the Thunderbird folder and picked up 70 GB in storage.  Outlook seems to have no such folder, I also learned that deleting an email message in my inbox folder does not delete it from my Important or from my All Mail folders and most importantly the Gmail server.  I was suprised to find that the all mail folder on the server contained nearly 200,000 messages.  The only way to delete them was going to gmail using a browser and deleting them directly on the server. I would like to return to Thunderbird if these problems can be resolved. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1634358;1676193;,lanejm47

There has been a problem recently where Thunderbird won't download my messages.  I open Tbird, log in and the blue bar at the bottom stays on for a while then goes off, no email.  If I hit the cloud button in the upper left corner of my Tbird window, it shows my email at the bottom of the screen, says downloading from host.  It sometimes just shuts down, or will show how many messages there are to download and then shuts down, or shows the number of messages to download with the blue light bar at the right at the bottom of the page just scrolling without downloading the messages.  Usually it just shows it has contacted the host, shows the number of messages it is going to download and just turns off in a few seconds.  I tried clearing out messages from the Earthlink Webmail, in case there was a message causing the error, cleared a bunch of messages out of my Tbird inbox, deleted the messages built up in trash, cleared the caches of both Tbird and Firefox.  I've used Tbird for years on the same computer I'm using now.  Had this same problem a couple weeks ago, took a number of the same steps as per above, shut the computer down and restarted and Tbird was operating normally again until yesterday where the same problem started up again. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",gwingard
