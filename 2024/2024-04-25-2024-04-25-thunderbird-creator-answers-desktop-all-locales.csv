Previously, thunderbird has simply taken the settings from the backed up files and used those to connect to my organisation's mail server. Any ideas?  How can I force Thunderbird to read the old account settings? </p><p>Many thanks. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",cfi2
