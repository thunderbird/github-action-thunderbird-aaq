Previously, thunderbird has simply taken the settings from the backed up files and used those to connect to my organisation's mail server. Any ideas?

Stavo lavorando quando all'improvviso mi è comparso il messaggio: ""Per installare l'aggiornamento di Thunderbird devi riavviare il computer. Vuoi farlo adesso?"". E io l'ho fatto. Risultato. Thunderbird non parte più. Ho provato a riscaricare dal sito la versione 115.10.1 e quella precedente per reinstallarle, ma niente. Sempre lo stesso messaggio. Sul Desktop m'è comparsa questa icona generica (in allegato) e il processo si ripete ogni volta praticamente in loop. Qualcuno mi può aiutare?
