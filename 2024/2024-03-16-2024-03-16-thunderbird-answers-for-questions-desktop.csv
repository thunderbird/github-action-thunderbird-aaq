Others might give you procedures to revert to an older version,  but I will not because it will cause issues going forward.

Please first search this site for similar problem by entering the name of it and then if you don't find a solution provide more derails such as provider and how you authenticate with it. </p>",shopov.bogomil,false,0,0

Remove the passwords from Saved Passwords in Settings, change the authentication for incoming and outgoing, restart TB, enter the account password in the OAuth window to allow access.  Not sure about Exchange, but most MS-type accounts copy sent messages to Sent automatically, so uncheck 'Place a copy in' in Account Settings, Copies &amp; Folders, and subscribe the Sent and any other folders by right-clicking the account in the Folder Pane, Subscribe... </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

Poked around here to find out what they were. Sign of corruption or problems. Didn't try deleting them. Looked in ""Properties"" of the Trash folder and  I came across a ""Repair Folder"" option. I tried it! When it was done the trash folder view flashed and the two 1969 messages were gone. I compacted the Trash folder and got a new message... no longer 1.2GB saved... 2.5GB saved! Whoa! Took Thunderbird down and up. Tried to delete a message.... NO COMPACTING upon deleting the message! Tried to compact the Trash file again... NO COMPACTING!... as in it doesn't need it, I guess? Seems that ""repair folder"" worked. I never saw this in any discussion of compacting issues. Hope it works for someone else. </p>",ajchicago,false,0,0
