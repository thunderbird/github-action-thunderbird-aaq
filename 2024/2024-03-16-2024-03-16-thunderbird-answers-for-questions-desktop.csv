I followed your suggestion and went into the Outgoing Server section at the bottom of the account settings.  I couple of accounts were missing and I added them.  In this section, when I select each account and check the details below the list, everything looks OK.  However, when I go into each individual account of the three accounts that are at issue, the User Name is still incorrect.  For instance, in the account for ""commercial"" if I change the user name to commercial@korufarm.org that name populates to the other two accounts.  (See attachments) I did reboot to ensure the changes were saved.  By way of context, I have 4 laptops and a desktop and Thunderbird is set up exactly the same on each.  When I set up a new computer I copy the profile from one of the others.  Needless to say, I have the same issue on all of my computers so I can only guess that there is an issue with the profile.

Under the bottom Outgoing Server (SMTP) section each account is correct, has the proper description, Server Name, Port User Name, Authentication Method, and Connection Security.  There is only one, I say again, one Server Name:  <a href=""http://mail.korufarm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.korufarm.org</a>.  It is the same for each, presumably because that is the name of my domain.  However, for the last three accounts in the list, when I go into the settings for the account, the same User Name is in each of the three accounts.  If I change the User Name in one so it matches the account, it instantly changes the other two to that name.  Somehow, they seem to be linked at the User Name level. </p> <hr>45 minutes later: <p>After drafting the above I went to one of our laptops and deleted two of the three accounts that are problematic then added them again.  The two are ones we use for non-personal purposes, Netflicks e-mails, etc, so no important data was lost.  So far the new accounts seem to be OK so I will try this on the other computers.  This may or may not be an interesting problem for your knowledgeable technical guys to look into.  I am in my eighth decade so I am lucky I can find the power button.
