Do you have four separate SMTP servers defined? (You can check that at account settings pane, scroll down left side to 'Outgoing servers (SMTP) and click to view.) Are they all defined identically? Please click 'edit' for one of them and post a screenshot of the contents for review here. This may not be where the solution lies, but much detail is missing from your post. Problems such as you reported are often done where there are too few SMTP servers, or where SMTP settings are incorrect. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
