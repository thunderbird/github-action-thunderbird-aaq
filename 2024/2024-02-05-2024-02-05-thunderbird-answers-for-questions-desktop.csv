Another approach is software: mailwasher is free for just one account and does an excellent job of spam management. Another option is to create a gmail account, and import your mail through gmail: that lets you then use gmail's filter tools for your account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Alla prima domanda non ti saprei rispondere.  </p><p>Alla seconda invece ti confermo che ho sempre fatto i backup regolarmente con mozbackup. E adesso ho appena provato a ripristinare all'ultima versione del backup ma sembra di avere peggiorato le cose...thunderbird mi propone solo due account (ne ho 5) e mi mostra delle email vecchissime che non so nemmeno da dove possano essere saltate fuori... ti mando screenshot. spero di non aver combinato un guaio... Di buono io ho pochissime email conservate sui server. Me le salvo sempre (quelle importanti) sul pc e cancello le altre. Quindi per me non è un problema aver perso dati perché non ne ho... mi domando infatti come possano essere saltate fuori delle email del 2019... </p><p>Cosa potrei fare per avere il programma funzionante? Disinstallare tutto e reimpostar tutti gli account manualmente da zero? </p><p>Molte grazie in anticipo per la disponibilità Aurin </p>,belsol.energia,false,0,0
