You will be prompted for overwrites. Allow - copy the abook.sqlite and the history.sqlite into the root of the profile - start thunderbird and add any IMAP accounts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Do you have four separate SMTP servers defined? (You can check that at account settings pane, scroll down left side to 'Outgoing servers (SMTP) and click to view.) Are they all defined identically? Please click 'edit' for one of them and post a screenshot of the contents for review here. This may not be where the solution lies, but much detail is missing from your post. Problems such as you reported are often done where there are too few SMTP servers, or where SMTP settings are incorrect. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To be safe, I suggest you verify that they each use different profiles to ensure you don't remove the primary one. And, to be extra safe, I always suggest backing up the profile when doing such as this, especially because communicating via  forum sometimes misses key information. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
