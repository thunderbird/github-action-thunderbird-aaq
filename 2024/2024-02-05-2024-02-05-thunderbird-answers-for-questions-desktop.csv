Alla prima domanda non ti saprei rispondere.  </p><p>Alla seconda invece ti confermo che ho sempre fatto i backup regolarmente con mozbackup. E adesso ho appena provato a ripristinare all'ultima versione del backup ma sembra di avere peggiorato le cose...thunderbird mi propone solo due account (ne ho 5) e mi mostra delle email vecchissime che non so nemmeno da dove possano essere saltate fuori... ti mando screenshot. spero di non aver combinato un guaio... Di buono io ho pochissime email conservate sui server. Me le salvo sempre (quelle importanti) sul pc e cancello le altre. Quindi per me non è un problema aver perso dati perché non ne ho... mi domando infatti come possano essere saltate fuori delle email del 2019... </p><p>Cosa potrei fare per avere il programma funzionante? Disinstallare tutto e reimpostar tutti gli account manualmente da zero? </p><p>Molte grazie in anticipo per la disponibilità Aurin </p>,belsol.energia,false,0,0

Pessima idea anche quella di ripristinare il backup di mozbackup, ti avevo anche invitato a fare il backup secondo la guida ufficiale. </p><p>A questo punto, se davvero non hai nulla da perdere, crea un nuovo profilo di Thunderbird come spiegato qui -&gt; <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/utilizzare-piu-profili#w_creare-un-profilo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/utilizzare-piu-profili#w_creare-un-profilo</a> e configura gli account che ti servono </p><p>Per il momento ti suggerisco di NON cancellare l'attuale profilo di Thunderbird ma affiancare il nuovo. </p>",@next,false,0,0
