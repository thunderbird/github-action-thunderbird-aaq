TB renames the damaged prefs.js file in the profile to prefs-1.js (or invalidprefs.js) and creates a new virgin prefs.js file (5 to 7 kB size) which contains no account data. So on startup doesn't find any account and invites the user to create an account. Go to your profile folder and search for a prefs-1.js file (or invalidprefs.js) to confirm my diagnosis. </p><p>The easiest way to solve this problem is to copy the prefs.js file from a recent profile backup and paste it in the profile folder.

As you are not getting any error other than no new mail - this could be various reasons - blocked from internet, webmail not receiving mail due to maxed out on quota, server settings not up to date. </p><p><strong>1.</strong> Check Firewall. Exit Thunderbird Access Firewall - this might be the default which came with computer or controlled by an Anti-Virus program you installed. Thunderbird must be set as an allowed program. </p><p>Then you can be sure the Firewall is not causing an issue. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> Check Password  Logon to webmail account via a browser - if you get access you know password is good. </p><p><strong>3. </strong>Log on to webmail and see if there are new emails on server - if the webmail account does not have new mail then Thunderbird is not going to display any new mail.  Check you server quota - if you have used up all your server quota then the server is incapable of receiving new mail. You will need to delete a load of emails off the server to create somne space. Please note if you do this and you use an IMAP account - those emails will also get deleted from the imap account.

I have seen a number of bugs raised. </p><p>Generally I would suggest just setting the auto-compact figure in settings to a few megabytes and never doing it manually at all, or just skipping it entirely for the time being. </p><p>Essentially the trash should not be compacted it should be emptied as it is not meant to be a long term storage location at all.  Perhaps set it to auto empty of shutdown in account settings. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Locate the menu entry of outgoing servers (SMTP) fine the one that you are using in the list and change the authentication to normal password.  It is very unusual for any provider to allow you to send mail unauthenticated.  That would mean they had an open relay and would be blacklisted for spam in minutes. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I now have sent a message through my gmail email to the company hosting my domain (and associated email addresses) as my password for them also isn't working. Hopefully they can suggest something. I will check with them what are the correct SMTP outgoing server settings. Cheers, Battista </p>",mercurifam,false,0,0

Remember Thunderbird is a email retriever from the Online email server so if it can't get the email from the server it will not be able to see the email. Did you login to the online email provider to verify the email was there as well. </p>,markwarner22,false,0,1
