TB renames the damaged prefs.js file in the profile to prefs-1.js (or invalidprefs.js) and creates a new virgin prefs.js file (5 to 7 kB size) which contains no account data. So on startup doesn't find any account and invites the user to create an account. Go to your profile folder and search for a prefs-1.js file (or invalidprefs.js) to confirm my diagnosis. </p><p>The easiest way to solve this problem is to copy the prefs.js file from a recent profile backup and paste it in the profile folder.

However, it looks likes Thunder bird creates a new profile when ever changes are made to the T-bird layout. For example, I added feeds on December 19, 2024.

As you are not getting any error other than no new mail - this could be various reasons - blocked from internet, webmail not receiving mail due to maxed out on quota, server settings not up to date. </p><p><strong>1.</strong> Check Firewall. Exit Thunderbird Access Firewall - this might be the default which came with computer or controlled by an Anti-Virus program you installed. Thunderbird must be set as an allowed program. </p><p>Then you can be sure the Firewall is not causing an issue. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> Check Password  Logon to webmail account via a browser - if you get access you know password is good. </p><p><strong>3. </strong>Log on to webmail and see if there are new emails on server - if the webmail account does not have new mail then Thunderbird is not going to display any new mail.  Check you server quota - if you have used up all your server quota then the server is incapable of receiving new mail. You will need to delete a load of emails off the server to create somne space. Please note if you do this and you use an IMAP account - those emails will also get deleted from the imap account. So before you delete anything - in Thunderbird, get 'Copies' of important emails put into the 'Local Folders' account.  </p><p><strong>4.</strong> Check current Account Settings AS I have no idea what typ of account you are using I've posted all info, so it's important if you have Account set up to use Pop then it must use pop server settings and same goes for imap - do not attempt to swap settings. If you have Pop and want Imap then you will need to create a new mail account for the imap option. </p><p><strong>POP</strong> </p> <ul><li> Incoming Server: <a href=""http://pop.shaw.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.shaw.ca</a> </li><li> Port: 995 </li><li> Security Type: SSL/TLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> username = full email address (normally full but website does mention first part only) </li><li> password - same one as used to access webmail account  </li></ul> <p><strong>IMAP</strong> </p> <ul><li> Incoming Mail Server: <a href=""http://imap.shaw.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.shaw.ca</a> </li><li> Incoming Port: 993 </li><li> Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> Username: Shaw email address without the @shaw.ca </li><li> Password: same one as used to access webmail account  </li></ul> <p><strong>SMTP</strong> </p> <ul><li> Outgoing Mail Server: <a href=""http://mail.shaw.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.shaw.ca</a> </li><li> Port: 587 </li><li> Connection SEcurity&nbsp;: STARTTLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> username = full email address </li><li> password - same one as used to access webmail. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
