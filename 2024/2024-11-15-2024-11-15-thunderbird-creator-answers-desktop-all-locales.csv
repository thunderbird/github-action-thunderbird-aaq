It happens whether I send them from Thunderbird myself or from Maildroid on my phone or tablet. All my other many many emails are getting through but not mine  to her. I can't find a block instruction in her (or my) Thunderbird software which does this. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bthomson

It’s running really slowly and making my whole computer lag. Thunderbird consumes constantly 8-9% CPU while it’s on. I’m using Windows 11 and Thunderbird version 128.4.3.esr (64-bit) on a laptop with fast NVMe drives. </p><p>I’ve added 8 email accounts, and the mail folder (Roaming/Thunderbird) is about 165 GB right now. I think it’ll go over 200 GB once all the messages finish downloading.   </p><p>The problem seems to be with message indexing. The Activity Manager shows it’s indexing over 300k messages. Even if I leave Thunderbird running all night, it doesn’t finish. When I get new emails in the morning, the indexing starts all over again. It takes hours and uses a lot of CPU while it’s happening.   </p><p>If I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works fast and smooth, and CPU usage drops a lot. But, I assume, this means I lose the ability to search emails. </p><p>When the lagging happens, opening an email preview can take up to 3 seconds (!), and deleting a message also takes 2-3 seconds. However, when I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works ultra-fast. Opening and deleting messages is instant, and there’s no delay. </p><p>Any idea how to fix this? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Qrzysio

(This happens if the 'move it to tray' feature is disabled) </p><p>On closing the window, thunderbird should minimize as icon to the notification area tray. (This happens if the 'move it to tray' feature is enabled) </p><p>I think this should be an option integrated in thunderbird settings, if not to be the default behavior </p><p>i haven't found any extension to solve this yet and it is a little bit annoying when I use many windows and press alt-tab when thunderbird is minimized to the tray with x or - button when using the addon not to close thunderbird when pressing x, so it won't appear alongside other windows and i have to reclick the tray icon to show it again </p><p><br> I want to have both abilities to minimize to tray and minimize to TB at the same time  </p><p><br> I believe that mail client has to be always running even if I press x button, unless I press Quit from inside the app </p><p>I have clarified the behavior expected above </p><p><br> Thanks </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",mohamedraesa
