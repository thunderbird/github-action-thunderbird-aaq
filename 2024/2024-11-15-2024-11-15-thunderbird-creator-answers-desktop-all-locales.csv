It’s running really slowly and making my whole computer lag. Thunderbird consumes constantly 8-9% CPU while it’s on. I’m using Windows 11 and Thunderbird version 128.4.3.esr (64-bit) on a laptop with fast NVMe drives. </p><p>I’ve added 8 email accounts, and the mail folder (Roaming/Thunderbird) is about 165 GB right now. I think it’ll go over 200 GB once all the messages finish downloading.   </p><p>The problem seems to be with message indexing. The Activity Manager shows it’s indexing over 300k messages. Even if I leave Thunderbird running all night, it doesn’t finish. When I get new emails in the morning, the indexing starts all over again. It takes hours and uses a lot of CPU while it’s happening.   </p><p>If I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works fast and smooth, and CPU usage drops a lot. But, I assume, this means I lose the ability to search emails. </p><p>When the lagging happens, opening an email preview can take up to 3 seconds (!), and deleting a message also takes 2-3 seconds. However, when I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works ultra-fast. Opening and deleting messages is instant, and there’s no delay. </p><p>Any idea how to fix this? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1688026;,Qrzysio

There's no other information included and requires user to have the appropriate PGP key imported before having access to the attachment. It is fair but I think there should be a flag/option called ""decrypt"" similar to <a href=""https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#getfull-messageid-options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#getfull-messageid-options</a>. </p><p>Context: We are developing a PGP Mail Extension for Thunderbird and this prevents us from accessing the encrypted attachment and requires us to import the PGP private key just to access the file. I am expecting to at least let us access the encrypted ""message.asc"" file and proceed process without requiring to have the PGP key imported into the Thunderbird. </p><p>Steps to reproduce: </p><p>1. PGP encrypt a message and save it to message.asc. 2. Send the message using Thunderbird client as follow: - add a subject. - add the message.asc as an attachment. - leave the email body blank. - send the email. 3. Install a debug attachment that uses `messenger.messages.listAttachments()` and noticed that it won't return any attachments at all. The error will say, error decrypting message x (where x is messageId) even though the error actually happens in messenger.messages.listAttachments(x) and messages.getFull() uses decrypt set to ""true"" option.  </p><p>Reference: <a href=""https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#listattachments-messageid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#listattachments-messageid</a> </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1687964;,mart.robles.it

Email aliasing and New Folders.,"<p>Hello, </p><p>I've used the desktop client on Linux for quite a while now and I'm pretty happy with it but when it comes to mobile, Gmail is the main app. Today, I downloaded the Thunderbird Android app and tried the export from desktop to mobile feature. I had 2 QR codes but only the first one worked. That was a bit heart breaking. </p><p>The first issue is this; the desktop client allows for on-the-fly email alias creation (directly in the From field) and it's smart enough to reply with an on-the-fly alias (no related identity). This one feature of the hundreds available is the only real reason Thunderbird is quite valuable on the desktop. </p><p>This feature (on-the-fly aliases) is <strong>not available on Android</strong>. Will this change? Please consider adding it as a feature? Maybe try to make the ""From"" field also editable rather than only choosing from a list of identities? </p><p>The second issue is, ""Manage Folders"". I could not find a way to create a folder and I looked pretty hard. I feel like its there and maybe I'm just old, stupid or both. But after almost 10 minutes looking for a way to add a folder, I just failed and gave up.  </p><p>Is <strong>creating new folders on Android</strong> possible at the moment? </p><p>In summary. Thunderbird on Android. On-the-fly email aliases (new and replies) is a pretty big deal, is this on a todo? And, is creating new folders possible and if not, is this on a todo? </p><p>PS.

Dit ging niet eenvoudig, omdat bij de installatie er blijkbaar een fout kwam bij het ophalen van eerdere e-mailberichten e.d.  Het ois blijkbar toch gelukt, maar in beeld komen nu de binnengekomen berichten omkaderd, waardoor er maar een paar berichten tegelijkertijd op het beeldscherm gezien kunnen worden. Ook is de opmaak van het blad heel anders en hier kan ik niks mee beginnen. Ik heb een paar keer het programma verwijderd en ook na afsluiten weer starten van de laptop, en opnieuw proberen te installeren, steeds weer met hetzelfde hier boven beschreven resultaat.  Wat is er aan de hand en vooral: hoe krijg ik de versie waarmee ik al jaren vertrouwd mee omga weer terug?

After the update, trying to delete unwanted emails takes 'forever'. Previously, just hitting the delete button, the unwanted items would instantly go away. Now, the deleted item 'stalls' for about 4 or 5 seconds, then jumps to the next item. Sometimes it takes a little longer, and pressing the delete button, just makes the next item disappear. Performance is so slow.  How can I resolve this, without loosing all the saved emails I have in the 5 different accounts listed on Thunderbird. Thanks for any help in this manner.   PS I have tried disabling Eset Virus, and Nord VPN. That did not help.
