It’s running really slowly and making my whole computer lag. Thunderbird consumes constantly 8-9% CPU while it’s on. I’m using Windows 11 and Thunderbird version 128.4.3.esr (64-bit) on a laptop with fast NVMe drives. </p><p>I’ve added 8 email accounts, and the mail folder (Roaming/Thunderbird) is about 165 GB right now. I think it’ll go over 200 GB once all the messages finish downloading.   </p><p>The problem seems to be with message indexing. The Activity Manager shows it’s indexing over 300k messages. Even if I leave Thunderbird running all night, it doesn’t finish. When I get new emails in the morning, the indexing starts all over again. It takes hours and uses a lot of CPU while it’s happening.   </p><p>If I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works fast and smooth, and CPU usage drops a lot. But, I assume, this means I lose the ability to search emails. </p><p>When the lagging happens, opening an email preview can take up to 3 seconds (!), and deleting a message also takes 2-3 seconds. However, when I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works ultra-fast. Opening and deleting messages is instant, and there’s no delay. </p><p>Any idea how to fix this? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Qrzysio

Ho molti contatti che hanno questa stessa situazione e giorno dopo giorno mi stanno chiamando per segnalarmi questo problema.

Non capisco se il problema è dovuto ad un aggiornamento di ESET o di Thunderbird. </p><p>E' una situazione destabilizzante, uso ESET da una vita, non vorrei dover cambiare antivirus su decine e decine di computer... e mi rendo conto solo adesso che Thunderbird non è supportato da ESET da moltissime versioni fa, però mai avuto problemi fino ad oggi (ma si sa, tutto funziona finchè non smette di funzionare). Cambiare Thunderbird per altro client&nbsp;? ..un bagno di sangue... inoltre ho letto che non è supportato neanche Outlook 365 (mentre la versione precedente si)... sto andando OT pardon... </p><p>Qualcuno ha una possibile soluzione da propormi&nbsp;? sarebbe una mano di Santo... grazie </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,it,1687951;,reaux998

There's no other information included and requires user to have the appropriate PGP key imported before having access to the attachment. It is fair but I think there should be a flag/option called ""decrypt"" similar to <a href=""https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#getfull-messageid-options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#getfull-messageid-options</a>. </p><p>Context: We are developing a PGP Mail Extension for Thunderbird and this prevents us from accessing the encrypted attachment and requires us to import the PGP private key just to access the file. I am expecting to at least let us access the encrypted ""message.asc"" file and proceed process without requiring to have the PGP key imported into the Thunderbird. </p><p>Steps to reproduce: </p><p>1. PGP encrypt a message and save it to message.asc. 2. Send the message using Thunderbird client as follow: - add a subject. - add the message.asc as an attachment. - leave the email body blank. - send the email. 3. Install a debug attachment that uses `messenger.messages.listAttachments()` and noticed that it won't return any attachments at all. The error will say, error decrypting message x (where x is messageId) even though the error actually happens in messenger.messages.listAttachments(x) and messages.getFull() uses decrypt set to ""true"" option.  </p><p>Reference: <a href=""https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#listattachments-messageid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#listattachments-messageid</a> </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mart.robles.it
