It’s running really slowly and making my whole computer lag. Thunderbird consumes constantly 8-9% CPU while it’s on. I’m using Windows 11 and Thunderbird version 128.4.3.esr (64-bit) on a laptop with fast NVMe drives. </p><p>I’ve added 8 email accounts, and the mail folder (Roaming/Thunderbird) is about 165 GB right now. I think it’ll go over 200 GB once all the messages finish downloading.   </p><p>The problem seems to be with message indexing. The Activity Manager shows it’s indexing over 300k messages. Even if I leave Thunderbird running all night, it doesn’t finish. When I get new emails in the morning, the indexing starts all over again. It takes hours and uses a lot of CPU while it’s happening.   </p><p>If I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works fast and smooth, and CPU usage drops a lot. But, I assume, this means I lose the ability to search emails. </p><p>When the lagging happens, opening an email preview can take up to 3 seconds (!), and deleting a message also takes 2-3 seconds. However, when I disable the ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"" option, Thunderbird works ultra-fast. Opening and deleting messages is instant, and there’s no delay. </p><p>Any idea how to fix this? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;tb128slow;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1688026;1688326;1690172;1690206;,Qrzysio

There's no other information included and requires user to have the appropriate PGP key imported before having access to the attachment. It is fair but I think there should be a flag/option called ""decrypt"" similar to <a href=""https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#getfull-messageid-options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#getfull-messageid-options</a>. </p><p>Context: We are developing a PGP Mail Extension for Thunderbird and this prevents us from accessing the encrypted attachment and requires us to import the PGP private key just to access the file. I am expecting to at least let us access the encrypted ""message.asc"" file and proceed process without requiring to have the PGP key imported into the Thunderbird. </p><p>Steps to reproduce: </p><p>1. PGP encrypt a message and save it to message.asc. 2. Send the message using Thunderbird client as follow: - add a subject. - add the message.asc as an attachment. - leave the email body blank. - send the email. 3. Install a debug attachment that uses `messenger.messages.listAttachments()` and noticed that it won't return any attachments at all. The error will say, error decrypting message x (where x is messageId) even though the error actually happens in messenger.messages.listAttachments(x) and messages.getFull() uses decrypt set to ""true"" option.  </p><p>Reference: <a href=""https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#listattachments-messageid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/messages.html#listattachments-messageid</a> </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1687964;,mart.robles.it

Email aliasing and New Folders.,"<p>Hello, </p><p>I've used the desktop client on Linux for quite a while now and I'm pretty happy with it but when it comes to mobile, Gmail is the main app. Today, I downloaded the Thunderbird Android app and tried the export from desktop to mobile feature. I had 2 QR codes but only the first one worked. That was a bit heart breaking. </p><p>The first issue is this; the desktop client allows for on-the-fly email alias creation (directly in the From field) and it's smart enough to reply with an on-the-fly alias (no related identity). This one feature of the hundreds available is the only real reason Thunderbird is quite valuable on the desktop. </p><p>This feature (on-the-fly aliases) is <strong>not available on Android</strong>. Will this change? Please consider adding it as a feature? Maybe try to make the ""From"" field also editable rather than only choosing from a list of identities? </p><p>The second issue is, ""Manage Folders"". I could not find a way to create a folder and I looked pretty hard. I feel like its there and maybe I'm just old, stupid or both. But after almost 10 minutes looking for a way to add a folder, I just failed and gave up.  </p><p>Is <strong>creating new folders on Android</strong> possible at the moment? </p><p>In summary. Thunderbird on Android. On-the-fly email aliases (new and replies) is a pretty big deal, is this on a todo? And, is creating new folders possible and if not, is this on a todo? </p><p>PS. I thank the Thunderbird team for the Android app. It's fast and responsive and although Gmail is still unfortunately required on Android, I'm really looking forward to Thunderbird winning here. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mozilla586
