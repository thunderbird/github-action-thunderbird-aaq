It happens whether I send them from Thunderbird myself or from Maildroid on my phone or tablet. All my other many many emails are getting through but not mine  to her. I can't find a block instruction in her (or my) Thunderbird software which does this. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bthomson
