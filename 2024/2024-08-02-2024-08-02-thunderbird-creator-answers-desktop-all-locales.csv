I had to move my TB to a new machine and copied the profile file to the new machine and started there. </p><p>Over time, it seemed that messages were not getting seen, so I thought I'd shift to (finally) using IMAP.  I added the new configuration, saved off the old emails, and started with the IMAP use.  Now I'm seeing a difference between the following: </p><p>1. Messages being downloaded 2. Messages ended in filtered 3. Messages ended in Inbox </p><p>The download count is let's say 60, the number filtered (showing in the filtered folder) is 10, but the number in the Inbox is 20.  There are 30 missing emails that I can't account for.  They do not show up in any of the folders (I have scanned for all messages from today, as an example).  As you might imagine, this is a concern. </p><p>I am thinking the best might be to start over; that is, create a new profile.  If I do this, please tell me a few things. </p><p>- Where the missing emails could be - Is there a cleaner alternative?  As this is IMAP, I don't see a strong reason to save off the emails, as I'll get them when I sync.  I would probably save off ones that are a bit older (let's say a week ago). - when I create the new profile, does this bring anything with it?  Will the existing filters come with it or will I need to create those anew (I don't see this as a real issue as most are spam filters and if I start clean, I will just start flagging ones that I don't want anymore) - is there an alternative that uses the existing profile?  How would that work?  How do I remove all spam filters so nothing is filtered (so I can see that the numbers add up)? </p><p>I appreciate your help, David </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1665851;,dmatusow

You can set a delay for when the filters are applied to incoming messages, allowing you to review and make changes before the filters take action. This can be useful for ensuring that important emails are not accidentally moved or deleted. To set a filter delay in Thunderbird, go to Tools &gt; Message Filters, select the filter you want to edit, and then click on the ""Run selected filters on"" dropdown menu to choose a delay time."" </p><p>Well, this option isn't there in the current version.
