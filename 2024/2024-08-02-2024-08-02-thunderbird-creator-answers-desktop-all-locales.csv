I had to move my TB to a new machine and copied the profile file to the new machine and started there. </p><p>Over time, it seemed that messages were not getting seen, so I thought I'd shift to (finally) using IMAP.  I added the new configuration, saved off the old emails, and started with the IMAP use.  Now I'm seeing a difference between the following: </p><p>1. Messages being downloaded 2. Messages ended in filtered 3. Messages ended in Inbox </p><p>The download count is let's say 60, the number filtered (showing in the filtered folder) is 10, but the number in the Inbox is 20.  There are 30 missing emails that I can't account for.  They do not show up in any of the folders (I have scanned for all messages from today, as an example).  As you might imagine, this is a concern. </p><p>I am thinking the best might be to start over; that is, create a new profile.  If I do this, please tell me a few things. </p><p>- Where the missing emails could be - Is there a cleaner alternative?  As this is IMAP, I don't see a strong reason to save off the emails, as I'll get them when I sync.  I would probably save off ones that are a bit older (let's say a week ago). - when I create the new profile, does this bring anything with it?  Will the existing filters come with it or will I need to create those anew (I don't see this as a real issue as most are spam filters and if I start clean, I will just start flagging ones that I don't want anymore) - is there an alternative that uses the existing profile?  How would that work?  How do I remove all spam filters so nothing is filtered (so I can see that the numbers add up)? </p><p>I appreciate your help, David </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1665851;1665876;1665902;,dmatusow

I use it to connect to email inboxes from a hosting provider. In the past, one of them was going through Google Workspace email (linked to my own domain), but I decided to go with Thunderbird instead. I did connect to Gmail once (if I recall correctly), to download emails from there. Then, all the mail server settings were set to those of my hosting company/my domain and worked well. </p><p>Today, after starting it up, I received a notification of a Thunderbird update (new looks, new nesting of connected emails, card-like look of emails), and I received a prompt to log in to the long-defunct Gmail account. I closed the window and went searching for the reason. All my mailing server settings seem to be fine. In the Thunderbird settings, in the Privacy&amp;Security tab, Passwords section, I found several saved passwords relating to said defunct account. I deleted them all in hopes of solving the issue. Unfortunately, this only changed the prompt: from asking me to sign in to the specifically-named defunct account, it's now asking me to sign into Google account in general while the popup's header still refers to the defunct account. I also went ahead and downloaded the newest update. My Thunderbird seemed already updated judging by the version number, though none of the new features seem to be enabled, and some note mentioned that it's not an automatic update but one that had to be downloaded. Unfortunately, it didn't help either. The PC had been restarted. The pop up appears shortly (~1 min) after the startup, and then at random points of Thunderbird being open. </p><p>I'm out of options and at a loss of how to get rid of that constant pop up, and I feel like I'm missing something obvious. I hope someone here might help. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1665973;1666025;1666026;1666039;,joannam

This is with 128.0.1esr (64-bit) on an Apple M1 Mac Mini with Sonoma 14.6. I have the same problem on a 2018 Mac Book Pro running Sonoma with an Intel chip. The problem is NOT manifest on a 2013 Mac Book Pro running the last release of Big Sur. In all 3 cases the same email accounts are loaded, so it is some interaction with the OS. (I previously reported this for Tbird 115 under Sonoma, with no resolution.) </p><p>Specifically, when I start Tbird 128 on the Sonoma M1 the window comes up in about 2 seconds but contents are blank. The contents don't fill until about 30 seconds. This makes it painful to quickly hop into email to do something, so I am resorting to Apple Mail when in a hurry. If I do the same on my 2013 Big Sur machine, it's 2 seconds for the window to come up and 8 seconds for the content to fill. Upgrading from 115 to 128 did not change this on any of the machines.  </p><p>None of the enhancements of recent releases are of sufficient value to compensate for this, so I wish the team would focus on ensuring speed on all platforms. Is there any clue what is going on? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1665967;1674688;1674986;1698489;1698568;1698780;,dan_suthers
