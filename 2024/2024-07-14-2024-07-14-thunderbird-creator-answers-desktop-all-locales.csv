I am asked to configure an account with TB. I use my old email address and password. This works but now about a third of my sub boxes containing saved emails are missing. The ones that show up have no messages in them. </p><p>After clicking back and forth on the various options I note a line at the bottom of the page saying that emails are being downloaded to the various existing boxes. Eventually they have mail in them BUT only old mail to about 2019. </p><p>The questions are - where are the missing boxes/folders and why only some of the mail in the others? </p> <hr> <p>I know where my profile info is on the hard drive. In 115 where do I read the name of the profile file it is using? </p><p>Thanks for any help. </p><p>Ernie </p>,chorny952;davidsk;,true,false,false,";category:troubleshooting;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird",1,0,0,,,

I had exported the address books from the working notebook and when I imported them into the new system they show up under address and when I star any of the addresses contained in them Thunderbird completes the auto fill. However if I try to get the autofill to work by starting the names of the actual address books Thunderbird doesn't recognize the address books. Also, if I make a new address book and add names to it it will not be recognized with autofill. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I regularly send to the recipients of the address books.
