I'm constantly close to running out of storage space due to all these daily emails. My question is: is there a way to safely block or unsubscribe from these emails without clicking on them (opening them)? I right click on them in Thunderbird but don't see a suitable option. Also, I haven't ever deleted my junk folder, and I know there are emails in there that I need, so I can't periodically delete the junk folder (at least not for foreseeable future). I'd be very appreciative of any help! Thanks in advance. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1661834;,frende3
