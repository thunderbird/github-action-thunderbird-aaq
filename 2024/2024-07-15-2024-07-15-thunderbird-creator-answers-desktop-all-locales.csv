I think it is now the time to add an option to allow it automatically startup in the background on system startup, which has been asked for several years. That is a really useful option, why not just implement it? </p><p>I think there are 2 ways: 1. Just automatically startup in the background on system startup and receive messages 2. Register a service in the background to receive e-mails and pop up notifications, and in this case, we don't need to add this option </p><p>The first solution may be easier to implement, but the second seems better? Anyway, thunderbird should have one of them </p><p>BTW, add an option to minimalize when click on 'close' button.

I can go back to the email on my phone, but on my desktop, they are hopelessly jumbled. What causes this and how can I stop it?
