Make sure the file system allows you write privileges, and you have enough disk space to copy the mailbox.","<p>My first support request about this was posted on Mon, Nov 18 (8:53 a.m.).  I never got a response--probably my fault for posting a minor correction which may have caused everyone else to think someone knowledgeable had responded.  I apologize for starting a new thread, but it’s been almost a week now and I really need help. The situation: I get my email via POP, and something got corrupted as a result of doing a backup of TB on Nov 15 using MozBackup.  Following advice by Toad-Hall on 11/7/23 to a similar support request, in Troubleshooting Information, inside Profile folder, then in Mail, then in the folder for my server, I renamed “Inbox” as “OldInbox.” A new Inbox and new Inbox.msf got created in Mail &gt; 'my-server.'  The new Inbox is 0 KB and is dated to the Nov 14, the evening before I did the MozBackup.  The date on the new Inbox.msf keeps advancing.  There’s a OldInbox.msf file too, with date that keeps advancing. The new Inbox.msf file doesn’t work or isn’t getting used or some such.  When I open TB, Inbox still shows the same old list of emails (now inaccessible) that used to be there and that are now accessible in the folder OldInbox.  I still get the error message when I try to Get Messages.  TB is still not downloading emails from the mail server.  How do I get a functioning Inbox? </p><p>Addendum Monday, Nov 25, 8:56:   I *think* some of the problem has to do with a mixup bwtween two different profiles (mine and an old one for my husband).  After my post last evening, I deleted his profile, and lost much of *my* stuff.  So I then restored TB from the Nov 15 backup, using MozBackup, and am now pretty much back to where I was at the time of the post above. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",selena.billington
