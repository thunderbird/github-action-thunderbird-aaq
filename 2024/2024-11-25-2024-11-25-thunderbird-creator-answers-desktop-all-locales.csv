This does work, but it has only just started happening. Internet information says due to out of date apps, does this mean Thunderbird is out of date and needs updating because usually the updates are automatic? Or does Thunderbird need to look at the problem and fix, I shouldn't have to go to Mail each time an email body is blank. Not all emails are blank. Appreciate your assistance. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",val4153

Make sure the file system allows you write privileges, and you have enough disk space to copy the mailbox.","<p>My first support request about this was posted on Mon, Nov 18 (8:53 a.m.).  I never got a response--probably my fault for posting a minor correction which may have caused everyone else to think someone knowledgeable had responded.  I apologize for starting a new thread, but it’s been almost a week now and I really need help. The situation: I get my email via POP, and something got corrupted as a result of doing a backup of TB on Nov 15 using MozBackup.  Following advice by Toad-Hall on 11/7/23 to a similar support request, in Troubleshooting Information, inside Profile folder, then in Mail, then in the folder for my server, I renamed “Inbox” as “OldInbox.” A new Inbox and new Inbox.msf got created in Mail &gt; 'my-server.'  The new Inbox is 0 KB and is dated to the Nov 14, the evening before I did the MozBackup.  The date on the new Inbox.msf keeps advancing.  There’s a OldInbox.msf file too, with date that keeps advancing. The new Inbox.msf file doesn’t work or isn’t getting used or some such.  When I open TB, Inbox still shows the same old list of emails (now inaccessible) that used to be there and that are now accessible in the folder OldInbox.  I still get the error message when I try to Get Messages.  TB is still not downloading emails from the mail server.  How do I get a functioning Inbox? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",selena.billington
