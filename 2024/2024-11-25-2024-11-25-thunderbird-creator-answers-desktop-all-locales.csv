This does work, but it has only just started happening. Internet information says due to out of date apps, does this mean Thunderbird is out of date and needs updating because usually the updates are automatic? Or does Thunderbird need to look at the problem and fix, I shouldn't have to go to Mail each time an email body is blank. Not all emails are blank. Appreciate your assistance. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",val4153
