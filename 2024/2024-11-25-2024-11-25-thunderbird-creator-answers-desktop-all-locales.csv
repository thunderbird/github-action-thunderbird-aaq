I never got a response--probably my fault for posting a minor correction which may have caused everyone else to think someone knowledgeable had responded.  I apologize for starting a new thread, but it’s been almost a week now and I really need help. The situation: I get my email via POP, and something got corrupted as a result of doing a backup of TB on Nov 15 using MozBackup.  Following advice by Toad-Hall on 11/7/23 to a similar support request, in Troubleshooting Information, inside Profile folder, then in Mail, then in the folder for my server, I renamed “Inbox” as “OldInbox.” A new Inbox and new Inbox.msf got created in Mail &gt; 'my-server.'  The new Inbox is 0 KB and is dated to the Nov 14, the evening before I did the MozBackup.  The date on the new Inbox.msf keeps advancing.  There’s a OldInbox.msf file too, with date that keeps advancing. The new Inbox.msf file doesn’t work or isn’t getting used or some such.  When I open TB, Inbox still shows the same old list of emails (now inaccessible) that used to be there and that are now accessible in the folder OldInbox.  I still get the error message when I try to Get Messages.  TB is still not downloading emails from the mail server.

When deciding to switch from Thunderbird to Outlook for the MBOX data of 2024-25, I was expecting to face a really annoying and long process. But surprisingly, it wasn’t. Here’s what happened. </p><p>I began by defining tools that would help in the transition to be smooth. Out of trying many options, I found the <strong>WebbyAcad MBOX converter software</strong>. It appeared to be reviewed and featured well, so I said let me try it. </p><p>The general preparation was very simple. The tool was downloaded, and I imported the MBOX files and then chose PST as the file type to save my results. The best part? It was having the ability to batch convert something, which would have taken me hours to do. </p><p>As soon as I clicked on “<strong>Convert</strong>,” I could hardly believe how fast a work of it was. That is an undeniable advantage – every mail, folder, and even attachment was intact. I did not even delete a single file, which was way faster than I anticipated. </p><p>That which I had probably estimated to take days, was actually achieved in minutes. These new PST files are quite compatible with Outlook 2024 and I had no problem at all trying to access all my data. </p><p>If you find yourself in a similar situation, there is a solution; email migrations don’t have to be a headache. There shouldn’t be any hitches if you get the right tool. In doing what I thought was an impossible mission after research, the <strong>WebbyAcad MBOX email migrator</strong> made it easy as pie. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",nickwatson2254
