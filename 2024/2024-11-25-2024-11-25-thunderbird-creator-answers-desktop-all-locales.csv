Make sure the file system allows you write privileges, and you have enough disk space to copy the mailbox.","<p>My first support request about this was posted on Mon, Nov 18 (8:53 a.m.).  I never got a response--probably my fault for posting a minor correction which may have caused everyone else to think someone knowledgeable had responded.  I apologize for starting a new thread, but it’s been almost a week now and I really need help. The situation: I get my email via POP, and something got corrupted as a result of doing a backup of TB on Nov 15 using MozBackup.  Following advice by Toad-Hall on 11/7/23 to a similar support request, in Troubleshooting Information, inside Profile folder, then in Mail, then in the folder for my server, I renamed “Inbox” as “OldInbox.” A new Inbox and new Inbox.msf got created in Mail &gt; 'my-server.'  The new Inbox is 0 KB and is dated to the Nov 14, the evening before I did the MozBackup.  The date on the new Inbox.msf keeps advancing.  There’s a OldInbox.msf file too, with date that keeps advancing. The new Inbox.msf file doesn’t work or isn’t getting used or some such.  When I open TB, Inbox still shows the same old list of emails (now inaccessible) that used to be there and that are now accessible in the folder OldInbox.  I still get the error message when I try to Get Messages.  TB is still not downloading emails from the mail server.  How do I get a functioning Inbox? </p><p>Addendum Monday, Nov 25, 8:56:   I *think* some of the problem has to do with a mixup bwtween two different profiles (mine and an old one for my husband).  After my post last evening, I deleted his profile, and lost much of *my* stuff.  So I then restored TB from the Nov 15 backup, using MozBackup, and am now pretty much back to where I was at the time of the post above. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",selena.billington

When deciding to switch from Thunderbird to Outlook for the MBOX data of 2024-25, I was expecting to face a really annoying and long process. But surprisingly, it wasn’t. Here’s what happened. </p><p>I began by defining tools that would help in the transition to be smooth. Out of trying many options, I found the <strong>WebbyAcad MBOX converter software</strong>. It appeared to be reviewed and featured well, so I said let me try it. </p><p>The general preparation was very simple. The tool was downloaded, and I imported the MBOX files and then chose PST as the file type to save my results. The best part? It was having the ability to batch convert something, which would have taken me hours to do. </p><p>As soon as I clicked on “<strong>Convert</strong>,” I could hardly believe how fast a work of it was. That is an undeniable advantage – every mail, folder, and even attachment was intact. I did not even delete a single file, which was way faster than I anticipated. </p><p>That which I had probably estimated to take days, was actually achieved in minutes. These new PST files are quite compatible with Outlook 2024 and I had no problem at all trying to access all my data. </p><p>If you find yourself in a similar situation, there is a solution; email migrations don’t have to be a headache. There shouldn’t be any hitches if you get the right tool. In doing what I thought was an impossible mission after research, the <strong>WebbyAcad MBOX email migrator</strong> made it easy as pie. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",nickwatson2254

Mailprogramm von Tunderbird schon etliche Jahre auf meinem PC. Nachdem ich jetzt durch Urlaub meinen Eingangsspeicher längere Zeit nicht geleert hatte, waren ca. 1000 Mails darin enthalten. Ich habe versucht, alle zu löschen, was nicht gelang. Ich konnte nur die Mails löschen, die auf meinem Eingang ersichtlich waren. Seither ist es mir nicht möglich, weitere E-Mails zu empfangen! Ich kann sehr wohl Mails versenden, aber nicht empfangen. Das gilt für beide Konten, nämlich erwinh@kstp.at und Schweden60@ <a href=""http://kstp.at"" rel=""nofollow"">kstp.at</a>&nbsp;! Ich habe keine Einstellungen geändert und auch mein Internetanbieter Kabelplus St. Pölten hat keine anderen Einstellungen durchgeführt! Es ist ganz kurz einmal ""aufgepoppt"", mein Zertifikat ist abgelaufen! Ich weiß nicht welches Zertifikat und wie ich das verlängern könnte, damit die Eingänge auf die Mail-Konten wieder funktionieren? Bitte um ihre Unterstützung!

The emails I have tried since 21st do have conversations and you can see the email trail if you scroll down the email. If I try Ctrl Shift O, then that does not work for post 21st November emails either. </p><p>Does anybody have any idea why this is happening, and why I can access the feature for some emails before a certain date but not for those past that date? </p><p>Thank you very much, Matt </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1690020;,matthew.p.huntley
