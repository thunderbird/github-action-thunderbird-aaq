Also checked profile.ini and installs.ini and several other Thunderbird files and they all seemed to be in order.  I did check AV logs and did not see anything about any actions taken against any files yesterday much less any changes to Thunderbird or my profiles folder. </p><p>After several hours of trying to remove, reinstall, copy folders from my spare PC (which has the same v115 version of Thunderbird on it) to the main PC, etc., I gave up and restored my last Macrium Reflect image from Sunday (lucky I created a full only 4 days earlier) and that seemed to fire Thunderbird right up pointing to my profile!  So the profile was definitely good. </p><p>I don't think it was AV.  I think it was a failed Thunderbird update to the latest version.  This new v128 didn't like my v115 profile.

Compact has over the years had some bugs,  but they have been few and far between really as regards to data-loss.

I do not hold much hope at all because you are looking for deleted mail post the process that removes deleted mail from the storage folder. Go to the account settings in Thunderbird. on the first screen of server settings for the account it shows the local directory used by that account. Then once you have the correct folder open the inbox file (no extension) in a text editor.  Does it contain anything? </p><p>As an aside, unless you have multiple account on zoho it may be worth looking in all of them as you used imap and may have reinstalled the account over the years and the residual mail may still be in those folders if the account was removed from Thunderbird. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency.  </p><p>TIP:  As a reminder, these are points, not pixels, so you may not want to use my example of 14. A user I assisted yesterday found that 20 was preferable. Change everything in this post and you will have consistent writing. The nice feature that these settings offer is that, although you mmay do a setting for a large or small font, the font that your recipients get unchanged and defaults to whatever their email client is set to. If you have problems, be sure to post screenshots of the ones I present below. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
