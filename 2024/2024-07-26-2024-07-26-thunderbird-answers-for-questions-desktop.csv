My guess in bitdefender has treated it as some sort of threat (it is after all a javascript file) and it is just not there or is totally corrupt or there are loads of copies with numbers and the one you need without the numbers is corrupt.  Restoring that file from a backup might work. </p><p>I still think you need to curb your antivirus product. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I am always cautious about compact and try to avoid using it but it started to slow down. That's why I used it and I made sure that no antivirus tool interfered. The Repair feature does not work because it tries to connect with the email server. It is an old offline account.

Please note that I have several email accounts. Can someone please show a way how to identify which inbox file belongs to a specific email address?
