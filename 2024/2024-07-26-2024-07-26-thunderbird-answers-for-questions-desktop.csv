That is all really. </p><p>However you may need to change the server names to the office365 ones and if you do need to make that change,  restart Thunderbird and then change the authentication type. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My guess in bitdefender has treated it as some sort of threat (it is after all a javascript file) and it is just not there or is totally corrupt or there are loads of copies with numbers and the one you need without the numbers is corrupt.  Restoring that file from a backup might work. </p><p>I still think you need to curb your antivirus product. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Try restarting Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode from the help menu and continuing when prompted.  Try again.  Is it still an issue? </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I am always cautious about compact and try to avoid using it but it started to slow down. That's why I used it and I made sure that no antivirus tool interfered. The Repair feature does not work because it tries to connect with the email server. It is an old offline account. Any hint where I can find my emails (Inbox, sent) and make them visible in Thunderbird again? </p>",unitybox,false,0,0

Please note that I have several email accounts. Can someone please show a way how to identify which inbox file belongs to a specific email address? For example: 4 different ones, such as <a href=""http://imap.zoho.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.zoho.com</a>, <a href=""http://imap.zoho-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.zoho-1.com</a>, <a href=""http://imap.zoho-2.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.zoho-2.com</a>, <a href=""http://imap.zoho-3.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.zoho-3.com</a>. Instead using the trial and error method, it would be great to be able to identify it beforehand; in order to avoid any additional complications with my inboxes in Thunderbird. </p>",unitybox,false,0,0
