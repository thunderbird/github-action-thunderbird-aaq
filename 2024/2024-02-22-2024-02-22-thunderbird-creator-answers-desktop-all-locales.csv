This was not an issue with the Mail app in Windows. </p><p>This is not good for security and privacy, as displaying images on spam messages is a way for spammers to confirm an account is live and thus continue sending their garbage.

It will not send the same email to the same client more than once. </p><p>GMail is the exception.  There I get what seems to be a first-come-first-served protocol.
