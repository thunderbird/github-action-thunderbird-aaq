I expected when running it, to find it in the exact same state because, as what I'm aware of, everything is stored in the profile and nowhere else on the filesystem. </p><p>But, I found that: - my favorite folders (around 10) weren't there (well, only 1 of them) - A lot of mails were in ""unseen"" state (not the unread/read marker, but that star that appears the first time you open a folder for mails that has just been downloaded), where they were already seen </p><p>So my concern is about where/how are those values supposed to be stored, and why they don't seem to ""migrate"" as well? And, may there be some other things that didn't come too? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",penlo
