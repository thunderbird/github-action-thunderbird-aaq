What other POP mail apps for Macintosh still exist?  All web based mail viewers have lousy interfaces, not to mention that you have to download mail one at a time, and then its just a bunch of files on your computer. </p><p>If I upgraded from 60-9-1, how high can I go without it creating a new install and having to go thru the process of saving my Profile.ini etc in their hidden directory and putting them into the 'fresh' install&nbsp;? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",s1s1s11

How to switch on delivery notification option as default,"<p>Hi Community, Please tell me how to switch on as default the Thunderbird delivery notification option. I have Thunderbird installed on two PCs. One has the option checked to always get a delivery status notification; i.e. always on by default. The other PC doesn't have this option checked for default and I have to remember to 'check' the option box each time I send an email. But I can't find where turn 'set' this option or change it! Help please.... regards, Al </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1637798;,arjbn

They don't say what OSX is installed.  If I use Migration Assistant to copy the whole hard drive from my 2011 machine running El Capitan and Thunderbird 60.90.1, I may find that this old version of TB will not function.  So I would try to install a newer rev of TB, but not all the way to rev 115. </p><p>If I'm lucky, it will not be a ""new install"" because then I would have to previously find &amp; save the Profile.ini and that other .ini file.  I don't remember if I also need to save the actual email data separately, but of course I want that as well.  And then I would have to do a complicated process to copy the Users and emails back into the newly installed version.  I did this once long ago &amp; don't relish figuring it out again. </p><p>However, the process of Migrating and fixing all the Preferences etc on the new computer might take me some days, and in the meantime I would be sending &amp; receiving emails on the old computer.  So I would want to take THAT data and stick it in the new machine. </p><p>So can anyone tell me if my old rev of TB is likely to function? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1637837;,s1s1s11

I recently went back to Thunderbird after having used the default Mail app in Windows 10 and 11 for some time. I am pleased with how it works and intend to now use it as my default email client. However, I am concerned that the option to make images visible in emails extends to the entire program, and emails that my mail providers have identified as spam and sent to a ""Junk"" folder will show embedded images. This was not an issue with the Mail app in Windows. </p><p>This is not good for security and privacy, as displaying images on spam messages is a way for spammers to confirm an account is live and thus continue sending their garbage. Would it be possible to have Thunderbird block images *only* in specific folders of the user's choosing, while still be able to see them in the rest of the user folders? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",carnotaur1
