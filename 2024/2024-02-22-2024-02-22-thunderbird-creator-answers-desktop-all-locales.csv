I expected when running it, to find it in the exact same state because, as what I'm aware of, everything is stored in the profile and nowhere else on the filesystem. </p><p>But, I found that: - my favorite folders (around 10) weren't there (well, only 1 of them) - A lot of mails were in ""unseen"" state (not the unread/read marker, but that star that appears the first time you open a folder for mails that has just been downloaded), where they were already seen </p><p>So my concern is about where/how are those values supposed to be stored, and why they don't seem to ""migrate"" as well? And, may there be some other things that didn't come too? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",penlo

I use an AddOn that allows me to edit the subject line - this is an ESSENTIAL function, since senders do not use any orderly system for the subject, and I need to change it around in order to search &amp; find them later. </p><p>When was it made an integral function - and if not, by now, why the hell not? </p><p>Seeing lots of grief about rev 115.  What other POP mail apps for Macintosh still exist?  All web based mail viewers have lousy interfaces, not to mention that you have to download mail one at a time, and then its just a bunch of files on your computer. </p><p>If I upgraded from 60-9-1, how high can I go without it creating a new install and having to go thru the process of saving my Profile.ini etc in their hidden directory and putting them into the 'fresh' install&nbsp;? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",s1s1s11

How to switch on delivery notification option as default,"<p>Hi Community, Please tell me how to switch on as default the Thunderbird delivery notification option. I have Thunderbird installed on two PCs. One has the option checked to always get a delivery status notification; i.e. always on by default. The other PC doesn't have this option checked for default and I have to remember to 'check' the option box each time I send an email. But I can't find where turn 'set' this option or change it! Help please.... regards, Al </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1637798;,arjbn
