I have a feeling the issue is outside Thunderbird and may well reside in an antivirus product.  Using windows safe mode will eliminate that (except for defender) </p><p>However I think you also need to reinstall the software as my XUL.DLL is 127mb not something around 121 GB.  As a dynamic link library,  the size should not change once installed and even between operating system versions will be generally the same range, although 64bit DLLs are traditionally larger than their 32bit equivalents, you report yours as 1000 times larger than mine.   </p><p>Perhaps before you attempt a reinstall you might want to check the integrity of the actual drive under windows.

Blue screens usually relate to real mode conflicts in Windows, that is kernel mode software, hardware drivers and other privileged programs.  Thunderbird does not operate in real mode directly, referring such requests to the operating system to undertake on it's behalf. Other than hardware drivers, one of the few programs that routinely operate in kernel mode are antivirus programs.  Hence they get an automatic suspicion when a blue screen occurs. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Most of them don't disable when they say they do,  or leave your system in a basically non functional state by breaking networking.  I do not know if it is deliberate on the part of the antivirus community,  but their products appear to universally not do what they say they will well.  Unless it is scan and scan everything they think they should when they think it should be done.  That is why I now use windows defender.

Thunderbird 115 on another. Same files on both computers. Both computers were disconnected from the Internet. No other link between the computers.
