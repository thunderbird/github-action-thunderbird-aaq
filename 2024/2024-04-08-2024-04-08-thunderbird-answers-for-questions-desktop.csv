I have a feeling the issue is outside Thunderbird and may well reside in an antivirus product.  Using windows safe mode will eliminate that (except for defender) </p><p>However I think you also need to reinstall the software as my XUL.DLL is 127mb not something around 121 GB.  As a dynamic link library,  the size should not change once installed and even between operating system versions will be generally the same range, although 64bit DLLs are traditionally larger than their 32bit equivalents, you report yours as 1000 times larger than mine.   </p><p>Perhaps before you attempt a reinstall you might want to check the integrity of the actual drive under windows.  This <a href=""https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/disk-check-windows-10-chkdsk/c1f2fb49-7b71-409d-b713-6c10a28c9e51"" rel=""nofollow"">discussion </a>on Microsoft answers offers instructions on how to do that using windows 10 and 11.  Blue screens usually relate to real mode conflicts in Windows, that is kernel mode software, hardware drivers and other privileged programs.  Thunderbird does not operate in real mode directly, referring such requests to the operating system to undertake on it's behalf. Other than hardware drivers, one of the few programs that routinely operate in kernel mode are antivirus programs.  Hence they get an automatic suspicion when a blue screen occurs. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Most of them don't disable when they say they do,  or leave your system in a basically non functional state by breaking networking.  I do not know if it is deliberate on the part of the antivirus community,  but their products appear to universally not do what they say they will well.  Unless it is scan and scan everything they think they should when they think it should be done.  That is why I now use windows defender.  I am done with the paid products that slow my system and reduce my productivity without appreciable improvements to security. </p><p>You might want to try this <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database</a> at times the database gets somehow muddled and Thunderbird spends all it's time working out what to index.

You can monitor it using the activity manager (it is on the menu bar tools menu (alt will display the menu bar if it is not visible)  It may help here I do not know for sure. </p><p>An inability to write to  the file system is generally an external problem to Thunderbird with the antivirus being the most common thing also playing the the file space at the same time,  although folk trying to sync their Thunderbird profile to things like google drive can also see the files simply not available at the time they are needed.
