As a dynamic link library,  the size should not change once installed and even between operating system versions will be generally the same range, although 64bit DLLs are traditionally larger than their 32bit equivalents, you report yours as 1000 times larger than mine.   </p><p>Perhaps before you attempt a reinstall you might want to check the integrity of the actual drive under windows.

Blue screens usually relate to real mode conflicts in Windows, that is kernel mode software, hardware drivers and other privileged programs.  Thunderbird does not operate in real mode directly, referring such requests to the operating system to undertake on it's behalf. Other than hardware drivers, one of the few programs that routinely operate in kernel mode are antivirus programs.  Hence they get an automatic suspicion when a blue screen occurs. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
