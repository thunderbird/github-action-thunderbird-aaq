I have a feeling the issue is outside Thunderbird and may well reside in an antivirus product.  Using windows safe mode will eliminate that (except for defender) </p><p>However I think you also need to reinstall the software as my XUL.DLL is 127mb not something around 121 GB.  As a dynamic link library,  the size should not change once installed and even between operating system versions will be generally the same range, although 64bit DLLs are traditionally larger than their 32bit equivalents, you report yours as 1000 times larger than mine.   </p><p>Perhaps before you attempt a reinstall you might want to check the integrity of the actual drive under windows.

Blue screens usually relate to real mode conflicts in Windows, that is kernel mode software, hardware drivers and other privileged programs.  Thunderbird does not operate in real mode directly, referring such requests to the operating system to undertake on it's behalf. Other than hardware drivers, one of the few programs that routinely operate in kernel mode are antivirus programs.  Hence they get an automatic suspicion when a blue screen occurs. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Most of them don't disable when they say they do,  or leave your system in a basically non functional state by breaking networking.  I do not know if it is deliberate on the part of the antivirus community,  but their products appear to universally not do what they say they will well.  Unless it is scan and scan everything they think they should when they think it should be done.  That is why I now use windows defender.

Thunderbird 115 on another. Same files on both computers. Both computers were disconnected from the Internet. No other link between the computers. Then the files disappeared from the 2024 folder (nothing there anymore) and it seems that they are now (all?) visible and readable in the Trash in Thunderbirds!

The Thunderbird established correct a 2023 folder and archived the email correct there. No problem. I deleted the mail to Trash. Now 2023 was empty in Thunderbird. The mail was readable in Trash in Thunderbird. The file was however also still in Archives.sbd, in the 2023 folder!?

When will the files disappear from the archive?  </p><p>Your comment to this will be very much appreciated.

BUT, if Macs are like Linux and Windows, there should be a folder named Thunderbird that contains a profiles.ini file and a folder named profiles. If so, the backup process is - exit Thunderbird (Important) - using the OS's file manager, copy the thunderbird folder to external media.   The advantage of copying the thunderbird folder and not just the profile is that if you ever need to reinstall, it's a somewhat simple process to  - install thunderbird and exit  - copy the backed up thunderbird profile to replace the default established during setup.  </p><p>AND, Macs may be totally different - but I had good intentions.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
