I have a feeling the issue is outside Thunderbird and may well reside in an antivirus product.  Using windows safe mode will eliminate that (except for defender) </p><p>However I think you also need to reinstall the software as my XUL.DLL is 127mb not something around 121 GB.  As a dynamic link library,  the size should not change once installed and even between operating system versions will be generally the same range, although 64bit DLLs are traditionally larger than their 32bit equivalents, you report yours as 1000 times larger than mine.   </p><p>Perhaps before you attempt a reinstall you might want to check the integrity of the actual drive under windows.  This <a href=""https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/disk-check-windows-10-chkdsk/c1f2fb49-7b71-409d-b713-6c10a28c9e51"" rel=""nofollow"">discussion </a>on Microsoft answers offers instructions on how to do that using windows 10 and 11.  Blue screens usually relate to real mode conflicts in Windows, that is kernel mode software, hardware drivers and other privileged programs.  Thunderbird does not operate in real mode directly, referring such requests to the operating system to undertake on it's behalf. Other than hardware drivers, one of the few programs that routinely operate in kernel mode are antivirus programs.  Hence they get an automatic suspicion when a blue screen occurs. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Sometimes it is even crashing during this process (which can take a couple of minutes). Even if it manages to build a summary file successfully, when I right click on the nstmp folder and try to delete it, it will crash every single time. </p><p>If I reinstall Thunderbird, I know it will keep my current inbox emails (as they are still on the email servers)..... but will it keep my sent folder, my trash folder, all the nstmp folders etc etc etc??? </p>",flamingobarpattaya,false,0,0
