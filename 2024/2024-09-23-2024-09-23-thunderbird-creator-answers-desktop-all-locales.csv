I have lost all my passwords and settings and am gradually getting things sorted. So far, I have set up Thunderbird with all 8 email accounts and the messages are all there and new ones are added successfully. Quite a chore as I relied on password manager to keep my passwords. </p><p>My current problem is that I want to protect Thunderbird from another disaster as I may have to reinstall Windows to resolve a recurring problem with my Touchpad. Apart from the Profile what else do I need to save in One Drive. I especially don't want to lose the emails or account passwords as it took me so long to get just the Accounts set up. Changing passwords when you forget them has become quite a chore with authentication and on Mozilla, a special code I don't remember being given. I was locked out of this site for a night. </p><p>I have just signed up to One Drive for 100GB but I'm keeping backups of Photos, Docs on a thumb drive as I don't produce very much. I never want to be in this situation again. </p><p>What do I need to include in One Drive? Profile and? Does the same apply to Firefox?  </p><p><br> I'm still trying to get the Snipping Tool to work.
