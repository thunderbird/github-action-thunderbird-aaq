When I wanted to retrieve the attachment I got a lot of internal information about the e-mail but no attachment. How can that happen? This has not happened before as I always have attachments saved with the message. </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",leananger90

This is unnecessary, bulky and un-asked for.  It makes my inbox look like the alphabet vomited in it.  How do I remove this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1676279;,wilkandreamichelle
