Here is the reason: </p><p><strong>Context: </strong>I use filtering rules to move every new email to its place in a large tree of folders, which is evolutive, and I rather look at them through a set of saved search folders: urgent, priority unread, unread, recent -16 days, heavy +1Mb etc. </p><p>This is very handy but requires the 10 saved searches to be updated when the tree is changed. This is a long operation&nbsp;! The only handy tip I know is that when the box ""choose folders"" opens, it has the previous shape, so a priori the tree remains fully expanded. So it is +/- easy to locate the unselected ranges of checkboxes and to select then <strong>toggle</strong> them at once with spacebar. I found no key to check all, only to toggle. Then the update itself is so looooooooong... (I use a small Linux PC for emailing, not a gaming station).&nbsp;:-( And I have the whole set to update this way. </p><p>I can hardly imagine searching on a sub-folder in the tree with the explicit will of excepting one of its own sub-folders. I think that for 99% of people, searching on a folder means on any new sub-folder added to it. But the current behavior makes this the exception. </p><p>Then logically: 1) Every folder created or moved within a sub-tree should be added to all the saved searches set for this sub-tree, if any, according to (2). 2) In the search selection box, checking or unchecking a folder should do the same to all its sub-folders. This would allow to easily make exception sub-trees if necessary. So any folder could be marked as ""root of search"" or ""root of exclusion from search"". NB: I think that (2) could also optimize the encoding, currently done with an explicit list of all sub-folders, as I could see. </p><p>There were addons to do so, at least in the case of checking, but they often suddenly stop working with a new version of TB. I think this should rather be part of the feature. </p><p>Your positions&nbsp;? Thanks, best regards. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1636174;,Zener131
1439409,2024-02-11 02:08:51 -0800,2024-02-11 04:56:24 -0800,"Unexpected duplicate instance of TB, at least window, (by clicking)","<p>Hello. </p><p><strong>Need: </strong>Unless explicitly wanted, TB should run as a singleton and a single all-in-one window with tabs. </p><p><strong>Context: </strong>I use TB on Linux Mint with Lightning and with the option ""minimize to tray icon on close"". Frequently, by clicking on the icon to wake it up, or by clicking on the tab Calendar, I end with a duplicate window with all the tree of emails. </p><p>I suspect several causes: </p><p>1) Lightning attempts to synchronize with the CalDAV server and this may take a few seconds, which delays the display of the whole TB window. It may lead to click again the icon, but this should act as a toggle, not open a new window everytime&nbsp;! </p><p>2) Apparently in TB like in Firefox, there is a feature ""detach tab"" which operates on a very little move of the mouse (a few pixels suffice). Since it is not easy to keep the mouse perfectly fix before clicking, clicking on a tab often results in detaching it to a new window, and apparently when itis the calendar tam, the email tab is recreated too. </p><p>This feature ""detach tab"" is horribly annoying for many people and should be optional, both for TB and Firefox, I guess that many users would salute it&nbsp;! Or at least it should operate only on an explicit tab vertical dragging (at least twice the height of a tab). </p><p>Then for the click on the icon, if the window is already about to show but not visible yet, it should do nothing more. Actually the window should not wait for the calendar's update to show, it is always a pain to have network delays in a GUI, and this concerns the content of the calendar tab, not the emails. </p><p>Your positions&nbsp;?
