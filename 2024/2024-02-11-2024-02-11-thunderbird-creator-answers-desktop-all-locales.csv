Here is the reason: </p><p><strong>Context: </strong>I use filtering rules to move every new email to its place in a large tree of folders, which is evolutive, and I rather look at them through a set of saved search folders: urgent, priority unread, unread, recent -16 days, heavy +1Mb etc. </p><p>This is very handy but requires the 10 saved searches to be updated when the tree is changed. This is a long operation&nbsp;! The only handy tip I know is that when the box ""choose folders"" opens, it has the previous shape, so a priori the tree remains fully expanded. So it is +/- easy to locate the unselected ranges of checkboxes and to select then <strong>toggle</strong> them at once with spacebar. I found no key to check all, only to toggle. Then the update itself is so looooooooong... (I use a small Linux PC for emailing, not a gaming station).&nbsp;:-( And I have the whole set to update this way. </p><p>I can hardly imagine searching on a sub-folder in the tree with the explicit will of excepting one of its own sub-folders. I think that for 99% of people, searching on a folder means on any new sub-folder added to it. But the current behavior makes this the exception. </p><p>Then logically: 1) Every folder created or moved within a sub-tree should be added to all the saved searches set for this sub-tree, if any, according to (2). 2) In the search selection box, checking or unchecking a folder should do the same to all its sub-folders. This would allow to easily make exception sub-trees if necessary. So any folder could be marked as ""root of search"" or ""root of exclusion from search"". NB: I think that (2) could also optimize the encoding, currently done with an explicit list of all sub-folders, as I could see. </p><p>There were addons to do so, at least in the case of checking, but they often suddenly stop working with a new version of TB. I think this should rather be part of the feature. </p><p>Your positions&nbsp;? Thanks, best regards. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",Zener131
