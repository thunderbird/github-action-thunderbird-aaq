Some years ago I had an Outlook email address on Thunderbird but removed it. At that time, sending or forwarding emails wasn't affected and wasn't until recently.I still receive emails ok.  The message is as follows:    'Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: This email was not sent but there is a way to fix it. To resend successfully you need to update your email settings (e.g. Outlook) to turn SMTP authentication on.

Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again.'   I can't really understand the message. Can someone help me out with this issue?
