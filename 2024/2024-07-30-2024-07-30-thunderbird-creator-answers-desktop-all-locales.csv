The message is as follows:    'Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: This email was not sent but there is a way to fix it.

My layout is set to vertical view. The layout on the list of messages (the middle section in between the list of folders and the message preview pane) looks very different from the previous version. The font is smaller and each message pane seems to take up more space (less dense). I wish I could describe the problem better by sending a screenshot, but I only know to do that in Firefox, not Thunderbird. I've tried to adjust the settings (either adjusting the density or zoom) but I can't get it to look the same as before. Adjusting the font size bigger makes each message take up more space so fewer messages fit in the message list.
