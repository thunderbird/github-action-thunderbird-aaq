Literally double click an .eml file within windows and get it to open the email and block all access to everything else, including (sorry!) the donation page which causes a browser window to open and we cannot have that (am happy to donate some money if I can block this) as well as the account start up. </p><p>So according to the documentation, I just need a policies.json file in a distribution folder, in the program files, thunderbird folder which I have done. </p><p>A very shortened JSON copy of this file is as follows: (includes one option that DOES work and one that does not) { </p><pre> ""policies"": {    ""BlockAboutAccounts"": true, </pre> <p>	""BlockAboutConfig"": true, ""Preferences"": { </p><pre>     ""app.use_without_mail_account"": {        ""Value"": true,        ""Status"": ""user""      } </pre> <p>} } } </p><p>So that works on blocking the about config, but still allows Thunderbird to keep asking for a user account, unless specifying that you do not want to. This happens every time, unless set not to manually. </p><p>When setting the change, the prefs.js file within the profile that it creates has the value key name, and the value is the default of ""false"" unless the config is manually edited and switched off, then it changes to true. </p><p>There are no group policies set against Thunderbird so I have no idea why my policies.json ""appears"" to be getting ignored, though the BlockAboutConfig <strong>does</strong> work. Perhaps it is not Preferences that it goes against but something else&nbsp;? (something I was not able to find out in the documentation, but I could not see it). </p><p>Any help would be most appreciated but ideally we need: No main app window to appear (so just the email itself would appear) No account request No donation page to appear. </p><p>Am happy to contribute some money towards the project if this can be locked down. </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;! </p><p>Carl </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",carlharrison
