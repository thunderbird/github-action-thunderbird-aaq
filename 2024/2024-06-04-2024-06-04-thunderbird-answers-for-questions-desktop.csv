However, it then went through an automatic update so I was back to that problem again. I installed the 115.8.1 exe file again but then went into Settings to stop the auto update. Instead, apparently in future it will ask if I want to update Thunderbird. So far so good, it has stayed as 115.8.1.  </p><p>Thankyou for your help </p>",graham65,false,0,0
