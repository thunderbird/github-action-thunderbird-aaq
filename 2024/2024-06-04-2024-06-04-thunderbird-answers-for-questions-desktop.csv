As for the second problem, I hope someone is working on a solution. I'm sure it started at about the time an update was loaded onto my pc. That leaves me with a quandary - should I click on the ""Solved The Problem"" button?

Het kan ook zo zijn dat de weergave de laatste berichten niet toont door een andere sortering, zie ook <a href=""http://mzl.la/1ApHmDc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mzl.la/1ApHmDc</a>. Komen er ook geen meldingen binnen van nieuwe berichten ontvangen? Zijn er eventueel foutmeldingen? Zo ja, dan graag een (geanonimiseerde) schermafdruk toevoegen. </p>",Fjoerfoks,false,0,0

To save messages for an IMAP account, and have the full content, I recommend  - click account settings&gt;synchronization&amp;storage - click 'advanced' button and mark desired folders for offline use - click File&gt;offline&gt;download sync   - now, highlight and COPY the messages you want saved in Local Folders.

In which files / databases with folder-name / folder-path or maybe with the `folderLocations` table `id` for the folder (in case all folders are listed in one setting) or in some file with the value for each folder or in the DB somewhere I missed it. That would allow me to automize the setup of hundreds folders to get this value (for hundreds of folder among many hundreds of folders that should not be always checked so the ""check all"" option is no alternative). </p>",frax1,false,0,0

You have to logon to your webmail account via a browser in order to set up or modify a password. </p><p>If you have forgotten the password then there should be a 'Forgotten Password' link to click on.  Then follow instructions in order to get access to account at which point you can reset the password. Once you have set up password, you can then use it to create the mail account. </p><p>If you already had this mail account set up in Thunderbird then perhaps you instructed Thunderbird to remember the password.
