But I have one that doesn't work as I'd like it to. I have a friend with whom I correspond regularly, often with the words 'Lunch Club' in the subject line. My wife also corresponds with a (different) group and uses 'Lunch Club' in the subject line. I have set up a filter with the intention of filtering my friend's e-mails first, using his e-mail address (as in 'from contains friend's email'). There's a second filter that filters any subject line 'Lunch Club' into my wife's in-box. Unfortunately ALL 'Lunch Club' e-mails end up in my wife's in-box, including my friend's messages, even though his filter is run first. Having read through the article on setting filters, I begin to suspect that this may be intentional behaviour as described here (extract from Mozilla Support 'Organize Your Messages by Using Filters'): ""Filters are executed in the order they appear in the list of filters, except when that order is not possible, in which case you will see the message Note: Filter actions will be run in a different order, and the link See execution order. If you click the link, you will see which order is used. For example: If you have a filter that moves a message to another folder, and then further down the list a filter that replies, the reply filter will not work because the message is gone from the folder. In this case, Thunderbird will change the order, so the reply filter will be executed before the move filter. "" I don't recall ever having seen seen the link 'See execution order'.

Most people know when this happens you are pretty much toast getting back into that account even if you know your pw, user name, phone number, etc... Their system just runs you in circles. I have found a way to get it back but its very very time consuming. But, its awesome that TB users can still use those gmail addresses for sending and receiving, you just can't go there to clean out the junk and expired stuff. </p><p>So my question is this: Is there a way for TB to tweak code for when TB does its automatic fetch mail routine to gmail, it makes gmail ""think"" you actually signed in physically? There would be hundreds of thousands of users jumping for joy if this could be done. I assume it would have to be I.P specific from my local machine and not I.P from TB servers? I.E words, when TB fetches email, it would need to utilize my actual I.P address when doing so. If it already does this, then why do we get blocked for not signing in for an unspecified time frame? </p>",TheNightowl;MattAuSupport;,true,false,false,;category:fix-problems;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0;product:thunderbird,2,0,0,,,

Many times over the past months I have tried to find the answer to this problem.  When I click on a link in email it no longer loads my browser.  My only option is to right click on the link, copy, then run my browser and paste it.  I use Google Chrome, but have tried Edge, Firefox and other browsers and the result is the same.  This would suggest the problem is somewhere in my Thunderbird settings.  I'm trying to be patient and ask you to be the same.  If this problem ever gets solved, I'll begin sending a donation. </p><pre>   I'm using Chrome on Windows 10 on a desktop computer.      My wife also uses Chrome but, on Windows 11 on a desktop computer.  She has no problem with her Thunderbird links.      I look forward to any help anyone has to offer. </pre> <p>Sincerely, Jim Archibald, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada </p>",jimarch;MattAuSupport;,true,true,false,";category:fix-problems;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird",1,0,0,,,
