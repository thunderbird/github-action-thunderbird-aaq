I've used local folders on this remote location (samba shares) for may years.  Two days ago, when I've try to move message from mailbox to local folders  I've received error ""not enough disk space"". There was a plenty of space on that remote location.  After several attempts to solve the issue I've found that problem happened when local folders are located remotely. When they are defined as local then everything work fine.  I've try to cheat making symbolic link for local folders or even for single subfolder. Result is the same.  Everything work fine if local folders are located locally on file system. Any remote location, direct or via symbolic link and even for subfolder, don't allow to move any message to that remote folder. There is enough space and proper R/W access tho that remote location from this machine.  How I can return to my normal operation with local folders on remote location? </p>",krismy1991;,true,false,false,;category:fix-problems;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:124.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0;product:thunderbird,0,0,0,,,
