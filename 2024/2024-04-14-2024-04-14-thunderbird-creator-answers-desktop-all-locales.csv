The current version is well marked, but it would be helpful if the older versions had a subject line like ""Release 115.x.x (github commit id)"" so we can do better than walk back one release at a time.  All flatpak examples for rollback show meaningful subject lines, but Thunderbird and other flatpaks I actually use don't seem to. </p> <ol><li> flatpak remote-info --log flathub app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird </li></ol> <p>Thunderbird - Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client </p><pre>       ID: org.mozilla.Thunderbird       Ref: app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/x86_64/stable      Arch: x86_64    Branch: stable   Version: 115.9.0 </pre> <p>... </p><pre>   Commit: ec99a6e7155ef2ce8fbb88a45c9ce50f3213289cdf6c0f77825b622f30fa7845    Parent: 6e23bd3c0dbb2ea57192a120e9d4c431ee192e454e0cc11452184392f14e6fab   Subject: <strong>Export org.mozilla.Thunderbird</strong>      Date: 2024-03-19 14:02:18 +0000   History:  </pre> <pre>   Commit: 6e23bd3c0dbb2ea57192a120e9d4c431ee192e454e0cc11452184392f14e6fab   Subject: Export org.mozilla.Thunderbird      Date: 2024-03-05 07:25:45 +0000 </pre> <pre>   Commit: 1d7a72d99a0e77fc16bdd610d356f4eea0626dfaf95fa572744451502b9f4128   Subject: Export org.mozilla.Thunderbird      Date: 2024-03-05 07:04:30 +0000 </pre>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",locutus.sg
