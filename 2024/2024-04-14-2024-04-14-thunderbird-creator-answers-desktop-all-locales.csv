The current version is well marked, but it would be helpful if the older versions had a subject line like ""Release 115.x.x (github commit id)"" so we can do better than walk back one release at a time.

I have gone to IONOS support and we have both looked at the configuration and can see no differences between my set-up and hers.  I have deleted all email address from her machine and reloaded Thunderbird (115.9.0), restarted her machine and added back her email.  Same results, she can receive but not send.  If she uses her phone, it works, and if you go to the IONOS web site and use there service it works.  I'm at my wits end and can not figure it out.  I have also opened an incident with the IONOS Postmaster, which I think is their second level support.  Please help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1647361;,cddunn100
