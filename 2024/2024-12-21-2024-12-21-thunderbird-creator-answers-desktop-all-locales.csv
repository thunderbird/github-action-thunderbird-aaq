When none of the obvious troubleshooting steps helped, I thought the Profile might be corrupted.  I recovered only the 2 day-old Profile folder from my Retrospect backup set, renamed the current Profile folder, and pasted the older Profile in its place. Thunderbird then started, logged into the server, and downloaded emails. However, nothing about Firefox looked familiar - no the local options/folders, etc. were there. How do I get the original Thunderbird look and feel back for her (very important)? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",BillRK

A couple of months ago, T-bird started sending me error messages and no longer sent outgoing mail. I checked with Spectrum (my main mail provider for email: mad1doc@twcny.rr.com) and it looks like all my settings are correct. I have  2 other Gmail accounts and they both work perfectly. I'm including a screenshot of the most recent error message / server refusal.

I was prompted to login with Oauth2, and it worked. However, I can receive emails, but cannot send emails. I get a notice that my password is wrong when I come to send emails. It just happens because of the password change. No matter what I do I cannot find where the Oauth was saved for smtp. There seems to be a desync, where the password updated for the Incoming server, but never lets me or updates the Oauth for the smtp server. Any thoughts? </p><p>Deleting saved passwords, just gets me to do Oauth2 for the incoming, it never takes effect on the smtp server. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1696365;,tim55
