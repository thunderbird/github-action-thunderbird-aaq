I can't remember any Thunderbird password, only Firefox. And I can't access anywhere where I can change it without having the original. Any ideas please. And does it mean that the password has to be the same for both Messaging Co and Thunderbird. Thanks </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1681051;,meowngame

Ik heb al vele jaren heel goede ervaringen met Thunderbird. Maar nu voel ik me gedwongen het te verlaten. Ik zou dan wel ik wel mijn archiefmappen met oude e-mails moeten overzetten naar Ziggo Webmail. Hoe zou ik dat moeten doen? Bij voorbaat veel dank voor je hulp.

I have been happy with Thunderbird for quite some years. But now I feel kind of forced to abandon it. But then the question is how to transfer my maps with old e-mails to Ziggo Webmail.
