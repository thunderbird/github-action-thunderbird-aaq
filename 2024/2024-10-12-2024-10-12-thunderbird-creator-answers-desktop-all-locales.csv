I am in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. </p><p>Here is what I did: 1- went into my server mail and moved every folder emails into my inbox </p><p>2- created my Thunderbird POP3 using the automatic process </p><pre>   - said to delete emails after being downloaded </pre> <p>3- once created I wanted to create a personnalized folder this account (I have another email to do the same thing).  I was pointing to a specific folder before I created a new one: ~/snap/thunderbird/common/.thunderbird/b*.default I pointed it to ~/snap/thunderbird/common/.thunderbird/f* </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> can't remember if these were called profile location or something else.  Please explain the purpose of it and when should we need to change it. </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>4- I went into my mail window and noticed Thunderebird Inbox being empty.  I went back to my server inbox and it was also empty.  I did not know why nothing was downloaded.  I tried using the Get Mail a few times but nothing was happening.  Tried to look for Synch something option but could not find any </p><p>5- I checked both folders above and saw the default one had tons of stuff why the second one had almost nothing.  So I figured that before I had chosen the 2nd folder location, my inbox must have been downloaded into the default one. </p><p>6- tried in the console to copy the whole content of the first folder to the second one.  I think I restarted at that point, not sure.  But in the email list window there was ""history.sqlite"" listed instead of inbox and ""minidumps"" below it. </p><p>7- I added an import addon, imported the b*.default folder into a 3 one I created, had chosen Offline and restarted.  Now in the email window nothing was showing up.  I tried Get Mail but it said I needed to get off the Offline mode.  I unchecked Working Offline in the File menu but still nothing. </p><p>If I do a Thunderbird restart, it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to start Thunderbird with.  If I chose the default one,  it shows the history.sqlite and minidumps folders.  If I chose the 2nd one I created, it has the same content.  If I chose the 3rd one I created with the import, it brings me up to the step where I can create a Thunderbird email account. </p><p>Now I have no idea what to do.  I still believe all my 200+ emails are in the b*.default folder but how to I switch back to it? </p><p>Please tell me I did not loose all those 200+ emails&nbsp;!!! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1681196;1681206;1681310;1681335;1681358;1681381;1681497;1681559;1681564;1681598;,browser_ice1
