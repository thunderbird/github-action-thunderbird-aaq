I can't remember any Thunderbird password, only Firefox. And I can't access anywhere where I can change it without having the original. Any ideas please. And does it mean that the password has to be the same for both Messaging Co and Thunderbird. Thanks </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1681051;,meowngame
