Per the instructions, I backed up my profile, deleted the account and reinstalled it with the previous profile files, using the server name <a href=""http://Outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.office365.com</a> as directed.

Also, under localhost, I see an even larger Inbox, Sent, etc. that appear to contain at least one of the missing emails, so I suspect that that is the location of the missing mail. </p><p>This is complicated by the fact that I have an email account through another company that also uses the server <a href=""http://Outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.office365.com</a>. </p><p>I've tried changing the local directory under the server settings for the Hotmail account to each of the different <a href=""http://Outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.office365.com</a> directories, but I still cannot see the old emails. </p><p>Can you help me to retrieve the old emails and place them in the same account?
