I can't get imap to work,"<p><a href=""http://Cox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Cox.com</a> has decided to no longer have their own email server and switched their accounts to yahoo.  I can read my email directly on Yahoo, but can't get their imap to work.  I changed the imap and smtp settings to yahoo.  Also, the email login has changed and I changed that in Thunderbird.  With Cox, the login was just ""username"" and now it is ""username@cox.net"".  When I made these changes in the account settings, my email account has disappeared from the inbox, but it is still in account settings.  I am using a unified inbox with several accounts. </p><p>Cox will not help me with this, and I have been on hold with yahoo for an hour with no response.  I have been messing with this for two days so I hope you can help me. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1648644;1648648;,patnsandy

T takes a very long time to load. There are no saved passwords and I enter them all with the options to save. I check the passwords in Settings and they are all there correctly. When I next run Thunderbird it may or may not have them still saved. I check the Settings and they have gone; so I enter them again and they are saved OK. But then they are deleted some time later. I cannot see any pattern in the failure. I wonder if there is a problem with the outgoing server setttings. All the passwords are lost whether imap, pop (Ionos), hotmail or yahoo. Is there a way to clear out my profile or is this a problem with this T release. it did not happen until about 1-2 months ago. My profile is on a local NAS.

Nostalgy is an essential add-on for me, but it's not working the same as in earlier versions, and I hope someone can help with these problems.  Or should I ask Alain Frisch, the author of the add-on? 1.  Using S to move (or C to copy) an email to a selected folder works when the email is closed (but highlighted in the Inbox or wherever) but no longer works when the email is open.  Earlier versions worked when the email is open, and it's a huge drawback for me that it doesn't work that way now.  Am I missing something? 2.  The command G (go to the specified folder) does not appear at all when invoked from within an email.  When the email is closed G provides the expected list of folders, but focus does NOT move to the selected folder.  Again, am I missing something? </p><p>Grateful for any help. </p><p>Lindsay Graham </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1648700;,Lindsay13Graham
