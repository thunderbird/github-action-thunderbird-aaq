I can't get imap to work,"<p><a href=""http://Cox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Cox.com</a> has decided to no longer have their own email server and switched their accounts to yahoo.  I can read my email directly on Yahoo, but can't get their imap to work.  I changed the imap and smtp settings to yahoo.  Also, the email login has changed and I changed that in Thunderbird.  With Cox, the login was just ""username"" and now it is ""username@cox.net"".  When I made these changes in the account settings, my email account has disappeared from the inbox, but it is still in account settings.  I am using a unified inbox with several accounts. </p><p>Cox will not help me with this, and I have been on hold with yahoo for an hour with no response.  I have been messing with this for two days so I hope you can help me. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1648644;1648648;,patnsandy

T takes a very long time to load. There are no saved passwords and I enter them all with the options to save. I check the passwords in Settings and they are all there correctly. When I next run Thunderbird it may or may not have them still saved. I check the Settings and they have gone; so I enter them again and they are saved OK. But then they are deleted some time later. I cannot see any pattern in the failure. I wonder if there is a problem with the outgoing server setttings. All the passwords are lost whether imap, pop (Ionos), hotmail or yahoo. Is there a way to clear out my profile or is this a problem with this T release. it did not happen until about 1-2 months ago. My profile is on a local NAS. Generally T seems to be quite unstable&nbsp;; I get Not Responding too often.. Thanks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1648682;,work37
