I'd like to have similar control over that toolbar to that I have on the other Thunderbird toolbars.  But I cannot find the appropriate Customize option. </p><p>What am I missing? </p><p>thx. </p><p>(Thunderbird 115.9 on Linux Mint, 115.10 on Windows) </p>",mike.543;sfhowes;,true,false,false,;category:customize;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:125.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/125.0;product:thunderbird,2,0,0,,,
