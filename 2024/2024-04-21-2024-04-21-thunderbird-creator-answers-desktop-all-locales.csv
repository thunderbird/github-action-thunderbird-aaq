I can't get imap to work,"<p><a href=""http://Cox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Cox.com</a> has decided to no longer have their own email server and switched their accounts to yahoo.  I can read my email directly on Yahoo, but can't get their imap to work.  I changed the imap and smtp settings to yahoo.  Also, the email login has changed and I changed that in Thunderbird.  With Cox, the login was just ""username"" and now it is ""username@cox.net"".  When I made these changes in the account settings, my email account has disappeared from the inbox, but it is still in account settings.  I am using a unified inbox with several accounts. </p><p>Cox will not help me with this, and I have been on hold with yahoo for an hour with no response.  I have been messing with this for two days so I hope you can help me. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1648644;,patnsandy

How do I get it back? The Trash Folder itself is gone, not just the trash. Now the trash just disappears when I delete it. Is there any way of reinstalling it? Can I reinstall Thunderbird? What are the consequences if I do that? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",bevmsp
