I enter my full name, email address, and app-specific password. Thunderbird recognizes the password, but when I click ""Next,"" I get the following message: ""Unable to log in to the server. There may be an error in the configuration, username, or password."" I expect a window to appear for additional authorization through <a href=""http://mail.ru"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.ru</a> since I am using OAuth2 authentication, but this window does not pop up. Interestingly, on another computer with the same version, I can add this account without any issues. Additionally, the account is added successfully on the same computer with the newer version, but for some reason, it does not add on the x32 version. Although the account does get added if I use the ""normal password"" option, I cannot send messages from it. I look forward to your response and assistance.
