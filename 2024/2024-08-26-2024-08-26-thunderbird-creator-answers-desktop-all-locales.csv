I enter my full name, email address, and app-specific password. Thunderbird recognizes the password, but when I click ""Next,"" I get the following message: ""Unable to log in to the server. There may be an error in the configuration, username, or password."" I expect a window to appear for additional authorization through <a href=""http://mail.ru"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.ru</a> since I am using OAuth2 authentication, but this window does not pop up. Interestingly, on another computer with the same version, I can add this account without any issues. Additionally, the account is added successfully on the same computer with the newer version, but for some reason, it does not add on the x32 version. Although the account does get added if I use the ""normal password"" option, I cannot send messages from it. I look forward to your response and assistance. Thank you in advance! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ilya.rudakov.23

I´ve already informed my hosting service about this issue and it seems like the problem is Thunderbird instead. I tried to use the information given on your website, but nothing happened.

The problem is, that I have only POP3 protocol and Inbox file brakes, if there is any new message while copying. Unfortunately, I can't move my mail to IMAP, it's not a variant. Automatic closing Thunderbird (like in crontab killing process) before backup is not a variant either, because it's not safe. Manual closing Thunderbird would solve my problem, but, as I said, I need to do it automatic). For example, If I am absent for a few weeks, backup should continue working fine. If anyone have already found working solution for it? </p><p>P.S. ImportExportTools NG ""Automatic backup"" is not automatic, you need to close Thunderbird manually every day for this to work. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1670593;,11i.am.fake.11
