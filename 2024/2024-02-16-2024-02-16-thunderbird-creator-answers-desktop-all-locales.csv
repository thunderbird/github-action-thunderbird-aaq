As I explained in another question, I use filtering rules to move the incoming emails to their definitive place in a tree of folders, and I look at them through a set of permanent Saved searches using specific criteria this is very handy. </p><p>I created the set of saved searches at once (all in the folder _Vues = Views in French), but they don't all work the same, as visible in the attached image: - all properly turn to bold, like other folders, when having messages in unread state, - but some of them don't turn to blue, while others do, when having new messages, - the real folders don't appear to have any problem, they do turn blue when the new messages are moved to  them. </p><p>This looks like a little cosmetic problem, but it is very annoying as it forces to look at all the searches instead of only the relevant ones. </p><p>All the accounts use the option to share a single input and output box in the Local Folders. There is no structural difference between the saved searches (names etc.). </p><p>Some emails meet the criteria so should appear in multiple saved searches. I suspect this is the key of the scenario, where for a given incoming email, only the last saved search found matching it would turn to blue, then the global result would depend on the set of incoming emails... </p><p>Understanding this would require to know the exact algorithm used. </p><p>Can someone explain what happens&nbsp;? </p><p>Thanks, Best regards. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Zener131

Let me start by saying I don't use the ""message pane"", I don't like it.  I have my emails listed as they are in the attached pic. I don't know what changed but before when a new message would come in it would be in BOLD and once I clicked on it to open it in a new tab it would automatically mark as ""read"" (or un-bold). Now when they come through they are not in BOLD and since I get so many, and am not able to save or move them right away, I get confused as to which ones I have actually opened. Right now I do NOT have the box checked to ""automatically mark messages as read"" so one would think this would mean they would stay 'un-read' until I open them but they don't. Yes, I tried to click ""automatically mark message as read - immediately on display"" AND ""automatically mark message as read - after&nbsp;?? seconds"" - - the first does what it's doing now, doesn't show them BOLD - - the second will show them as bold for exactly so many seconds and then un-bolds after that time which still doesn't help because I may not check my email for hours at a time.
