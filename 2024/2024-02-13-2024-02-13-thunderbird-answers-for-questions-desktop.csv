I have had to buy a new pc as my old one died. I have updated the new new pc and am currently downloading all my emails but wondered if the all the separate folders i had on my old pc (  in the firebird email app ) will be copied as well or have i lost them? Also if they are not downloadable i still have the hard drives so would they be on there somewhere&nbsp;? Thanks for any help PS. will all my sent and deleted emails come back as well? </blockquote>",danhayj,false,0,0
