I have had to buy a new pc as my old one died. I have updated the new new pc and am currently downloading all my emails but wondered if the all the separate folders i had on my old pc (  in the firebird email app ) will be copied as well or have i lost them? Also if they are not downloadable i still have the hard drives so would they be on there somewhere&nbsp;? Thanks for any help PS. will all my sent and deleted emails come back as well? </blockquote>",danhayj,false,0,0

That is the only way I can see what you typed making any sense. </p><p>POP accounts use a global inbox in local folders by default.  This works really well for me,  because I have half a dozen mail accounts dropping mail in the same inbox.  It is not syncronised so does not meet the needs of many folk these days.  But it suits me. </p><p>If you want to see a POP mail account separately in the folder pane, so into the account settings &gt; server settings.   Click advanced Change the setting to inbox for this account </p><p>Note once you change it,  changing it back will see the folders in the folder pane for that account vanish, along with their contents.  So make sure folders are empty before reverting to the global inbox. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
