I probably overdid the cleaning and I must have changed a setting of how Thunderbird performs.  I have an email account with Apple and I also use Apple for my Thunderbird calendar source.  I have an iPhone so that's why I use Apple for email and calendar.  (I also have a GMail email account and that's working fine in Thunderbird.)  To access my Apple email and calendar in Thunderbird I need to provide an ""App Specific Password"" which I can download from Apple.  I have used this in the past for Apple applications on my Windows PC and laptop without any problems.  On my laptop, when I try to access my Apple email or calendar, I'm asked for my App Specific Password.  I have created new App Specific Passwords for both my email and calendar but, having entered these in Thunderbird, I still don't have access to new entries in my email or calendar.  I can see existing entries but I can't create new ones.  When I enter a new calendar event on my phone, it doesn't appear in Thunderbird.  If I could, somehow, repair the fault that CCleaner seems to have made in Thunderbird, I would prefer to do that.  If anyone knows how to make this repair, please let me know.  Another solution might be to delete Thunderbird completely from my laptop and reinstall it.  A clean reinstall would probably take the App Specific Passwords as I originally entered. I also have a Windows desktop PC with Thunderbird installed that that's working fine with Apple email and calendar.  I haven't use the CCleaner professional on that! My options seem to be: 1.  Repair Thunderbird to remove the problem that I created by destroying part of it by using CCleaner. or 2.  Deleting Thunderbird from my laptop and start again with a fresh install. If I delete Thunerbird from my laptop, will it affect how Thunderbird works on my PC? Sorry for this essay. If anyone has any suggestions, I would be grateful for your advice.

Thunderbird handles four accounts for me, three of them Gmail. Each of those three has been set up differently with respect to Bin/Trash (not by me; I just let Thunderbird do all that). One of them has a Bin folder <em>and</em> a Trash Folder, one of them has just a Bin folder, and one of them has just a Trash folder. What is going on here and how can I fix it so they all have just one, and all called the same (I don't really care which but I'd have a UK preference for Bin!)
