I probably overdid the cleaning and I must have changed a setting of how Thunderbird performs.  I have an email account with Apple and I also use Apple for my Thunderbird calendar source.  I have an iPhone so that's why I use Apple for email and calendar.  (I also have a GMail email account and that's working fine in Thunderbird.)  To access my Apple email and calendar in Thunderbird I need to provide an ""App Specific Password"" which I can download from Apple.  I have used this in the past for Apple applications on my Windows PC and laptop without any problems.  On my laptop, when I try to access my Apple email or calendar, I'm asked for my App Specific Password.  I have created new App Specific Passwords for both my email and calendar but, having entered these in Thunderbird, I still don't have access to new entries in my email or calendar.  I can see existing entries but I can't create new ones.  When I enter a new calendar event on my phone, it doesn't appear in Thunderbird.  If I could, somehow, repair the fault that CCleaner seems to have made in Thunderbird, I would prefer to do that.  If anyone knows how to make this repair, please let me know.  Another solution might be to delete Thunderbird completely from my laptop and reinstall it.  A clean reinstall would probably take the App Specific Passwords as I originally entered. I also have a Windows desktop PC with Thunderbird installed that that's working fine with Apple email and calendar.  I haven't use the CCleaner professional on that! My options seem to be: 1.  Repair Thunderbird to remove the problem that I created by destroying part of it by using CCleaner. or 2.  Deleting Thunderbird from my laptop and start again with a fresh install. If I delete Thunerbird from my laptop, will it affect how Thunderbird works on my PC? Sorry for this essay. If anyone has any suggestions, I would be grateful for your advice.

Il messaggio arriva ma senza gli allegati, esportando però l'email e decirfandola esternamente gli allegati sono presenti quindi solo thunderbird non gli riconosce, la mia chiave privata e la chiave pubblica del mio collega però l'ho scaricata direttamente da thunderbird. 3. Arriva la mail crittata coi allegati e si può scaricarli etc. ma non si riesce più ad aprirli direttamente dall'email come si poteva fare precedentemente.  </p><p>Sapete darmi una mano&nbsp;? </p>",pawel.resolvo;@next;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:132.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/132.0,5,0,1,,,

Io non ho messo in sola lettura il calendario sulle varie postazioni così che possa inserire degli eventi da ovunque. Il problema è che le persone che hanno la possibilità di vedere il calendario (e modificarlo) una volta ricevuto l'invito possono modificare anche il calendario di salvataggio e quindi poi toglierlo dal calendario condiviso (per esempio sul calendario personale).  In pratica io vorrei che il calendario condiviso possa essere utilizzato da tutte le postazioni dove l'ho creato in modo da poter creare e modificare eventi, l'unica cosa vorrei che uno possa modificare il calendario di salvataggio quando riceve l'invito. Spero di essermi spiegato bene, grazie in anticipo e buona giornata </p><p>Manuel </p>",manuel7wlf;@next;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/130.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;solver_id:6257059",4,0,0,,,
