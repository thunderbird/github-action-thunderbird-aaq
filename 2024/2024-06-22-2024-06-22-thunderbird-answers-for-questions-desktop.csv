This generally means that the profile pointed to by profiles.ini does not exist. My sugestion is to let Thunderbird do the heavy lifting. On that, I suggest:  - copy your desired profile to a desired place on the computer.  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folders' and click 'about:profiles' - now, click the 'create profile' button in upper left - click next - enter name for the profile, such as, MYPROFILE - now, click the 'choose' button to locate and select the profile you placed in first step - now click to close and activate the profile. These steps ensure that the proper settings are being done for you.  I hope these steps work for you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
