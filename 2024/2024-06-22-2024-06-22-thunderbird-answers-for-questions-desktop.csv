I have no idea what choices you made when your set up the account in Thunderbird,  so it could be something to do with contact sync or even calendar sync depending on what addons you have installed.  Actually completing it,  which would initiate an oauth2.0 flow will disclose exactly what the request is to authorize,  so try that and post back when you know what it is you are attempting to ignore. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Only a ""best endeavors"" type thing.  So there is no one failure point to look for why you are not getting mail. </p><p>In the first instance use the bell webmail and see if your missing mail is there.  If not,  there is no way it can get to Thunderbird because the bell webmail will see it before Thunderbird ever gets a chance. </p><p>Often email from hosted domains which it sounds like you incoming mail is aresimply not accepted or delivered by the receiving domain as the sender is not correctly set up with standard email validation products like SPF, DKIM or DMARK.  Additionally the mail exchanger (MX) has to be correctly set in DNS for many sites to accept mail for it. </p><p>You can check most of these things on this site. <a href=""https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx</a>  normally I would have a quick look,  but you have not supplied the sending domain,  so I will leave that to you. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You will just have to let the process complete as I am not aware of any limiting setting on the Yahoo site.  Google offer a limiting setting for their POP mail accounts, but I am not aware of one for Yahoo.You might want to ask Yahoo to be sure. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Or even the newest release 128 which will be out in a few weeks. </p><p>In all probability the opening of the email initiates the writing of temp files to the system temp folder.  This usually initiates a virus scan on the file and can bring things to their knees.  On older systems it can be that the temp folder has so many orphaned temp file that the process of writing a file can bring things to a crawl.  As Windows makes no attempt to clear out the system them folder, it is a leading cause of systems starting to slow after only a few months </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
