Generally IMAP mail is received on Port 993 and send mail using SMTP on port 465  </p><p>I would like to confirm those things on the Optus web site,  but unfortunately if it is there it is well hidden. The est I could find was this <a href=""https://www.optus.com.au/for-you/support/answer?id=1434"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.optus.com.au/for-you/support/answer?id=1434</a> which at least confirms the server names to be used. in the form of Incoming mail server: <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a> Outgoing mail server: <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a> Username: Your OptusNet username (without @optusnet.com.au) Password: Your OptusNet email password </p><p>So I have trawled the web and come up with these settings which appear fairly consistent accross the web forums and support sites I looked at. IMAP Server <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a> Port 993 Security Policy Use SSL/TLS  Username your-email@optusnet.com.au Password Your <a href=""http://optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">optusnet.com.au</a> password </p><p>SMTP Server settings </p><p>SMTP Server <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a> Port 465 Security Use SSL/TLS  SMTP Username your-email@optusnet.com.au SMTP Password Your <a href=""http://optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">optusnet.com.au</a> password </p><p>So I really do not know as Optus appear to think security through obscurity will prevent the next hacking event. </p><p>There is also the possibility that the issue is your antivirus.  There have been a lot of those type things reported in the recent past.  Check that there is not some sort of error window hidden behind other windows complaining about a certificate. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
