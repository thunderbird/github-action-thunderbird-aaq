I have no idea what choices you made when your set up the account in Thunderbird,  so it could be something to do with contact sync or even calendar sync depending on what addons you have installed.  Actually completing it,  which would initiate an oauth2.0 flow will disclose exactly what the request is to authorize,  so try that and post back when you know what it is you are attempting to ignore. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You will just have to let the process complete as I am not aware of any limiting setting on the Yahoo site.  Google offer a limiting setting for their POP mail accounts, but I am not aware of one for Yahoo.You might want to ask Yahoo to be sure. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
