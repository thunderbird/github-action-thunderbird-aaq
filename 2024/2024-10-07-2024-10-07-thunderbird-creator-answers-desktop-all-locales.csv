Now, when attempting to launch or use that previous profile in reinstalled 128.3 popup advises: ""You have launched an older version of Thunderbird."" ""A newer version of Thunderbird may have made changes to your profile which are no longer compatible with this older version.  Use this profile only with that newer version or create a new profile."" </p><p>Only options then available are ""Exit"" or ""Create New Profile."" TB 128.3 will recognize only a newly created generic profile, but not allow previous profile to be launched or set as default from Profile Manager. </p><p>Essentially, the options are: 1)  Use your previous profile, but only with the Beta 131 release 2)  Use the latest supported (128.3) release but only with a newly created profile, not yours. </p><p>I've seen this problem posted in several forms by people unknowingly on the ""release"" update channel who got the 131 release and can't implement their profile after downgrading to the esr release.

Thunderbird started displaying a text block instead of some emails. It starts with loading the mesage longer then ussually and <strong>some</strong> of new messages are replaced with text that resembles part of encoded email.  What's strange is that it is always the same message that replaces the email, looking like in image in the attachement below (it contains a reference to attachement that has been sent previously in some other mail, but in now way connected to email that it replaces). Email is looking perfectly fine in web client, I can even forward it from web to TB and it displays properly in TB. I don't see any pattern as to what kind of email is replaced by the text  block. It affects only some emails but restarting computer or TB doesn't help - email that has been downloaded wrong will stay wrong in TB&nbsp;:)  </p><p>I copy part of the text from this ""block"".

I also mentioned that I am a cave-man when it comes to anything computer and am very skittish about making any changes as I don't how to straighten out any errors that might occur. He asked me where I installed Thunderbird from and the answer is that I don't know. It was an IT guy that did it many years ago. So I guess my questions are, if I've been using this version for years, do I need to or should I update it? If so, if I click on the latest stable version of Thunderbird, will that change anything on my computer, aside from getting the newer version of T-Bird?
