On the ad screen to donate.  This never happened until now.  It is annoying since it opens over Thunderbird.  How do I get it to stop?  I do use it as my default browser, but when I want it.  Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",mejacobie1

Now, when attempting to launch or use that previous profile in reinstalled 128.3 popup advises: ""You have launched an older version of Thunderbird."" ""A newer version of Thunderbird may have made changes to your profile which are no longer compatible with this older version.  Use this profile only with that newer version or create a new profile."" </p><p>Only options then available are ""Exit"" or ""Create New Profile."" TB 128.3 will recognize only a newly created generic profile, but not allow previous profile to be launched or set as default from Profile Manager. </p><p>Essentially, the options are: 1)  Use your previous profile, but only with the Beta 131 release 2)  Use the latest supported (128.3) release but only with a newly created profile, not yours. </p><p>I've seen this problem posted in several forms by people unknowingly on the ""release"" update channel who got the 131 release and can't implement their profile after downgrading to the esr release.   The recommendations I've found to address this problem seem to lead one to a circular return to the problem. </p><p>John C </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",curtiss3
