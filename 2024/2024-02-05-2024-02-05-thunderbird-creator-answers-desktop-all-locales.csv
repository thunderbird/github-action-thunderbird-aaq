Today I transferred some files from one mailbox (Mailbox A) to another (Mailbox B) and by the end some messages cannot be found in either Mailbox A nor B. On a separate issue, I seem to be missing messages that I thought were in Mailbox B previously. Unfortunately when I open the local Mailbox B file in a text editor, I also cannot see the messages I was expecting to find, so I don't think it's an .msf file corruption issue.  </p><p>Does anyone know where I could potentially recover these messages? I'm a bit distressed to think they are lost forever (my last backup of the local mail storage was unfortunately out of date) but I am guessing this is likely the case. Thank you. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",hatmatrix
