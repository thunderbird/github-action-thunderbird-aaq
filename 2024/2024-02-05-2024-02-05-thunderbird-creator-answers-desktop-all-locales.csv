Only one is in use at a time. There is one personal and three tied to 3 volunteer organizations I work with. A few days ago I began getting a Send Message Error window ( I assume generated by Windows) when I attempted to send a message from any of the accounts and thereafter I received a Thunderbird Unable  to connect to your IMAP server error message. </p><p>My ISP advises they are not restricting connection numbers and this is a Thunderbird issue. Nevertheless, following the Thunderbird Message instructions I reduced the number of cached connections under Advanced by half. This made no difference. There is no one with my ISP who will discuss Thunderbird or seems to know much about it and they want me to use their webmail, which sorely lacks the sophistication of Thunderbird. </p><p>Read all of the relevant messages I could locate on the Thunderbird site on the issue and tried most of the suggested solutions, to no avail. </p><p>During the solution efforts, all INBOX mail in my primary personal account disappeared, but the rest of the folders are OK and so are those in  the other accounts. It is in the ISP IMAP webmail folder. </p><p>But when I try to email my ISP I get the Unable to Connect to your IMAP server message or the Thunderbird error message. No outgoing message. </p><p>I did look at the Proflies link which I see references the ISP IMAP account. It shows 0 messages and 1.1 GB which I assume is the size of the INBOX file so assume there are messages and the 1.1 GB are the messages, safe but untransferable to Thunderbird. When I clik on Repair Folder the link attemps to go to the ISP IMAP account but the Thunderbird connection error message reappears shutting the process down. </p><p>When I just recently upgraded (32 bit)  to 115.7 from 115.2 a number, not all, of the folders under my personal account also disappeared (but didn't touch the other accounts). They remain on  the ISP webmail site (Zimbra). Could not find a way under Thunderbird how to reimport the missing folders from the ISP webmail account to Thunderbird so have been moving messages I need to save to the folders via the webmail site then reentering Thunderbird. </p><p>If this is unclear it's because I am so confused now that I frankly don't know where I am, way way above my pay grade! It appears I've done enough damage so quitting and looking for help. </p><p>Image of the two messages attached </p>",w7wll;davidsk;,true,false,false,";category:fix-problems;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/109.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 AtContent/94.5.4680.41;product:thunderbird",10,0,0,,,
