I had to set up an IMAP account for a friend with TB but I don't use them so I have limited working knowledge If I understand it correctly, only actions on the host account ('remote server') will effect what's displayed on TB. TB is simply a shadow of the data that's given it. As no one else seems to have definitively answered you yet, I'd suggest that TB is only displaying what it's being given by the Host. The reason I say that is because both accounts should be synced. A deletion in one place is a deletion in the other. If TB has deleted an email, it should be mirrored in the Host. So I'd look for a solution in the settings on the four Host accounts. I'm probably wrong but... ...the only other thing it could be, I guess, is if the emails are being archived? </p>",frisée,false,0,0

After reading lots of suggestions everyone was saying find the profile folder, copy it and replace on your new machine. But! copying the profile folder does not work, you need to copy the whole ""Thunderbird"" folder from your old machine and replace the Thunderbird folder on your new machine. On both Win10 and 11 it's in the same place. Also any mail you've downloaded onto your new system will download again so nothing is lost. </p><p>This is the easiest way to find it </p><pre>   1. ensure thunderbird is not running on old machine     2. enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key     3. this should open windows file explorer in Appdata\roaming folder     4. highlight the Thunderbird folder and copy to external media     5. ensure thunderbird is installed on second computer and NOT running     6. enter %appdata% in search window on task bar and press Enter key     7. you should be in Appdata\roaming folder , copy&amp;paste the exported Thunderbird folder there. This may prompt to overwrite an existing folder of same name. allow it     8. start thunderbird and all should be there  </pre> <p>This process copies everything that is in the profile.

However, they have also altered what password to use and what email address can use the SMTP. Read on: </p><p><strong>4</strong>. Your microsoft account and your hotmail/outlook/msn/live account and any other account using outlook server all need to have the same password. So all your microsoft accounts need to be using same password.

Once all your accounts are using same password..... </p><p><strong>5.</strong> In microsoft account accessed via a browser If you have more email addresses or hotmail addresses etc , microsoft now regard one is 'primary' and all others are alias to the account. This is not a problem when it comes to receiving mail, but can be an issues when you want to send. When it comes to 'sending' - that is smtp in  Thunderbird - it can only send using the 'primary' email address.  You can choose what you want to be set as 'primary', but whatever email address you set up as 'primary' - only that email address can be used for SMTP in all imap accounts. So if you want to send using hotmail email address then make sure it is set up as the primary email address. But then if you have an <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account as well, it will only be able to send using the hotmail primary email address. So choose the email address which you want to set up as 'primary'. </p><p>'<em>6</em>.
