In the past, I was able to check a box on the settings for ""download messages from the server"", whereupon they would reside on my local HD. That is what I want to do, I don't need to access them remotely once I've viewed them from my home office. Once they're downloaded I don't care what the server keeps, since I already have my copy.  However, I do not see any such setting in the current version. Is there is such a thing, or can I find and download an older copy that does have it? And if not, any other program that you'd recommend that would allow this? </p>",service195,false,0,0
