These woulds require using on every single outbound email, which would be too prohibitive for regular use. However, I think it <strong>could</strong> be really useful to allow custom injection of additional content into the HTML &lt;head&gt; section on outbound emails. </p><p>When writing html emails that are generated out of apps, this allows for all sorts of things that standard email clients do not provide for. Also, it seems a very, very easy feature to implement, given that it only requires a string variable be added to the existing &lt;head&gt; generation code, that can then be accessed and edited through the Config Editor... </p><p>Is there a place for submitting feature requests, or is this something I would need to implement in a custom add-on if I wanted to see it happen? </p><p>Much appreciated! </p>",stevenstromer,false,0,0
