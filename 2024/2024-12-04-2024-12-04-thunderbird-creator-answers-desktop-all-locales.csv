Is this doable with Thunderbird?  It would also be helpful to be able to turn off inheritance in a child folder if desired. </p><p>Thank you Steven Wheeler </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",graygeek

I expect that hovering the mouse over the dividers between the various panes will change the pointer type and let me push the dividing lines up and down, or side to side. That just doesn't happen. </p><p>Actually, the problem is not limited to the classic view. Resizing anything has just quit working in any and all viewing layouts offered by Thunderbird. </p><p>There are some related threads here where people use custom CSS to work around limitations on what proportions can eventually be chosen. That's not my problem. I cannot make _any changes at all_. In the classic view, the pane in which the message text appears is uncomfortably small, but I can see several dozen message subject lines. </p><p>The behaviour is the same when I start Thunderbird in safe mode. Are there other non-destructive things worth trying? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",mathlover
