On my pc, lately, when I move an email from my Thunderbird Inbox to a folder, the message does 'go' from my Inbox, but it does not re-appear in the folder. In fact, the message seems to disappear!  However, the message tally count for that folder indicates that the message should be there, but it isn't visible.  It's obviously been happening for a while but I don't know when it will have started. In the attached image, the folder 'Chatham, Cape Cod' shows that it should have 10 messages in it, but you'll see that the folder is empty, no messages are showing. In fact, all of the 3 folders 1) Boston, 2) Chatham, Cape Cod, and 3) Virgin Atlantic show that they have messages in them, but on opening each folder, each of those folders is empty. I should add that, on my phone or ipad, when I view my folders, all of the messages are visible. It is just on my PC that the messages are not visible. I've uninstalled Thunderbird and reinstalled it, but that didn't help. And I don't know what else to do! I'd be so grateful for help as I'm not techy and, as I work mainly from my PC, it's proving to be difficult not having all of my messages visible in their folders on my PC.

I'm currently using v.115.5.0 (64 bit) on Ubuntu 22.04. </p><p>2 PROBLEMS... </p><p>1. The setting of  view / sort / threaded  for INBOX ONLY seems to now be volatile (in that it switches itself on, and when turned back off goes back to ""on"" at the start of the next session... BUT also does this in real time as mail comes down: I watched mail coming in (maybe 50 messages, took a good minute or so to do this) and as it came in the presentation (right pane) changed from ""unthreaded"" to ""threaded"". </p><p>2. The global setting of  view / sort / threaded  switched itself on all by itself, bit annoying because at first I thought all sorts of messages had been deleted... </p><p>I can change to ""unthreaded"" on a mailbox by mailbox basis except that I have 14,000-odd mailboxes. </p><p>I have changed the global settings using: Edit / settings;  scroll down, clock on ""config editor"" button Edit ""mailnews.default"" Set: mailnews.default_news_sort_order 1 (ascending) mailnews.default_news_sort_type 18 (sort on date) mailnews.default_sort_order 1 (ascending) mailnews.default_sort_type 18 (sort on date) </p><p>except that although mailnews.default_news_sort_type was set to 22 (threaded) and I have changed it to 18 on a stable basis (it stays at 18) I never use news and so the value for mailnews.default_sort_type was 18 all along.. and the global sort setting (found by looking at a random mailbox) is still set to ""threaded"" - as if ""mailnews.default_sort_type"" is not being read. Also no manual words on what these settings mean, as far as I can tell. </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1629039;1629051;1629054;,nick.theboatman
