The installation is the same one I've had for awhile, with two email accounts in it, one being GMail.   </p><p>Today I changed my Google password.  I expected Thunderbird to prompt me when the old password failed; and it did, except the window it showed me was entirely blank, except for a URL bar at the top which was to Google's domain.   </p><p>I tried it several times, same result.  I closed Thunderbird and restarted.  This time the window prompting me about the GMail connection had stuff in it, but it showed a Thunderbird logo and seemed to want me to ""log into Thunderbird"" or something (not Google).  I think I clicked a button to advance through that screen and something else went wrong, IIRC.   </p><p>I decided to just delete the GMail account and rebuild it from scratch.
