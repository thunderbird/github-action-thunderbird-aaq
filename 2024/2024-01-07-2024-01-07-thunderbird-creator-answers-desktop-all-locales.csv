I created a new profile to try renaming and replacing the files, but I noticed that folder for the new profile didn't appear in AppData locations. I tried to open them via 'about:profiles' and I received an error, I also tried to rename my old profile to new name I found there - but nothing helped.  As my last attempt I tried to import files via Import Tool, but after choosing the correct folder, Thunderbird shows an error (more details are supposed to be in error console which I have no access to, as the files don't exist physically in AppData location). Export also failed as the file size exceeds 2 GB. </p><p>Is it somehow possible to successfully copy the profile to the version from MS Store?
