I closed Thunderbird and restarted.  This time the window prompting me about the GMail connection had stuff in it, but it showed a Thunderbird logo and seemed to want me to ""log into Thunderbird"" or something (not Google).

Csatoltam egy képet a problémáról. Az egyik informatikus ismerős szerint, valami kódolási hiba lehet. Nem a levelekkel van a hiba, mert szolgáltatónk által biztosított webmail felületen normálisan jelennek meg a levelek. Sajnos nem találtam meg milyen beállításon kellene változtatni.

I created a new profile to try renaming and replacing the files, but I noticed that folder for the new profile didn't appear in AppData locations. I tried to open them via 'about:profiles' and I received an error, I also tried to rename my old profile to new name I found there - but nothing helped.  As my last attempt I tried to import files via Import Tool, but after choosing the correct folder, Thunderbird shows an error (more details are supposed to be in error console which I have no access to, as the files don't exist physically in AppData location). Export also failed as the file size exceeds 2 GB. </p><p>Is it somehow possible to successfully copy the profile to the version from MS Store? I'm sure that downloading installation file from Mozilla site would help, as I've been copying profiles many times before this way, but here I need to use MS Store as a single point of installations. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1628816;1628831;1628832;,amon.re89
