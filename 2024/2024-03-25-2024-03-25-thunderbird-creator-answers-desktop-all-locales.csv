I have an mbox file with approximately 1200 emails that I need to import into my Gmail account. I've been following the process of importing the mbox file into a local folder on my Mac and then moving that folder to my Gmail account within Thunderbird. However, I'm consistently running into a problem where only 39 of those emails get imported into Gmail, no matter how many times I attempt the process. </p><p>Here are the steps I've followed based on instructions I found online: 1. I used the Import/Export Tools NG to import the mbox file into a local folder within Thunderbird. 2. After the import appears successful, with all emails visible in the local folder, I then drag and drop that folder into my Gmail account within Thunderbird. 3. The process begins, but only 39 emails are transferred to the Gmail folder. The rest seem to be ignored or fail to import. </p><p>Some additional information that might be helpful: - I'm using Thunderbird on a Mac. - The mbox file contains about 1200 emails. - I've tried repeating the process multiple times, always with the same result of only 39 emails being imported. - There don't seem to be any error messages; the process just stops after 39 emails. </p><p>I'm at a bit of a loss on how to proceed and would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or solutions you might have. Could this issue be related to the size of the mbox file, a limitation within Gmail, or perhaps something I'm missing in the Import/Export process? Any help or guidance would be immensely appreciated. </p><p>Thank you very much for your time and assistance. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1644102;,grishchenkom

I thought I had done things right, but apparently I messed up somewhere. I copied the Thunderbird Profile from my old machine and used it to transfer everything to my new machine after I downloaded and setup the latest version of Thunderbird on it. It kind of worked. The good news is that it doesn't appear that I lost anything, however I now have two sets of folders. At the top of the window on the left is my email address, with Inbox, Draft, Sent, Junk and Trash folders under it. This ""new"" Inbox is where any new emails arrive. However, under that it says Local Folders, which has Junk, Trash, Outbox and then another Local folders, which also has an Inbox folder with all of the many sub-folders where I had stored all of my emails for the last five years, by topic. I would like to have just one Inbox, where I get my emails, and then have all of my old topic folders under that, the way it used to be. Somehow I now have two sets of Inbox folders. Thanks for any help you can provide. It's a bit confusing to me. Dave </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",dk_salerno
