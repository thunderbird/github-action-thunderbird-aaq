De instellingen voor ontvangen van mail lukken wel, maar die voor het versturen gaan niet. Zij vragen om poort 587 met SSL/TLS. Daar gaat het mis. Toen kreeg ik van hen het advies om het mailaccount te verwijderen en opnieuw in te stellen. Dat heb ik gedaan maar nu blijkt dat in Thunderbird een soort automatisme zit. Bij intypen van poort 587 springt de verbindingsbeveiliging automatisch naar STARTTLS en als ik daar kies voor SSL/TLS springt de poort automatisch naar 465. Dus nu zit ik helemaal zonder mail van mijn website omdat Thunderbird de instellingen niet kan vinden. En ik dus geen mailadres kan installeren. Wie weet wat ik kan doen? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,nl,1648294;1648296;1648300;1648309;1648333;1648335;1648338;,rian7jo

When I have missed reminders (e.g. a task set for today at 8am and it is now 9am), the task is visible in the reminder window that pops up every time a reminder is active. This is fine. But if there is a past reminder (not resolved), every time I add a new task (or edit a past task) to the calendar, the pop-up reminder window opens and comes to the front. Let me describe the example: I missed (knowingly) a reminder at 8AM. Now, at 9 AM I need to add 3 new tasks to the Calendar. After setting (or copying, editing) each new task, the pop-up reminder window is focused on the front. Can I change this behavior so that the reminder window only pop up when the reminder is due and not in the case a new task is set up or old one edited? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1648304;,orwel
