I have been able to do most of my emails, but my husband had yahoo tech help him and one of his emails will not download to the thunderbird account. The tech did a pop.mail.yahoo with this one but created new imap accounts with the other two. I tried to create a new account but it says Incoming server aleady exists. So I deleted the account, shut down Thunderbird and brought it up and tried again. I got the same message. </p><p>I am new extremely tech savvy but know a little more than my husband. If someone could please help walk me through this, I would appreciate it. Thank you. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",celiat

Now; when I log in to TB, the start page flickers on the screen for a fraction of a second, then another program screen takes its place and cannot be changed. No way I could find to get to another screen or back to the start page. The only option is to exit the program, or use the  screen that came up, if that's the one you actually wanted, pure luck. The screens that came up included input, calendar, and scam. I downloaded and reinstalled TB, re booted computer, no change. Need help very much. Thanks in advance. Sherm Problem went a way with no help from me. Maybe I was the problem. Regards, Sherm </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",sherm9227

Screenshop attached of part of folder tree -  it happens to each and every sub-folder in the account(s). Sometimes it's just on one IMAP account that I have defined, sometimes more than one. Some points that might help (or not): </p> <ul><li> The status line says that it is downloading messages, even though I've told it to only download headers </li><li> This happens on more than one installation of Thunderbird on different machines (home deskside and laptop), all on Windows 10. I don't have access to Linux but might try it on Linux on a Chromebook. I've avoided Windows11 so far.  </li><li> no way to reproduce this on demand; just random </li><li> Persists at random after a clean installation of TBird with completely new profiles </li><li> Takes ages to close all folders - I think I've seen elsewhere that an option to collapse all folders by, for example, a right-click on the top-level folder and an option in the context menu, would be very useful </li><li> happens to different IMAP hosts - my personal accounts are on UK2, but also affect gmail and IONOS-hosted accounts </li><li> is an issue with many previous versions - certainly since Supernova was released, maybe earlier </li></ul> <p>Much as I like the TBird interface, I can't continue to live with this - I think it's back to Outlook (I have a 365 account so thiis is the full-fat Outlook) or maybe invest in an emClient license, where their limited free version seems robust and has a decent interface. Might also look at the email client in the Vivaldi browser. </p><p>Any advice that might help me stay on TBird would be welcome.

It <strong>WAS </strong>downloaded, I was looking at it two days ago! This has been a common problem in Thunderbird for me for several years now. Messages are downloaded, read, I go offline, they are still there ok, then a few days later they mysteriously say ""The Body of this message has not been downloaded for offline use"".  </p><p>Fragments of the message bodies appear in search results, even at the same time as trying to read the messages gives me ""The Body of this message has not been downloaded for offline use."" It's in there somewhere, I can even find the entire message body by searching the data files in the profile folder, but Thunderbird THINKS it's not downloaded. </p><p>I need to work offline a lot, and any help would be very much appreciated. </p><p>Thank you for your time. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",br.dominic

It happily shows our current emails inboxes and the contents. However it is vital that I can still access old emails that have been archived on the old pc 'locally'. I have these saved in year folders, 2022, 2023 etc. The sheer size of these archives is causing me a headache, as I cannot see how to move them easily; 2023 alone is nearly 5GB! To give it some context, we are an engraving company and as part of the process we send and receive artwork files, hence the size of the folder. Customers return to us year on year and expect us to be able to recall what they used previously, or remember an email conversation of previous years. The minimum I need to keep is the 2023 email, but 2022 would be useful too. I have tried looking on Youtube, but all the videos there seem to be about moving the the 'live' emails rather than those than the archived folders saved on the pc. Any help on how to achieve this would be appreciated please. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1641408;,ClassyGlass
