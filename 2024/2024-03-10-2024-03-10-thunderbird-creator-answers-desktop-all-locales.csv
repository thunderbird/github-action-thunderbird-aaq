I have been able to do most of my emails, but my husband had yahoo tech help him and one of his emails will not download to the thunderbird account. The tech did a pop.mail.yahoo with this one but created new imap accounts with the other two. I tried to create a new account but it says Incoming server aleady exists. So I deleted the account, shut down Thunderbird and brought it up and tried again. I got the same message. </p><p>I am new extremely tech savvy but know a little more than my husband. If someone could please help walk me through this, I would appreciate it. Thank you. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",celiat

Now; when I log in to TB, the start page flickers on the screen for a fraction of a second, then another program screen takes its place and cannot be changed. No way I could find to get to another screen or back to the start page. The only option is to exit the program, or use the  screen that came up, if that's the one you actually wanted, pure luck. The screens that came up included input, calendar, and scam. I downloaded and reinstalled TB, re booted computer, no change. Need help very much. Thanks in advance. Sherm Problem went a way with no help from me. Maybe I was the problem. Regards, Sherm </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",sherm9227
