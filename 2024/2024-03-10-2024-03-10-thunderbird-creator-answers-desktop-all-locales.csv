No way I could find to get to another screen or back to the start page. The only option is to exit the program, or use the  screen that came up, if that's the one you actually wanted, pure luck. The screens that came up included input, calendar, and scam. I downloaded and reinstalled TB, re booted computer, no change. Need help very much. Thanks in advance.

It happily shows our current emails inboxes and the contents. However it is vital that I can still access old emails that have been archived on the old pc 'locally'. I have these saved in year folders, 2022, 2023 etc. The sheer size of these archives is causing me a headache, as I cannot see how to move them easily; 2023 alone is nearly 5GB! To give it some context, we are an engraving company and as part of the process we send and receive artwork files, hence the size of the folder. Customers return to us year on year and expect us to be able to recall what they used previously, or remember an email conversation of previous years. The minimum I need to keep is the 2023 email, but 2022 would be useful too. I have tried looking on Youtube, but all the videos there seem to be about moving the the 'live' emails rather than those than the archived folders saved on the pc. Any help on how to achieve this would be appreciated please. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1641408;1641410;1641416;1641424;,ClassyGlass
