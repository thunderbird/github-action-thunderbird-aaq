On copying the messages, you could highlight the folder and click 'copy to' if only a few messages. If many, I recommend creating a filter to copy (not move) the messages. When done, spot check that the messages are intact. The challenge is that IMAP was not designed for a large number of uploads. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
