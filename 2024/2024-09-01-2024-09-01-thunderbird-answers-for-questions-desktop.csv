It came from a different mailing list server, not Gmail.  I sent myself this email from Gmail, with a PDF attachment as before, and in both cases, the Subject line and body, together with the document, were all in Base64 encoding. </p><p>The mail that I sent from Gmail was received with the Greek letters DISPLAYED in Thunderbird. </p><p>It is a limitation of the mailing list server that causes the question marks to appear in the text, and that is all in several hundreds of kilobytes of Base64 encoding.  In the More… menu, I saw where I can ""repair"" the encoding guesswork.  That changed nothing.  The plain English and the middle dots I typed into my document all look as I sent them. </p><p>This issue is not with Thunderbird.  The accelerator, brake and gearshift work just fine—ahh, not THAT Thunderbird! &nbsp;:) </p><p>I will mark this issue solved. </p>",FirefoxinUbuntu,false,0,0
