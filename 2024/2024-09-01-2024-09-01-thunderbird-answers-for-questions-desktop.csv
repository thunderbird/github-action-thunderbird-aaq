Waarschijnlijk is het oude Thunderbird-profiel nog wel aanwezig op het systeem met alle gegevens. In dit artikel <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/nl/kb/profielen-waar-thunderbird-gebruikersgegevens-bewaart"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/nl/kb/profielen-waar-thunderbird-gebruikersgegevens-bewaart</a>, staat waar normaal profielen zijn te vinden. Kijk even rond op het systeem voor het oude profiel. Met de profielbeheerder is dat wellicht te herstellen: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/nl/kb/profielbeheerder-thunderbird-profielen-aanmaken-en#thunderbird:linux:tb115"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/nl/kb/profielbeheerder-thunderbird-profielen-aanmaken-en#thunderbird:linux:tb115</a>. </p>",Mozilla-assistent,false,0,0

Ik kom op die manier niet verder helaas. Als ik in de map .thunderbird kijk dan staan daarin vier submappen en twee losse bestanden: - MAP: crash reports (47 items) - MAP: h4cz7ily.default (8 items) - MAP: Pending Pings (0 items) - MAP: sh0qvjbi.default (330 items) - installs.ini - profiles.ini </p><p>Als ik op installs.ini klik dan krijg ik het volgende te zien: </p><p>[FDC34C9F024745EB] Default=sh0qvjbi.default </p><p>Als ik op het profiles.ini bestand klik dan krijg ik het volgende te zien: </p><p>[InstallFDC34C9F024745EB] Default=sh0qvjbi.default </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=sh0qvjbi.default Default=1 </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>De vraag is of ik ergens in deze mappen mijn mailboxen kan terugvinden. Ik heb alleen geen idee hoe ik dat zou moeten aanpakken. Suggesties? </p><p>Alvast reuze bedankt voor het meedenken, Erik. </p>",erik103,false,0,0

Ik heb niet meer iets bruikbaars op de huidige computer kunnen vinden. Ik heb het opgegeven en ben inmiddels maar helemaal opnieuw begonnen. Wel een heel gedoe, want ik moet veel kennissen opnieuw naar hun mailadres vragen en een flink stuk correspondentie met een groep klanten ben ik kwijt. Ook ben ik nu weer druk om al mijn mailfilters opnieuw in te richten en zo. Dat was een harde leerschool; ik zal in het vervolg bij updates echt alles eerst op mijn externe harddrive backuppen. </p><p>En ik had voor de update een alias die ik voor zakelijke doeleinden gebruikte. Nu krijg ik die niet meer aan de praat, omdat ik bij verzenden steeds een foutmelding krijg: ""Er is een fout opgetreden bij het verzenden van e-mail. De mailserver antwoordde: Your FROM address ( info@xxxx.com , ""Erik Wannee (xxxx)"" &lt;info@xxxx.com&gt; ) must match your authenticated email user (erik@xxxxxx.nl ).. Controleer het bericht en probeer het opnieuw."" Ik weet niet hoe ik dat voor elkaar krijg. In het verleden had ik nooit een dergelijke foutmelding gehad en ik had wel meer aliassen aangemaakt. </p>",erik103,false,0,0

Wellicht is op die manier het oude profiel nog te achterhalen. Als deze is gevonden, kunt u deze aan profiles.ini toevoegen en daarna met de profielbeheerder standaard maken (als deze nog werkt uiteraard). </p>",markh2,false,0,0

Now you have&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> Selected 'Server Settings' for pop account </li><li> Clicked  on 'Advanced' button </li><li> Selected 'Inbox for this servers account'  </li><li> clicked on OK </li></ul> <p>In the Folder Pane, you now see each pop account as a separate set of folders and all new incoming mail is using those folders. But all the old mail is still in 'Local Folders', however it is very incomplete. Meaning you now had a good set of emails on Laptop but not on Desktop. </p><p>Then you found another profile - <em><strong>There was an unused Profile that had all of the Local Folder folders in it.</strong></em> </p><p>This sounds like you have created a new profile for the pop accounts and set them up as separate accounts. </p><p>OK- </p><p>So at this point please confirm the following to ensure I've got this correct. The Desktop is set up for each account to use it's own folders. Some Local Folders emails but it is incomplete. It also has an old original profile which you believe to have a load of old emails in Local Folders. </p><p>It sounds like the laptop is still correct -  In Folder Pane there is only 'Local Folders'. It still has all the pop accounts using 'Local Folders' and you can see all the emails. </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Does the laptop have everything correct? if yes then you need to get a proper copy of whatever is on the laptop and put it on the desktop, </p><p><br> First make sure you are using the same identical version of Thunderbird on both Laptop and Desktop. This is important because different versions may have a different file format etc and profiles use a dedicated profile for version.  </p><p>Then make sure the Firewall on both Laptop and Desktop has Thunderbird set up as an allowed program. The Firewall may the computer default or controlled by an Anti-Virus program which you installed. This ensures the Firewall will not block anything. </p><p>If you want everything you see on LAPTOP to be on DESKTOP do the following. I've added an image below as a guide to help you locate correct location. </p><p>I'm assuming you use 'User Accounts' on Desktop and Laptop and that everything is stored in the default locations. </p><p><strong>On LAPTOP</strong> Exit Thunderbird if it's running </p><p>Use Windows search: </p> <ul><li> type %Appdata% </li><li> select %Appdata% file folder </li><li> Select 'Roaming' </li><li> Copy the 'Thunderbird' folder to an external drive. </li></ul> <p><strong>On Desktop:</strong> Exit Thunderbird if it's running </p><p>Use Windows search: </p> <ul><li> type %Appdata% </li><li> select %Appdata% file folder </li><li> Select 'Roaming' </li><li> '<strong>Move'</strong> the 'Thunderbird' folder because you are going to replace it. </li></ul> <p>I suggest 'Move' to your desktop as a temporary location because you said it contains old emails in Local Folders. Those emails may be on the laptop anyway so could end up being copied over. You can always delete it later on if all emails area ok. </p> <ul><li> Paste the copied from laptop  'Thunderbird' folder from external drive into the 'Roaming' folder. </li></ul> <p>Start Thunderbird on Desktop and it will look identical to Thuderbird on Laptop. </p><p>I'm not sure how you have been copying between Desktop and Laptop in the past but the instructions I've given are the correct and only way to ensure both are identical. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
