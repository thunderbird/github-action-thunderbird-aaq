I had TB 115 something (it's uninstalled so not available to see). I run Firefox without issues. TB went completely haywire, all email accounts disappeared, nothing worked (second time this year) but recovering was proving too difficult and I'd already spent a whole day on it. I decided to uninstall and install a fresh copy.  First I copied the single profile to an external drive. Then I uninstalled TB. Then I ran Ccleaner to tidy up the remaining TB cache and other remnants, also cleaned the registry. I downloaded a new copy from Mozilla's site, ran the install file, The install dialog box offers the same install location as the previous location, same user. Upon clicking install, the dialog box disappears and nothing happens. I've tried this more than ten times now, including fresh downloads from Mozilla. The dialog box offers an alternative user as Administrator but that won't work because I don't actually have the  administrator account set up with a password, and TB demands the password. I do not want to open a new user account just for TB. Any suggestions for working round this will be gratefully received. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1654789;1654806;,jfdi

No, I have no older version of TB (why did not one ask before?). My program (since you failed to check) is up to date (see attached) </p><p>2. No, again, there is no HTML option to paste (See screen shot proof attached yet again– and refuted and shown again)  . 3. I have no TB add-on’s at all (why did no one bother to even inquire)?   </p><p>So the demonstrable solution to a problem Mozilla support can not solve (after multiple answers are PROVED AND DOCUMENTED as wrong) is to respond with self-righteous and rather juvenile tantrum to block and punish the dissenter who had the temerity to prove the advice of the ‘experts’ was  wrong.  This is less the behavior a forum staffed by adults and professionals trying to solve problem than a church of true believers intolerant of any dissent against dogma.  </p><p>In response to To NoahSUMO his retaliatory display of intolerance follows and responses to his “No reply” reply are in ALL CAPS to distinguish. If Mozilla executives support this kind of support then they have no reason to complain they command 0.0% of the market share.    </p><p>“I'm sorry, I'm afraid I'm going to have to close your question. </p><p>“There are many times in support where not every mysterious glitch or bug can be determined quickly &amp; easily. Sometimes more time, testing &amp; troubleshooting is needed to learn what is causing the issue. </p><p>“But rather than offer you more steps to try then watch you return, get defensive &amp; berate others saying you've already tried that and did we understand the question and so on &amp; so forth, I'm just going to close this question &amp; leave you with these final thoughts (of which may anger you, simply for trying to help you troubleshoot your problem). </p><p>The main problem: “‘Paste as HTML: Instead of directly pasting the text, try pasting it as HTML. You can do this by right-clicking in the email body and selecting ""Paste as HTML"" or by using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V in some applications). This should retain the formatting, including hyperlinks.’”   </p><p>FALSE. AGAIN, THAT OPTION DOES NOT EXIST. SEE ATTACHED.   </p><p>“Observations: Your Thunderbird version is unknown. For all we know, you could be using a older version of TB which is missing the ""Paste as HTML"" option from the right-click context menu. “ </p><p>FALSE: MY TB PROGRAM IS NOT “UNKNOWN”. AND YOU NEVER EVEN CHECKED. IT IS KNOWN, VERIFIED, AND THE MOST CURRENT VERISON. (SEE ATTACHED.)   </p><p>“You could have a addon installed that is breaking the context menu &amp; hiding the ""Paste as HTML"" choice from you.” </p><p>THERE  ARE NO TB ADD-ONS. NEITHER YOU NO ANYONE ELSE EVEN ASKED. NOW YOU RELY ON AN EXCUSE NO ONE INQUIRED INTO? NICE. </p><p>“You would need to disable ALL your addons in Thunderbird, restart the program then test again to see if the option was returned to the context menu. You might angrily retort you don't have any addons installed. Are you sure? You better check. If confirmed no addons are installed, move on to the next troubleshooting idea. </p><p>“YOU BETTER”?! WOW. NICE. NO, THERE ARE NO ADD ONS. AND IF YOU (OR YOUR COLLEAGUES) WERE TRULY INTERESTED SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE THE ISSUE THEN WHY DO YOU ONLY MENTION IT NOW AND NOT BOTHER TO TELL HOW TO DO THAT BUT BLOCK RELY? NO, THERE ARE NO ADD ONS. (SEE ATTACHED)  </p><p>“Could your Thunderbird profile be broken somehow? Is it very old profile &amp; a settings file got damaged thus hiding this option? Or again, are you using a very old version of Thunderbird where this option is not present?” </p><p>“COULD”? HOW WOULD I KNOW? WHY DO YOU ONLY ASK NOW AND THEN RETALIATE BY BLOCKING ANY RESPONSE? RATHER TELLING. THIS SPECULATION AND THREATENING “YOU BETTER” ATTITUDE DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR LACK OF INTEREST IN PROBLEM-SOLVING WHERE THE DEFECTS LIE SOLELY WITH YOUR PRODUCT AND YOUR AGENTS’ INABILITY TO REMEDY THE DEFECT OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE DOCUMENTED PROOF OF FACTS.  </p><p>“Finally, no support forum anywhere on Earth can guarantee your problem will be solved. It takes lots of patience, lots of testing, lots of troubleshooting and lots of time. Sometimes if you work thru a premade list of common fixes it can help you narrow down the problem faster. If a support forum can't solve your issue, we are never happy about it &amp; continue to think about it in the future in case we finally find the obscure resolution to your problem. Endlessly talking about the problem can not magically produce a solution. Real troubleshooting work must be done.” </p><p>THANKS BUT IF MOZILLA’S AGENTS CANNOT RESOLVE SO SIMPLE AN ISSUE WHEN THEIR OWN STATEMENTS ARE PROVEN FALSE, THEN AFTER THEY FAILED TO MENTION ANY OF THE ISSUES YOU NOW TOSS OVER, AND AFTER RETALIATING AGASNT A USER WHOSE VALUABLE TIME THEY HAVE WASTED, IF YOU AND THEY ARE NOT COMPETENT TO SOLVE SO SIMPLE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR PRODUCT BUT CAN ONLY RETALIATE THEN NEITHER THIS PRODUCT NOR ITS AGENTS ARE FIT FOR PURPOSE. 0.0% IS EARNED AND YOUR MARKET SHARE IS QUANTUM MERUIT.   </p><p>FINALLY, IF YOU AND MOZILLA’S TB AGENTS CANNOT TOLERATE, BUT MUST RETALIATE AGASNT, A USER WHOM YOU SELF-RIGHTEOUSLY CENSOR AND SILENCE FOR CALLING-OUT AND DOCUMENTING YOUR DEFECTS AND ERRONEOUS STATEMENTS OF FACT, THEN, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU HAVE NO BUSINESSES SERVING THE PUBLIC AND ARE NOT AN ASSET TO MOZILLA BUT A LIABILITY.     </p><p>“Even something like 3rd party programs have been known to inject themselves in Firefox &amp; Thunderbird causing maddening issues that take us a long time to finally find out they were the cause.” </p><p>THERE ARE NO “THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS” INJECTING THE THEMSELVES INTO FIREFOX. THIS IS ALL MOZILLA PRODUCT. STOP BLAMING OTHERS AN ESCHEWING CULPABILITY FOR YOUR PRODUCT DEFECTS AND INABILITY TO FIX THEM WITHOUT WASTING OTHERS’ VALUABLE TIME.  </p><p>YOU (TB AND MOZILLA) ARE NOT THE ONLY PLAYERS IN THE FIELD.

I wish you the best of luck, I truly do. </p><p>“Thanks to everyone who offered their ideas to fix the solution here. I really appreciate your patience in dealing with issues like this.” </p><p>IN CLOSING, PLEASE DO NOT DELIVER TB USERS DISINGENUOUS LECTURES ABOUT ‘PATIENCE’ WHEN YOU DEMONSTRATE DISPARITY BETWEEN YOUR OWN WORDS ACTIONS.  </p><p>PATIENCE? WHEN RETALIATION, CENSORSHIP, AND SILENCING OF DISSENT, ARE YOUR RESPONSES TO YOUR CUSTOMERS’S COMPLAINTS ABOUT YOUR INABILITY TO SOLVE SIMPLE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR PRODUCT DEFECTS THEN I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINES AND BANKRUPTCY COURTS.  </p><p>YOU TELL ON YOURSELF HERE AND DEMONSTRATE PRECISELY WHY THUNDERBIRD NOW COMMANDS A WHOPPING 0.0% OF THE MARKET SHARE AT THE BOTTOM WITH RANK OF #21.
