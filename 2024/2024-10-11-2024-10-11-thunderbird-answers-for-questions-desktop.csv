If so, there is a file named popstate.dat in the profile folder that keeps track of last downloaded message to prevent what you are describing. Now, if some process is running (antivirus?) that is preventing thunderbird from saving that file, then it never updates and keeps downloading the same messages. If you check in profile folder, in the Mail folder for the account, you will see the file.  To get there:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open folder', exit thunderbird.  You are now in the profile.

When you delete the account, it appears deleted because thunderbird is hold the deletion in memory, to be updated at shutdown. But if prevented from updating the prefs.js file, on restart, it reloads the file and the account displays again. The same explanation applies to the message view layout. The challenge is finding the culprit, maybe an antivirus?  If you browse profile outside of thunderbird in windows file explorer, you might see multiple copies of prefs.js, such as prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js, etc.  If so, I would delete all versions except the one with highest number, and then rename that one to prefs.js and restart thunderbird. My guess is the deleted account will now be gone. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
