I ask because imap offers many options, you can choose some folders to download full copies and others to only download headers and for any folder set up to download full copies, settings can determine whether only X number of days is fully downloaded and all the rest are headers only. Issues may occur if you are not uploading a full email. </p><p>Also...

What has changed over the years is that Thunderbird will create an IMAP account is possible now where years ago it preferred POP.  So your last created account was probably IMAP.  But it does not really matter. </p><p>Do you have an antivirus product other than defender?  There have been a lot of reports here in recent weeks about Kaspersky and Norton.  But they appear to take it in turns as to which antivirus product blocks mail.  None that scan mail are really exempt.

If so, there is a file named popstate.dat in the profile folder that keeps track of last downloaded message to prevent what you are describing. Now, if some process is running (antivirus?) that is preventing thunderbird from saving that file, then it never updates and keeps downloading the same messages. If you check in profile folder, in the Mail folder for the account, you will see the file.  To get there:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open folder', exit thunderbird.  You are now in the profile.

You'd need to backup your entire email archive on Gmail as long as the the account is available. Once you lost access to your workspace account it's too late. I'd download a copy of all messages on the server to your Local Folders account. You'd have to manually re-create any folder structure you may have underneath Local Folders. Download messages for each folder in smaller batches, not everything at once. Email servers don't like mass transactions, and may limit the amount of data you are allowed to transfer within a certain time frame. Depending on the size of your email archive this may be a somewhat tedious process, and it won't be in one step either. </p><p>Once you got a local copy of all your messages make sure to create a full backup of your Thunderbird profile. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile</a> </p><p>Having said that, you should create profile backups regardless on a regular basis. </p><p>You don't need to download message copies from All Mail, unless there are messages in All Mail which have no other label, i.e. are in no other folder. </p><p>Alternatively you can download your entire message archive from Gmail outside of Thunderbird.

When you delete the account, it appears deleted because thunderbird is hold the deletion in memory, to be updated at shutdown. But if prevented from updating the prefs.js file, on restart, it reloads the file and the account displays again. The same explanation applies to the message view layout. The challenge is finding the culprit, maybe an antivirus?  If you browse profile outside of thunderbird in windows file explorer, you might see multiple copies of prefs.js, such as prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js, etc.  If so, I would delete all versions except the one with highest number, and then rename that one to prefs.js and restart thunderbird.

If the Title bar is not enabled then on far right it will display the 3 icons for minimise, maximise/restore and close. </li><li> The 'Menu Bar' toolbar has this: 'File, Edit, View, Go, Message, Events &amp; Tasks, Tools, Help </li><li> The 'Folder Pane' is normally on far left. It contains the mail account name folder and it's own set of personal folders such as Inbox. </li><li> The 'Message List' also known as 'Threads Pane' is where you see the list of emails. The old view is called 'Table View' and it allows one line per email and it has columns such as threads,starred,attachments, From, Subject,Date, etc. The new additional view is called 'Cards View' and the list of emails now uses 3 lines per email and there are no columns. </li><li> The 'Message Pane' is the area where you read the email you have opened. </li><li> At the top of the 'Message Pane' is where you see all the headers for the email you have opened and that area is the 'Message Header area and it will contain some buttons Reply, Forward, Archive, Junk, Delete, 'More'  </li><li> The 'Status Bar' is located at the bottom and on far left there is the offline/online icon -and on far right is the 'Today Pane' enable link. The status will show info such as connecting to server, download data and compacting data when those actions occur. </li><li> On very far left is the 'Spaces Toolbar' - at the top it has shortcut icons to  Mail, Address Book,Calendar, Tasks, Chat and at the bottom 'Settings' and the enable/disable view of Spaces toolbar icon. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
