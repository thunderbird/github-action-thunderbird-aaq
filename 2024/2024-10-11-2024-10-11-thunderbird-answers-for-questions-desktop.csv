Windows OS exe came from the official site thunderbird version 115.13.0 (32-bit) (I guess I should switch to x64, I wonder if that's easy?) troubleshooting mode, without disabling add ins, fixes the issues I am having this issue when creating a new email, using the To: dropdown list. In troubleshooting mode the grey banding is gone and the result set is sensible (I type in ""sam"" and I get a short list of entries with sam). Have never used the contacts sidebar. Light theme, default no added themes. my email accounts are with google. I use cardbook to sync to gmail. I think all of the addresses are in the one gmail account. Also, and interesting, the contacts sidebar, which I've never used until you mentioned it and I then tested it, does not have this issue. It is only the dropdown list that is presented when I start typing into a new email's To field. </p><p>If others are having this issue, how can it still be biting after more than a year?

You'd need to backup your entire email archive on Gmail as long as the the account is available. Once you lost access to your workspace account it's too late. I'd download a copy of all messages on the server to your Local Folders account. You'd have to manually re-create any folder structure you may have underneath Local Folders. Download messages for each folder in smaller batches, not everything at once. Email servers don't like mass transactions, and may limit the amount of data you are allowed to transfer within a certain time frame. Depending on the size of your email archive this may be a somewhat tedious process, and it won't be in one step either. </p><p>Once you got a local copy of all your messages make sure to create a full backup of your Thunderbird profile. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_backing-up-a-profile</a> </p><p>Having said that, you should create profile backups regardless on a regular basis. </p><p>You don't need to download message copies from All Mail, unless there are messages in All Mail which have no other label, i.e. are in no other folder. </p><p>Alternatively you can download your entire message archive from Gmail outside of Thunderbird.

When you delete the account, it appears deleted because thunderbird is hold the deletion in memory, to be updated at shutdown. But if prevented from updating the prefs.js file, on restart, it reloads the file and the account displays again. The same explanation applies to the message view layout. The challenge is finding the culprit, maybe an antivirus?  If you browse profile outside of thunderbird in windows file explorer, you might see multiple copies of prefs.js, such as prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js, etc.  If so, I would delete all versions except the one with highest number, and then rename that one to prefs.js and restart thunderbird.

At the very least you could do with knowing what the very basic areas are called because that is how you tell people where the problem is located. </p> <ul><li> The 'Titlebar' - if enabled will at the very top. It displays a Thunderbird icon on far left followed by the name of account nad folder you have selected anbd on the far right it will display the  3 icons for minimise, maximise/restore and close. </li><li> The new 'Unified Toolbar' has the Global Search and Menu app icon (3 lines) plus anything else you customised. If the Title bar is not enabled then on far right it will display the 3 icons for minimise, maximise/restore and close. </li><li> The 'Menu Bar' toolbar has this: 'File, Edit, View, Go, Message, Events &amp; Tasks, Tools, Help </li><li> The 'Folder Pane' is normally on far left. It contains the mail account name folder and it's own set of personal folders such as Inbox. </li><li> The 'Message List' also known as 'Threads Pane' is where you see the list of emails. The old view is called 'Table View' and it allows one line per email and it has columns such as threads,starred,attachments, From, Subject,Date, etc. The new additional view is called 'Cards View' and the list of emails now uses 3 lines per email and there are no columns. </li><li> The 'Message Pane' is the area where you read the email you have opened. </li><li> At the top of the 'Message Pane' is where you see all the headers for the email you have opened and that area is the 'Message Header area and it will contain some buttons Reply, Forward, Archive, Junk, Delete, 'More'  </li><li> The 'Status Bar' is located at the bottom and on far left there is the offline/online icon -and on far right is the 'Today Pane' enable link. The status will show info such as connecting to server, download data and compacting data when those actions occur. </li><li> On very far left is the 'Spaces Toolbar' - at the top it has shortcut icons to  Mail, Address Book,Calendar, Tasks, Chat and at the bottom 'Settings' and the enable/disable view of Spaces toolbar icon. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

However, due to extremely poor vision, I cannot wend my way clearly through the various Settings options that are provided in THUNDERBIRD. I DID see the 'MORE' option at the bottom, but when I clicked on it, the other options are not clear to me. I think that you should not waste any more of your time with this problem. I appreciate your assistance, bit I think it's best now that I find someone more able to read all your advice, and then may this problem will utlimately be resolved. Thank you. k.t. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0
