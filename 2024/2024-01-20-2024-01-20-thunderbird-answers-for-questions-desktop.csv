Clicking More in the Message Header, then Tag shows the colours, and the same thing if the Tag button is on the Unified toolbar, and also with Message/Tag from the Menu Bar, and even the message context menu.  See the attached pictures. </p><p>Does the same thing happen in <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_Mode"" rel=""nofollow"">safe/troubleshoot mode</a> (hold Option when launching TB)? </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I can see that this has been a solution for other people and I'm optimistic that you have the fix I needed.  I have been in this situation all day and evening though so it's best I monitor it to see whether this has stuck and report back in a day or two.   </p><p>While being a technical type myself, I am not familiar with this area and the Oauth aspect is at the moment out of my experience.  A bit of reading up is required I think.  Thanks again for your help.  I'll be back. </p>",bordonbert,false,0,0
