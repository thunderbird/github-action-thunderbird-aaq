I can see that this has been a solution for other people and I'm optimistic that you have the fix I needed.

Hotmail traditionally ignores any connection attempt in less that 15 minutes after the last.  So if you change you connection frequency in account settings to check mail on less than a 15 minute cycle then you will be locked out until the timer for 15 minutes runs down. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Review the layout, especially the top line in the exported TB csv file, and adjust yours accordingly.  - with this done, the import is generally successful. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
