I say deprecated because when you look in the html that TB generates there are tags that have been officially deprecated for a while, but TB continues to generate them...   </p><p>I've seen a Lifewire article that showed how to add images in a signature in TB and so I've made a bogus message and added the content I needed with the links and saved that as an html file and used THAT file as my signature and now it works.  It's just that my previous html5 signature file (which any relatively up to date browser can open just fine) was about 2kb in size, but the one I made in TB is around 23kb.  That's because the images are written IN the html instead of being externally linked.   Because of that care must be taken if there are alot of replies as this would potentially make for bigger and bigger messages being sent back and forth.  It's not ideal, but it works. </p><p>I'm just surprised that this ""solution"" isn't mentioned more often in a bunch of other similar posts, it would save time and frustration.  I would also suggest that TBird's html generator be updated to today's standards. </p>",pduclos,false,0,0

To ensure thunderbird is set properly, you could reinstall thunderbird over what is there now to see if that addresses the issue. Prior to doing that, I suggest doing a backup to be safe. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

From your post, the technicians must have then done a full reinstall of Thunderbird and I don't know how they handled your account information, so it's unclear what actually happened to your account and messages. I am not sure a screenshot will help, since it was a full reinstall. Screenshots posted here must be images, such as jpg or png, not word documents. Is this an IMAP account? If so, the attachments should be viewable from your online login. Please advise on that. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
