I say deprecated because when you look in the html that TB generates there are tags that have been officially deprecated for a while, but TB continues to generate them...   </p><p>I've seen a Lifewire article that showed how to add images in a signature in TB and so I've made a bogus message and added the content I needed with the links and saved that as an html file and used THAT file as my signature and now it works.  It's just that my previous html5 signature file (which any relatively up to date browser can open just fine) was about 2kb in size, but the one I made in TB is around 23kb.  That's because the images are written IN the html instead of being externally linked.   Because of that care must be taken if there are alot of replies as this would potentially make for bigger and bigger messages being sent back and forth.  It's not ideal, but it works. </p><p>I'm just surprised that this ""solution"" isn't mentioned more often in a bunch of other similar posts, it would save time and frustration.

I checked up on the process you described and it looks as though you were correct, I don't seem to get an update fulfilled inside 15 minutes.

Using OAuth settings seems to have sorted it out, (I'm sure you knew it would sfhowes).  I wasn't aware of anything to do with OAuth though I had seen it in the options.
