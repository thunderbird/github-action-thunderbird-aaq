When I imported everything from my gmail account, it was all there. I assumed it was now downloaded and local/accessible offline. Here's where it goes down hill. Since I believed I had all my content on my hard drive, I went ahead and deleted what was saved in gmail. almost 20 years of stuff Now, when I open Thunderbird, nothing is there. It looks like the fresh install. Question: Is it all gone forever or is there somewhere on my machine that it's stored that I don't know about, yet? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",opalsmail

The actual online IMAP server folder size is less than 1 GB in size, a locally stored Maildir. And Thunderbird shows the mailbox size as 721 MB. </p><p>I've search online and in the forum but haven't been able to root out the problem; nor have I been able to find anyone else even having this problem. </p><p>The first this I tried was to compact that specific folder but this didn't make a dent. </p><p>One thing that I did notice is that when I ""type"" the various files in Thunderbird's ""profile"" directory, they return different file types. This seems odd to me as I would expect all of the files to be ASCII only. Here's a sample of three: </p> <ul><li> Problem file (100 GB): Library/Thunderbird/profiles/lsdgt05u.default-release/ImapMail/.localhost/********: UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF, LF line terminators </li><li> HTML?

One active POP account had a large number of emails going back several years. Suddenly I noticed all but emails received in the past 3 hours had headers only, no data or attachments. My other email accounts were fine. Of course when I did a repair on that email account, the headers all disappeared as well, leaving me with only the latest 3 hours of emails and a lot of missing emails and attachments. What is the best way to recover the missing emails? If the data still exists on the hard drive how can I find it and can it be re-indexed? How can I restore the data file from one of my backups? If I get it restored, can I merge the emails received between the time of the data loss to the current emails, with the recovered data? Is there an email recovery program to handle this? For several days leading up to the data / index file failure I noticed that Thunderbird, when processing that one large email account was taking a lot of time to do simple tasks, likely spending a lot of time trying to figure out the index chains. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pt0572

I have gone to the advanced settings and changed the default font size for all the fonts so that It appears larger. I also use a monitor setup at 800 X 600 resolution to help with my weak eyesight.  </p><p>The issue has to do with the Message Filters window which is now unusable as in the attachment. I once resized the Filter Name column too much by mistake and the entire window expanded beyond the bounds of my current display setting and now no matter what I do I cannot resize it back. </p><p>I did search the forum and found someone else who had a similar problem, but the solution provided was for Windows and the same steps do not work on Mac.  </p><p>It would be great if someone has a solution to share for this as I depend on Filters a lot to stay sane and free of spam, and frequently updating my blocked domains in the filters list is key to that.  </p><p>Thanks in advance, C </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1632168;,yelrahc-2023
