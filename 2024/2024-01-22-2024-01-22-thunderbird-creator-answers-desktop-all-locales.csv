I've never used an email client like this before. When I imported everything from my gmail account, it was all there. I assumed it was now downloaded and local/accessible offline. Here's where it goes down hill. Since I believed I had all my content on my hard drive, I went ahead and deleted what was saved in gmail. almost 20 years of stuff Now, when I open Thunderbird, nothing is there. It looks like the fresh install. Question: Is it all gone forever or is there somewhere on my machine that it's stored that I don't know about, yet? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1632205;1632206;1632208;1632209;1632211;1632223;,opalsmail

One active POP account had a large number of emails going back several years. Suddenly I noticed all but emails received in the past 3 hours had headers only, no data or attachments. My other email accounts were fine. Of course when I did a repair on that email account, the headers all disappeared as well, leaving me with only the latest 3 hours of emails and a lot of missing emails and attachments. What is the best way to recover the missing emails? If the data still exists on the hard drive how can I find it and can it be re-indexed? How can I restore the data file from one of my backups? If I get it restored, can I merge the emails received between the time of the data loss to the current emails, with the recovered data? Is there an email recovery program to handle this? For several days leading up to the data / index file failure I noticed that Thunderbird, when processing that one large email account was taking a lot of time to do simple tasks, likely spending a lot of time trying to figure out the index chains. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pt0572

Per sbloccare questo problema occorre chiudere e riaprire Thunderbird che in quel momento e solo in quel momento scarica le nuove email arrivate sull'account IMAP e procede a salvare correttamente le copie dell'email inviate nella casella Posta Inviata sul server IMAP. Con la versione 102 questo non avveniva. Saluti Stefano </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,it,1632189;1632203;,ced8

My plan is to have different folders for different groups of years.  I created a new profile and deleted the emails from other years to just keep one group of years in the profile.  Then I compacted folders, closed the profile, closed Thunderbird and looked at the size of the profiles in Windows 10.  It showed very little difference in the size of the profile with a large number of emails deleted.  I tried compacting each folder separately and still the size is not near proportional to the number of emails.  Is it possible to compact the profile properly? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1632244;,Fredtr

In that summary we can Release or Delete the emails. Well everything worked fine until they changed the format of the Quarantine Summary. Now when you click the Release or Delete button its like it trys to open the link in Thunderbird. That link brings you to a confirmation page asking are you sure you want to do what you click. Well because it opened that link inside of Thunderbird you can not click the confirmation button. You can right click the button and say Open Link in Browser and everything works fine. The only thing I can see that has changed is they added a button tag around the link? Orginal link &lt;a href=""#""&gt;Release&lt;/a&gt; New Format &lt;a href=""#""&gt;&lt;button&gt;Release&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I dont understand why just adding a button would cause the link to try and open inside of Thunderbird. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",PGTech
