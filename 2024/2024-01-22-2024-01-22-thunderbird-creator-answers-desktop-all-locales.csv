One active POP account had a large number of emails going back several years. Suddenly I noticed all but emails received in the past 3 hours had headers only, no data or attachments. My other email accounts were fine. Of course when I did a repair on that email account, the headers all disappeared as well, leaving me with only the latest 3 hours of emails and a lot of missing emails and attachments. What is the best way to recover the missing emails? If the data still exists on the hard drive how can I find it and can it be re-indexed? How can I restore the data file from one of my backups? If I get it restored, can I merge the emails received between the time of the data loss to the current emails, with the recovered data? Is there an email recovery program to handle this? For several days leading up to the data / index file failure I noticed that Thunderbird, when processing that one large email account was taking a lot of time to do simple tasks, likely spending a lot of time trying to figure out the index chains. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pt0572

Mail suddenly refused to display messages and no one on the Apple forum could figure out why. So I was advised to download Thunderbird. So far, I'm not a fan. Here are my issues: 1. Unread messages in the Inbox are in bold. But the bold is so close to the normal font that I can't tell them apart. Is there another, better way to mark unread messages? A tick/check mark? A coloured background? 2. Messages are automatically organised into conversations. But when the latest message comes in, the inbox message doesn't go bold. So there is no way of knowing where to find it. I have to go through all messages that have a conversation (more than one message in the inbox) and find one where the latest message is in bold at the bottom. It's a royal pain. I see the number next to the account on the left, but nothing is in bold on the right. Grrr. 3. The conversations are the wrong way up. I want the most recent message at the top, not the bottom. I would actually prefer not to have them in conversations at all, just the most recent message, but I realise that is probably asking too much. 4. There is no number next to the Thunderbird icon on my desktop when I get a message. I used to appreciate this in Mail. It told me if it was worth going to my inbox. With Thunderbird I have to open the program to find out. Ok, that's enough for now.

It seems like everything has successfully synced, besides the Inbox, which keeps attempting to download the same number of emails repeatedly. The inbox is currently displaying ~66K total emails, and Thunderbird keeps cycling through ""Downloading message X of ~64K in Inbox"". But it keeps getting very close to finishing ""downloading"" all the ~64K emails, and then restarting the process. Last time, it got up to ~63K of ~64K, and then popped up a message that said ""Deleted 64,000 emails from Inbox"". I've been watching the INBOX file in the ImapMail folder actively grow in size, but am confused as to why it seems to be stuck in a loop of downloading the 64K emails. Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1632441;1632524;,joelichtenauer12
