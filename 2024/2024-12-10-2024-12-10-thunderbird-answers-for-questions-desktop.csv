It is much like when you click on of those sign in with Google links on the web.  Thunderbird has no control over the content or anything else about the oAuth authentication flow.  It just gets to save the response from Google to authenticate you going forward. So if you have comments on it to pass on.  Please notify google how confusing it is. No one at Thunderbird has any influence at Google about how they undertake their business. </p> <blockquote>Got a number of error pop-ups when dismissing old events and calendar link downloaded GCal.

But really not knowing what your security set up with Google is I can do little but guess.  The same must be said for anyone else in this forum. </p><p>As for wanting a Save button.  So do I.  However the developers removed them as a design feature some years ago.  So I guess you like me will have to get used to having things save as soon as the field looses focus. </p><p>I would also like to point out that opening an unknown file type leads you through a point and click process to select the correct helper application for that MIME type or as it is new called Media type.  The file extension is not considered in this as identifying a files""type"". Using the extension is basically exclusively a windows thing even the internet uses media types.  This means that using an add button is not really going to be all that useful as not all DAT files are text, and not all DOC files come from the same version of Word. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
