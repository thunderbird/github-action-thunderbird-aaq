In some cases, the server requires that you need to switch on the options you want to use.  Xfinity states you need to select a specific checkbox  option to allow third part access. Some servers now require you to use 'app specific passwords'  eg: yahoo - many email addresses use the yahoo server. Other servers like gmail and microsoft require you to use 'Authentication Method: Oauth2' for both receiving and sending and will prompt you to enter password in order to allow third party access to server. </p><p>REcently, Microsoft has changed a few more rules, Microsoft account password must be the same as <a href=""http://outlook.com/hotmail.com/live.com/msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com/hotmail.com/live.com/msn.com</a>  account/email address password. Microsoft has also now stated only one account will be classed as the main account - set up as 'primary' and any other email addess eg: <a href=""http://outlook.com/hotmail.com/live.com/msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com/hotmail.com/live.com/msn.com</a> will be regarded as 'alias' account. This has an impact on sending using third party programs - no matter what the account email address used for receiving emails, it must use whatever is set up as 'primary' as the SMTP username. However, you do have the choice on what you choose to be as 'primary'. </p><p>I notice in a previous question you said  - GMX does not work with Thunderbird It does, but as is the case for any email address on any server - obviously you do have to use very specific settings. Get any part wrong and it will fail. </p><p>I notice you also said&nbsp;: I read on THIS FORUM that Gmail did not work well with Thunderbird Not true, it works perfectly well.  Thunderbird has no problem providing you use correct settings. In fact there has been huge progress recently when it comes to gmail. Now you easily hookup to the gmail Address Book and Calendar. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That said, I hope I am a little more computer literate than some old folks my age.  </p><p>I really did read the things I said I read on this forum. You are probably correct that what I read wasn't accurate, but I did get them here. </p><p>Last summer, I was desperate to set up a new email address as our old email addresses were tied to our old ISP before we moved. Someone on this forum recommended GMX. I went as far as setting up the GMX addresses for my husband and myself.

I got this from someone named Stan on the Thunderbird help site. I am copying and pasting below the instructions I have used since 2013. </p><p><br> Thunderbird is INSTALLED to a folder in \Program Files - but there is no data there.  </p><p>All your messages, folders, settings, preferences and more are in the Profile folder in your computer user account. This way when the computer is set up with more than one user account the other account(s) can have their own Thunderbird Profile (with their own messages and folders and settings). Kinda just like when when there is more than one user account, they can have separate and different desktops. They'll each also have their own 'My Documents' and settings for whatever browser is used will be for that particular user.  </p><p>If you back up your Profile folder it will include all your messages and so on. If disaster hits, you can 'restore' that profile folder back to where it was or to another computer with Thunderbird and it'll be just like before.  </p><p>It is fairly simple to manually back up your profile. This process just involves copying a single directory to a backup location. Most of the work is in finding where the profile folder is stored.  </p><p>Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information, and where it says Profile Directory, click the 'Open Containing Folder' button. That is the Profile Folder, it's name is 8 random characters.default, ie xxxxxxxx.default. It's may be easier to see/copy if you go up one level.  </p><p>Close Thunderbird and copy this folder to somewhere safe and you've backed up not only all your emails and folders but also all your settings and everything else you have set. You can restore it to any computer and TB will come up just as you left it.  </p><p>See <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_backup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_backup</a>  Comment  good answer!  •	Norris Wootton 6 months ago  •	•  Norris Wootton 6 months ago  •	Stan, I did not see any data when I looked at the Thunderbird folder.

So you have been doing ok. But if you need to reuse that profile you would need to get instructions on how to proceed. Either you would need to only use it's contents and reuse an existing profile Or paste in the profile to the correct location and then create a new profile which would point to the one you had just copied over - why - because the data that knows the profile exists is located in the 'profiles.ini' file and that is not in the profile name folder - it's in the 'Thunderbird' folder - hence why I suggested you backed up the entire 'Thunderbird' folder which contains the profiles.

Se hai cartelle con 50 GB di posta (per fare un esempio) è normale che Thunderbird abbia bisogna di molta RAM per aprirle (una cartella Thunderbird è un unico file su disco). Per questo si suggerisce sempre di suddividere la posta in sotto-cartelle. Di che dimensione sono i file del profilo che contengono la posta? </p>,@next,false,0,0

Comunque ho risolto con i seguenti passi: -ho copiato il profilo in altra cartella -ho disinstallato Thuderbird e cancellato la cartella Thunderbird nella libreria -ho installato Thuderbird re-impostando i parametri della mia casella mail -ho copiato manualmente i file delle cartelle locali dal mio vecchio profilo, così come pure gli indirizzari. Ora funziona tutto e incrocio le dita. </p>",gspagnuolo1,false,1,0

Ezt például úgy tehető meg, hogy a menüből kiválasztod a <em>Súgó -&gt; Hibakeresési információ</em> lehetőséget, majd a lapon lévő táblázatban a <em>Profilok</em> szöveg melletti hivatkozásra kattintasz. Itt láthatod a mostani profilodat, az egyszerűség kedvéért nyisd meg a mappát. Ezután a Thunderbirdben kattints az <em>Új profil létrehozására</em> és a folyamat során add meg az új mappát. Ezután állítsd be ezt az alapértelmezett profilként a profil alatt látható gombbal. Legvégül állítsd le a Thunderbirdöt, és másold át az adatokat az új helyre a régiből. </p><p>A Thunderbird újraindítása után már az új profilt fogja használni (ezt azért ellenőrizd az említett <em>about:profiles</em> oldalon), a régit törölheted. </p><p>Üdv, Balázs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0
