Got the email part set up (far as I can tell).  Calendar and Address book are a different story.  Calendar:  Using Google Calendar as primary calendar.

Created ANOTHER calendar and entered URL for Googles stock Holiday calendar. It also seemed to show up OK. Tried to do what I did with those calendars to add my Birthday Calendar, but Google uses data from Google Contacts to create that calendar. Can't figure how to add that data.  HELP?  Address book: Exported Google Contacts Data to a CSV file.  Tried BOTH Outlook CSV and Google CSV exports. NEITHER produced a CSV file ANYWHERE Close to what TBird appeared to want, based on what showed up on the ""fields"" page that appeared after I chose the CSV filename. Moving data around in a spreadsheet is a Royal pain. Isn't there a Google Contacts CSV export file that more closely approximates the arrangement that TBird WANTS? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1650684;1650735;,dalewebb1
