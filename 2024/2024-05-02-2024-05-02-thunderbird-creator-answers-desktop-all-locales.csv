Thunderbird 115.8.0 While trying to figure out why my taskbar badge says I have 99+ unread emails (for the record, I only have 7), I hovered over the tray icon, and it says I have over 4 billion (with a B!) unread emails. That's not even possible with the email address I'm using it for.  Why would this be like this, and how do I get it to be accurate? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jmo2610

Got the email part set up (far as I can tell).  Calendar and Address book are a different story.  Calendar:  Using Google Calendar as primary calendar. Consists of an appointment, birthday, and holiday calendars. Created a new calendar and entered the URL for my Google Calendar.  It showed up in TBird apparently OK. Created ANOTHER calendar and entered URL for Googles stock Holiday calendar. It also seemed to show up OK. Tried to do what I did with those calendars to add my Birthday Calendar, but Google uses data from Google Contacts to create that calendar. Can't figure how to add that data.  HELP?  Address book: Exported Google Contacts Data to a CSV file.  Tried BOTH Outlook CSV and Google CSV exports. NEITHER produced a CSV file ANYWHERE Close to what TBird appeared to want, based on what showed up on the ""fields"" page that appeared after I chose the CSV filename. Moving data around in a spreadsheet is a Royal pain. Isn't there a Google Contacts CSV export file that more closely approximates the arrangement that TBird WANTS? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",dalewebb1
