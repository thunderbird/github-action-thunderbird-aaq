Got the email part set up (far as I can tell).  Calendar and Address book are a different story.  Calendar:  Using Google Calendar as primary calendar. Consists of an appointment, birthday, and holiday calendars. Created a new calendar and entered the URL for my Google Calendar.  It showed up in TBird apparently OK. Created ANOTHER calendar and entered URL for Googles stock Holiday calendar. It also seemed to show up OK. Tried to do what I did with those calendars to add my Birthday Calendar, but Google uses data from Google Contacts to create that calendar. Can't figure how to add that data.  HELP?  Address book: Exported Google Contacts Data to a CSV file.  Tried BOTH Outlook CSV and Google CSV exports. NEITHER produced a CSV file ANYWHERE Close to what TBird appeared to want, based on what showed up on the ""fields"" page that appeared after I chose the CSV filename. Moving data around in a spreadsheet is a Royal pain. Isn't there a Google Contacts CSV export file that more closely approximates the arrangement that TBird WANTS? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1650684;1650735;,dalewebb1

For the last week I keep getting a large popup saying ""Mozilla Thunderbird Email wants to access your Google Account."" Not only do I not want or need what this offers for this particular account, but whatever I do, it keeps coming back every few minutes, which as it is on top of whatever I am working with, is extremely annoying. It offers me ""Deny"" or ""Allow"" options - but slicking ""Deny"" just removes that popup - and a few minutes later it returns. Screenshot of the message attached. Can anyone tell me how to get rid of it permanently, please? Many thanks for any help you can offer. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1650666;,clearcomms
