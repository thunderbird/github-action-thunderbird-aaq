In that case, recovering the old messages will need some details. So, once you locate the thunderbird folder, do this:  - open the file, profile.ini. It will have the name of the profile that was being used. Look next in the subdirectory named profiles for the folder with that name. That was the active profile. Click it. Now, your POP and/or local folders will be in the Mail folder. Folders will have names such as inbox, inbox.msf, etc. Once you find the ones you want, I suggest this:  - make new local folders in the Local Folders area with unique names for each of the folders to keep. - install the importexport addon if not already done - highlight one of the new folders, rightclick and select the importexport option to import mbox  - select one of the identified folders on drive e and import it. - repeat these steps for each of the desired folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Some are free for a limited number of customers. Mailchimp, as I recall, allows up to 2,000 messages per month free. The advantage of a mailing service is that your messages do not get flagged as spam, and you don't have the many delivery problems. This can also let you develop a professional template for your announcements. On your question, no email client will ever be able to do that. That is because email clients are not designed for mass communications. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

However, because of the way the mass mailings are set up in thunderbird, there are now 1347 messages in my outbox waiting for a send command.  If I try to send them all at once again, using the command you indicated, I'll generate another swarm of error messges.  It would be a great help if I could find a way to send them in batches of 500.
