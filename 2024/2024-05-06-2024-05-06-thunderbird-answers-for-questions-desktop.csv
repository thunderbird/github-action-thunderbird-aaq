Click that and a folder named Appdata should appear in the list. Click that and a folder named Roaming should appear. And there will then appear a folder named Thunderbird.  - now, if thunderbird is installed already, you can do a full recovery that will overlay whatever is already there. If that is the desire, just copy the thunderbird folder from drive E to  </p><pre>  c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming    That will OVERWRITE the existing thunderbird folder </pre> <p>- now, just restart thunderbird  </p><p>If you have already started using Thunderbird and have messages saved, then the process of salvaging the old PC gets messier.

In that case, recovering the old messages will need some details. So, once you locate the thunderbird folder, do this:  - open the file, profile.ini. It will have the name of the profile that was being used. Look next in the subdirectory named profiles for the folder with that name. That was the active profile. Click it. Now, your POP and/or local folders will be in the Mail folder. Folders will have names such as inbox, inbox.msf, etc. Once you find the ones you want, I suggest this:  - make new local folders in the Local Folders area with unique names for each of the folders to keep. - install the importexport addon if not already done - highlight one of the new folders, rightclick and select the importexport option to import mbox  - select one of the identified folders on drive e and import it. - repeat these steps for each of the desired folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Your antivirus or mail provider however are very different issues. </p><p>I did a google search in the message you posted mfrm-502 and I would have to say all of the responses I got were from exchange servers refusing to send mail for what they termed abuse.  This discussion includes links on the action to take when trying to have you mail account removed from the abuse list,  but essentially you need to contact your mail server admin.   <a href=""https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/i-receive-this-message-when-i-press-sendreceive-in/14c1551d-7359-4e7a-989d-6e569ea7f5c7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/i-receive-this-message-when-i-press-sendreceive-in/14c1551d-7359-4e7a-989d-6e569ea7f5c7</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
