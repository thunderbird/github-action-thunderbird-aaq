This is a common occurrence when a person has more than one email address with an email provider, but is using the same SMTP server for both. You can verify this by checking that you have a unique SMTP server defined for each account and that each account is linked to its appropriate SMTP server. This can also happen when the user does not enter the full email address in account setting pane or SMTP server pane. I suggest you enter the email id for each SMTP server in the Description field as that provides clear information when viewing the link at the account pane. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Once you have made settings, immediately exit thunderbird. Now, restart and it should be acting as desired. To do backup, I recommend - always exit thunderbird first, as a backup while running will cause some data to not be backed up, as the data is being held by Thunderbird.  - then, copy the profile at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to an external drive using Windows File Explorer (assuming you use WIndows) or whatever preferred software you prefer for this purpose.  - Then, should you need to restore, just copy the backedup Thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming - you will be prompted for overwrite, allow.  </p><p>However, if your small business includes several people on different PCs accessing the account, you have bigger issues to address, such as deciding how they are to share one account.

Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match.
