This is a common occurrence when a person has more than one email address with an email provider, but is using the same SMTP server for both. You can verify this by checking that you have a unique SMTP server defined for each account and that each account is linked to its appropriate SMTP server. This can also happen when the user does not enter the full email address in account setting pane or SMTP server pane. I suggest you enter the email id for each SMTP server in the Description field as that provides clear information when viewing the link at the account pane. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Once you have made settings, immediately exit thunderbird. Now, restart and it should be acting as desired. To do backup, I recommend - always exit thunderbird first, as a backup while running will cause some data to not be backed up, as the data is being held by Thunderbird.  - then, copy the profile at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to an external drive using Windows File Explorer (assuming you use WIndows) or whatever preferred software you prefer for this purpose.  - Then, should you need to restore, just copy the backedup Thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming - you will be prompted for overwrite, allow.  </p><p>However, if your small business includes several people on different PCs accessing the account, you have bigger issues to address, such as deciding how they are to share one account. You need also to be sensitive to whatever possible limit the email provider allows for storage space, as you may eventually exceed the space allocation and will need then to rethink your retention strategy.  Just issues to consider... </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

If I'm getting this right, both the 'syncronization&amp;storage' and 'server settings pane' options are after I set up the actual email account, connecting with password, and are repeated x times for each account. There isn't a global option for future/subsequent/new email accounts to never delete from server, right? </p>",CTmoz,false,0,0
