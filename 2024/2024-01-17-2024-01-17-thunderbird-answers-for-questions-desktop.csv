Assuming you have used right click on email &gt; Move to &gt; select destination </p><p>I had been dragging and dropping, but this method has the same result. </p><p>Are you moving the email to another folder within the same mail account? YES (not shouting - easier to see) After moving email - select folder you moved email into and then reselect the 'Unread' folder.

I have had the problem before, from another business I'm pretty sure. </p><p>Is the 'Unread' folder a standard folder you created which receives auto filtered emails? I THINK I DID THIS ONE. When an email arrives, it goes into the INBOX and also shows up in the UNREAD folder under INBOX. When I move the email to it's destination folder (under INBOX), it disappears from INBOX but stays in the UNREAD folder if it's one of these nasty ones. </p><p>OR do you always manually put unread emails into the 'Unread' folder?
