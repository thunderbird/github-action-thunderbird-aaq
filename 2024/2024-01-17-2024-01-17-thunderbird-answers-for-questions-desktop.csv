I have had the problem before, from another business I'm pretty sure. </p><p>Is the 'Unread' folder a standard folder you created which receives auto filtered emails? I THINK I DID THIS ONE. When an email arrives, it goes into the INBOX and also shows up in the UNREAD folder under INBOX. When I move the email to it's destination folder (under INBOX), it disappears from INBOX but stays in the UNREAD folder if it's one of these nasty ones. </p><p>OR do you always manually put unread emails into the 'Unread' folder?

Yes, it's a natural thing to include native picture resizing, IMHO.   I would recommend that if Thunderbird team does not want to natively support popular/necessary addons, they should *ENSURE* that they don't break existing ones with new releases. </p><p>I bought a new PC and ended up with latest and of course, nothing works that I've grown fond of over the years and the number of addons that I'm interested seems to have gone down.   The addon developers keep saying that they're done creating addons where the infrastructure keeps changing, causing them to endlessly reprogram.   This tool is about just reading emails, right?   Why must things innovate to the point of of breaking normal functionality (like emailing pictures)?? </p><p>Tim </p>",tconrad63,false,0,0

Developers tend to keep developing as long as users donate. That's the big reason they quit. It would be unreasonable for Thunderbird development staff to test every addon whenever a change is done. I do appreciate your thoughts, as I also use certain addons regularly. My approach is to also have a beta installed to let me preview which addons are being updated. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Where can you not change the font size?  In a new message, in the viewing of emails received or in the user interface.  They are all different. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
