I sent a test email and now only one is in my unified sent folder, which is the one stored in Gmail's sent folder.  As for how to delete the duplicates, I tried deleting the copies in one of the two Sent folder for my main email account, but that also wiped out the same items from the other Sent folder.  So I had to Undo that.  This doesn't make sense to me and here's why:  If I turn on the option to Save a copy in Sent folder, then both Sent folders for this Account get a copy, presumably the one associated with my Gmail account by default, and the other to the second Sent folder in Thunderbird.  Hence the Unified Sent folder shows two copies.  Now if I turn off Save a copy in Sent folder, only one Sent folder gets a copy, which I figured must be the regular Gmail Sent folder.  But apparently the two individual Sent folders are linked, because deleting items from the one that I figured was only associated with Thunderbird will delete the same ones from Gmails Sent folder as well. So it looks like there's no way for me to delete the 800 duplicate emails. </p>",romainroad,false,0,0

You can see that the first folders (inbox, sent etc) have no header, but have numbers of emails in them - but the emails just do not appear.  Further down you see the header for this email account, but none of the folders (inbox etc) have any numbers of emails in them, and nothing appears if I open them. I tried clicking and moving the header and the folders as you suggest, but it just shews the circle with a bar through it, meaning that it won't move the anything. If I can only get to see the emails that are counted, that would do for now. Further problem just surfaced - trying to get emails for this gmail account, it keeps asking me for the password, which I tap in only to be refused - and this is the same password that I can use to access gmail on my browser. Final thought - I used Ccleaner not long before this went wrong, and I think I saw that it asked to close T'bird to clear the cache. Could this be the source of the problem? </p>",jfdi,false,0,0

Yes, when other software closes Thunderbird, it may not close it 'gently', which means some files may have been left open during the shutdown. Check view&gt;folders and UNTICK unified folders if that is set so that you can see whatever is really there.  On gmail, it only accepts an OAUTH2 password, not your online password, so that is not unusual. I suggest you do a screenshot of the imapmail folder in profile from windows file explorer with Thunderbird not running. That will show that you really have. If you're not sure how to get there, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' and then click the imapmail folder. That will show you what accounts are there. That would be one screenshot. Then, click each account and do a screenshot of what is in each account. From that, we will all have a better view of whatever issue you have. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
