The other question, how do I delete the hundreds of duplicates now? </p>",romainroad,false,0,0

I sent a test email and now only one is in my unified sent folder, which is the one stored in Gmail's sent folder.  As for how to delete the duplicates, I tried deleting the copies in one of the two Sent folder for my main email account, but that also wiped out the same items from the other Sent folder.  So I had to Undo that.  This doesn't make sense to me and here's why:  If I turn on the option to Save a copy in Sent folder, then both Sent folders for this Account get a copy, presumably the one associated with my Gmail account by default, and the other to the second Sent folder in Thunderbird.  Hence the Unified Sent folder shows two copies.  Now if I turn off Save a copy in Sent folder, only one Sent folder gets a copy, which I figured must be the regular Gmail Sent folder.  But apparently the two individual Sent folders are linked, because deleting items from the one that I figured was only associated with Thunderbird will delete the same ones from Gmails Sent folder as well. So it looks like there's no way for me to delete the 800 duplicate emails. </p>",romainroad,false,0,0

It was there. </p><p>So I guess we go to the other hint you offer of zero size.  Generally that sort of issue is directly caused by antivirus scanning.  When you drag,  first the attachment data has to become a file.  So a temp file goes into the system temp folder.  Then it gets moved or copied really when the drop happens.  IF the antivirus is a slug and still thinking about it's actions the copy that get to the drop is minus the file content as it is still locked up by the antivirus.  So try disabling it for a bit and see if you still have the same problem. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Further down you see the header for this email account, but none of the folders (inbox etc) have any numbers of emails in them, and nothing appears if I open them. I tried clicking and moving the header and the folders as you suggest, but it just shews the circle with a bar through it, meaning that it won't move the anything. If I can only get to see the emails that are counted, that would do for now. Further problem just surfaced - trying to get emails for this gmail account, it keeps asking me for the password, which I tap in only to be refused - and this is the same password that I can use to access gmail on my browser. Final thought - I used Ccleaner not long before this went wrong, and I think I saw that it asked to close T'bird to clear the cache. Could this be the source of the problem? </p>",jfdi,false,0,0

Yes, when other software closes Thunderbird, it may not close it 'gently', which means some files may have been left open during the shutdown. Check view&gt;folders and UNTICK unified folders if that is set so that you can see whatever is really there.  On gmail, it only accepts an OAUTH2 password, not your online password, so that is not unusual. I suggest you do a screenshot of the imapmail folder in profile from windows file explorer with Thunderbird not running. That will show that you really have. If you're not sure how to get there, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' and then click the imapmail folder.

It appears that TB had simply changed the local directory pointer in the profile for that email account. Re-directing the local directory to the correct pop account gave me back the view of all the emails, and as a bonus re-arranged the left hand pane to how it should be. Delete the Smart Mailbox folder? There are thirty-eight versions (original and -1 to -37). Before I try that, I'll save the entire default profile directory..... Many thanks for your input.

The existence of 38 indicates Thunderbird is having trouble accessing it's own files on your system.  The usual cause,  and leading cause of folk saying settings don't save is antivirus product causing file contention with their scanning.  Creating an exception in the antivirus product for the profile folder is the best outcome after you delete all the numbered version of files. Other causes are files stord on very slow locations like USB drive and network shares as well as locations on the drive that are cloud sunced to thing like google drive. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Do you save the new App password from prior day? My thought on this is that, if Thunderbird requests mail and had not updated password from prior day, AOL will reject the login and prompt for a new app password. A suggestion: save the app password next time, so that the following time you start thunderbird, see if the app password you saved works. If it does, that indicates thunderbird isn't saving it, not that AOL wants to issue a new app password.
