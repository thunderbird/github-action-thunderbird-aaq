Uso Thunderbird da oltre 10 anni, con piena sodisfazione. Da quando sono passato alla versione 115 (qualche mese fa) Thunderbird si blocca, nel senso che la pagina diventa bianca e inerte e nella barra blu in alto appare la nota ""(non risponde)"". Questo capita circa ogni ora, anche mentre sto scrivendo un'e-mail (con gran seccatura perchè devo riscrivere il testo - magari lungo o complicato).  Questo è particolarmente seccante quando sto aspettando un'e-mail e tengo d'occhio l'icona di Thunderbird nella barra delle applicazioni. Quando il programma si blocca, l'icona non mi segnala posta in arrivo, non perchè non sia arrivata ma perchè il programma è bloccato. Devo chiudere a forza il programma e riavviarlo. Attenzione, il programma non va in crash, infatti nulla compare nelle ""Segnalazioni di arresto anomalo negli ultimi tre giorni"". La cartella della posta ha poco più di 16 giga. Ho vari accounts di posta, e seguendo consigli nel forum ho sminuzzato le cartelle ""posta in arrivo"" e ""posta inviata"", creando sottocartelle, in modo che nessuna sia più grande di 700 MB. Ho Windows 7. La RAM del computer ha 16GB, con spazio su disco disponibile 681 GB. Svuoto regolarmente la cache sul disco, e compatto regolarmente le cartelle quando sia possibile recuperare 5 Mb in totale. Grazie per l'aiuto che potrete darmi. </p>",fix-problems;needsinfo;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,it,1654064;,borasulmare

It was ok in the past, though I recall was tricky to set up on TB a couple of years ago. But now it has ceased to function after I migrated TB profile (successfully apart from this issue) no matter what I try. I’d be grateful for any suggestions. As is the case with many non-profits, there’s little tech support, but others can use the email account ok. I think it may be a TB issue as I have been able to set up the account ok with MS new Windows Outlook app (lame, but better than Mail…low bar). I’d rather have this account on my TB client along with the others I use. And the issue is replicated on two of my PCs. TB account set up reports “can’t detect settings from host server”. I found a support thread <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1441677"" rel=""nofollow"">link text</a>, which says “The failure to detect settings is rather common where hosted domains are concerned. Mostly because everything is done to a price and most of the things around encryption are done in a halfhearted manner. As is the server setups for mail. However by faithfully copying the settings from the provider as to domains server name and ports it should work.” So I did manual configuration – copied the settings from the successful Outlook set up, but no dice – all I get is server time out message. Settings are: IMAP server: <a href=""http://mail.XXXX.org.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.XXXX.org.uk</a> Port 993 Security SSL/TLS [earlier working settings were STARTTLS port 143] SMTP server: <a href=""http://mail.XXXX.org.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.XXXX.org.uk</a> Port 465 Security SSL/TLS [[earlier working settings were STARTTLS port 587] And using Normal Password for both; I tried Autodetect too but no good. I’ve see a suggestion that turning off the firewall (Norton) might work, but I’m reluctant to do that and doesn’t seem to make sense that would cause the issue.  I found another suggestion that apparently works for some people - leaving password blank on setup. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1399690"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1399690</a>.

That is the plan -- the user is NOT prepared to deal with 115 and later, and the changes therein. Somehow, even though it was supposedly set to only install updates when you told it to, it downloaded and began the process of installing 115. So it's up and running now at 102, but says that when you restart, it will go to 115. Please don't tell me how wonderful 115 is; been there, done that, it's not my machine but it's someone near and dear to me who detests computers in the first place but has to use them so gratuitous changes are utterly unwelcome.... </p><p>So is there a way to delete something and tell Thunderbird to just keep running 102 and not do the upgrade? If I have to reinstall 102 on top of the old profile, which contains many gigabytes of IMPORTANT mail, I can deal with that. I assume that the profile hasn't been munged yet by the update so I'm asking now. Thanks! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1654182;1654185;1654189;1654195;,fred37
