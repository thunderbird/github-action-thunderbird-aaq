Older messages not deleted from server","<p>As stated in the question, messages older than 1000 days are not deleted (this is a POP server). This is on my Desktop which is my primary PC. I also have a laptop using Thunderbird with ""Leave messages on server"" but with neither option (Number of days or Until I delete them) checked. The purpose of the laptop settings is that since it is not my primary PC I don't want it to delete anything from the server. </p><p>I did quite a few searches and the closest thing I found was another user who had migrated to Thunderbird after using another mail client for years, and it sounded like after they installed Thunderbird, they imported their old emails  from the old client and then began using Thunderbird. The explanation they got was that any emails that had not been downloaded from the server by Thunderbird would not have a download date in Thunderbird and would therefore not be subject to the ""older than xxx days"" setting.  That scenario doesn't apply to me because I have been using Thunderbird exclusively for at least 5 years, so all emails on the server that are less than ~1825 days (5 x 365) were downloaded by Thunderbird. All emails older than 5 years have long since been deleted from the server manually.  </p><p>Either I am misunderstanding the ""For at most xxx days"" setting or something is not working properly. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1650035;1650062;,TampaTom

Every on and then when I double-click on a PDF file attached to an email nothing happens. No action whatsoever. Thunderbird does not ask me if I want to open the file or save it. When I right-click on it and save the file on my computer the saved file size is 0 KB. I tried to access my emails using the browser and it works perfect. I can both open the file or save it on my computer and it saves with a proper size and then I can open it in Acrobat. Has anyone experienced a similar issue? I use Thunderbird SUPERNOVA 115.10.1 Windows 10 pro 10.0.19045 </p><p>Thank you for any tips. Tadeusz </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1650005;,tadekjaworski
