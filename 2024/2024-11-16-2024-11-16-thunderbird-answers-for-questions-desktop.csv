Es ist unabhängig ob ich die Geräte relativ zeitgleich, zeitnah nacheinander oder mit längerem Abstand nutze. Immer beim Starten des Mail-Programmes habe ich die gleichen Mails wieder an den gleichen Stellen wieder. Soll heißen, ich starte das Mailprogramm und es aktualisiert sich selbst, wenn Updates gemeldet sind, und außerdem lädt es die vermeintlich neuen Mails herunter, ohne zu bemerken, daß auf einem anderen Gerät ebendiese Mails bereits gelesen, verschoben oder sonstiges sind. Dieses Problem/Phänomen hatte ich beim vorherigen Programm [Outlook als geschäftliche Version] nicht, was gelöscht war, war gelöscht und so weiter. Am schwierigste bzw aufwendigsten ist es ja leider mit dem Verschieben der Mails in entsprechende Ordner nach meiner Zuordnung, das dann immer mehrmals zu tun ist nicht der Sinn.

In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. </li><li> if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font.

And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), no HTML will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

Is your intent that the recipient receive it in Palatino Linotype? Or is it just your desire that YOU see it in Palatino Linotype? The bulleted portion of your sample appears to have been prewritten.

The message has an inline graphic farther down and would, I believe, always be in HTML as a result.  The email is originally written in MS Word and then copied and pasted into Thunderbird (all of it, not just the bulleted section), I don't know if that would make any difference, and ALL of the MS Word text is also in 12 pt.

HTML messages do show the desired font, but only if you're entering from scratch. Pasting in HTML text does not follow the intent. (That is also true in Word: pasting in text of one font does not change because of specified preferred font.) The Word text has a font size embedded in it, but the new text in thunderbird uses the default, which is 12 pixels, not 12 points. If you want to merge Word documents and have new content all in the same font, then I suggest you paste in the Word text without formatting, and then highlight all text when done to select to font. Attempting to have thunderbird formatting mirror formatting from a wordprocessor is doomed to failure. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I'm used to having a choice as to whether the past uses the source or the destination formatting.  This particular email goes to a group, along with the previous three weeks (one per week) and each week, individually, is also posted to my web site, which is why I did it that way.  Obviously I had no problem going from MS Word to MS Outlook. </p><p>Now that I have a better understanding of how Thunderbird works, I could probably start in Thunderbird instead of Word.  I came to Thunderbird from Outlook because of the ""New"" and ""Old"" calendars not syncing with each other and only the ""New"" synced with my phone.  The ""Old"" version also dumped all of the first names in my contacts, but ""New"" still had them.  I came to hate Outlook. </p><p>If you have any pull with the ""powers that be"", I suggest they do the font size in points, instead of pixels, and allow us to choose the size in points instead of small, medium, large, etc. </p>",Christopher32,false,0,0

To me, it's priceless. When you can actually see the HTML, it starts to make more sense. And I'll be glad to assist if you have further questions.  </p><p>No, I have zero pull, but there is much wisdom in Thunderbird's strategy. The main strength I like is that the defaults do NOT force font sizes on recipients. If you select 'medium' as the default, no font size is sent, allowing the recipient to view the message in their own preferred size. To me, that is a strength, as all other email clients (to my knowledge) force a font size in messages. Further, if you select 'variable width' as your default, then you, an only you, see the Paladino Linotype font, and the recipients see the message in their own choice. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
