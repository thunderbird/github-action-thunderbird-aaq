This occurs sporadically with no obvious pattern and once the misdirected pointer is present it remains -in spite of deleting previous emails, compacting, etc. If I access the email via a browser they render correctly. I'm using Thunderbird 128.3.3esr (64-bit).   Any ideas why this might be happening?     </p><pre>   Thanks </pre>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tlylezim
