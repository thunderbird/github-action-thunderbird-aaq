A new problem has appeared with nebula that I am hoping that the experts here can help me troubleshoot.  </p><p>When any operation is performed on the emails in one particular account's Inbox folder, there is a 3-5 second pause where TB freezes. For example, when I try to open an email, I see a blank email tab with `Loading Message...` for a few seconds, before the email shows; when I toggle the read status for an email in the folder by clicking on the gray/green icon, there is a few seconds' delay. During this pause I can hear my CPU fan speed up, so seems like there is a spike in CPU usage. After a few minutes, these delays go away, but then reappear at some point (even though TB has been open the entire time) - possibly after new email has been downloaded from the server.  </p><p>My overall suspicion is that <em>something in this particular folder's files is triggering Nebula</em>. I need help figuring out what it is and fixing it. This is not bad enough for me to ditch TB but it's definitely annoying AF. Strange part is that it appeared only after the Nebula upgrade, which makes me think this is a code issue not a mailbox file issue. </p><p><strong>Setup</strong> </p> <ol><li> Thunderbird 128.3.3esr (64-bit) on Windows 11 23H2 </li><li> Multiple mailbox accounts, all using POP3 (not IMAP; there is no interaction between TB and the server other than downloading email). Had not changed any settings during the nebula upgrade </li><li> The account in question has multiple folders in TB. Filters are used to move messages from the Inbox to different folders (and sometimes, to folders on other accounts). Again, the slow performance is only on the single, Inbox folder in one account, and not any of the other folders or other accounts. </li><li> Profile files are on a very fast SSD. I have not been able to detect a peak in disk usage when the pause happens. </li><li> The affected folder has 32K emails in it, size on disk 1.5G (+27M for `.msf` file). I have another folder which is 3.1G+20M, that one does not have this problem. </li></ol> <p><strong>Here's what I have tried, with no changes</strong> </p> <ol><li> Compact all mailboxes </li><li> Repair folder for all folders/subfolders </li><li> Delete the GLODA to force a rebuild </li><li> Troubleshooting mode </li><li> Watching the console in developer tools (no relevant errors appear) </li><li> Turning on `browser.dom.window.dump.enabled` - no significant errors appear </li><li> Turning off hardware acceleration </li><li> Updating graphics card drivers </li><li> Ensuring that the TB profile folder and windows temp folder is not being indexed by Windows search </li><li> Checking the filter logs - no errors </li></ol> <p>Any suggestions or tips on how to gather more data, are welcome.
