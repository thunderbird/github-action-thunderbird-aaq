But that's because I receive few spam. Without training, the junk filter never learns but keeps repeating mistakes. My suggestion, if you want to get the filter meeting your needs is to periodically mark junk and non-junk. If your email provider offers a tool on web, see it is is one that Thunderbird works with and make that setting as well.
