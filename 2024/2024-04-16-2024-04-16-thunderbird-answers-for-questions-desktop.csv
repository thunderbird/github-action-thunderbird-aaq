I can then select [left mouse] to delete said message, and it gets sent to ""TRASH"" folder. Later on, I can select ""TRASH"" , and by ""RIGHT"" clicking get a drop down that says ""EMPTY"" trash folder. Which I do.  Thunder bird suggested, that after selecting a message &amp; highlighting it, I should press the ""Ctrl &amp; A"" key at the SAME time. This high lights the entire page. Support then says to press the ""Delete"" key.  Question?? If I depress the ""Delete"" key, will I JUST delete the messages showing on the screen, OR will it delete EVERY email in the Thunderbird  in box?? First option would be fine but NOT the second.  Thanks for your time, guess I'll use the ""old"" fashioned way of deleting 1 at a time. Then I'll just have to wait about 5 years, until I get another 1000 emails at once, from years past. Of course I may beat them to the punch, and be gone myself.-Joel </p>",flyplayne@bellsouth.net,false,0,0

But that's because I receive few spam. Without training, the junk filter never learns but keeps repeating mistakes. My suggestion, if you want to get the filter meeting your needs is to periodically mark junk and non-junk. If your email provider offers a tool on web, see it is is one that Thunderbird works with and make that setting as well.
