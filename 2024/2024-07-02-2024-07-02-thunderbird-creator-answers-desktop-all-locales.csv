Quando apro Thunderbird, compare una finestra che chiede la password, ma non la accetta. Sembra che non sia possibile stabilire la verifica in due passi, ma solo la password normale. Il Tecnico di Aruba dice che è un problema di settaggio di Thunderbird. Qualcuno mi può aiutare? </p>",gianpieronegri;@next;ing.carreri;,true,false,false,";category:other;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird;solver_id:6031107",8,0,0,,,

See the picture attached. </p><p>I even tried to take a previous copy of the Inbox.msf file from a backup (it was 800 kb).  I deleted the old Inbox.msf file and replaced with the larger 800 kb file.
