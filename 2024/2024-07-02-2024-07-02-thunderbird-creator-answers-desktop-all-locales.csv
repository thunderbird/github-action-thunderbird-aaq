Then at approx 12:41 PM EST Thunderbird stopped working. I can send and receive emails through AOL to AOL but they do not show up in Thunderbird. I did not have any other computer issues and did not change any settings. Verizon told me it was an AOL issue, but I was able to successfully send and receive messages with AOL. AOL tried to fix it but ultimately said it was a Thunderbird issue. In the last 6 or 7 weeks I have had issues with Thunderbird. What is going on? Very Very Frustrating!!! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",k.machv
