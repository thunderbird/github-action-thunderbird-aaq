TB still *seems* to be using those files.  I really need to free up space on C:\ - tiny drive filled with Windows OS,  huge D:\ with nothing on it.   </p><p>Thank you for your time and attention! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1660007;1660008;,mswilder

Then at approx 12:41 PM EST Thunderbird stopped working. I can send and receive emails through AOL to AOL but they do not show up in Thunderbird. I did not have any other computer issues and did not change any settings. Verizon told me it was an AOL issue, but I was able to successfully send and receive messages with AOL. AOL tried to fix it but ultimately said it was a Thunderbird issue. In the last 6 or 7 weeks I have had issues with Thunderbird. What is going on? Very Very Frustrating!!! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",k.machv
