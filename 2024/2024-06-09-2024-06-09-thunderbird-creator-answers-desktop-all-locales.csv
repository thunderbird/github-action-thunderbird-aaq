Let me state some facts. 1. The error I'm reporting here, I have NEVER EVER seen before. 2. I have 2 email comcast email addresses, they have worked with Thunderbird for over 15 years- no issues. 3. Optimum is my ISP for the past 5 yrs- no issues like this. I don't have an email address w/them. Seems they don't provide them anymore I was told by their rep! </p><p>Earlier last week I noticed I was not receiving emails at all from on my iPhone. I use the iPhone Mail application for email. </p><p>I opened Tbird this morning and saw this WEIRD message for both comcast email addresses. </p><p><strong> Sending of password for user xxx@comcast.net did not succeed. Mail server <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> responded: [AUTH] Temporarily blacklisted IP Address - try again later</strong> </p><p>Then the following window in Tbird appears both accounts each. </p><p><strong>Login to server <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> with username xxx@comcast.net failed </strong> Retry, Enter New Password, Cancel<strong> </strong> </p><p>No idea what the above blacklist error means. </p><p>I called Comcast. We checked/reset the passwords on the accounts in the comcast webmail, I changed them in Thunderbird. I checked both inboxes, and there were over 40 emails I never received in Tbird, nor on my phone, inside Comast's webmail. </p><p>Using comcast webmail on my PC, I am able to send emails to myself from both accounts, and reply. My friends are able to send me emails to both accounts. However I can only see the emails on my phone, NOT in Thunderbird. </p><p>Here's the more weird part. </p><p>My primary comcast (#1) email address on my phone works ONLY when I'm using my cellular data. If I connect to my ISPs router, I cannot send/receive email at all from comcast, and using Apple's mail app, I cannot send email using the gmail account that I have in Mail also. The gmail is independent from comcast.  </p><p>If I disconnect from Optimum WiFi router, then the following works: 1. Gmail- can send/receive email 2. Comcast email #1 (Primary)- can send and receive emails from/to anyone 3. Comcast email #2- can only receive email, it cannot send at all. </p><p>When connected to my WiFi both comcasts read same error in Mail app with ""Cannot Get Mail, xxx is currently unavailable"" </p><p>And no matter what I do- Thunderbird continues to give me the above error and nothing can be sent OR received in Thunderbird. </p><p>I have no idea where to go on this one. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1656580;1656587;1656591;1656605;,viperc
