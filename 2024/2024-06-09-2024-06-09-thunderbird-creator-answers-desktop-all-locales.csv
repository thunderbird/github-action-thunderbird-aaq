I love the platform so it would be great if I could figure this out. </p><p>My email address ends in @hws.edu. It seems to be run through Microsoft, but the 2 factor authentication takes you to their own <a href=""https://sso.hws.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sso.hws.edu/</a>...  </p><p>I have tried adding, just the email (and it says that the configuration isn't recognized by Mozilla's ISP), and then also just putting in the password (where it says, authentication failed either the entered credentials are incorrect or a separate username is required for logging in. This username is usually your Windows domain login or without the domain.) I don't know what\how the ""Your login ex: YOURDOMAIN\yourusername"" works. </p><pre>I have no idea how to do manual configuration but would be willing to try.  </pre> <p>Any help would be appreciated </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mefairfld
