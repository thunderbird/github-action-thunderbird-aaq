I pay for cloud back-up so everything except Thunderbird was fully restored.  I know noting about computers.  My friend, an IT pro who built and sold me this machine, has worked hard without success.  This is my home desktop machine running Windows 10.  I can access incoming mail through AT&amp;T Yahoo Mail.  And today some kind AT&amp;T person spent two hours with me on the phone.  Now I have a newly assigned security code and, to my surprise, a functioning Thunderbird.  However, my hundreds of addresses have not reappeared nor have the thousands of saved emails in my various local folders.  I believe what I have now is a newer version of Thunderbird.  Much of it looks different.  And weirdly there was a button for ""old email"" that I hit and started to receive things sent to me as far back as 2007.  I think it stopped at some capacity limit.  I am sure most of what came through I don't want but I certainly don't want to permanently delete things I may have moved to another folder.  The AT&amp;T person got me to some repair page with step-by-step instructions for hooking up with Thunderbird but he got stymied at some point.  I am at a loss here and would appreciate help.  Thank you for your time and attention. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1668694;,kamholzmarvels

So instead of ""if sender contains"" Political candidate #1 OR Political candidate #2 and on and on I'd like to be able to use a list of some format that contains the same information. </p><p>Is that possible? </p><p><br> Otto </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1668691;,ottohoel
