I pay for cloud back-up so everything except Thunderbird was fully restored.  I know noting about computers.  My friend, an IT pro who built and sold me this machine, has worked hard without success.  This is my home desktop machine running Windows 10.  I can access incoming mail through AT&amp;T Yahoo Mail.  And today some kind AT&amp;T person spent two hours with me on the phone.  Now I have a newly assigned security code and, to my surprise, a functioning Thunderbird.  However, my hundreds of addresses have not reappeared nor have the thousands of saved emails in my various local folders.  I believe what I have now is a newer version of Thunderbird.  Much of it looks different.  And weirdly there was a button for ""old email"" that I hit and started to receive things sent to me as far back as 2007.  I think it stopped at some capacity limit.  I am sure most of what came through I don't want but I certainly don't want to permanently delete things I may have moved to another folder.  The AT&amp;T person got me to some repair page with step-by-step instructions for hooking up with Thunderbird but he got stymied at some point.  I am at a loss here and would appreciate help.  Thank you for your time and attention. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1668694;,kamholzmarvels

My Thunderbird has been slow to pen,lagging while in it,and when clicking on messages,they do not show,and have to close it by right clicking the icon several times then waiting for it to close,then when reopening it,it says it is processing,and still open,and a box appears with an option to close the program so it can open again.I have done nothing to cause this.I have many important emails etc,and i cant uninstall the program,so i installed OE Classic,and was able to import settings from Thunderbird to it,and luckily i was able to export Thunderbirds setting to a 2.1 gn file that was the file i used to import to OE Classic,but OE Classic waits,and authenticates,and then i get a big error message,and here is the screenshot. I guess i,l try outlook express if its still any good for email(have heard /read otherwise) By the way i tried right clicking on the thunderbird shortsut,and selecting run as admin,and make it run in compatibility mode for win7,and thunderbird was fast for a day or two,but now its back to quicksand. Any help is appreciated. ThankYou, Screenshot.... </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1668697;,cs999

I see <a href=""http://manua.ls"" rel=""nofollow"">manua.ls</a> has a manual I can download. Do you have experience with that? I find searching the knowledge base at Thunderbird difficult to use - my incompetence, I'm sure! Is there a tutorial that would teach me the basics? I've been using Thunderbird for about 20 years and it's vital to my business. I've had techs screw it up a couple of times. I think I need to be my own repairman. Any direction you can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thanks much! </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",martypa
