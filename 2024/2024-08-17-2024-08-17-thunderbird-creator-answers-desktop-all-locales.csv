I pay for cloud back-up so everything except Thunderbird was fully restored.  I know noting about computers.  My friend, an IT pro who built and sold me this machine, has worked hard without success.  This is my home desktop machine running Windows 10.  I can access incoming mail through AT&amp;T Yahoo Mail.  And today some kind AT&amp;T person spent two hours with me on the phone.  Now I have a newly assigned security code and, to my surprise, a functioning Thunderbird.  However, my hundreds of addresses have not reappeared nor have the thousands of saved emails in my various local folders.  I believe what I have now is a newer version of Thunderbird.  Much of it looks different.  And weirdly there was a button for ""old email"" that I hit and started to receive things sent to me as far back as 2007.  I think it stopped at some capacity limit.  I am sure most of what came through I don't want but I certainly don't want to permanently delete things I may have moved to another folder.  The AT&amp;T person got me to some repair page with step-by-step instructions for hooking up with Thunderbird but he got stymied at some point.  I am at a loss here and would appreciate help.  Thank you for your time and attention. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1668694;,kamholzmarvels

At first, right when I implemented it, they asked to modify this configuration: </p><p>Edit → Preferences → Advanced → General → Configuration Editor. Follow the procedure: Locate a key called: mailnews.customDBHeaders Change it to: Received After that restart the application --&gt; Right click on the folder and go to Properties --&gt; Repair Folder </p><p>This worked for a few days, but then it started having problems and even repairing the folder, but it didn't help. What they told me was an issue with Thunderbird reading email data on their server, but the problem continued. They kind of ""washed"" their hands, since it's ok on their server and asked to test it on another email client. Has anyone experienced this problem? Attached is an image of what the email looks like, there are several with the data that I asked to repair, but empty.
