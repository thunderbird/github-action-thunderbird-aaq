When the power supply returned my Thunderbird Email would not start up and requested my password which I have forgot as it is a while since I last used it. Could someone please advise how do I reset my password in Thunderbird... Thank You Derek </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Derek_J_Wilson
