I can't send or receive emails.  I wrote and email and since it wouldn't send I wanted to save it and could not save it.  Initially I got the message that my email accounts were black listed.  That stopped and I got another error message that kept repeating itself.  I am not sure what that said anymore.  I rebooted my computer and now it just doesn't work.  I checked my settings and they are still correct.  </p><p>Is there any way that I can go back to the last update?  Is there anything I can do to fix this one without losing all of my saved emails?

Only for MS outlook mail (aka office365 email, but no ofc365 on my laptop, just the email in tbird).   -in unified folder view, my MS mail acct (it still has the ""<a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>"" address, but works), is not present -- that's the problem. A workaround is that I can choose both ""unified"" and ""all"" views together -- but while the MS mail acct now appears in the folder pane at the top, as well as in its own ""place"" at the ""accounts"" area below, that MS mail acct not longer has its messages appearing in the ""message list"" pane.  I have to go to MS Mail's own place below, in the folder pane (as stated above),to see its msgs. in msg pane. </p><pre> I could use the ""all"" view, but it's not as nice &amp; I never have had to choose that before this prob. </pre> <p>- I did run ""repair folder"" for MS mail's own inbox (again, below, in its own place below, in folder pane, accts). And I restarted <a href=""http://t-bird.No"" rel=""nofollow"">t-bird.No</a> change in behavior, unified view does NOT list my hotmail emails. </p><p>I have used &amp; am comfortable w/config ed, but only when I have the proper instructions you may post in your potential reply (I am not a coder). </p><p>Please advise, thank you. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1679826;1680166;1680167;1680224;1680343;1680424;1680772;1680870;,linusr

I have been powerless to stop them, Donald Ericson, and Forrest Kimmel has been using your platform thunderbird to attack my family for four years or longer. I need help because they have no intention to quit. My kids are 13 and 15 and I have been tormented by this group of grown men stealing information about them, and they have Mozilla certificates to do this to us. I guess you let any pervert get a certificate. I promise that i am not going to try and stop it anymore. I am hiring an attorney and suing the crap out of your site. Hope you have cho-mo coverage. </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1679771;,m0ns73r123
