With the latest release of Thunderbird for iOS it does not work when trying to type a message. The default is ""preformat"" and trying to change it to paragraph or other does not work. Older version works on my MacBook Pro (2011). My MacBook Air, Thunderbird writing message does not work. Glad I did not contribute money!

I was using a filter for something else totally unrelated, and suddenly I began seeing only total e-mail number, and the unread are no longer highlighted. The unread are still highlighted in my other folders. Is there some way to get the unread messages in my primary inbox marked again? Otherwise I often don't know which to read.

In both cases, the email address associated with my custom domain is the only one I use for everything, such as email, calendar, contacts, etc (x@er.com).  Also in both cases, there is also a login email address to the email hosting service (i.e. x@mailbox.com and x@icloud.com respectively).   </p><p>Issue: My calendar invites erroneously send from my icloud email address, rather than my custom domain email address.  This appears to be by defaul and unchangeable.  See 1/2 screenshot. </p><p>Settings: I'm on W11 Pro, using TB 115.10.1 (64-bit).  For calendar settings, see 2/2 screenshot.   </p><p>Background: With both providers, my calendar invites initially were being sent from the correct email address (x@er.com), but inexplicably switched to the being sent from login email address of the email hosting service after some time (about a year with <a href=""http://mailbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mailbox.org</a>, and a couple of months after migrating to <a href=""http://icloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">icloud.com</a>).  This messes up my calendars, and I need to resolve it.  Hopefully it's just something dumb that I'm doing. </p><p>What I've tried: On <a href=""http://mailbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mailbox.org</a>:  When the issue first occured I put up with it for a few weeks then assumed it was probably <a href=""http://mailbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mailbox.org</a> and migrated to icloud.  This appeared to resolve the problem at the time. On icloud, my calendar sync was setup in TB using add-ons, which worked for a couple of months and then the issue recurred.  I've tried: 1. In apple account settings: I tried changing my apple-id to be my custom domain email address, rather than my icloud email address (didn't fix it). 2. I then unsubscribed from all of my network calendars in TB, removing the addons and restarting TB, as per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406255#answer-1568028"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406255#answer-1568028</a> - I had to add a blank local calendar first before I was able to remove all of the network calendars. 3. I then added my calendars back into TB by using the direct URL locations, as per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406112"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406112</a> - when adding the calendars back, I tried using the login as both my custom domain email address, and also my icloud email address (didn't fix it). </p><p>Any help would be much appreciated. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",mozilla573
