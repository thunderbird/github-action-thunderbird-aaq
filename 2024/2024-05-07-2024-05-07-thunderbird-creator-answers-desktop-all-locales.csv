In both cases, the email address associated with my custom domain is the only one I use for everything, such as email, calendar, contacts, etc (x@er.com).

This appeared to resolve the problem at the time. On icloud, my calendar sync was setup in TB using add-ons, which worked for a couple of months and then the issue recurred.  I've tried: 1. In apple account settings: I tried changing my apple-id to be my custom domain email address, rather than my icloud email address (didn't fix it). 2. I then unsubscribed from all of my network calendars in TB, removing the addons and restarting TB, as per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406255#answer-1568028"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406255#answer-1568028</a> - I had to add a blank local calendar first before I was able to remove all of the network calendars. 3.

I saw something about Thunderbird and Yahoo and want to make sure I do it right or should use the third party setting for desktop clients that Cox provided for the transition.

My normal practice is to keep only the last email in a thread quoting all the contributions, and to delete the rest. Then I have one email with everything about that in it, with a history trail. I've done this for years and years. Then, some time last year, after an update of Thunderbird, everything was in threads. Someone replies to my message, and the thread goes missing from Sent, and appears in Inbox, but not marked as unread - you only see this when you expand the thread. If you reply, it jumps back into Sent. Finding anything is now a time-consuming nightmare. But there also appears to be at least one bug.  </p><p>Suppose I now go into a thread and delete an intervening email. Thunderbird clears the preview panel of emails. If I click on Sent then back in Inbox, they reappear! But if I'm now confused as to exactly what that delete did to how many emails, I click Edit / Undo Delete. What it seemed to do tonight when I hit the Delete was get rid of a big chunk of the large thread, including some emails I hadn't read yet, and some not in this or other threads! They are not in the Deleted folder - they are gone! I think it has also done this before. What a mess!
