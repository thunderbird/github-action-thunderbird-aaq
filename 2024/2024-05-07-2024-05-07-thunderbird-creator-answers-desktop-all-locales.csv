With the latest release of Thunderbird for iOS it does not work when trying to type a message. The default is ""preformat"" and trying to change it to paragraph or other does not work. Older version works on my MacBook Pro (2011). My MacBook Air, Thunderbird writing message does not work. Glad I did not contribute money! Oh well must be a way to get folks to purchase Office 365, Outlook? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dave.mcinnes

I usually just highlight the email, then click the delete button.  When that stops working, sometimes I can use the Edit menu and delete the email that way.  Other times I cannot delete.  If I come back later, I can usually delete again.  How can this be fixed?  Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mkdeupree
