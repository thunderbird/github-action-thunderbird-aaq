In both cases, the email address associated with my custom domain is the only one I use for everything, such as email, calendar, contacts, etc (x@er.com).  Also in both cases, there is also a login email address to the email hosting service (i.e. x@mailbox.com and x@icloud.com respectively).   </p><p>Issue: My calendar invites erroneously send from my icloud email address, rather than my custom domain email address.

This appeared to resolve the problem at the time. On icloud, my calendar sync was setup in TB using add-ons, which worked for a couple of months and then the issue recurred.  I've tried: 1. In apple account settings: I tried changing my apple-id to be my custom domain email address, rather than my icloud email address (didn't fix it). 2.
