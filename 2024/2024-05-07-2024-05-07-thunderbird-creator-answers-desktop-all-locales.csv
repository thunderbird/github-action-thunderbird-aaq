The unread are still highlighted in my other folders. Is there some way to get the unread messages in my primary inbox marked again? Otherwise I often don't know which to read.

In both cases, the email address associated with my custom domain is the only one I use for everything, such as email, calendar, contacts, etc (x@er.com).  Also in both cases, there is also a login email address to the email hosting service (i.e. x@mailbox.com and x@icloud.com respectively).   </p><p>Issue: My calendar invites erroneously send from my icloud email address, rather than my custom domain email address.  This appears to be by defaul and unchangeable.  See 1/2 screenshot. </p><p>Settings: I'm on W11 Pro, using TB 115.10.1 (64-bit).  For calendar settings, see 2/2 screenshot.   </p><p>Background: With both providers, my calendar invites initially were being sent from the correct email address (x@er.com), but inexplicably switched to the being sent from login email address of the email hosting service after some time (about a year with <a href=""http://mailbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mailbox.org</a>, and a couple of months after migrating to <a href=""http://icloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">icloud.com</a>).  This messes up my calendars, and I need to resolve it.  Hopefully it's just something dumb that I'm doing. </p><p>What I've tried: On <a href=""http://mailbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mailbox.org</a>:  When the issue first occured I put up with it for a few weeks then assumed it was probably <a href=""http://mailbox.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mailbox.org</a> and migrated to icloud.  This appeared to resolve the problem at the time. On icloud, my calendar sync was setup in TB using add-ons, which worked for a couple of months and then the issue recurred.  I've tried: 1. In apple account settings: I tried changing my apple-id to be my custom domain email address, rather than my icloud email address (didn't fix it). 2. I then unsubscribed from all of my network calendars in TB, removing the addons and restarting TB, as per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406255#answer-1568028"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406255#answer-1568028</a> - I had to add a blank local calendar first before I was able to remove all of the network calendars. 3. I then added my calendars back into TB by using the direct URL locations, as per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406112"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1406112</a> - when adding the calendars back, I tried using the login as both my custom domain email address, and also my icloud email address (didn't fix it). </p><p>Any help would be much appreciated. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",mozilla573
