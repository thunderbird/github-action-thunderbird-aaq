I need to be able to get to vivaldi, firefox, libreoffice and others.  Every time I enter one in the application box, the snapper remaps to /run/user/...

Everything was running fine, but some of my mailboxes had lots (thousands) of (POP) emails in them and so I decided to prune and archive.   Since then TB is running very slowly, frequently displaying the ""not responding"" warning.    I have searched ""not responding"" on the forum, but there are 117 PAGES of posts and finding even one that might be relevant to my situation is beyond the scope of my remaining lifespan!  So I apologise if this has already been dealt with and in which case I hope some kind soul can point me in the right direction.  I'm apparently using v 128.3.1esr on a 3 year old Dell XPS13 laptop running Win 10.
