Now none of the applications -- like http handler -- will run because snap maps them all to something under /run/usr/... AND THEY WON'T RUN FROM THERE I cannot even use Help to make a donation!  I need to be able to get to vivaldi, firefox, libreoffice and others.  Every time I enter one in the application box, the snapper remaps to /run/user/...  I try to find that location and it's not there -- of course it won't run! -- and the application won't work. screenshots attached </p><p>Tell me how to roll back from v128.3.1esr to a version without snaps -- without losing 10 years worth of email! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",kmcaywood

1469538,2024-10-16 01:22:58 -0700,2024-10-16 01:22:58 -0700,Very slow TB,"<p>My (wonderful) Thunderbird is driving me nuts. A few weeks ago I decided that some housekeeping was in order. Everything was running fine, but some of my mailboxes had lots (thousands) of (POP) emails in them and so I decided to prune and archive.   Since then TB is running very slowly, frequently displaying the ""not responding"" warning.    I have searched ""not responding"" on the forum, but there are 117 PAGES of posts and finding even one that might be relevant to my situation is beyond the scope of my remaining lifespan!  So I apologise if this has already been dealt with and in which case I hope some kind soul can point me in the right direction.  I'm apparently using v 128.3.1esr on a 3 year old Dell XPS13 laptop running Win 10.
