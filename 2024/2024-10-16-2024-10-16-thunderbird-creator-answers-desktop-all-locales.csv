Now none of the applications -- like http handler -- will run because snap maps them all to something under /run/usr/... AND THEY WON'T RUN FROM THERE I cannot even use Help to make a donation!  I need to be able to get to vivaldi, firefox, libreoffice and others.  Every time I enter one in the application box, the snapper remaps to /run/user/...  I try to find that location and it's not there -- of course it won't run! -- and the application won't work. screenshots attached </p><p>Tell me how to roll back from v128.3.1esr to a version without snaps -- without losing 10 years worth of email! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",kmcaywood
