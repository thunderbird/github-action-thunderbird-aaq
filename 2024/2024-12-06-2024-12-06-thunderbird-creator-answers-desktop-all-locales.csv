Recently, I linked my Thunderbird client (128.5.5 esr 64-bit) with Gmail and now find that my Thunderbird inbox has been completely put under the control of Gmail. Email still arrives at the Thunderbird Inbox but, if not acted on quickly, is removed to my Gmail account, leaving the Inbox empty. It is also removed from the Spectrum server.  I spoke with Spectrum and they confirmed that they are not forwarding the email and that  the solution to the problem is with the settings in Thunderbird or Gmail. I would like to stop all forwarding of my email from Thunderbird to Gmail. I’ve looked hard but not been able to find anyway to do this either in Gmail or Thunderbird. Please advise.
