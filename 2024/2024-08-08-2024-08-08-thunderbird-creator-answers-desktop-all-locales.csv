It's been getting more frequent and today after multiple attempts, and restarting my computer it still didn't work. I am able to use my password to sign into my <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> account and see the e-mails using the mozilla browser (or chrome) but can't sign on at Thunderbird. I have another e-mail address in Thunderbird (at my own domain) and there have been no issues with that address. However, if I am looking at my personal/msn e-mails, then go to the other inbox and return to the msn inbox I am usually asked (repeatedly) for the msn password and login fails. The problem started a couple of weeks ago and has grown progressively worse/more frequent. Any ideas on what happened/changed and what I can do? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1667066;,ROXTRUAX

However the latest release seems to be having problems with moving emails. </p><p>Example 1  - I moved an email from my Inbox to a special folder. The email was present in full before the move.   Only the header appeared to be copied.  I could not undo this and attempting repair on both inbox and other folder failed, as did exit and re-start.  The result is that this email is lost. </p><p>Example 2 - I went to do a bulk move from the search window (something I have done hundreds of times before without incident).  As usual CTRL A, Move to &lt;new folder&gt;, emails greyed out but nothing happens.  Exit, return, repeat - same result.   </p><p>At other times, both these type of operations work fine.  But it is unpredictable.   </p><p>Relatedly, I observe that on start-up the Inbox initially shows as &lt;no messages&gt; and takes several seconds to populate.  Also, my auto-filing Rules are also working inconsistently. </p><p>These two points, and the two examples, are new issues for me since 128 release.  I am using Windows 10 Pro on an HP Envy 17"" laptop. </p><p>Any suggestions welcome as I am now concerned about losing emails! </p><p>Best wishes Roland </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",jollygreengiant
