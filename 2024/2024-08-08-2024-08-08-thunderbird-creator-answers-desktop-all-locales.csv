It's been getting more frequent and today after multiple attempts, and restarting my computer it still didn't work. I am able to use my password to sign into my <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> account and see the e-mails using the mozilla browser (or chrome) but can't sign on at Thunderbird. I have another e-mail address in Thunderbird (at my own domain) and there have been no issues with that address. However, if I am looking at my personal/msn e-mails, then go to the other inbox and return to the msn inbox I am usually asked (repeatedly) for the msn password and login fails. The problem started a couple of weeks ago and has grown progressively worse/more frequent. Any ideas on what happened/changed and what I can do? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1667066;,ROXTRUAX

However the latest release seems to be having problems with moving emails. </p><p>Example 1  - I moved an email from my Inbox to a special folder. The email was present in full before the move.   Only the header appeared to be copied.  I could not undo this and attempting repair on both inbox and other folder failed, as did exit and re-start.  The result is that this email is lost. </p><p>Example 2 - I went to do a bulk move from the search window (something I have done hundreds of times before without incident).  As usual CTRL A, Move to &lt;new folder&gt;, emails greyed out but nothing happens.  Exit, return, repeat - same result.   </p><p>At other times, both these type of operations work fine.  But it is unpredictable.   </p><p>Relatedly, I observe that on start-up the Inbox initially shows as &lt;no messages&gt; and takes several seconds to populate.  Also, my auto-filing Rules are also working inconsistently. </p><p>These two points, and the two examples, are new issues for me since 128 release.  I am using Windows 10 Pro on an HP Envy 17"" laptop. </p><p>Any suggestions welcome as I am now concerned about losing emails! </p><p>Best wishes Roland </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",jollygreengiant

At regular intervals, I get from Kivra that you must verify your email address and when I do that, the email does not arrive either in my email client Thunderbird or via your webmail portal. I myself work with IT solutions and software development, so I am quite familiar with how it works. Most likely, Kivra's email is not whitelisted with you, nor is my email account. How can we solve it? </p><p>Sincerely Martin Larsson </p><p>On 2024-06-20 at 14:38, Ownit Support wrote: </p><pre>   Hello Martin, </pre> <pre>   Thank you for your message, I am terribly sorry for the delay in replying. </pre> <pre>   The mail client that is blocking does not belong to us, you probably use an external client such as outlook or microsoft mail to log in.

For the best part of this time, so at least for over 15 years, I have been having problems that no one has been able to help me with. But, I just love how Thunderbird is laid out, and honestly, I am a creature of habit!  Many friends have advised I move somewhere else, but have refrained to do so. </p><p>Where to start! My initial provider was madasafish, and later ported over to Thunderbird.  After a few years, a female techie. friend set up my mails to use on PlusNet, so I could receive and send on my mobile too.   </p><p>This went fairly well for a while, until PlusNet were not providing a very good service for e-mails, so now it is nearly impossible to use PlusNet, as after each action such as transferring an e-mail to a folder, it goes into refresh mode, and can sit there for minutes or hours!  Is it possible to sync. my e-mails with a better provider other than PlusNet, and if so, could you please help me out with this? </p><p>However, a problem that I’ve had for some time now is not only have I lost a lot of e-mails from Thunderbird (and no one has been able to help me to recover them), but I am having difficulty sending e-mail from Thunderbird.  The limitation of data now allowed on Thunderbird is very limiting, so I have had to learn from my son how to save my e-mails in a separate folder on my pc at a too regular basis. </p><p>What has motivated me to write again after so many years, is that it appears that there are changes coming about by Thunderbird that have been recently advertised, and I was rather hoping that there would be some developments that could make my life easier after such a long time. </p><p>You don’t have to be a techie. to recognise that I am not, so if anyone has the knowledge and patience to help me out, I would be very grateful. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1667202;,stixman
