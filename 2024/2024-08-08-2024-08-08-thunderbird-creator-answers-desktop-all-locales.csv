It's been getting more frequent and today after multiple attempts, and restarting my computer it still didn't work. I am able to use my password to sign into my <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> account and see the e-mails using the mozilla browser (or chrome) but can't sign on at Thunderbird. I have another e-mail address in Thunderbird (at my own domain) and there have been no issues with that address. However, if I am looking at my personal/msn e-mails, then go to the other inbox and return to the msn inbox I am usually asked (repeatedly) for the msn password and login fails. The problem started a couple of weeks ago and has grown progressively worse/more frequent. Any ideas on what happened/changed and what I can do? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1667066;,ROXTRUAX

However the latest release seems to be having problems with moving emails. </p><p>Example 1  - I moved an email from my Inbox to a special folder. The email was present in full before the move.   Only the header appeared to be copied.  I could not undo this and attempting repair on both inbox and other folder failed, as did exit and re-start.  The result is that this email is lost. </p><p>Example 2 - I went to do a bulk move from the search window (something I have done hundreds of times before without incident).  As usual CTRL A, Move to &lt;new folder&gt;, emails greyed out but nothing happens.  Exit, return, repeat - same result.   </p><p>At other times, both these type of operations work fine.  But it is unpredictable.   </p><p>Relatedly, I observe that on start-up the Inbox initially shows as &lt;no messages&gt; and takes several seconds to populate.  Also, my auto-filing Rules are also working inconsistently. </p><p>These two points, and the two examples, are new issues for me since 128 release.  I am using Windows 10 Pro on an HP Envy 17"" laptop. </p><p>Any suggestions welcome as I am now concerned about losing emails! </p><p>Best wishes Roland </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1668670;1668907;1668913;1668916;1670796;1670810;1670962;1670966;1672945;1673247;1673253;,jollygreengiant

I did not change the default mailbox db idle time.  I do have rather large mailboxes that are synced via SMTP, from three different providers.  There are dozens of folders (not hundreds) containing thousands if messages (but not tens of thousands).  Hopefully that gives an idea of scale .. I don't have a massive overload of untended email history but I do have a quantity of historical emails that the system has to deal with. </p><p>I followed the excellent directions online to obtain a profile during one of these high-cpu sessions.  It is available at https://share.firefox.dev/4dAmyAz </p><p>Please let me know if there is anything further I can do to help diagnose this issue, such as generating more specific profiles.

It hangs up and I have to close the program and then restart, sometimes having to do this several times. It will then be normal for a short while, and start doing it again. I am running Windows 7 on my PC, I have the latest Thunderbird downloaded up until two weeks ago I never had this issue. I have not installed any new software either. I did think maybe it was CCleaner or Advanced Systemcare so I uninstalled those two programs yet the problem is still ongoing. Its quite frustrating and I can't figure out why its happening or what a potential fix for it. Thank you to those who respond. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",kinsella5jon
