Thunderbird works fine and when shut down, it saves all the new info in prefs.js file in profile. But if the save is interrupted,the info isn't saved and thunderbird starts fresh. Sometimes you can salvage this by going to profile, looking to see if there are multiple prefs.js files, such as prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js, etc.  If so, you could delete all except the one with highest number, and rename that one to prefs.js. then restart thunderbird to see if contents there. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
