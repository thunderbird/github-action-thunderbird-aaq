I can replicate the problem. </p><p>But forcing the Message List to remain the same is currently not available.  </p><p>The issue is made worse because you have a lot of the 'column headers' enabled, so they appear rather squished up and there is no room to expand any of them. When maximised you will discover you have to drag the vertical splitter to the left (the one which separates the Message List from the Message Pane). Eventually, the horizontal scrollbar appears, but now it's really squished.  Mixed result here - useless Message List but plenty of space for Message PAne. </p><p>Dependsupon what you want to achieve - personally, I would want to make it easier to read the Message List. AS shrinking the Message List width by dragging the splitter is not exactly producing a result which is useable, I  found other workarounds were a better option. </p><p>Current methods to get a more instant result. Reduce the number of column headers you have selected. eg:  You have 'From, Recipient and Correspondents.  You will discover Correspondents shows same as From, so may as well remove Correspondents. You have the 'Status' column which displays New or Unread. New always has a yellow star against Subject. Unread always has a green dot in the 'Sort by read status' column header. Read always has greyed out/no green dot. So do you need the 'Status' visible as well? </p><p>When maximised: Change the View &gt; Layout &gt; to Classic Then Message Pane is below thus allowing a lot more space for the column headers which means they can read more easily. </p><p>I do recall someone posted a bug - it was asking if window made wider or maximised then increase the area allowed for the Message Pane not the Message List if using View &gt; Layout &gt; Vertical. OK I found it: </p> <ul><li> Vertical layout: only the message pane should resize when the main windows is resized </li><li> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1877326"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1877326</a> </li></ul> <p>Looks like they are trying to come up with a solution but not succeeded at this point.

That's what I've found already in some fora. Before I've deleted even more, e.g. ""lock"" (a link, marked ""faulty"" in Linux) and "".parentlock"" (0 byte). </p><p>Linux Mint 22 doesn't use Snap per default (I think it's installable - I'm not sure). Even more, they have introduced a purely Debian based edition - because of Canonical's own development paths - like Snap. Nonetheless, even being an apt package it might be broken somehow as it seems that the Mint guys are quite involved in some parallel developments concerning their code basis. However, I'll try asking in the Mint environment as well. </p><p>Before the last major upgrade of TB I'd been able to access both profiles from Windows and Mint. Both are stored outside the normal Windows environment, on a different drive. Instead of further trying to get access from Linux side, I created a pretty new profile and was able to import almost everything but my local folder. </p><p>I'm neither a dev, nor a Linux nerd. Rather a power user and I'm teaching on a voluntary base how to use TB and other useful FOS applications. As far as I can see the local content wasn't touched by the upgrade and is still in the original text format as it was before. It still works fine under Windows. I've even tried to copy it into the "".thunderbird""-folder in Mint, but it doesn't change anything. Linking the path even to this internal location still shows nothing in TB (as before) and the import fails as well. </p>",axmoz,false,0,1

Thunderbird works fine and when shut down, it saves all the new info in prefs.js file in profile. But if the save is interrupted,the info isn't saved and thunderbird starts fresh. Sometimes you can salvage this by going to profile, looking to see if there are multiple prefs.js files, such as prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js, etc.  If so, you could delete all except the one with highest number, and rename that one to prefs.js. then restart thunderbird to see if contents there. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
