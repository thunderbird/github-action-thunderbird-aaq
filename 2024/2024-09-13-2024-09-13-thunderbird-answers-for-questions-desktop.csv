It's as if Thunderbird knows nothing about the invisible folders. </p>",JLT,false,0,0

If I then use Applemail to move a folder that is Thunderbird-invisible to be inside that first created folder, Applemail then happily shows the two folders (the newly created subfolder and the problem folder) inside that new parent folder.  But viewing even after refreshing/restarting in Thunderbird still only shows the one new empty subfolder inside that new parent folder.  There's something about the old folder that Thunderbird just doesn't like. </p>",JLT,false,0,0
