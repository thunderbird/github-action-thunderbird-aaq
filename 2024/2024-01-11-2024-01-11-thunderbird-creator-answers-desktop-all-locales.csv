This doesn't happen when the events are posted elsewhere, on a  Google Calendar. When I'm about to enter a new event, I can see a line labeled ""Calendar"" that gives me 3 choices ... 2 of them are the same, like xxxxx@gmail.com and the other is GMAIL. I have 2 gmail accounts sharing on three devices ... my laptop, my phone and my wife's iPad. Once I've finished and closed the event, I wait a bit and I get the duplicated item beside it. When I right-click on an event that I've put into Thunderbird, I see a line that says ""Organizer:"" with my gmail address. I don't see anything like that when clicking on a duplicate that has popped up. There is also a Related Link ...  <a href=""https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/event?eid=X2M5ajYyZTluNnRpajBiOWo2OWg2YWI5a2NkaGphYmIyYzhzNjRiOW02cGozaW9wcGNkaW04b2hnY2tfMjAyNDAxMTFUMTgzMDAwWiBnaGNoYXJ0ZXJzQG0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/event?eid=X2M5ajYyZTluNnRpajBiOWo2OWg2YWI5a2NkaGphYmIyYzhzNjRiOW02cGozaW9wcGNkaW04b2hnY2tfMjAyNDAxMTFUMTgzMDAwWiBnaGNoYXJ0ZXJzQG0</a>  ... but it comes up as ""requested URL not found on this server"".

I lost all my Thunderbird contacts when my old computer failed so I wanted to import contacts from my Android phone. I exported all my phone contacts to a .vcf file and then tried to import that file into Thunderbird. It took a while to read about 1000 contacts and when it was done there were no contacts in my address book. Interestingly, when I exported that seemingly empty address book from Thunderbird as a .csv file it was fully populated. I read that file into Excel and deleted a bunch of empty rows and rows with garbage in them. Then I read the edited .csv file back into Thunderbird with success! This took me several hours to accomplish with much trial and error. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",jmeisner1
