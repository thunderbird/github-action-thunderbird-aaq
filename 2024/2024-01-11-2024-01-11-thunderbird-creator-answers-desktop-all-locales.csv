This doesn't happen when the events are posted elsewhere, on a  Google Calendar. When I'm about to enter a new event, I can see a line labeled ""Calendar"" that gives me 3 choices ... 2 of them are the same, like xxxxx@gmail.com and the other is GMAIL. I have 2 gmail accounts sharing on three devices ... my laptop, my phone and my wife's iPad. Once I've finished and closed the event, I wait a bit and I get the duplicated item beside it. When I right-click on an event that I've put into Thunderbird, I see a line that says ""Organizer:"" with my gmail address. I don't see anything like that when clicking on a duplicate that has popped up.

I lost all my Thunderbird contacts when my old computer failed so I wanted to import contacts from my Android phone. I exported all my phone contacts to a .vcf file and then tried to import that file into Thunderbird. It took a while to read about 1000 contacts and when it was done there were no contacts in my address book. Interestingly, when I exported that seemingly empty address book from Thunderbird as a .csv file it was fully populated. I read that file into Excel and deleted a bunch of empty rows and rows with garbage in them. Then I read the edited .csv file back into Thunderbird with success! This took me several hours to accomplish with much trial and error. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",jmeisner1

Thunderbird pops up a Google login page then it is saying it can't connect to the server. Everything is working fine on my old laptop with configuration exactly the same (except for the use of older but still active app password). </p><p>I don't think Google allows me to see my old app password, only generate a new one, but as the new one won't work I'm thinking that maybe Google somehow knows I'm using POP email on two machines and won't allow this until I delete the old app password. Does anyone have experience of this? Just don't want to delete the password in case it stops working on both laptops! Also note that I don't want to disable 2 step authentication as this makes my account less secure and it has been working fine for years with this enabled. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",gordon750
