Napadly mě dvě možnosti řešení: Použít <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/cs/kb/klavesove-zkratky-thunderbirdu"" rel=""nofollow"">reverzní klávesovou zkratku</a> , ale žádnou vhodnou jsem nenašel. Nezná někdo nějakou klávesovou zkratku, která by mohla tyto e-maily zviditelnit v doručené poště?  Filtry, ale ve filtrech žádný viditelný aktivní není (a chování jim také úplně neodpovídá) - lze nějak vypnout všechny ""filtry"" nebo něco jako ""návrat do továrního nastavení"" (se zachováním nastavení účtu)? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,cs,1630019;,smid.ra
