I went thru the whole recommended thunderbird prodedures but no success.  </p><p>So I need your help or I will have to change my email programme. </p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon. </p><p>Thanks in advance.

I believe the right way to go about it is to install Thunderbird, set up all email accounts as POP3 and make sure not deleted from server. But, I see that I have to set up my email before ensuring I don't delete off the server and, thus, the terror at setting up and then somehow missing the critical setting that doesn't delete off the server and pulling everything off the server into my backup. </p><p>Questions: 1) Is this the right way to back up (POP3)? 2) Is there a global default to never delete off the server? 3) For account specific, is there anything I can do to mitigate this? I'm ok doing this command-line too if there's a way to ensure the setting isn't 'missed'. 3) Is there a recommended flow for backing up email and then saving to S3 (might you consider adding this as a feature? Seems like many people would want this?) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1635663;1635664;1635665;,CTmoz
