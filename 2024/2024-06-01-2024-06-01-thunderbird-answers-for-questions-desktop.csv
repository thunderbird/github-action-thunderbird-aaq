Now I have to waste vertical space to see the counter.  What was wrong with its logical position in the status bar?  The status bar has plenty of available space and is something most people will want to have showing, so why now move the counter to another bar that you have to enable?  Where do I submit my vote saying it ""ain't broke don't fix it"" and mess it up - let's put the message counter back to where it was. </p>",eberger5,false,0,0

When I get a message in TBird saying someone responded to my post I can click ""Mark is as solved"" or ""Doesn't solve my problem.""
