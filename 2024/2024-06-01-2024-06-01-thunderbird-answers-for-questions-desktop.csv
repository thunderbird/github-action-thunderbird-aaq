Most of the time Thunderbird works great (why I use it) but after some time, sometimes hours, sometime weeks, I start getting authentication errors. Closing and restarting Thunderbird doesn't help, HOWEVER if I restart the PC then it does start working again for several days. I have two other *.outlook.com account and these do not appear to suffer from these issues, I can send emails from these even when my primary account reports ""Authentication errors"", particulary for the SMTP server. I've deleted the account in the Settings ¦ Outgoing Server (SMTP) list, then recreated the SMTP details.
