When I installed the update on my desktop the view stayed as it was since I installed the program which I think it was or prior to 115. Thunderbird has been updated to 128.1. When I installed 128.1 fresh install on my laptop it has a card style view and I can't change it no mater which view the check mark is on. Restarting Thunderbird after changing the check mark to different views had no affect. Maybe I am misunderstanding the terminologies. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1669322;,g.radtke

After setting up the account as IMAP it took several days to download the full messages (""Syncing"").  </p><p>However, even after the syncing of all 260,000 has completed, I get a message in the Status bar that messages are downloading again; e.g Downloading message xx of 40,707 in Inbox... </p><p>After done, and a few hours later, it start gain, now Downloading message xx of 7,149 in Inbox... This keeps going on during the day with different remaining numbers in the inbox (increasing and increasing numbers). </p><p>I am not sure what triggers the download. Maybe when I look at another Inbox and then return to this Gmail inbox(?) </p><p>How can I troubleshoot this? Is there some way to find which messages are downloading? I am assuming that the same messages are downloading multiple times (I am receiving less that 50 messages/day). </p><p>I am using Betterbird 115.14.0-bb31 (64-bit) on Windows 7. When the messages are downloading the CPU goes very high and the program (and PC ) become unresponsive. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",viking2

Eu possuo 4 contas, no Gmail, que trocavam dados com 4 contas do Thunderbird. O sistema de autenticação de acesso do Gmail já tinha mudado para OAuth. Quando eu mudei a senha, no Gmail, e a primeira conta do Thunderbird não conseguiu mais acessar os emails. A segunda não conseguiu mais acessar os emails inexplicavelmente. As outras duas continuam tendo acesso, sem que eu tenha feito nenhuma alteração, mas o Thunderbird mudou, por sua conta, a configuração de Preferências \ Opções I Segurança \ Senhas Memorizadas, que abre a janela ""Contas de acesso"", e criou duas contas, do tipo OAuth, referentes às duas contas do Thunderbird que têm acesso ao Gmail, mas não criou para as outras duas, que estão sem acesso. Nessa janela de contas, o usuário pode mudar senhas e remover contas, mas não pode criar contas. Solicito orientações. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,pt-BR,"",celso.mitidieri
