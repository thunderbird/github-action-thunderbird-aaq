When I installed the update on my desktop the view stayed as it was since I installed the program which I think it was or prior to 115. Thunderbird has been updated to 128.1. When I installed 128.1 fresh install on my laptop it has a card style view and I can't change it no mater which view the check mark is on. Restarting Thunderbird after changing the check mark to different views had no affect. Maybe I am misunderstanding the terminologies. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1669322;,g.radtke
