When I installed 128.1 fresh install on my laptop it has a card style view and I can't change it no mater which view the check mark is on. Restarting Thunderbird after changing the check mark to different views had no affect.

Eu possuo 4 contas, no Gmail, que trocavam dados com 4 contas do Thunderbird. O sistema de autenticação de acesso do Gmail já tinha mudado para OAuth. Quando eu mudei a senha, no Gmail, e a primeira conta do Thunderbird não conseguiu mais acessar os emails. A segunda não conseguiu mais acessar os emails inexplicavelmente. As outras duas continuam tendo acesso, sem que eu tenha feito nenhuma alteração, mas o Thunderbird mudou, por sua conta, a configuração de Preferências \ Opções I Segurança \ Senhas Memorizadas, que abre a janela ""Contas de acesso"", e criou duas contas, do tipo OAuth, referentes às duas contas do Thunderbird que têm acesso ao Gmail, mas não criou para as outras duas, que estão sem acesso. Nessa janela de contas, o usuário pode mudar senhas e remover contas, mas não pode criar contas.

All mail left on the server unless I delete it. I create a new POP account every year to keep track of emails by year. Have lots of folders to place the inbox messages. </p><p>For about a week now, when I move a message to a folder. Say Paid"" or ""Cars"", the message is no longer visible or selectable. I have read/unread/folder size turned on under my Inbox. So I know the missing messages are there in the folder but I cannot see them or select them. Some of the folders contents have completely disappeared. This a disaster for me. Has just started happening but was working fine before  this TB update. Never happened before.   </p><p>Another note. Just discovered that ALL the read messages have become invisible and unselectable even in the Inbox. Only the unread messages are visible. I will appreciate someone's kind help.
