When I installed the update on my desktop the view stayed as it was since I installed the program which I think it was or prior to 115. Thunderbird has been updated to 128.1. When I installed 128.1 fresh install on my laptop it has a card style view and I can't change it no mater which view the check mark is on. Restarting Thunderbird after changing the check mark to different views had no affect. Maybe I am misunderstanding the terminologies. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1669322;,g.radtke

Eu possuo 4 contas, no Gmail, que trocavam dados com 4 contas do Thunderbird. O sistema de autenticação de acesso do Gmail já tinha mudado para OAuth. Quando eu mudei a senha, no Gmail, e a primeira conta do Thunderbird não conseguiu mais acessar os emails. A segunda não conseguiu mais acessar os emails inexplicavelmente. As outras duas continuam tendo acesso, sem que eu tenha feito nenhuma alteração, mas o Thunderbird mudou, por sua conta, a configuração de Preferências \ Opções I Segurança \ Senhas Memorizadas, que abre a janela ""Contas de acesso"", e criou duas contas, do tipo OAuth, referentes às duas contas do Thunderbird que têm acesso ao Gmail, mas não criou para as outras duas, que estão sem acesso. Nessa janela de contas, o usuário pode mudar senhas e remover contas, mas não pode criar contas. Solicito orientações. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,pt-BR,"",celso.mitidieri
