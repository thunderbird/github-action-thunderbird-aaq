Thunderbird has had a list of outlook parity bugs for twenty years now.  Progress on them is glacial. </p><p>But I do not get you comment about scattered buttons.  F9 turns on permanently an address book pane from which you can select any entry you like a simple double click will add it to the to: field.  Right clicking it offer a menu of actions or you can use the button at the bottom of the list to determine where it is to be added.  Typing in the address field offers matches from your address book that meet your typing. </p><p>The Outlook way You click a button,  select an entry by double clicking and I presume the address book closes. The Thunderbird way  You select the individual in the list,  click the button to send them where ever if you don't desire the To: and the list stays there.   </p><p>I really do not see one as particularly more efficient that the other,  but that is probably why a just start typing because then I can select the one I want after a keystroke or two.

If you have a POP account that you are not using, you can just delete it. If there are messages on the POP account that you would like to keep while also deleting the account, you can achieve that by first copying the POP account folders to Local Folders prior to deleting the POP account. A simple way to accomplish that can be done with the importexporttools addon. Just  - create new empty folders in Local Folders for each POP folder to save.  - right-click on a POP folder, right-click and select importexport menu to export mbox  - then, highlight a new Local Folder, right-click and select the importexport menu to import mbox  - repeat for each folder - once done and checked that you have all the messages, you can safely delete the POP account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In doing it, you may have difficulties and, even when messages are uploaded, you need to spot check to verify that the full messages are there. My suggestion is to do small groups at a time and to create a filter to manage this. Having a manual filter automatically slows the process and that helps ensure the upload is successful. I suggest treating each folder separately. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Like everything you pay for (even with your personal data) there are limits and google do publish theirs.  They are generous for getting and sending mail and backing up files to google drive.
