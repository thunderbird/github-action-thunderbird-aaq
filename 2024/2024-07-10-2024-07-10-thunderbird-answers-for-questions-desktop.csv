If you have a POP account that you are not using, you can just delete it. If there are messages on the POP account that you would like to keep while also deleting the account, you can achieve that by first copying the POP account folders to Local Folders prior to deleting the POP account. A simple way to accomplish that can be done with the importexporttools addon. Just  - create new empty folders in Local Folders for each POP folder to save.  - right-click on a POP folder, right-click and select importexport menu to export mbox  - then, highlight a new Local Folder, right-click and select the importexport menu to import mbox  - repeat for each folder - once done and checked that you have all the messages, you can safely delete the POP account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
