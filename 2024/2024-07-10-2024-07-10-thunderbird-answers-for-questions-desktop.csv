Lijkt mij dat dit niet aan Thunderbird kan liggen en er zijn volgens mij ook geen acties met kleurwijzigingen door bijvoorbeeld themaâ€™s.

The smart mailboxes entry is how Thunderbird manages unified folders. The Mail folder is for POP accounts and any message folders not related to an account that are stored on your PC  (Mail\Local Folders). If you wish to keep the Mail and Mail\Local Folders content on a backup, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder', then exit thunderbird, and you will be inside the profile. Highlight the Mail folder and copy to external media or elsewhere on your PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
