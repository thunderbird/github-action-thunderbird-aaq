If anyone wants the whole gory story, please ask and I'll tell all.  ( I used Eudora Mailbox Cleaner and Eudora Rescue.)  But the simple question is:  is it possible to import a Thunderbird profile created on a Mac into a Thunderbird program on a PC?   Thanks for any help. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1664656;1664662;1664740;,mamaconnie

The system continually tries unsuccessfully then blocks me for too many attempts. 1. how do I delete the two new accounts, one IMAP and one Pop, without deleting the original much used account? 2. How do I change the settings on the old account so it connects through the <a href=""http://messaging.co"" rel=""nofollow"">messaging.co</a> now iinet no longer runs it? It should be IMAP not pop. My attempts so far have just created new accounts and more problems. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rkpwor
