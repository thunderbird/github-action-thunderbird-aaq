I'm looking at previous posts for migration issues.  </p><p>The pressing issue right now is the color scheme in both Thunderbird AND Windows.  </p><p>I installed Thunderbird (Version 102.15.1 32-bit because that's what I had on my old computer) and it had its standard colors.  I was personalizing the appearance in the settings.  I suddenly -- not when I was doing any adjustments to colors, fonts, anything at all -- got the most awful shades of pink and peach, and get this -- not only in Thunderbird, but in Windows!  (Windows 10 Pro)  I had changed absolutely nothing in my Windows display.  I simply set up Thunderbird, moved to close it and did close it, and everything on my computer changed.  The Windows taskbar is still my normal color, but buttons within Windows, borders and buttons on ALL of my apps such as my browser (Iron Browser), you name it ...... something happened within Thunderbird and to my entire computer.  I can't get rid of it by changing the customize appearance in Windows. </p><p>I didn't do anything!  Except maybe I did?  I wasn't doing anything at the time within my Thunderbird settings when it happened --  I know that -- but it did happen while I was looking at Thunderbird's settings and when I closed it.  Does anybody have any idea as to what I may have inadvertently done, and how to undo it?  </p><p>Thank you SO much. </p>",spotterfly;MattAuSupport;sfhowes;,true,false,false,";category:troubleshooting;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Iron Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird",10,0,0,,,
