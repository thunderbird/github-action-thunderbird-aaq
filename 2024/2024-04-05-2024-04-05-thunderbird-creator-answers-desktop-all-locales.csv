I suspect it can't be reproduced consistently. </p><p>Every message (since Mar20) shows a yellow error bar: ""Thunderbird thinks this message is Junk mail.""   [Learn More]  [Not Junk]  [X] Just as I'm composing this, messages also have inconsistent coloring (picture attached). </p><p>Since the message says ""Thunderbird..."", I'm posting here and not google/gmail.  NOTE I just tried the Learn More link and may be able to reset the ""learning"" so this post may have been unnecessary. Still - an unpleasant experience. I did locate the [Reset training data] in Settings and may have to use that. </p><p>BACKGROUND: I migrated from another Mac in January, that seems to be unrelated.  I downloaded several apps from the App Store the day before (Mar 19) but those all seem unrelated. Some Mar20 messages are fine. </p><p>I'm running Thunderbird 115.9.0 (64-bit) ""supernova"" and ""Thunderbird is up to date"" on macOS Ventura 13.6.3 </p><p>Hopefully this is the end of this story for me!

Since then, I have had a problem with good emails - from my credit union, companies I do business with, even mailing lists I subscribe to - showing up in Junk Mail.  I have tried following TB's whitelisting directions on the web, and have also tried whitelisting through my ISP (Charter/Spectrum), but nothing I've done so far seems to have much effect. </p><p>Before I head further down the rabbit hole, I would like to know if there's any way of determining whether it's TB or the ISP that's flagging stuff as junk, so I can concentrate on the source of the problem. </p><p>And of course any suggestions as to how to actually fix the problem would be more than welcome! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jamesqf
