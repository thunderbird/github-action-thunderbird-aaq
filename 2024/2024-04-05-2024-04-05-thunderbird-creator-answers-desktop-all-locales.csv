Since then, I have had a problem with good emails - from my credit union, companies I do business with, even mailing lists I subscribe to - showing up in Junk Mail.  I have tried following TB's whitelisting directions on the web, and have also tried whitelisting through my ISP (Charter/Spectrum), but nothing I've done so far seems to have much effect. </p><p>Before I head further down the rabbit hole, I would like to know if there's any way of determining whether it's TB or the ISP that's flagging stuff as junk, so I can concentrate on the source of the problem. </p><p>And of course any suggestions as to how to actually fix the problem would be more than welcome! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jamesqf

For example, i create an event with ""New Event"", select ""Calendar: &lt;my gmail account&gt;"" and set ""Start: 15:00"", ""End: 16:00"", then ""Save and Close"". Thunderbird Calendar displays it as from 16:00 to 17:00. ""Use system timezone"" is selected in Calendar settings. When i open ""Edit"" dialog for the event, time in ""Start:"" and ""End:"" fields is also incorrect (16:00 and 17:00 respectively). However, when i go to ""Options"" and click ""Show Timezones"" it becomes correct (15:00 and 16:00). Disabling ""Show Timezones"" leads back to incorrect time. Web page and other applications display time for the same event correctly (as i set it during creation). The same error for events created not by Thunderbird but on web page or other applications.

I have 7 email accounts, and to view the email, I use the unified folder view, where the email from all the inboxes appears. The problem is that Thunderbird identifies the spam, since the icon appears as if it has detected it, but it continues to show it. What I want is for it not to appear there, since it is very annoying, and the idea is that only the desired email appears, and the Spam can only be seen in the Spam folder. Well that's what I would like to do. Thank you!.
