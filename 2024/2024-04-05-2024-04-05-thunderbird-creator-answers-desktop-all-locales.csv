I have also contributed money - because I believe in paying for a good product.  I think Thunderbird is quickly moving away from being a 'good product'. </p><p>I have two big complaints now with Thunderbird. </p><p>1. Apparently the 'developers' just can't stop themselves from adding more and more ""stuff"" (called ""features""). All I want is a decent email client.  The tabs to open PDF attachments was a nice feature, when it was added. However, the vast majority of so-called ""features"" that have been added over the past few years are useless to me.  And it shows in how big the Thunderbird application has become and how long it now takes to load and display. </p><p>2. The 'threaded' crap is driving me nuts. It seems like every time Thunderbird updates it puts some/most/all of the folders back to 'sort by threaded' and displaying the thread column and star column.  I hate 'threaded'. If you are updating the application why can't you import my 'custom' settings or at least just leave them alone.  No, you reset all kinds of stuff with nearly every ""update"". </p><p>I guess I have two options: 1. I will quit updating Thunderbird (disable auto-update, if that's possible). 2. Find a new email client that is simpler, smaller, loads quicker, and is less cluttered with ""features"". </p><p>Thank you for taking a decent product and 'improving' the hell out of it - to the point where I am starting to hate it. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1645837;1645973;1646009;1646012;1646094;,hoeldd533
