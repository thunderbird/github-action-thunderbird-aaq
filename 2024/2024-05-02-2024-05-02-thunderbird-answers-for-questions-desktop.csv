The date of that special email with the implicit time format (`Date: Thu, 2 May 2024 05:55:12 UTC`) is not being converted to the local time zone. It should be displayed as 13:55 in the +8 time zone, not 5:55, in Thunderbird. 2. Emails sent from other mail clients with an explicit time format in the header are converted and displayed normally in the local time zone format in Thunderbird. 3. To exclude any issues with the local time zone settings, I changed the time zone from +8 to +7 on my Windows system, and after restarting Thunderbird, I found that the date for this special email in the overview list changed to 4:55, but when opened, the time on the detailed page changed back to 05:55. This behavior is very strange. Other emails behave as expected. The previous attachments showed this anomaly. 4. This special email can be displayed with the correct time on other mail clients. 5. Therefore, I believe this is not a problem with the locale settings, but rather an issue with Thunderbird's date conversion or display. </p><p><br> The attachments contain the following images: P1 P2 These show that other mail clients can display the date for this special email normally in the local time zone. P3 P4 This shows an email sent by a different client a few minutes later with the same title, but with an explicit time format in the header, which can be normally converted and displayed by Thunderbird. </p><p><br> Thank you again for your help! </p>",dangjinghaoemail,false,0,0

Who's even going to know that a threaded email arrived today? I'm calling it ""group"", because the person who sent the first one called it that and everyone who responds to that subject line is being threaded.  It was called a group because it's messaging only a few co-workers from different departments that need to stay in contact.  Threading is a big horses-ass as a complete failure.  Even trying to ""unthread"", they still don't show up as today's mail in ""today's"" in the date part of the menulist.

But you will still have access to them. </p><p>IF the server itself marks emails as spam and you are using an IMAP mail account then those emails will display in the Spam folder. However, if you using a POP mail account which can only access server Inbox then any email your webmail account puts into server Spam folder will not get downloaded to the Pop account. You would only see those emails if you logged on to your webmail account.  </p><p>Thunderbird is just a program running on your computer. There is no server - no server filtering etc. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;: I do have blacklist and whitelist filters set up,.....But CC doesn't show up anywhere.</strong> </p><p>In Thunderbird, the 'whitelist' is set up in Junk Controls and basically means any email address set up as a contact in an a selected address book is considered in a whitelist.  </p><p>The Junk Filter Log (providing it's switched on) will tell you what your own Message Filters are doing with any email that gets filtered. So you can double check to see if one of those filters is somehow picking up something in a CC email which performs whatever you set it to do. The Filter Log button is in 'Message Filters' window bottom right. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:The other alternative is that my Comcast ISP is doing the automatic rejections.</strong> </p><p>That is a very real possibility. </p><p>Your mail account in Thunderbird can only download from server Inbox, if Pop OR display whatever is on server if imap.  </p><p>First you need to be certain your comcast mail account is actually receiving those emails.  Logon to Comcast webmail account via a browser, then get emails sent from CC and wait to see if they turn up in the comcast webmail account and if yes note the folder they are being put into. If they are not being received onto server then you are never going to see them in Thunderbird.  Comcast and indeed any server will have it's own Spam filters. There are occasions when email is marked a spam but still is shwon in mail account. However, if the server has decided too much spam from a certain IP address or email address is being sent then it could just block the emails and they disappear in the void of space. </p><p>Spamhaus is a decent starting point to check for that issue.  <a href=""https://check.spamhaus.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://check.spamhaus.org/</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
