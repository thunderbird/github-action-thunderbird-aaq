Whatever message you receive is from Thunderbird, but only as a messenger. Thunderbird sends your requests to the server, either for receiving or for sending, and returns back the message from the server.

If you password as you know it is appearing in the password manager,  clearly you will not be able to connect as it is the mailkey that should appear there for both your incoming and outgoing accounts. </p><p>Your alternative is to use the yahoo mail settings here <a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN4724.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN4724.html</a> and replace your yahoo username with your ATT email address.  That will allow oauth authentication with ATT.  Again you will not have a password recorded in the password manager for the account, but an oauth access token. &lt;/blockquote&gt; </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I am guessing here that you need an APP password created on the AOL site to access your pop mail in Thunderbird rather than your generic AOL password.
