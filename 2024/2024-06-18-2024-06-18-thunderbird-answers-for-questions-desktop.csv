I asked for clarification on the issue and it is still not understood. From your post, you can receive mail in Thunderbird. Mail is possible to still be received in Windows Live Mail if that account is still active. Are the messages not appearing in Thunderbird? If messages are being received by Windows Live Mail and not by Thunderbird, it could be an error in configuration, or possibly a POP account wherein Live Mail downloads the messages and then deletes them, causing thunderbird to not receive them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thunderbird has addons that make editing raw HTML rather easy. </blockquote> <p>This also works, but is quite painful. I have to scroll to locate the offending style element (including scrolling past the fairly large binary PNG data of an image in my signature). If I could setup a rule to automatically remove this, that would be great. Otherwise, this will remain a workaround; I feel this is something any user could have problems with, and not everyone has developer skills to edit HTML. </p><p>Alternatively, adding a rule so that all ""p"" elements inserted by Thunderbird use a style override of my choosing (which would preserve the line spacing) would be nicer, but I don't know of any addon that can do that. </p>",Kalith,false,0,0

Alternatively, you could respond by rightclicking and selecting 'edit as new' and respond above the client's text. Ok, stick a fork in me; I'm done. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
