Then there is the question of antivirus programs.  Many of them react badly to the arrival of a new version of Thunderbird and at times block access to the internet for days at a time for the new version while they wait for a note from home about the new version not being an ""alien"" that needs to be removed. </p><p>I would suggest you try the following and see if your get an better result;  But note that a wired internet connection is required for the operating safe mode as WiFi is not loaded in that operating mode. </p><p>Please also provide results for the following test on your system </p> <ul><li> Does Thunderbird work as expected in <a href=""/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">Thunderbird troubleshooting mode</a>? </li><li> Does Thunderbird work as expected with your OS started in <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_mode"" rel=""nofollow"">safe mode with Networking</a></strong>.

Thunderbird stores and uses the password you give it, until it does not work.  This gives many people the impression that no password is used,  but it is there in the background all along.  If you access your email via a web browser or phone app, it to will be recording and saving the password. </p><p>See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

If not, with Thunderbird not running, you can copy the message folders to the Mail\Local Folders folder in active profile. From your post, I infer you are comfortable with that task. If not, just ask.  Now, uploading messages to IMAP is NOT a strength of IMAP. If only a few messages, just highlight and move them with context menu. Ifa lot of messages, I encourage creating a filter to manually COPY them, as that regulates somewhat the transfer. After success, you can then delete the local message folders. Do NOT use MOVE, just COPY (to protect you in case the transfer to IMAP causes corrupted messages). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
