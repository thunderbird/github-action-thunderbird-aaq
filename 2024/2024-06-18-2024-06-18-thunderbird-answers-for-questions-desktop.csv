I asked for clarification on the issue and it is still not understood. From your post, you can receive mail in Thunderbird. Mail is possible to still be received in Windows Live Mail if that account is still active. Are the messages not appearing in Thunderbird? If messages are being received by Windows Live Mail and not by Thunderbird, it could be an error in configuration, or possibly a POP account wherein Live Mail downloads the messages and then deletes them, causing thunderbird to not receive them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
