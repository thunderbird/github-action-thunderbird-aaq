For version 115 you would just disable updates now as it has been out of support for some time, 16 will have been he last point release. So there will be no updates.

It is possible to set the text and background colours with userChrome, so make sure to check if you have that, if there is a userChrome.css file.

There is little bar underneath it that highlights when thunderbird is not minimized, but that's it. I wonder if its some kind of windows setting that is hiding the values. I went through the windows settings for taskbar behavior to see if I could figure anything out but still now showing anything. </p>",prestonmeg,false,0,0
