When clicking ""Delete"" in right-click menu, Thunderbird tries to move it to trash. This fails for folders that are shared from another user with error ""[CANNOT] Renaming not supported across non-private namespaces"". When I switch the ""When I delete a message"" setting to ""Remove it immediately"" the folder is deleted correctly. Is it possible to do this just for folders? I tried Shift+Delete and holding Shift while clicking Delete but both did not work, Thunderbird tried and failed to move the folder to trash as usual. It would however be most useful if after failing to move the folder to trash it would give me an option to delete it permanently instead. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",pavelh
