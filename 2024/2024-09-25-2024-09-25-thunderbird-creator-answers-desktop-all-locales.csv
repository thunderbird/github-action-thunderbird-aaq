Routinely have been able to delete older items from Trash folder.  Starting today though, I scroll to the bottom of the folder to see the older items.  TB then freezes, not responding to anything I click on.  Right click on task bar icon and close the program - which reports the issue to Microsoft.  Am able to permanently delete more recent items in the Trash folder.  Any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",neraklrae

1465408,2024-09-24 22:35:05 -0700,2024-09-24 22:35:05 -0700,Problems with latest Thunderbird version,"<p>Several problems 1. Updated to new version and then ran the file/address book transfer. I have 5 email accounts. The prime account and 4 others (secondary). The file transfer worked for all the 4 secondary emails but not the prime email. The address book was reinstated OK but none of the saved emails in the primary account were  transferred over. The saved emails in the 4 secondary accounts did transfer over. 2. When I click on the thunder cloud symbal, only emails for the prime account are received. I use an app called Mailwasher by Firetrust to pre examine incoming emails to help stopping spurious emails from being downloaded into my PC. The emails for my 4 secondary accounts show up in Mailwasher but don't download into Thunderbird. In the past, Mailwasher and Thunderbird have worked great together.  3. When trying to solve my problems, I accidentally created a duplicate account for my prime email address. However, I can't find any way to delete the superfluous account. Having just made a small donation to Mozilla, I feel quite let down! Note: in the previous version of Thunderbird, to download all the emails from all 5 accounts I clicked on ""File"" then ""Download for all accounts"" or similar wording. There does not seem to be a similar transaction in the new version </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rclloyd

However, the 2nd search bar appears to be missing. I generally dont use the search bar on top but the smaller one, where I see a list of all emails based on the search items without opening a new window. The Quick filter search bar opens a new window and its not really effective for me to search for emails.  </p><p>Is there a way to get the old search bar back?  </p><p>Thanks a lot,  Best wishes,  Martin </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",mstoltiii

I spent the last 6 hours trying to flag and delete messages and managed to get about 30 deleted and those were not one at a time.  The same thing happened yesterday as well.  The ""Not responding is so annoying and is all the time now.  I need to roll it back to a version that works.  The ""not responding"" started with the last update but this version is totally unusable.  The OS is Windows 7. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",southern-boy
