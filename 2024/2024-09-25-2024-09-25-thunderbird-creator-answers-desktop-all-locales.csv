I have 5 email accounts. The prime account and 4 others (secondary). The file transfer worked for all the 4 secondary emails but not the prime email. The address book was reinstated OK but none of the saved emails in the primary account were  transferred over. The saved emails in the 4 secondary accounts did transfer over. 2. When I click on the thunder cloud symbal, only emails for the prime account are received. I use an app called Mailwasher by Firetrust to pre examine incoming emails to help stopping spurious emails from being downloaded into my PC. The emails for my 4 secondary accounts show up in Mailwasher but don't download into Thunderbird. In the past, Mailwasher and Thunderbird have worked great together.  3. When trying to solve my problems, I accidentally created a duplicate account for my prime email address. However, I can't find any way to delete the superfluous account. Having just made a small donation to Mozilla, I feel quite let down! Note: in the previous version of Thunderbird, to download all the emails from all 5 accounts I clicked on ""File"" then ""Download for all accounts"" or similar wording.

I do not use the Calendar or Chat features of TB. TB is configured to use the ""macOS Address Book"" (i.e. Mac's ""Contacts"") - and this is a critical feature for me. </p><p>I recently upgraded from MacOS v12.7.6 (Monterey) to  MacOS v14.7 (Sonoma).  </p><p>Now there is a significant delay of at least 10 seconds (sometimes accompanied with the dreaded spinning beach ball) upon starting TB. The sequence is like this: </p><p>1) Start TB 2) Primary Password Required dialogue box appears instantly 3) After entering the password and hitting return to sign in TB ""Home"" window appears but is blank 4) After a 10 second delay (sometimes with the beach ball appearing) the TB window completely opens, populated in the normal manner. 5) TB then seems to operate normally. </p><p>I have read article ""<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1421395"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1421395</a>"". I can confirm that if I ""disable Thunderbird's access to Mac Contacts in Mac Settings"" then there is no delay noted in step 4 above. So it seems the delay does result from having TB access the macOS Address Book.  </p><p>BUT it is a critically important feature for TB to utilize the macOS Address Book (Contacts).  </p><p>I sync Mac Contacts across devices via iCloud, so TB will have access to the current collection of addresses, and I need only use one application to maintain my contacts. </p><p>I can live with the startup delay, disappointing though it is, because I find TB to be the best email application.  </p><p>I do not know if the same issue occurs with the recently released macOS 15.x (Sequoia) - and I'm not ready or willing to upgrade to that version for a multitude of reasons. </p><p>It would be nice if the wonderful developers would investigate and resolve this delay issue. </p><p>Comments, tricks, and pointers most welcome. </p><p>Thanks. </p><p>PS: Does anyone know if this issue persists with macOS 15.x (Sequoia)? </p><p>Mac Mini specs: 3.2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB 32 GB 2667 MHz DDR4 </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1676978;1677597;1677603;,kensolobrown

I can no longer access my ATX tax prep program. </p><p>When I try, I get this message:  ""The program has encountered an unexpected error and needs to close.""

The ATX program worked just fine up until yesterday. </p><p>I badly need that ATX program.  Please help ASAP.  If someone wants to call me, my number is (775) 747-4666. </p><p>Finally, the error message I get when I try to start the ATX program has a link that says ""Show details.""

It says:  ""Unable to connect to the remote server ---&gt; System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it "" </p><p>I have over fifty tax return to prepare before the extended deadline of October 15th, so I desperately need to be able to open my tax prep program.
