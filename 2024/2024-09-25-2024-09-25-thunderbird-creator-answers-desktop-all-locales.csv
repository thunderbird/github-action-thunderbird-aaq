I have 5 email accounts. The prime account and 4 others (secondary). The file transfer worked for all the 4 secondary emails but not the prime email. The address book was reinstated OK but none of the saved emails in the primary account were  transferred over. The saved emails in the 4 secondary accounts did transfer over. 2. When I click on the thunder cloud symbal, only emails for the prime account are received. I use an app called Mailwasher by Firetrust to pre examine incoming emails to help stopping spurious emails from being downloaded into my PC. The emails for my 4 secondary accounts show up in Mailwasher but don't download into Thunderbird. In the past, Mailwasher and Thunderbird have worked great together.  3. When trying to solve my problems, I accidentally created a duplicate account for my prime email address. However, I can't find any way to delete the superfluous account. Having just made a small donation to Mozilla, I feel quite let down! Note: in the previous version of Thunderbird, to download all the emails from all 5 accounts I clicked on ""File"" then ""Download for all accounts"" or similar wording. There does not seem to be a similar transaction in the new version </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1676663;1676670;1676675;1676679;1676700;,rclloyd
