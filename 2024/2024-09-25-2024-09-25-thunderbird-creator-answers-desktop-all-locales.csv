Routinely have been able to delete older items from Trash folder.  Starting today though, I scroll to the bottom of the folder to see the older items.  TB then freezes, not responding to anything I click on.  Right click on task bar icon and close the program - which reports the issue to Microsoft.  Am able to permanently delete more recent items in the Trash folder.  Any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",neraklrae
