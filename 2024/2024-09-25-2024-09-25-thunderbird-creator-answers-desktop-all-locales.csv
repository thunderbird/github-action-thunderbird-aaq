The file transfer worked for all the 4 secondary emails but not the prime email. The address book was reinstated OK but none of the saved emails in the primary account were  transferred over. The saved emails in the 4 secondary accounts did transfer over. 2. When I click on the thunder cloud symbal, only emails for the prime account are received. I use an app called Mailwasher by Firetrust to pre examine incoming emails to help stopping spurious emails from being downloaded into my PC. The emails for my 4 secondary accounts show up in Mailwasher but don't download into Thunderbird. In the past, Mailwasher and Thunderbird have worked great together.  3. When trying to solve my problems, I accidentally created a duplicate account for my prime email address. However, I can't find any way to delete the superfluous account. Having just made a small donation to Mozilla, I feel quite let down! Note: in the previous version of Thunderbird, to download all the emails from all 5 accounts I clicked on ""File"" then ""Download for all accounts"" or similar wording.

Shortly after that, I tried to start the tax preparation program I use for preparing tax returns for my clients.  I am a CPA and tax preparer.  The tax prep program is called ""ATX"" and is a product sold by Wolters-Klewer (aka CCH), and is unrelated to Thunderbird.  I can no longer access my ATX tax prep program. </p><p>When I try, I get this message:  ""The program has encountered an unexpected error and needs to close.""  I have tried multiple times, and get the same error message every time.  I also get that message when I try to start ATX for previous tax years.  I am sure it is the Thunderbird update that is causing this, as I have made no other changes to my computer, programs, hardware, or anything else.  The ATX program worked just fine up until yesterday. </p><p>I badly need that ATX program.  Please help ASAP.  If someone wants to call me, my number is (775) 747-4666. </p><p>Finally, the error message I get when I try to start the ATX program has a link that says ""Show details.""  When I click that, I get a long list of gobbledegook, but one line may be relevant here.  It says:  ""Unable to connect to the remote server ---&gt; System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it "" </p><p>I have over fifty tax return to prepare before the extended deadline of October 15th, so I desperately need to be able to open my tax prep program.
