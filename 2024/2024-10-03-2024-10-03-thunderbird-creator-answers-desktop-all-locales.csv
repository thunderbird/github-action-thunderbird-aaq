I assume it's due to huge file size and number of emails stored offline. Also, I often have to ""repair folder"" to the inbox because the message body is commonly just scrambled text or contains the message from a totally different email message or file attachments are missing, etc....  </p><p>I'm using AOL, so I've accumulated about 50K emails in my account. I separated them by year, on the AOL server, in an attempt to reduce folder/file size(s). Doesn't appear to help, but doesn't make it worse. When I search for an email or sort by a column, it usually freezes for a few minutes up to a full lock up... </p><p>Also, no matter if the inbox is fully synched, the message at the bottom always seems to be ""Downloading Message # out of 48,915"" or whatever the new email count is at the time... After it completes the synch, I notice it starts over from ""1 of   "" after some time. </p><p>Is there a max file/folder size that TB can handle for offline storage? Is there a way to increase the size? I don't want to delete emails as I need to reference years of archives on a regular basis. Do I completely delete (and data) and reinstall? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",younghowie

Right now a lot of us can't use it because of this limitation. The only solutions so far appear to be Owl (for purchase) or DavMail (which requires a separate OpenJDK 8 installation). This is a fundamental need in Thunderbird rather than a third party add-on. I like the look of Thunderbird but, alas, am not able to use it. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",jerry.mahun

MalwareBytes Team up &amp; running &amp; up to date, many yrs. Problem: an attachment, which I tried to completely remove, keeps ""coming back"" in emails, in a specific inbox (only 1 inbox, of 1 acct).  Other t-bird mail accts do NOT have this issue. -The ""coming back"" means that I delete the attachment and empty the t-bird trash. The attachment then plants itself in another email. -Once planted in an email, it appears the attachment completely erases the body of the text of the body of the email.  -The attachment, when opened, is an image of a family. That is it. It is not of any family we know. It is always the same family. -I ""found"" the attachment (using a search program) by name, ""img_2068.jpg"" . Deleted what I thought were all occurrences of this file on the laptop, which were only 2 files, both in temp folders. I deleted all temp files from the laptop, emptying the w11 trash &amp; also running w11 file deletion apps. Malwarebytes has never detected this corrupt image file. -After making all those deletions, I ran the search and the search prog did not detect the file. But I reopened t-bird and the corrupt attachment has attached itself to another email, and the same behavior recurs (I delete attachment, corrupt attachment attaches itself to another email). </p><p>-Also please note, the emails that had the corrupt attachment attached (have been previously not having any attachments), do exist on the mail server (imap), where you can see the the message body/text. And again, once the corrupt attachment infects an email, in t-bird, that email's body/text goes blank, there is no longer any message to be seen. There is just the attachment notice at the bottom of the email border, to be clicked on to open. </p><p>Is the only solution to completely back up all the t-bird accts (address books, sent, drafts, etc.) and reinstall t-bird program (and/or profiles)&nbsp;? Or, would an ""easier"" way work (or has worked), like simply deleting the inbox of the ""infected"" account? I would then download the uncorrupted emails from the imap server in a new inbox. But I don't know where to find this corrupt file, there is apparently no ""attachments"" folder for t-bird. And again, searching by corrupted attachment file name, and removing it as above, has apparently NOT removed all instances. I don't know how else to find it. </p><p>Please advise. Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",linusr
