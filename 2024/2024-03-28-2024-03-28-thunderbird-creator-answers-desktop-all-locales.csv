All my 6 email accounts were listed. I had to click on folders for the message total number to appear. Several accounts received messages but no messages were retrieved for my main email account: bkoopers@irbl.net The 20 to 50 emails that I would normally receive after I powered off the old computer yesterday and up until 5:30 pm today when I setup Thunderbird on the new computer are not there. I logged into the webmail website for my bkoopers@irbl.net account. All emails not retrieved by Thunderbird should be listed there but there were no emails in the Inbox there. I had somebody send me an email. It appeared at the webmail screen. I selected ""Get messages"" for that email account in Thunderbird and I retrieved that message. A few minutes later, several other new emails arrived in Thunderbird in that email account. The emails from the previous 24 hours are just not  there. </p><p>In addition, I have three Add-ons that I had installed: Quick Folder Move ReFwdFormatter ReplyWithHeader </p><p>They are listed in the Add-ons screen but they do not work. They do not say they are incompatible with Thunderbird v155.9.0. Do I need to remove and re-install them? </p><p>Can anybody tell me what happened to 24 hours worth of new emails from yesterday and earlier today? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1644522;1644524;,bkoopers

I am used to an earlier version found in Mint 20.3, which had a header bar, I will call it, for lack of a better term, that let me sort by name, subject or date.  By date, I could sort with ne newest or oldest email at the top.  There is no such here on TBird 115. </p><p>There is a screenshot attached to this post showing at the top of my inbox. </p><p><strong>Now, to answer my own question:</strong> Referring to that attached screenshot, there is an arrow pointing to the button, just right of the Quick filter.  That button will open a menu that provides display options.  Select to sort by, then select Date at the top of the menu and  Descending toward the bottom of the menu, fourth up from the bottom, in my case.  The Descending option will put the newest email at the top. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",FirefoxinUbuntu

Creating a Google mail account, or Yahoo! account (IMAP setting up). Or creating on POP3 module my mail account that I have on my internet provider. </p><p>So, the question/problem is, when I create account, all settings are being created (settings I mean incoming mail server, ports, etc), the authentication of username and password is passed, and finally account is created, with inbox folder, and immediately automatic getting messages begins. And, all other folders under inbox are being created/loaded. What I want to ask is if there is a technique, after account creation, only the inbox folder to be created empty, then not starting an automatic getting messages, and only if I click on inbox folder or press the get messages button, just then, the getting messages and folders begin. Just something like say disable automatic getting messages when creating existing account. </p><p>Is there any way to make this? </p><p>Thank you for your time! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1644562;,netad98

I added screenshot to describe better what I mean. Is it planned to move the action buttons to the top for the new apointment tab?` </p><p>In general it is a bit annoying that the height of the toolbar on top varies. Like if there are buttons and you choose ""show text below symbols"" for it the toolbar is higher, of course. But then if you have a tab without symbols, e.g. the settings-tab or the new appointment tab, the height of the toolbar reduces.
