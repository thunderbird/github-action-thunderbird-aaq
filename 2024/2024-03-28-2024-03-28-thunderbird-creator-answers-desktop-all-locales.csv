By date, I could sort with ne newest or oldest email at the top.  There is no such here on TBird 115. </p><p>There is a screenshot attached to this post showing at the top of my inbox. </p><p><strong>Now, to answer my own question:</strong> Referring to that attached screenshot, there is an arrow pointing to the button, just right of the Quick filter.  That button will open a menu that provides display options.  Select to sort by, then select Date at the top of the menu and  Descending toward the bottom of the menu, fourth up from the bottom, in my case.  The Descending option will put the newest email at the top. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1644740;1644928;,FirefoxinUbuntu

What I want to ask is if there is a technique, after account creation, only the inbox folder to be created empty, then not starting an automatic getting messages, and only if I click on inbox folder or press the get messages button, just then, the getting messages and folders begin.
