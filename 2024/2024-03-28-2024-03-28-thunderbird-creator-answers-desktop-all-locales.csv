I followed these directions: </p><p>Moving Thunderbird Data to a New Computer <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a> </p><p>I installed Thunderbird on the new computer. I opened Thunderbird and canceled configuring it. I copied the Thunderbird folder from my old C drive to the new computer to this folder: </p><p>C:\Users\bkoop\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird </p><p>I opened Thunderbird. All my 6 email accounts were listed. I had to click on folders for the message total number to appear. Several accounts received messages but no messages were retrieved for my main email account: bkoopers@irbl.net The 20 to 50 emails that I would normally receive after I powered off the old computer yesterday and up until 5:30 pm today when I setup Thunderbird on the new computer are not there. I logged into the webmail website for my bkoopers@irbl.net account. All emails not retrieved by Thunderbird should be listed there but there were no emails in the Inbox there. I had somebody send me an email. It appeared at the webmail screen. I selected ""Get messages"" for that email account in Thunderbird and I retrieved that message. A few minutes later, several other new emails arrived in Thunderbird in that email account. The emails from the previous 24 hours are just not  there. </p><p>In addition, I have three Add-ons that I had installed: Quick Folder Move ReFwdFormatter ReplyWithHeader </p><p>They are listed in the Add-ons screen but they do not work. They do not say they are incompatible with Thunderbird v155.9.0. Do I need to remove and re-install them? </p><p>Can anybody tell me what happened to 24 hours worth of new emails from yesterday and earlier today? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1644522;1644524;,bkoopers
