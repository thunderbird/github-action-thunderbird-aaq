Still use PICASA, a Google app that hasn't been supported in years, but still works fine, and immediately would send the selected photos via emClient email. BUT THEN i decided to download Thunderbird; it did not have certain functions i wanted (I doubt any program does), so my computer guy de-installed it. BUT THE PROBLEM is, when i went to Picasa to email photos to a class, it did not automatically open an emClient window, but gave me the choice of using Thunderbird or GoogleMail.&nbsp;??? even tho Thun. was de=installed.  My consultant found it was a MAPI Problem, and we have spent hours trying to fix it, with no luck. FastStone photo editing would also not work to send emails. Is it possible that downloading Thunderbird could have somehow correupted my general MAPI function?  </p><p>We have spent HOURS trying to fix it, and no luck.  Finally i said, let's re-install Thunderbird, and at least now i can email photos directly from FastStone. But not from Picasa, which is a huge loss to me.  PLEASE, i know Picasa is ancient, but now it doesn't even give me the choice of Thun. or Gmail when I click on ""Send by email"". Please,  can anyone help with this MAPI issue?? My consultant tried everything, but it seems to be corrupted in some way. Thank you so much! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1642939;,iaconetti

I have the email on my laptop, but the images are firstly huge and go way off the screen, secondly I can't find a way to easily save them all at once. I have to scroll and right click each one and save as.  Weirdly when I right cilck there's an option to ""select all"", great! so I chose that to select all, then right clicked and saved again. It didn't save all, just the one I clicked on?! I'm sure there must be a better way to save all attachments/images, hopefully someone can advise thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mozilla516
