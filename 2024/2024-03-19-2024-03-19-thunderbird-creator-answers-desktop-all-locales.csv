Still use PICASA, a Google app that hasn't been supported in years, but still works fine, and immediately would send the selected photos via emClient email. BUT THEN i decided to download Thunderbird; it did not have certain functions i wanted (I doubt any program does), so my computer guy de-installed it. BUT THE PROBLEM is, when i went to Picasa to email photos to a class, it did not automatically open an emClient window, but gave me the choice of using Thunderbird or GoogleMail.&nbsp;??? even tho Thun. was de=installed.  My consultant found it was a MAPI Problem, and we have spent hours trying to fix it, with no luck. FastStone photo editing would also not work to send emails. Is it possible that downloading Thunderbird could have somehow correupted my general MAPI function?  </p><p>We have spent HOURS trying to fix it, and no luck.  Finally i said, let's re-install Thunderbird, and at least now i can email photos directly from FastStone. But not from Picasa, which is a huge loss to me.

I recently changed email providers with my own DNS and kept the same mail id.  During the provider transition I had my original TB account and created a new one.  I wanted to keep the old/original around until I was certain all was good with the changeover.  At first, email kept coming in to the original account.  That stopped when the DNS transfer was finally completed.   After that, emails started coming in to both accounts (duplicates) or either account, on what seemed to be completely random basis.  I stopped downloading completely.  I went looking for a way to keep the old account around and stop it from receiving email.
