I am a Windows person, but got this little desktop back in the day for my daughter for movie projects, hobby websites, desktop publishing etc. I also used it as an email backup. I have an old version of Thunderbird loaded on it and was downloading email periodically from a pop account. I changed providers awhile ago and today tried to set up the new account on the iMac. I was stymied by a setting I could not locate on the old version of Thunderbird, and I accidentally removed the existing account and my inbox and subfolders disappeared. I checked a Time Machine backup figuring I was covered by that, but for whatever reason, there is no backup of Thunderbird, just the proprietary Apple mail app which contained nothing. I rooted around and found the pop account buried in my user profile (which is to say I am not sure where this actually is) and I see the inbox and sub folders with .sbd and .msf extensions. Is there a way to import these into Thunderbird again? Many thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1676449;,terri_walker
