I am a Windows person, but got this little desktop back in the day for my daughter for movie projects, hobby websites, desktop publishing etc. I also used it as an email backup. I have an old version of Thunderbird loaded on it and was downloading email periodically from a pop account. I changed providers awhile ago and today tried to set up the new account on the iMac. I was stymied by a setting I could not locate on the old version of Thunderbird, and I accidentally removed the existing account and my inbox and subfolders disappeared. I checked a Time Machine backup figuring I was covered by that, but for whatever reason, there is no backup of Thunderbird, just the proprietary Apple mail app which contained nothing. I rooted around and found the pop account buried in my user profile (which is to say I am not sure where this actually is) and I see the inbox and sub folders with .sbd and .msf extensions. Is there a way to import these into Thunderbird again? Many thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1676449;,terri_walker

In the company since version 115 there have been problems with placing sent messages in the IMAP sent folder. The problem appears randomly.  The problem remained until version 128.2.2.

The recipient of the message receives the message normally. Killing the Thunderbird process and restarting the program helped, after restarting Thunderbird the message was sent normally and copied to the IMAP sent folder correctly.
