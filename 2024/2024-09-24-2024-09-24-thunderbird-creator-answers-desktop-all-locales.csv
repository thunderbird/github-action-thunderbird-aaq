I am a Windows person, but got this little desktop back in the day for my daughter for movie projects, hobby websites, desktop publishing etc. I also used it as an email backup. I have an old version of Thunderbird loaded on it and was downloading email periodically from a pop account. I changed providers awhile ago and today tried to set up the new account on the iMac. I was stymied by a setting I could not locate on the old version of Thunderbird, and I accidentally removed the existing account and my inbox and subfolders disappeared. I checked a Time Machine backup figuring I was covered by that, but for whatever reason, there is no backup of Thunderbird, just the proprietary Apple mail app which contained nothing. I rooted around and found the pop account buried in my user profile (which is to say I am not sure where this actually is) and I see the inbox and sub folders with .sbd and .msf extensions. Is there a way to import these into Thunderbird again? Many thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1676449;,terri_walker

I'w been using Thunderbird since the 90'ties but I'm know reaching a point were I'm feeling quite nervous about actually losing my mails..... And for this security reason I would like some help from the community. Could you please help me with this&nbsp;? I know there's a local folder and that I can save them there. My problem with this is Thunderbird's .file and that I'm only available to open these files in Thunderbird.  But the thing is, I actually prefer the mails to have an appearance like the sample I have as a attachment her and that I can open them in software that show's them readable and hopefully with some explainable data.  As you can se and what I'w done is just printed a mail. We are probably talking about more than 1000 of mail's so I rather do this a simpler way. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",spacepunk

In the company since version 115 there have been problems with placing sent messages in the IMAP sent folder. The problem appears randomly.  The problem remained until version 128.2.2. When Thunderbird cannot place a message in the sent folder, it is possible to save the sent message in the local folder. However, it takes a few minutes before it is possible. The recipient of the message receives the message normally. Killing the Thunderbird process and restarting the program helped, after restarting Thunderbird the message was sent normally and copied to the IMAP sent folder correctly. At first we thought that the problem was with the ""<a href=""http://home.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">home.pl</a>"" hosting. We spent a lot of time testing with them, as well as with the ORANGE internet provider. Without success. <strong>A few days ago we returned to version 102.15.1 x86 (32bit) for one employee. Since then, he has not experienced any problems with sending messages. I would like YOU to investigate what was changed in versions 115 and 128 that might cause such a problem.</strong> If the employee does not have any problems for another week, we need to revert to version 102.15.1 for all employees. However, we know that this is not a safe solution. We should have the latest version of Thunderbird working properly.
