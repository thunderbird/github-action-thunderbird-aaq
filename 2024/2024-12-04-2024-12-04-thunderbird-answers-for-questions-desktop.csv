Using the IMAP protocol is oke, if you do not use that and you do use a pop account switch over to IMAP if ,if that is possible if you become to choose it to like having that option to have that ,and like to create it with these next steps in the software. </p><p>Go to the account settings after that then go to the serversettings and use that option to place a deleted message direct in to that trashfolder.After taking use of that option Thunderbird wil  automaticly create for you a trashcan.

If so, the old profile may still be there. to investigate, do this: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - you are now in the profile in windows file explorer, click back one folder so you will be in the 'profiles' folder. - here, if there is another profile, it should be listed. An IMAP account would be in the imapmal folder and a POP account would be in the Mail folder  - if it looks right, then, in thunderbird, do this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles' - now, click the 'create profile' button  - click next - now, enter a short name for the profile, such as, OLDPROFILE and then click the 'choose' button and locate and select the profile you want, then click finish and launch. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
