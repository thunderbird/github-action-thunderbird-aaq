All seems well, except for the fact that some messages have gone missing from their folders/labels. For example - I have a message thread in Gmail, labelled 'Work', with the subject line 'New project'. As expected, these have appeared as a folder in Thunderbird called 'Work', and a message thread with the subject line 'New project'. But not all the messages in the Gmail conversation are there. It's pretty extreme, too - the conversation on the Gmail website has 10 messages in it, and on Thunderbird only two are showing. So, I did a search for text in the missing messages, and they showed up in my my 'All Mail' folder - but I need them to appear as part of the conversation.  Any advice? This is going to be a bit of a nightmare for email organisation if I can't get it sorted. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",teaandowls
