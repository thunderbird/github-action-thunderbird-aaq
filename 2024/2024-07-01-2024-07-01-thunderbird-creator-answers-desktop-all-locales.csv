I tried setting it up identically on my android and it doesn't work.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong as I run the server side as well. How do you get thunderbird to accept no username or password for the outbound server? I'm using postfix and it only accepts outbound email from my ip address. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",Multicsfan

I continue to get an error message on account noeljc@optusnet.com.au (IMAP) </p><pre>   Connection to server <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a> timed out. </pre> <p>or Failed to connect to server <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a>. I have looked thru all the forums and tried various solutions without success including extending the setting for mailnews.tcptimeout to 3000. I have checked and validated my account server settings are as recommended by my ISP(Optus) are correct for authenticated emails. I even turned off my Norton VPN completely to no avail even though I use Split tunnelling to allow Thunderbird thru it as an exclusion. It appears to me there maybe a bug in the last Thunderbird update causing this. I have had this issue in the past at various times intermittently but it has always seemed to correct itself. I have been in contact with my ISP(Optus) regarding this error and all they could say was to logon to email server via webmail and did not offer any other solution. It appears there is a communication breakdown between my PC and the Email server somewhere. As I stated this only happened after the last Thunderbird update on my PC on 25/6 as it was working up until 24/6. I also have another optus email account for my wife on Thunderbird which has the same error messages. Could the Mozilla gurus please advise what to do. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",njac0011

I was able to SEND on June 18th and left town for a week and when I came back could not Send.  That could be a coincidence.  Have Windows 11, with Defender Firewall and Security virus protection.  I have TB version 115.12.2 up to date.  I have checked with Spectrum for the correct configuration and currently I have as Description: SMTP Server  (on top line);  Server Name: <a href=""http://Mail.brighthouse.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Mail.brighthouse.com</a> and Port 465, No Authentication and SSL/TLS.  My User Name: e-mail address ends in  @tampabay.rr.com and that is the same as shown on incoming server.   </p><pre>My husband just downloaded TB program on his Windows 8.1 which is my old computer that I've been running TB on for 15 years without a hitch!!  ''''<em><strong>And he also cannot SEND.''''</strong></em>  It's very frustrating - we've tried changing server settings since Spectrum uses not only Brighthouse (which is the one they say covers the <a href=""http://Tampabay.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Tampabay.rr.com</a> address) but they also use <a href=""http://Mobil.charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Mobil.charter.net</a> and also <a href=""http://TWC.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TWC.com</a>.  I've tried changing them up but nothing works.  I've tried changing Ports and anything I could change I did, but nothing works.  I did get a couple of error msgs but they didn't help.   Brighthouse timed out and another msg was saying that the email address I was sending as had to match the email address of the authentication and that didn't make sense as I have only had one address &amp; (typed correctly in all places).  I have called Spectrum more than once and asked for an upper level, however, they were no help at all saying they have no resp. for 3rd party etc.    I HOPE YOU CAN HELP SOLVE THIS MYSTERY.  </pre> <p>Thank you!   </p><pre>Tabatha </pre>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",kdunn004
