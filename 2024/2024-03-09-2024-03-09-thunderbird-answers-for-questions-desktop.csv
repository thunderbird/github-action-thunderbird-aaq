Is that normal to see under certain circumstances? </p><p>And why would the Gloda suddenly need rebuilding, after I was only archiving messages?

My experience over the last 10 or more years with it, is that GLOD actually messes up it's indexes and keeps stuff after it is deleted, or pointers to moved mail and generally drops the ball on a whole host of other questionable things,  so at the first hint of slowness,  hanging or dodgy search result I rebuild it. An occasions rebuild post major changers is usually a better result than letting it flog around interminably.  A rebuild usually takes less than a day and for some reason does not cause those interminable waits while it works out what to index.  It is a good overnight job. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

After turning the indexer back on, it indexed the new archive folders but now it's gone back to indexing every message I guess, I just don't understand that part.  It's normal to index new messages/folders and then go back and recreate the whole index of every message?  Got the total under 100k now at least.  Ok, I'll let it run over night. </p>",scarlion,false,0,0
