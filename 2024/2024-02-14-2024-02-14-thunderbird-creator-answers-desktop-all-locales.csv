Whenever I go to make a change in the settings or the account list, it does not save the next time I log in.  2 examples.  I change the top of the message window menu from ""Icons besides text"" to ""Icons Only"", but if I close Thunderbird and come back in, the menu bar is back to ""Icons besides text"". This is annoying but bearable.   </p><p>But recently, I tried to add another email/gmail account. I can add it without a problem, see my inbox, receive and send messages, etc.  But again, when I exit the Thunderbird application and re-enter, the new account is gone and I have to add it again.  Somewhere, a config file is not updating, but I don't know where. Any ideas? This is more of a ""well, I guess I need to look for another mail client"" problem. </p><p>Thanks,  Chris </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1636875;1636902;1636907;,chris_gulli

TB 115.7.0 (64 bit) on windows 10, 32 GB RAM, intel i7-6700 CPU@3.40GHz I signed up for an account on the newsserver <a href=""http://astraweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">astraweb.com</a> which has a very high message retention, around <strong>21 years</strong> in the groups I subscribed to!!! in two groups I subscribed to, it downloaded 1410000 and 3031000 headers (no messages)... since after this massive download it was slow and unresponsive often, I repaired the folders of those groups and deleted the startup cache... in response the TB re-downloaded everything again, remained not responding for about 20 minutes and during this process used over 20 GB of RAM memory (see attached image). now it's using about 8.5 GB RAM, but every time I click on one group or another of astraweb it freezes with a ""not responding"" message until some mysterious task finishes... I could try to limit the number of headers downloaded in the account settings but I will only do it if I have to... If I don't find some solution, this way TB is almost unusable... </p><p>before posting on bugzilla and before deleting the older headers, do you think there is anything else I can do to avoid freezing TB on that server? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1637124;1637822;1637823;1637857;1637864;1638080;1638084;1638099;,filigrana

In the past year or so, emails from one sender don't show remote content while all other emails do. If I recall correctly, this wasn't a problem in the early part of 2023 but I'm not sure. I have done the following: checked allow remote content for all emails; explicitly allowed remote content from the URLs of the sender; restarted TB and my PC from a cold start after making changes; used the HTML of the emails to locate the document on the sender's server so I know it's there. I am at a loss as to what to do now. These emails also contain a link that allows the same graphic to be displayed on a browser and that works. I receive a fairly large number of emails daily so I have a lot of filters and the emails missing content have been moved to their appropriate folder by the filtering (only one folder is involved for these emails). These emails are sent by the community where I live which does not have any technical support office so I have no success trying to get someone to help me. I do think it's their problem but I don't know how to prove that. Can anyone suggest something that I could try? Are there any TB flags that might have been set somewhere that are preventing the remote content from displaying? I have included images of the email (2 pages) and the HTML (3 pages). I would be very happy to try just about anything to get this to work or to prove the sender needs to fix something. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1637026;1640374;,LesK13
