Whenever I go to make a change in the settings or the account list, it does not save the next time I log in.  2 examples.  I change the top of the message window menu from ""Icons besides text"" to ""Icons Only"", but if I close Thunderbird and come back in, the menu bar is back to ""Icons besides text"". This is annoying but bearable.   </p><p>But recently, I tried to add another email/gmail account. I can add it without a problem, see my inbox, receive and send messages, etc.  But again, when I exit the Thunderbird application and re-enter, the new account is gone and I have to add it again.  Somewhere, a config file is not updating, but I don't know where. Any ideas? This is more of a ""well, I guess I need to look for another mail client"" problem. </p><p>Thanks,  Chris </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1636875;,chris_gulli

TB 115.7.0 (64 bit) on windows 10, 32 GB RAM, intel i7-6700 CPU@3.40GHz I signed up for an account on the newsserver <a href=""http://astraweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">astraweb.com</a> which has a very high message retention, around <strong>21 years</strong> in the groups I subscribed to!!! in two groups I subscribed to, it downloaded 1410000 and 3031000 headers (no messages)... since after this massive download it was slow and unresponsive often, I repaired the folders of those groups and deleted the startup cache... in response the TB re-downloaded everything again, remained not responding for about 20 minutes and during this process used over 20 GB of RAM memory (see attached image). now it's using about 8.5 GB RAM, but every time I click on one group or another of astraweb it freezes with a ""not responding"" message until some mysterious task finishes... I could try to limit the number of headers downloaded in the account settings but I will only do it if I have to... If I don't find some solution, this way TB is almost unusable... </p><p>before posting on bugzilla and before deleting the older headers, do you think there is anything else I can do to avoid freezing TB on that server? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",filigrana
