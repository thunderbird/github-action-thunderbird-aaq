GEEZ, ever since this new total rebuild, it's become so inconsistent and unstable as to be almost unusable. </p><p>In fact, now I can't use it at all because a single keystroke causes it to crash. Even the crash reporter crashes! I am on the latest version 115.7.0 I have gone into troubleshooting mode, disabling all add-ons </p><p>Nothing helps. The problems began with the mouse double-clicking with a single click. Fixed that with removing and reinstalling mouse device driver. </p><p>Now, as mentioned, when I reply, place a cursor and type a single keystroke, Tbird crashes. As mentioned it pops up a crash reporter. I can't type in that...as soon as I try, it crashes! (Yes, the crash reporter crashes!) </p><p>Sadly, I am really dependent on Thunderbird. Is there anyway I can go back to a stable version before this giant rebuild was created. Seems the problems all began then. </p><p>thanks for any help, advice, Pradhan </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",pradhanbalter

Can it be because of this size? I already compacted it, so that size is already compacted. </p><p>I wanna keep all my emails for reference and archive, and on the server side this is no issue, I pay for a provider. Now I also wanna keep ALL my mails locally on my PC in a mail client, in Thunderbird. So ideally I don't wanna delete emails, delete large attachments, or split them into sub-folders by year etc. </p><p>Does anyone have an idea what the best solution could be? </p><p>Thanks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1636736;,r_matz

Trying to soften background with a lighter shades rather than glaring white. I am no IT person but like to dabble on a spare PC to try and get it right. </p><p>I have tried applying this method  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1418832"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1418832</a>  with no change or noticeable damage. Feel as so though its close I have mixed it up a bit with the 2 examples given with half a dozen of my thoughts to no avail. Here is my last .CSS file attempt . See below </p><p>I realise I donâ€™t understand all of this and I could go learn all about .CSS Files. I also realise I could spend any amount of time learning it. To not use in the next couple of years and I have forgotten or it has changed again. So please if someone could help me out here. I thank you in advance and appreciate the contributors here for their post that I have used in the past. </p><p>Regards George </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dregs

I moved a couple of them to the local folder using drag and drop.  It seemed to be going OK but when I went to double check the content, all the messages where gone.  I could not find them in trash nor were they in the ""from"" or ""destination"" folder.  The only things that were saved were the folders and subfolders. </p><p>This seemed like a simple move operation but it has gone very wrong.  Any ideas why? </p><p>I have backups.  Can someone point me to the procedure to recover specific folders in email? </p><p>I have been trying to search for a solution but have not been successful in even finding this issue. </p><p>This is on a Win10 PC running 115.7.0 (64-bit) version of Tbird. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",SaratogaGap
