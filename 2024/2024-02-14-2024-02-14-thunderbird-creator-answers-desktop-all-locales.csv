In the past year or so, emails from one sender don't show remote content while all other emails do. If I recall correctly, this wasn't a problem in the early part of 2023 but I'm not sure. I have done the following: checked allow remote content for all emails; explicitly allowed remote content from the URLs of the sender; restarted TB and my PC from a cold start after making changes; used the HTML of the emails to locate the document on the sender's server so I know it's there. I am at a loss as to what to do now. These emails also contain a link that allows the same graphic to be displayed on a browser and that works. I receive a fairly large number of emails daily so I have a lot of filters and the emails missing content have been moved to their appropriate folder by the filtering (only one folder is involved for these emails). These emails are sent by the community where I live which does not have any technical support office so I have no success trying to get someone to help me. I do think it's their problem but I don't know how to prove that. Can anyone suggest something that I could try? Are there any TB flags that might have been set somewhere that are preventing the remote content from displaying? I have included images of the email (2 pages) and the HTML (3 pages). I would be very happy to try just about anything to get this to work or to prove the sender needs to fix something. </p>",LesK13;MattAuSupport;,true,false,false,;category:privacy-and-security;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:122.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/122.0;product:thunderbird,2,0,0,,,
