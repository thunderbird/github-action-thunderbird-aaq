GEEZ, ever since this new total rebuild, it's become so inconsistent and unstable as to be almost unusable. </p><p>In fact, now I can't use it at all because a single keystroke causes it to crash. Even the crash reporter crashes! I am on the latest version 115.7.0 I have gone into troubleshooting mode, disabling all add-ons </p><p>Nothing helps. The problems began with the mouse double-clicking with a single click. Fixed that with removing and reinstalling mouse device driver. </p><p>Now, as mentioned, when I reply, place a cursor and type a single keystroke, Tbird crashes. As mentioned it pops up a crash reporter. I can't type in that...as soon as I try, it crashes! (Yes, the crash reporter crashes!) </p><p>Sadly, I am really dependent on Thunderbird. Is there anyway I can go back to a stable version before this giant rebuild was created. Seems the problems all began then. </p><p>thanks for any help, advice, Pradhan </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",pradhanbalter

Can it be because of this size? I already compacted it, so that size is already compacted. </p><p>I wanna keep all my emails for reference and archive, and on the server side this is no issue, I pay for a provider. Now I also wanna keep ALL my mails locally on my PC in a mail client, in Thunderbird. So ideally I don't wanna delete emails, delete large attachments, or split them into sub-folders by year etc. </p><p>Does anyone have an idea what the best solution could be? </p><p>Thanks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1636736;,r_matz

I moved a couple of them to the local folder using drag and drop.  It seemed to be going OK but when I went to double check the content, all the messages where gone.
