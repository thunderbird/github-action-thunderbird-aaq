When I get the account settings window, it shows the correct smtp server for yahoo.  (<a href=""http://smtp.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.yahoo.com</a>) but when I click on the edit SMTP button, there is a section called ""Security and Authentication"" section with 3 lines </p><pre>     Connection Security:             [SSL/TLS]      Authentication Method&nbsp;:        [0AUTH2]      User Name:                             [*****1@cox.net]  (My accounts were transferred from COX to Yahoo) </pre> <p>If I edit the SMTP on any of my cox accounts, it changes them all to the same user name.  If I want to send mail from any cox account, I have to go to account settings first and edit the smtp and put in the correct account.  This is very tedious. </p><p>I have noticed that my gmail accounts do the same thing, but gmail doesn't care. Here is the error I get when sending mail before going to account settings first to change the account. </p><p><strong><em>Sending of the message failed.</em> </strong> <em>An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: Request failed; Mailbox unavailable. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again.</em><strong></strong> </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",patnsandy

They  still have the same name such as xxxxx@cox.net.  It was difficult to get everything working, and I almost succeeded.  There is still a problem with SMTP and I have submitted a separate question in this forum.  </p><p>All my Gmail accounts are in the unified folder.  The Cox accounts used to be there, but no longer. I have tried multiple times to get them there, but they won't move.  Both the Cox and Gmail use 0AUTH2 and SSL/TLS. I prefer to have all my email in the unified folder so I don't miss anything. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",patnsandy
