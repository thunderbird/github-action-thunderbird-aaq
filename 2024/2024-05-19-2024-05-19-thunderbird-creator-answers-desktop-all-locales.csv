It is similar to my last post about Firefox on that system.  Updating is hanging.  About Thunderbird shows an update available, just as that feature on Firefox did last week.  However, though it indicates that it is attempting to download, it shows that nothing is downloading.  So, there is a spinning icon on the left, but zero bytes downloading, just as Firefox did.  After a restart last week Firefox applied the download.  The same action occurs now with Thunderbird.  To contrast, that same update just downloaded and applied on this Mac Monterey.  The version on Windows 10 is 115.10.2, 64-Bit.  There is a general Windows Update problem on that system.  Edge, on the other hand, downloads its updates without any problem.  I just ran a Troubleshooter that Windows makes available under Settings, Update and Security, Troubleshoot.  Right now I am about to restart that computer. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1653523;1654087;,tightpurchaser
