When I get the account settings window, it shows the correct smtp server for yahoo.

If I want to send mail from any cox account, I have to go to account settings first and edit the smtp and put in the correct account.  This is very tedious. </p><p>I have noticed that my gmail accounts do the same thing, but gmail doesn't care. Here is the error I get when sending mail before going to account settings first to change the account. </p><p><strong><em>Sending of the message failed.</em> </strong> <em>An error occurred while sending mail.

They  still have the same name such as xxxxx@cox.net.  It was difficult to get everything working, and I almost succeeded.  There is still a problem with SMTP and I have submitted a separate question in this forum.  </p><p>All my Gmail accounts are in the unified folder.  The Cox accounts used to be there, but no longer. I have tried multiple times to get them there, but they won't move.  Both the Cox and Gmail use 0AUTH2 and SSL/TLS. I prefer to have all my email in the unified folder so I don't miss anything. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1653551;,patnsandy

It is similar to my last post about Firefox on that system.  Updating is hanging.  About Thunderbird shows an update available, just as that feature on Firefox did last week.  However, though it indicates that it is attempting to download, it shows that nothing is downloading.  So, there is a spinning icon on the left, but zero bytes downloading, just as Firefox did.  After a restart last week Firefox applied the download.  The same action occurs now with Thunderbird.  To contrast, that same update just downloaded and applied on this Mac Monterey.  The version on Windows 10 is 115.10.2, 64-Bit.  There is a general Windows Update problem on that system.  Edge, on the other hand, downloads its updates without any problem.  I just ran a Troubleshooter that Windows makes available under Settings, Update and Security, Troubleshoot.  Right now I am about to restart that computer. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1653523;,tightpurchaser
