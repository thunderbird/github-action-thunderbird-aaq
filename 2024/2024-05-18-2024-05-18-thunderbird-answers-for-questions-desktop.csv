You can certainly set those folders to automatically delete content after a period of time,  but marking mail as junk does not delete it,  only move it. </p><p>Those settings are in account settings &gt; Junk settings. </p><p>The second issue is depending on how many account you add to Thunderbird,  each has it's own junk/Spam and trash/deleted folders (names can vary)  and It is also possible in the case of IMAP mail account that the server does not correctly identify those folders as such when it is first connected to in the account setup.  This can result in multiple folders in a single account which apparently have the same purpose. </p><p>I have that in a Gmail account from where I was fiddling with some settings.

Do you think I could safely delete the the ""Junk E-mail"" folder (which rarely seems to contain anything), and the ""Trash"" folder once and for all?  </p><p>It can be a bit confusing that manually deleting items from ""Trash"" simply moves them to ""Junk""... Also, that while the ""Junk"" folder offers the options ""Empty Deleted"" and ""Empty Junk"", in practice they are interchangeable and delete everything in the folder.

Is the folder empty? Or does it contain email? </p><p>I say I am guessing,  because it might not be your provider,  it might be your phone app that creates and uses the folder.  It is one of the things about synchronicity  changes reflect everywhere you use IMAP.  That the Junk folder is also flagged with a trashcan, indicating it is a ""deleted mail"" folder only adds to the mystery. </p><p>Who provides your email account?  and in the same vein,  is the account provider offering the service in multiple languages?  My observation over the years is these sorts of issue are often associated with language conversions server side. </p><p>But I think this can be fixed once we work out what the server wants to use,  the relevant settings in Thunderbird need to be changed to match. </p><p>So lets start by having a look in the account settings. In Server settings what folder is set to be the one you move deleted mail to.  If it is set to junk,  change it to trash.  If it is set to trash  report that back. </p><p>Then in junk settings have a look at the bottom for the folder that new junk mail is dropped in.  Normally that is set to junk,  but in your case it is set to SPAM,  leave it alone,  but note if I am wrong. </p><p>Now we have to figure out what your provide thinks is the correct folders.  Often the best way to do this is look in their webmail and note the folder names they use.  It is not foolproof as yahoo use a ""bulk mail"" folder for spam/Junk  but to not reflect it in their web page.  But it will offer some sound clues. </p><p>Microsoft for instance have a ""Junk E-Mail folder in their exchange offering  which powers <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> and office365  so if they are your provider then things would be getting to known ground,  but they also have a ""deleted"" folder and you apparently do not.
