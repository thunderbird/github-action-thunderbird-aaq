You can certainly set those folders to automatically delete content after a period of time,  but marking mail as junk does not delete it,  only move it. </p><p>Those settings are in account settings &gt; Junk settings. </p><p>The second issue is depending on how many account you add to Thunderbird,  each has it's own junk/Spam and trash/deleted folders (names can vary)  and It is also possible in the case of IMAP mail account that the server does not correctly identify those folders as such when it is first connected to in the account setup.  This can result in multiple folders in a single account which apparently have the same purpose. </p><p>I have that in a Gmail account from where I was fiddling with some settings.

Do you think I could safely delete the the ""Junk E-mail"" folder (which rarely seems to contain anything), and the ""Trash"" folder once and for all?  </p><p>It can be a bit confusing that manually deleting items from ""Trash"" simply moves them to ""Junk""... Also, that while the ""Junk"" folder offers the options ""Empty Deleted"" and ""Empty Junk"", in practice they are interchangeable and delete everything in the folder. Living with the latter is not a problem, but you tend to worry when computers and applications do apparently irrational or inexplicable things. </p>",stathatos1,false,0,0
