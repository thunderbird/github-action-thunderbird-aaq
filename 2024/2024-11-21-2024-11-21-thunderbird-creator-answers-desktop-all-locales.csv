I get mail for AccountA via IMAP on Thunderbird, no problem, and have for years. For over a year now I've been unable to collect mail for my second-string address, AccountB, on Thunderbird, and have had to get it in the browser. </p><p>I've finally decided to do something about this. I removed AccountB from Thunderbird &amp; set it up again. I'm using the exact same settings (in Thunderbird and in Gmail) that I do for AccountA, the only difference is the password. I've double-checked the password, too. But when I try to connect, I get a pop-up: </p> <hr> <p>titled: Enter credentials for AccountB@gmail.com on <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> [a very long URL which I've copied &amp; saved] page from Google: </p><p>400. That's an error. The server cannot process the request because it is malformed. It should not be retried. That's all we know. </p> <hr> <p>Thanks a heap, guys! </p><p>Is this problem coming from Thunderbird, or from Google? What do I do now? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>MEC </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",curtin.me

While that mostly worked, I wanted a better idea. So I got rid of the blacklist, and just have a White list. If any email address isn't in the White list, I want the email to be automatically transferred to the Junk emal folder. </p><p>The concept seems to work, except that I want to also accept all email in my address book when it falls thru the whitelist filter, but I don't know how to specify this. Is it possible? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1689219;,Don-Peters
