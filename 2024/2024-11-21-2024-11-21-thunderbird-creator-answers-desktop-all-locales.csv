In the folder with emails from my sister (top folder with a few hundred emails, subfolders going back to 2004 with thousands of emails), all the emails after Nov. 7 had disappeared. That could be a only a couple of dozen emails. They also disappeared from my iPhone.  (Now play the Twilight Zone music). </p><p>Then there is a folder called Randy (me) with various subfolders going back as long. Many fewer emails were there. It was mostly for receiving  bcc's of emails sent from my iPhone, and most of those had been moved immediately to my Sent folders. They are still there. But there still should have been hundreds of emails. Every single one, plus all the subfolders, have disappeared. </p><p>A fix I've seen here might be to rebuild the entire message database. That would only work if the messages were still there but simply not synced any more. Last time I did it I had all the messages, but the search function had become erratic. It took overnight.
