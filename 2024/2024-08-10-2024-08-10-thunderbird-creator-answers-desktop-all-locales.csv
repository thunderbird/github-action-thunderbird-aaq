Until recently they both worked fine.  Now while one of them continues to work, mail for the other is never downloaded.  Comparing the Thunderbird Server Settings for the two accounts, they appear to be identical except for User Name and MessageStorage/Local Directory. </p><p>Even more confusing, I have identical accounts on both a laptop and a desktop computer.  I get the problem with the laptop (above), but *not* with the desktop, where I have Thunderbird v. 102.15.1 installed! </p><p>Is there some setting I'm overlooking? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",coffent1

The website is hosted on the server of a member of the club, but we need to remove the website from his server. We have decided to close the website down. Will this impact on our email? If necessary, we can create a new Thunderbird email address, which is an inconvenience, but is there any way Thunderbird can move all the existing emails across to a new address? If not, I will have to save them all some other way, which is a big job. Many thanks in anticipation. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",ghf67

For some reason, this is not working anymore and now I have my computer connected via wifi. As soon as I changed from cable to wifi, Thunderbird started to ask permission to connect to my Google account every time I open Thunderbird. Sometimes I have to grant permission several times. At some point, it stops and I can keep on with my work until the next time I restart my computer and open Thunderbird. Then the cycles starts all over again.
