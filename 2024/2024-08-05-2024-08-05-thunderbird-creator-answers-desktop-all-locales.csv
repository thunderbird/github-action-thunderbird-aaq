After updating to version 128, my Thunderbird has been very sluggish. While trying to troubleshoot that, I used Properties-&gt;Repair Folder on the inbox, which is when the current problem started. </p><p>In the main inbox window, everything looks fine. All emails are there, with correct subject names and correspondents, etc. Everything received before April 8 this year looks to be unaffected, but if I try to open up anything later than that, it displays a chunk of a completely different email from like 2007, with the From: and Subject: fields blank. </p><p>Additionally, doing the repair marked all emails from April 21, 2008 and earlier as unread. </p><p>I use POP3 to download all emails to my computer, two addresses going to the inbox. </p><p>I tried using Properties-&gt;Repair Folder again, but it still leaves the same result. </p><p>If I open the gigantic ""Inbox"" file in my Thunderbird profile folder in notepad++, scrolling down to the bottom I see the emails are still there, so they're not completely missing. In between the last good email and the first bad one, there is a huge section that starts with: </p><p>--=-SgCIEz327q/2h3s2MXJ25A== Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Id: &lt;92b40d02-593e-4a4a-8768-a31f564d0d90&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 </p><p>and then hundreds of lines of gibberish, followed by ""--=-SgCIEz327q/2h3s2MXJ25A==--"" and then it goes to the next email. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",peter850

I have installed the newest version of Thunderbird- 128.0.1esr, but my Thunderbird was not working properly. So, I installed older version- 115.13.0. But after this installation and after creating a new profile for my account, I have these two issues.  First- there are some additional folders in my home page (image 1)- I cannot delete or move them.  Also, I don't have my old e-mails- both in ""Inbox"" and <em>Sent</em> folders. I can't also import them from another profile, because there is an error (image 2 and 3). </p><p>What should I do? Uninstall and install thunderbird again? Try to import my archives some another way?
