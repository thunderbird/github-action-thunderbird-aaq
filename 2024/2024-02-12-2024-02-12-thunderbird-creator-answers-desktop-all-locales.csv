I have years of Thunderbird messages on it.  The repair is complete and Thunderbird is working well again. </p><p>However, for several weeks I was only able to send and receive messages via my ISP Webmail.  I would now like to move these messages into Thunderbird on my repaired desktop computer. </p><p>I cannot find an elegant way to do this.  I know I send forward or resend all of these messages from Webmail to the main address on the desktop and then move them into the appropriate In or Out folders.  But, I have downloaded all of these messages onto a flash drive and would like to use it to load the messages. </p><p>I would appreciate any advice about the best way to do this. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rob86a
