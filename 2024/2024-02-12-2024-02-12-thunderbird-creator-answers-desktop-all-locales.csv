I've been using T-Bird for decades.  I have 5 e-mail accounts from various e-mail providers, all collected under t-bird,  But recently the one account that connects to an outlook server has been generating password reject messages in bursts and then goes quiet, connecting regularly and pulling mail.  I thought it might be from using obsolete domain names as microsoft has been pushing to get people on office365 domains.  So I tried changing that one account to using an <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> domain. That seemed to improve things for a few hours but actually not.  The next day more of the same periodic bursts of password reject popups and than back to normalcy. So my questions are these:   </p><p>1&gt; What is the right set of server settings to achieve the same kind of generally error-free access to an e-mail address resolving to an outlook-based e-mail account (in this case an e-mail address at <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a>)? 2&gt; How do you go about replacing the server settings in order to go thru discarding the old settings while preserving the e-mail filters you have uniquely assigned and reassigning them to the revised account settings? 3&gt; I recall seeing some e-mail traffic from microsoft regarding their mucking around with their email domains but don't recall seeing anything recently that would indicate a recent significant change other than the push for office365 - which I don't use.  Am I missing something that microsoft has done that should drive me to change this e-mail address to another e-mail server? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1636339;1636342;1636357;,axel43

I then opened Thunderbird up in ""Offline"" mode and checked all the emails were there. They were which was great however as soon as I went online all  the folders disappeared.
