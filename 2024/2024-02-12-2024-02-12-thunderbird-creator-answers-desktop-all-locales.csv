I have years of Thunderbird messages on it.  The repair is complete and Thunderbird is working well again. </p><p>However, for several weeks I was only able to send and receive messages via my ISP Webmail.  I would now like to move these messages into Thunderbird on my repaired desktop computer. </p><p>I cannot find an elegant way to do this.  I know I send forward or resend all of these messages from Webmail to the main address on the desktop and then move them into the appropriate In or Out folders.  But, I have downloaded all of these messages onto a flash drive and would like to use it to load the messages. </p><p>I would appreciate any advice about the best way to do this. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rob86a

I have 3 email accounts. I have lost my passwords for these accounts. When I look on my old computer in Thunderbird I go to password manager and there are no saved passwords for me to get. It's like I have to set up thunderbird all over again. I transferred from the old thunderbird to the new one and nothing happened.  I AM A NOVICE AT THIS. No accounts etc etc no passwords. I am desperate.  Yes I used an external drive to put the thunderbird stuff on the new computer, </p><p>PLEASE HELP </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",jwagener76

I've been using T-Bird for decades.  I have 5 e-mail accounts from various e-mail providers, all collected under t-bird,  But recently the one account that connects to an outlook server has been generating password reject messages in bursts and then goes quiet, connecting regularly and pulling mail.  I thought it might be from using obsolete domain names as microsoft has been pushing to get people on office365 domains.  So I tried changing that one account to using an <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> domain. That seemed to improve things for a few hours but actually not.  The next day more of the same periodic bursts of password reject popups and than back to normalcy. So my questions are these:   </p><p>1&gt; What is the right set of server settings to achieve the same kind of generally error-free access to an e-mail address resolving to an outlook-based e-mail account (in this case an e-mail address at <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a>)? 2&gt; How do you go about replacing the server settings in order to go thru discarding the old settings while preserving the e-mail filters you have uniquely assigned and reassigning them to the revised account settings? 3&gt; I recall seeing some e-mail traffic from microsoft regarding their mucking around with their email domains but don't recall seeing anything recently that would indicate a recent significant change other than the push for office365 - which I don't use.  Am I missing something that microsoft has done that should drive me to change this e-mail address to another e-mail server? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",axel43
