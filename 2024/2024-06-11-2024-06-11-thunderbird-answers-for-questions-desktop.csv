That is most likely the root issue here. </p><p>This image shows you as having a lot more than the normal single smart folders entry. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-06-20-13-08-43-a93ae7.png""> </p><p>Thunderbird file management is ancient and does not cope with files not being available well.  So when it goes to write something and the file is locked (AVG probably,  but it could be streaming backups,  cloud synchronization of the folder etc) it just writes another one, appends a number and promptly ignores the new copy because it does not have the correct name.  We see it all the time with prefs.js,  not usually with smart folders sometimes users have a hundred prefs.js files neatly numbered and ignored.  or some other prefs file.  Contention is the enemy of Thunderbird. </p><p>So my recommendation is delete all of the smart mailboxes folders shown in the image (without Thunderbird running of course and check in task manager in processes as well as applications) and then restart Thunderbird to force a rebuild of the smart folder and by default the unified inbox.  This is not going to get better if AVG is the cause and the exception is not in place first. </p><p>I do think, as there was enough developer attention to this sort of issue in the first place to write the addon, that you should actually make a copy of everything I suggest you delete. Before you delete it, perhaps on a thumb drive, just in case Wayne has a use for it. </p><p><strong>My comments about task manager.</strong>   Thunderbird moves from an application to a process when the last window is closed,  but that does not mean the application has closed,  and when dealing with contention and antivirus it is possible the shutdown has hung pending a write.  So check,  rather than go ""it did not work"". </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
