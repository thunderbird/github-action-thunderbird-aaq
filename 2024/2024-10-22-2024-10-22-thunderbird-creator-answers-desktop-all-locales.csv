The laptop is Win 11 Pro with all updates for 24H2.    I installed Thunderbird (128.3.2esr 64bit).     I have used Thunderbird for over 20 years  or so.   I know how to move profiles, etc.   Well, I moved my profiles from old laptop to new laptop and everything was working fine.       Today, I tried to go into Thunderbird Settings (NOT Account Settings).    if I go through the menu Tools \ Settings.   Nothing happens.    Use the ||| on the taskbar,  NOTHING HAPPENS.    Open ""Account Settings"" and go down to  * Thunderbird Settings,   NOTHING HAPPENS.      Tried using Troubleshooting and restart with no change. </pre> <pre>   I also reverted back to the original Profile that was the default when it installed.   I then imported from my other profile saved off.   Same deal, cannot open Settings.  (Tried before Import and after). </pre> <pre>  What have I done wrong?  What can I try and massage to get the window to show? </pre> <p>Thanks, </p><p>Joe </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",jkaisler

Je to velmi obtěžující. Dá se někde něco nastavit jinak? Příp. jak se vrátit o 3 aktualizace zpět, kdy to nedělalo? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,cs,1683218;,chudikp

It's when I go to add the second account that I start encountering issues. </p><p>I'll see one of two things happen: </p><p>1. A browser window will instantiate but it will attempt to use the login from the first account to authenticate the mailbox for the second account. Obviously that's not going to work, so I cancelled out of the authentication workflow. </p><p>2. Now that I've cancelled the authentication workflow, Thunderbird attempts to use basic auth each and every time. I've deleted the account and tried adding it back again. No luck. </p><p>I've had this working on a couple of other Windows computers. But, as mentioned at the onset, the behavior was very inconsistent. </p><p>Now, I'm setting up a new computer and I'm stuck. </p><p>From what I've seen in other email clients - they seem to understand that each mailbox will require unique credentials. </p><p>They do not attempt to reuse OAuth2 tokens for subsequent mailboxes. Instead, they restart the authentication workflow for each account - which is the behavior I would expect with Thunderbird as well. </p><p>This seems like a bug. I'm not sure how to troubleshoot it any further. </p><p>This is with version 128.3.2esr on Windows 11 (24H2). </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",jeff275

Ho disinstallato e reinstallato, ma ora ha perso ogni formattazione (oltre a continuare a non vedere quelle mail): i modelli li vede tutti senza formattazione (sia firma, che font, in alcuni aggiunge anche a capo che non c'erano), quando invio le mail formattate poi le salva nella posta inviata senza formattazione (font di base, asterischi al posto dei colori etc). Da un altro pc le mail che ho inviato si vedono formattate come le vedevo io quando le ho inviate. Quando faccio ""nuovo messaggio"" o ""rispondi"" la formattazione della firma c'è. Come posso risolvere? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,1683220;,info7357
