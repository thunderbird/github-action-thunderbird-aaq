The laptop is Win 11 Pro with all updates for 24H2.    I installed Thunderbird (128.3.2esr 64bit).     I have used Thunderbird for over 20 years  or so.   I know how to move profiles, etc.   Well, I moved my profiles from old laptop to new laptop and everything was working fine.       Today, I tried to go into Thunderbird Settings (NOT Account Settings).    if I go through the menu Tools \ Settings.   Nothing happens.    Use the ||| on the taskbar,  NOTHING HAPPENS.    Open ""Account Settings"" and go down to  * Thunderbird Settings,   NOTHING HAPPENS.      Tried using Troubleshooting and restart with no change. </pre> <pre>   I also reverted back to the original Profile that was the default when it installed.   I then imported from my other profile saved off.   Same deal, cannot open Settings.  (Tried before Import and after). </pre> <pre>  What have I done wrong?  What can I try and massage to get the window to show? </pre> <p>Thanks, </p><p>Joe </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",jkaisler
