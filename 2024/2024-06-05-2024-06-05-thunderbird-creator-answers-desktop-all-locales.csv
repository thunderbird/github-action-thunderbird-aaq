The problem is, sometimes a spelling is correct as intended or not, depending upon its context in the email body. But the Spell Check Window covers that up as it blocks the middle of the email body. </p><p>It can't be moved in Thunderbird for Mac. </p><p>A previous post - now archived - suggested a left click on the (spell check?) window title area would allow moving the window. But that only works on ... Windows ... because it certainly does NOT work on a Mac. No click-drag, left or right, resulted in un-anchoring the spell check window from the center of the email body. </p><p>One example is when I used the word Add-ons. The spell check stopped at ""ons"", wanting to correct it to ""one"". If ""ons"" was by itself, I could see that. But I couldn't know that it referred to ""ons"" from Add-ons because the spell-check window covered that text. </p>",designer5;MattAuSupport;,true,false,false,";category:customize;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.5 Safari/605.1.15;product:thunderbird",1,0,0,,,
