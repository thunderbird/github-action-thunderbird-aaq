Actually it did load but it seems to have permanently replaced the original message with a completely different e-mail from a different sender. But the From and the Subject lines pertained to the e-mail that was supposed to be there. The replacement message, if it matters, is an e-transfer notification, again, from a completely different sender. </p><p>I noticed then that a few other e-mails show only code data in the body. This is loading from a Gmail account which appears to be intact when I log in there directly. </p><p>I was also concerned when I first went to open Thunderbird from the taskbar, that a Win 10 pop-up appeared as I hovered over to click the icon, showing ""recent"" e-mails from all different dates, most of them well in the past and certainly not accessed recently. This has me concerned about a security breach.  </p><p><br> PS: When I tried to remove the ""recent"" e-mails pop-up menu I accidentally deleted the taskbar shortcut and now can't get it back. Well, I can but the TBird icon won't reload and it just shows up as a blank icon. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",jell

I accept it. When I look at the calendar event, I can see the organizer and attendees but the zoom meeting link and all other details are missing.
