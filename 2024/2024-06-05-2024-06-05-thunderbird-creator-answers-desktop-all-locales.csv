The replacement message, if it matters, is an e-transfer notification, again, from a completely different sender. </p><p>I noticed then that a few other e-mails show only code data in the body. This is loading from a Gmail account which appears to be intact when I log in there directly. </p><p>I was also concerned when I first went to open Thunderbird from the taskbar, that a Win 10 pop-up appeared as I hovered over to click the icon, showing ""recent"" e-mails from all different dates, most of them well in the past and certainly not accessed recently.
