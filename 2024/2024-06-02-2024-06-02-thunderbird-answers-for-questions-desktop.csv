The error message indicating an unexpected error preventing profile changes is indeed troubling, especially given the long history of your profiles. </p><p>Steps to Troubleshoot: Profile Manager: First, ensure that you are correctly using the Profile Manager. Close Thunderbird, then restart it with the -P flag (e.g., thunderbird.exe -P). This should bring up the Profile Manager directly. </p><p>Check Profile Files: Sometimes, the profile files themselves can get corrupted. Navigate to your Thunderbird profile directory (typically found in C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles) and check for any inconsistencies or missing files. </p><p>Permissions Issue: Ensure that there are no permission issues. Right-click on the Thunderbird profile directory and make sure your user account has full control. </p><p>Backup and Restore: As a precaution, back up your existing profiles by copying the entire profile folder to a safe location. You might try creating a new profile and then manually copying your old profile data into this new profile’s directory. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Ensure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer releases. </p><p>Consult Thunderbird Support: If the problem persists, it might be beneficial to consult Thunderbird's support forums or documentation. Additionally, while troubleshooting, you can use <a href=""https://www.sekhlo.pk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sekhlo.pk/</a> free learning resource to get better at handling such software issues. </p><p>Temporary Fix: As a temporary fix, try creating a new profile and gradually import data from the old profile. This could help isolate the issue to specific files or settings within the problematic profile. </p><p>Conclusion: Switching profiles should not be this cumbersome, and it’s unfortunate that reinstallation did not solve the problem. By methodically checking permissions, ensuring files are not corrupted, and keeping your Thunderbird updated, you should be able to resolve the issue. Engaging with community forums and support can also provide additional insights and solutions. Good luck, and I hope you can recover your local folders and continue using Thunderbird without further issues. </p>",sws.lit24,true,0,0

Then you can check to see what is arriving on the server. If newsletter is not arriving on server then it explains why Thunderbird cannot download it. If it arrives on server, but server spam filters put email in server Spam folder and you use POP in Thunderbird, then Thunderbird cannot download it and you need to move email into the Inbox in order to get it downloaded.  If server has too many emails and on occasions is full until something gets deleted then server cannot receive emails until there is space.
