POP would be in the Mail folder and IMAP in the Imapmail folder.  If there, you might try tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbirdinstallation&gt;choose a profile folder. That would bring in the missing folders. OR, you could exit Thunderbird and use File Manager to copy the profile directly to overlay the existing profile. The existing profile can be located by help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' and then exit Thunderbird. At that point you would be in the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The error message indicating an unexpected error preventing profile changes is indeed troubling, especially given the long history of your profiles. </p><p>Steps to Troubleshoot: Profile Manager: First, ensure that you are correctly using the Profile Manager. Close Thunderbird, then restart it with the -P flag (e.g., thunderbird.exe -P). This should bring up the Profile Manager directly. </p><p>Check Profile Files: Sometimes, the profile files themselves can get corrupted. Navigate to your Thunderbird profile directory (typically found in C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles) and check for any inconsistencies or missing files. </p><p>Permissions Issue: Ensure that there are no permission issues. Right-click on the Thunderbird profile directory and make sure your user account has full control. </p><p>Backup and Restore: As a precaution, back up your existing profiles by copying the entire profile folder to a safe location. You might try creating a new profile and then manually copying your old profile data into this new profile’s directory. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Ensure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer releases. </p><p>Consult Thunderbird Support: If the problem persists, it might be beneficial to consult Thunderbird's support forums or documentation. Additionally, while troubleshooting, you can use <a href=""https://www.sekhlo.pk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sekhlo.pk/</a> free learning resource to get better at handling such software issues. </p><p>Temporary Fix: As a temporary fix, try creating a new profile and gradually import data from the old profile. This could help isolate the issue to specific files or settings within the problematic profile. </p><p>Conclusion: Switching profiles should not be this cumbersome, and it’s unfortunate that reinstallation did not solve the problem. By methodically checking permissions, ensuring files are not corrupted, and keeping your Thunderbird updated, you should be able to resolve the issue. Engaging with community forums and support can also provide additional insights and solutions. Good luck, and I hope you can recover your local folders and continue using Thunderbird without further issues. </p>",sws.lit24,false,0,0
