POP would be in the Mail folder and IMAP in the Imapmail folder.  If there, you might try tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbirdinstallation&gt;choose a profile folder. That would bring in the missing folders. OR, you could exit Thunderbird and use File Manager to copy the profile directly to overlay the existing profile. The existing profile can be located by help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' and then exit Thunderbird. At that point you would be in the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
