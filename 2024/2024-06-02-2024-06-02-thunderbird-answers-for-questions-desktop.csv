Then you can check to see what is arriving on the server. If newsletter is not arriving on server then it explains why Thunderbird cannot download it. If it arrives on server, but server spam filters put email in server Spam folder and you use POP in Thunderbird, then Thunderbird cannot download it and you need to move email into the Inbox in order to get it downloaded.

REstart Thunderbird and it will prompt you to logon to prove you really are you and then a new Oauth token will get uploaded and stored in Thunderbird.
