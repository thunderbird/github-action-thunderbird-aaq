You will also find that the AV will scan anything downloaded , uploaded and any file opened. This causes a problem when it comes to emails because the AV interrupts the process. This is a well known fact and causes no end of irritations.  Whilst on the topic - if you use a cleanup software product like CCleaner, WiseCleaner or indeed some AV offer it as well - then you need to make sure Thunderbird profile folder exempt as they could remove required data such as session or passwords etc. It mean preferences may not get updated upon closing and it causes annoyances. </p><p>If you really want the Anti-Virs to check everything - Never allow any Anti-Virus to auto fix anything to do with Thunderbird because AV's do not understand that an mbox file contains many (possibly hundreds) of emails. It sees a problem in a file and the auto fix on Inbox can be catastrophic. Loss of all emails.  </p><p>Everytime a file gets opened in order to read or write data then that Anti-virus could be interupting the process to check an opened file. In addition, if you are using an imap account then there is a lot of jibber jabber between thunderbird and server for each email.  </p><p>You may not have experienced an issue so far with Kaspersky, but I've been in contact with many people who have had issues. You would also find many people saying they have issues on Kaspersky help forum.  </p><p>Emails themselves are not a problem - you can open email without an issue -  it's what the recipient does with them which is important. </p><p>Basic safety rules&nbsp;: 1. Thunderbird does not allow remote content by default - so if you do not alter the default settings then you are safeguarded against remote content. 2. Do not click on links whether text or image before you know where that link is taking you to - hover over it first and the real link address/webpage is shown the bottom Status Bar. 3. Do not open email attachments just because you are curious. </p><p>I've had loads of emails claiming stuff like see you invoice attached - everyone should know if they have engaged with a company etc and are expecting an invoice.  </p><p><br> <strong>re&nbsp;:My inbox is about 3.2GB, with about 23,000 messages. </strong> In reality that means if you download full copies of emails then in one single mbox text file document you have 23,000 emails all written one after the other.  AS you seem to be very cautious then I would advise that you reduce your risk by creating more imap folders, then moving emails into those folders to improve organisation and storage.  Remember to compact the Inbox after you have moved a lot of emails.  </p><p><br> <strong>re&nbsp;: but I have never found these forums offer much in the way of help</strong> I notice you have not asked many questions in the past. But the information you are getting in this question alone is worth it's weight. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:My inbox is about 3.2GB</strong> Assuming you are using Message Storage Type: File per folder (mbox)- this means you are talking about a single text file document which is 3.2GB in size - it's not a folder - it's a file.  It may take quite a bit of RAM to open a single file of that size.  Compacting becomes much harder if you have very large mbox files. Basically, any email you delete or move out of the Inbox, gets 'marked as deleted' and hidden. You may see the email in another folder or in Trash, but the original email is still lurking in the Inbox. When you compact the Inbox, the Inbox file is opened and read - all emails that do not have a 'marked as deleted' flag are copied over to a new file. Then the original mbox file is deleted and the new file replaces it. So the new Inbox mbox file is cleaner and smaller in size.  </p><p>If mbox files get too big then in the event of needing to access it; maybe to recover data, can prove difficult. I have known computers crash when attempting to open very large files.  </p><p><br> <strong>re&nbsp;:Example 1  - I moved an email from my Inbox to a special folder. The email was present in full before the move.   Only the header appeared to be copied. </strong> </p><p>What do you mean by a 'special' folder&nbsp;? Is that 'special' folder in another account eg: Local Folders mail account&nbsp;? Are you saying you were 'moving' an email out of an imap folder - out of imap account and putting it in a folder you created in the 'Local Folders' mail account&nbsp;? But Only the header was copied. </p><p>It might be only header copied over if only header was downloaded in the first place. Note: If only header downloaded - when you select to read email - contact is made with server and full copy gets downloaded to a temp cache to faciliate reading. So from your point of view, you would be able to read it anyway. If only header was copied/moved to 'Local Folders' folder then it cannot access server to download full copy. The only other explanation is a scanning process interrupted the process - already discussed in some detail. </p><p>As I'm not ware of all your specific settings on a per folder basis, I've included the following info as a reference guide. In Imap account&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> Account Settings &gt; Synchronisation &amp; Storage' </li><li> Click on 'Advanced' button </li></ul> <p>Any folder which has a selected checkbox is designed to download full copies to that folder. Any folder which is not selected does not get a full downloaded copy - only a header. </p><p>In addition - if you have selected eg: 'Synchronise the most recent 60 days' option, then when you compact, only the last 60 days will be fully downloaded and all the rest will be just headers. This only works providing you have already selected the account folder to have full downloaded copies' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

You really need to see if you can reduce the current file size as it's not doing you any favours. </p><p>AS you have a large Inbox Compacting a large file may take a while. So advise you stop the AV from  Scanning any file you open first. </p><p>Do not exit Thunderbird whilst the compacting process is operational. Strongly advise you compact on a per folder basis because you have large files. Advise you compact the folder that get used the most: Empty Spam and then compact Spam Then compact the 'Drafts' folder Finally try compacting the 'Inbox' If the 'Inbox' is being compacted then advise you do not select anything in that folder. In your case, it may be beneficial to go into Offline mode to stop the server from trying to download anything into the Inbox. Then try compacting Inbox. Maybe take the opportuity to have a cuppa. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

My understanding is that you and others are  volunteesr seeking to help others and I appreciate you giving your time to this. </p><p>Second, thank you for setting out your suggestions re compacting in your second message.  While none of this was new to me, it was a useful reminder. </p><p>Thirdly, what comes through strongly is an opinion that the problems I am raising are either related to another program (Anti-Virus), or reflect some form of user error or lack of understanding or good practice on my part. I apologise if I may have contributed to this - for example ""special folder"" is old language, and I really should have said ""user-created"" - twenty plus years ago people talked about special folders and standard folders in email&nbsp;;-) </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird since its inception and have a well-managed folder structure.  The Inbox size is relative to the total size of this Profile, which is around 130GB. </p><p>For me the information about anti-virus is interesting, useful and important.  It is also less likely to be related to the issues I was dealing with.  This is simply applying Occam's razor.   </p><p>My situation arose specifically after the large recent update and rebuild; it seems not to have recurred after the second minor update to this. This suggests the problem was related to some internal Thunderbird issues.  </p><p>There are still likely to be issues.  I attached a screenshot showing how the Search screen does not update fully after a move operation - in that it still shows the shading and ""slots"" for messages that have been moved.  To me this is potentially related to the problem I experienced, and again is a new situation post the update.   </p><p>Please ignore the ""moving two items to Trash"" at the bottom.  This was subsequent to the move operation I reference above  My point is that the slots on the screen are still showing as highlighted in a fixed position, even after that operation completed and I then moved to delete two items.  At this point I realised I actually had tangible evidence of a problem and so took a screenshot.  </p><p>I'd be interested in whether this is sufficient evidence to raise a bug report? </p><p>What I am left with in any event is needing to search my profile to discover whether any of the 200 odd missing messages from mid-July to early August are somewhere or are lost for good.  The ""Search"" function simply fails when I look for  a specific email address across all Folders in my local folder. It doesn't crash - it just stops without generating a result (ie it stops without finding anything or saying nothing found).  It works across specific folders but not across all. </p><p>So I wonder if you are aware of any tool or other mechanism which one can use to directly search a large profile, outside of starting Thunderbird?  As I understand it, messages are all text / HTML so it ought to be possible to search for a string of characters.  Using the Windows 10 search function on a Thunderbird profile doesn't seem to work (I have tested this using known results). </p><p>Best wishes Roland </p>",jollygreengiant,false,0,0

I'm not sure what folder the deleted/lost message was originally in, but there will be an mbox file for that folder name.  </p><p>I notice the search image mentions eg:<strong> Inbox/2017</strong> So if '2017' is a folder you created as  subfolder to 'Inbox' In 'Local Folders' folder - click on 'Inbox.sbd' folder to see mbox file called '2017' - then open that '2017' mbox file using Notepad ++ </p><p>If the file is too big for Notepad++ then you need to find a different Text Editor program which can open a very large single text document) </p><p>Emails are written to the file one after the other, so oldest will be at the top and newest at the bottom.

My guess is IMAP, since you indicated that you have access to messages on both phone and PC Also, from menu bar, click help&gt;about and share the version of Thunderbird that you are using.  </p><p>I know nothing of Plusnet, but I have had good success with an email account at Gmail (free), one at Outlook (free), and one with gmx (also free), and one at Fastmail (fee), and there are others. All of those work with Thunderbird the same way, but that is something for you to make the decision on. If you switch, my suggestion is set up the new account at least a month or more before leaving Plusnet to ensure that you retain email access throughout, as you may have many people to notify of the switch. </p><p>We can advise on possibly upgrading your Thunderbird after you share the version in use. You mentioned the limited storage of Thunderbird. Actually, Thunderbird has no limits itself, but uses whatever resources the user provides.  </p><p>So, next steps: you need to decide on a new email address if that is your desire. You will need to set on the PC and your phone. If you have difficulties, you can post here for help in that. I encourage that to be a new post, not a follow on from this one. When you want to exit Plusnet and save the messages, please make that another separate post to ensure you get assistance on that one topic. Finally, after you tell us which version you use, we can advise on the upgrade from this post.  </p><p>So, at this time, the ball is in your court. Let us know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I had support to set up my e-mails for some time, but I don't know how it all works! I know that my madasafish e-mail account was used on the Thunderbird platform, and is my preferred platform today. However, I have limped through problems with my e-mails for many years now, with a particularly disappointing time in losing years of contacts and e-mails. </em> </p><p>Whilst Plusnet is no longer my provider, they still give very minimal support, and by their own admission have been trying to wind down their e-mail services for a long time, and the staff have been telling me for some time that not even they know when they are going to terminate their service.  </p><p>I now understand what you are saying about the limits on storage, as these are set by Plusnet and not Thunderbird. </p><p>In regards to the next steps, would I lose my madasafish e-mail address by closing the PlusNet connection, or could I not simply keep it on Thunderbird and use one of the free e-mail accounts you suggested? I am guessing that since Plusnet took over madasafish, that they became my new e-mail provider, and that's why I could keep my original madasafish address? So I don't know why in the first place that I was using Thunderbird, many years ago, to open up my madasafish e-mails? I told you that I don't know much! </p><p>What I would ideally want is to keep it simple by just using Thunderbird, but I don't understand the function and nature of Thunderbird. I guess as it isn't an e-mail provider, so what is it?!  If you think it is possible for me to find another e-mail provider; keep my original madasafish e-mail address and use Thunderbird that is my preferred layout, I would be very grateful  to hear from you if this is the case. </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>Byron. </p>",stixman,false,0,0

However, I suggest keeping the madasafish account also until your friends or others are aware of the new email address, which can be a couple of months. For a new account, there are several quality email providers who provide free accounts. Three i'm aware of are <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>. <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, and <a href=""http://gmx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.com</a>. They have their different strengths, and they have (in my personal experience) been very reliable. Once you have an account, then set it up on Thunderbird to administer it for you. You can have Thunderbird manage both the madasafish and the new account concurrently.  I hope this info proves useful. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It's on a Yahoo account and thus has settings (defined there) that limit the age of trash and auto-delete old stuff.  There are currently 577 emails in that folder .. not a huge amount. </p><p>I did run Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode and observed the same high-cpu usage when deleting an email from Yahoo.  I then deleted another email from another account (270 or so emails in it's Trash folder) and saw the same (but not as bad, 60% cpu instead of 100+) for a minute or so. </p><p>Poking at this doesn't make it happen reliably, unfortunately.  Typically when only an individual email or two are deleted, things seem to settle back to a decent (low) CPU usage within a minute or so.  When multiple  emails get deleted in rapid succession, it seems to be worse.  I've had the CPU usage peg for minutes at a time, causing the fans on my laptop to roar and it doesn't seem to stop for several minutes.  By this time, I'm used to simply exiting and restarting Thunderbird when I hear the fans kick in, and that calms things down.  It's not ideal, but it does work! </p>",daves0,false,0,0

Those would generally be accompanied by an error dialog.  It is also almost deguree for those with a Norton product who had the temerity to allow a software update of Thunderbird. I see some sort of attempt to import a profile.  Why I have no idea, except to perhaps try and fix the fix from your providers recommendation to remove your account. Your profile is 128,898 Mb  that is over 125 gigabytes, almost 126. as the profile import is limited to 2Gb I can see why it would fail.  But that size does not jell with the size you give in bytes that would indicate your profile is 2300gb or more  most confusing. </p><p>What does downloading chunks of email even mean?  To me it says your account is functioning correctly and something it interfering with the connectivity to the link so it gets dropped.  This could have many causes,  none of them in Thunderbird.  My guess is most probably you have an antivirus problem.  Or even a saturated internet link so things timeout as there in contention between say streaming on the bandwidth and your mail. But as you mention the dreaded Norton I will point my finger squarely at it. </p><p>Uninstall the Norton product and I think you will find all your problems just go away, but it is highly probable your have thousands of files in your profile folder that are a result of Norton ""hanging on"" to them and Thunderbird making a new one.  You may also have tens of thousands of useless files created when you clicked on the ""allow windows search to search my email"" way back when you first installed the product.  I get rid of over 100,000 files when I stopped that circus on my own system. A duplicate copy of the first 42kb of each mail in a special folder. </p><p>I suggest you look for the file prefs.js in the root of the profile folder. Do you have perhaps have tens or hundreds or thousands of them? </p><p>Fundamentally your profile folder is huge for it to hold 20 email accounts let alone one and I think some pruning is in order once the initial connectivity problem is escaped.   </p><p>BTW stop listening to Comcast for advice.  The best advice they will give you will probably loose data.  Removing and adding an account for example will ""loose"" the data from the user interface and a new complete download of everything on the server will be initiated. Hardly a fix for a non working connection.  It does however encourage you to use their add supported web interface </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
