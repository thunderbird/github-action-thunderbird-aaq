My guess is IMAP, since you indicated that you have access to messages on both phone and PC Also, from menu bar, click help&gt;about and share the version of Thunderbird that you are using.  </p><p>I know nothing of Plusnet, but I have had good success with an email account at Gmail (free), one at Outlook (free), and one with gmx (also free), and one at Fastmail (fee), and there are others. All of those work with Thunderbird the same way, but that is something for you to make the decision on. If you switch, my suggestion is set up the new account at least a month or more before leaving Plusnet to ensure that you retain email access throughout, as you may have many people to notify of the switch. </p><p>We can advise on possibly upgrading your Thunderbird after you share the version in use. You mentioned the limited storage of Thunderbird. Actually, Thunderbird has no limits itself, but uses whatever resources the user provides.  </p><p>So, next steps: you need to decide on a new email address if that is your desire. You will need to set on the PC and your phone. If you have difficulties, you can post here for help in that. I encourage that to be a new post, not a follow on from this one. When you want to exit Plusnet and save the messages, please make that another separate post to ensure you get assistance on that one topic. Finally, after you tell us which version you use, we can advise on the upgrade from this post.  </p><p>So, at this time, the ball is in your court. Let us know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I had support to set up my e-mails for some time, but I don't know how it all works! I know that my madasafish e-mail account was used on the Thunderbird platform, and is my preferred platform today. However, I have limped through problems with my e-mails for many years now, with a particularly disappointing time in losing years of contacts and e-mails. </em> </p><p>Whilst Plusnet is no longer my provider, they still give very minimal support, and by their own admission have been trying to wind down their e-mail services for a long time, and the staff have been telling me for some time that not even they know when they are going to terminate their service.  </p><p>I now understand what you are saying about the limits on storage, as these are set by Plusnet and not Thunderbird. </p><p>In regards to the next steps, would I lose my madasafish e-mail address by closing the PlusNet connection, or could I not simply keep it on Thunderbird and use one of the free e-mail accounts you suggested? I am guessing that since Plusnet took over madasafish, that they became my new e-mail provider, and that's why I could keep my original madasafish address? So I don't know why in the first place that I was using Thunderbird, many years ago, to open up my madasafish e-mails? I told you that I don't know much! </p><p>What I would ideally want is to keep it simple by just using Thunderbird, but I don't understand the function and nature of Thunderbird. I guess as it isn't an e-mail provider, so what is it?!  If you think it is possible for me to find another e-mail provider; keep my original madasafish e-mail address and use Thunderbird that is my preferred layout, I would be very grateful  to hear from you if this is the case. </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>Byron. </p>",stixman,false,0,0

However, I suggest keeping the madasafish account also until your friends or others are aware of the new email address, which can be a couple of months. For a new account, there are several quality email providers who provide free accounts. Three i'm aware of are <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>. <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, and <a href=""http://gmx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.com</a>. They have their different strengths, and they have (in my personal experience) been very reliable. Once you have an account, then set it up on Thunderbird to administer it for you. You can have Thunderbird manage both the madasafish and the new account concurrently.  I hope this info proves useful. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
