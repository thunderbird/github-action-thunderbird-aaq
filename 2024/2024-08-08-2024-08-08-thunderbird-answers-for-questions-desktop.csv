I feel you would be safer to stick with the release version, but as long as you do frequent (i.e., weekly) backups, it doesn't matter. I back up weekly and any problems are quickly behind me. You can revert to the release by going to <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> and downloading and installing over the top of the beta. Then, there may be a compatibilities.ini file in the profile to delete to avoid the message that the release is not compatible. BUT, my big suggestion is to do backups.

All of those work with Thunderbird the same way, but that is something for you to make the decision on. If you switch, my suggestion is set up the new account at least a month or more before leaving Plusnet to ensure that you retain email access throughout, as you may have many people to notify of the switch. </p><p>We can advise on possibly upgrading your Thunderbird after you share the version in use. You mentioned the limited storage of Thunderbird. Actually, Thunderbird has no limits itself, but uses whatever resources the user provides.  </p><p>So, next steps: you need to decide on a new email address if that is your desire. You will need to set on the PC and your phone. If you have difficulties, you can post here for help in that. I encourage that to be a new post, not a follow on from this one. When you want to exit Plusnet and save the messages, please make that another separate post to ensure you get assistance on that one topic. Finally, after you tell us which version you use, we can advise on the upgrade from this post.  </p><p>So, at this time, the ball is in your court. Let us know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
