Most of these come from security software that is trying to pretend they know something about email.  But these toolbars can mess thing up in a big way as many of them only work with specific Thunderbird versions,  so you need a new antivirus version for a new Thunderbird version for the toolbar to work. Essentially if you have say a McAfee toolbar, expect issues. </p><p>Then troubleshooting mode also disables hardware acceleration in settings.  Most of us will never notice anything as to which setting this is on,  but apparently it has value for video, needlessly Thunderbird gets it inherited from Firefox.  It can cause issues if the video driver changes (almost always when new computers come out to play) but the issue are generally a blurriness of the display,  not things missing. So probably not relevant today. </p><p>Safe mode also disables userchrome.css and userchrome.js as well as the mozilla.cfg file which are about customization and management control if settings.  </p><p>Layout information stored in the session file is also ignored in troubleshooting mode.   </p><p>Check your antivirus/Security software for anti scam/Spam tools and disable them. </p><p>What result from troubleshooting mode? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The fact that you have folders with numbers indicates you have had multiple problems in the past. That is, when Thunderbird has a hiccup from such as an antivirus interruption, it creates a new folder. So, the folder ending in -17 would likely be the most current and its inbox, sent, etc. would be first priority to copy. To keep names straight, I suggest renaming them, such as inbox17, sent17. etc.  Now, after setting up a new profile, exit TB and copy the desired items to the Mail\Local Folders folder.

We see oAuth authentication requests frequently reported here as ""annoying popups"" </p><p>At the completion of the oAuth authentication process there is a step where the completed ""transaction"" for want of a better word with the authorization code is redirected to your local computer.  This redirection occurs using the localhost adapter.  Apparently yours is not available. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-04-27-05-44-19-b8622e.png""> </p><p>The most likely cause of this problem in my opinion will be  </p><pre> Antivirus: Cloudeight/Emsisoft </pre> <p><br> I know nothing of the product,  but antivirus products are by far the most common problems when connectivity is in question as here.  They are also prone to blocking access to the localhost adapter because it was used for malware once about 25 years ago. Interestingly it was the original cause of Comcast blocking port 25 to send mail, it was such an issue with their customers. </p><p>There are other causes,  not the least of which are having certain developer tools and web tools (Apache et. al.) that actively monitor connections to localhost and respond to them.
