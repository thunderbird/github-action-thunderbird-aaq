If you click on the box and nothing changes, you may need to manually resize your window. Do not click on one of those three symbols. Instead, if you click and hold on a free space in that top potion, you can drag your window down and to left or right. Then, you can move your mouse until an arrowed line segment pointing up and down appears. Click and hold as you drag your window down so that it is a smaller size than it was before. Now, you should be able to see the bottom of your window. </p><p>If that is not the problem you are facing, please provide a greater description. </p><p>Thank you and good luck.

If you post screenshots of the content as viewed in windows file explorer, I think we can point out what can be imported into a new profile. Merging doesn't work, but if you know what components you want, you can do this manually. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To do this, you will be best served (in my opinion), by creating manually-run filters to COPY (not move) messages, folder by folder, to the desired IMAP folder. When done, do some spot-checking to ensure messages are not corrupted (not likely, but possible, depending on network connection). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
