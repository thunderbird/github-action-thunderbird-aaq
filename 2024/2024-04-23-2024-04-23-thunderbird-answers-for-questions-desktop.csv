If you click on the box and nothing changes, you may need to manually resize your window. Do not click on one of those three symbols. Instead, if you click and hold on a free space in that top potion, you can drag your window down and to left or right. Then, you can move your mouse until an arrowed line segment pointing up and down appears. Click and hold as you drag your window down so that it is a smaller size than it was before. Now, you should be able to see the bottom of your window. </p><p>If that is not the problem you are facing, please provide a greater description. </p><p>Thank you and good luck.
