However, upon opening Thunderbird, I discovered that my address book and all saved emails in Thunderbird were lost, and I didn't save them in the Earthlink account itself other than the address book.  I do daily backups with Carbonite. Is there a file or files I can look for in my Carbonite backup files that would contain the saved emails?
