Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue: </p><p>1. Clear Thunderbird Cache: </p><pre>  Sometimes, cached data can cause issues. Try clearing Thunderbird's cache:   - Open Thunderbird.   - Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.   - Click on Open Folder next to Application Basics.   - Close Thunderbird completely.   - In the folder that opens, locate and delete the `cache2` folder. </pre> <p>2. Check Date and Time Settings: </p><pre>  Ensure your computer's date, time, and timezone settings are correct. Incorrect settings can sometimes trigger security warnings. </pre> <p>3. Verify Google Security Settings: </p><pre>  Double-check the security settings in your Google account:   - Go to your Google account settings (<a href=""https://myaccount.google.com/security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myaccount.google.com/security</a>).   - Look under Third-party apps with account access and ensure Thunderbird is listed and allowed.   - If Thunderbird is listed, try removing it from the list and re-adding it after attempting to set it up again in Thunderbird. </pre> <p>4. Try a Different Browser: </p><pre>  When you click on ""Allow"" in Thunderbird to authorize access to your Google account, it opens a browser window. Try using a different browser to see if the issue persists. </pre> <p>5. Check Thunderbird Updates: </p><pre>  Ensure Thunderbird is up to date. Sometimes, updates include fixes for OAuth2 authentication issues. </pre> <p>6. Firewall and Security Software: </p><pre>  Temporarily disable any third-party firewall or security software that might be blocking Thunderbird's connection to Google servers. Ensure Windows Defender or any other antivirus software is not interfering. </pre> <p>7. Re-add Gmail Account in Thunderbird: </p><pre>  After performing the above steps, attempt to re-add your Gmail account in Thunderbird:   - Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings   - Click on Account Actions &gt; Add Mail Account.   - Follow the prompts, including OAuth2 authentication steps. </pre> <p>8. Contact Thunderbird Support: </p><pre>  If the issue persists after trying these steps, consider reaching out <a href=""https://www.omegletv.click/"" rel=""nofollow"">to</a> Thunderbird support or checking their community forums for additional assistance specific to Thunderbird's OAuth2 issues. </pre> <p>By systematically checking these steps, you should be able to trace out and resolve the problem preventing you from re-installing your Gmail account on Thunderbird. </p>",therobertscott56,true,0,0
