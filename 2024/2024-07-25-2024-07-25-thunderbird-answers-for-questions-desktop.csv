Outgoing mail goes using SMTP regardless of the incoming protocol used. </p><p>So in essence each email account is two accounts,  one incoming and one outgoing.  That server name looks suspiciously like that used by a hosting company.  Are your email accounts on a hosted site? </p><p>I looked at digital pacific and they have these settings on their site for email <a href=""https://support.digitalpacific.com.au/en/knowledgebase/article/general-email-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.digitalpacific.com.au/en/knowledgebase/article/general-email-settings</a> </p><p>Those server names and the ones in your error do not look like they will ever matchup.  So what exactly is in outgoing server (SMTP) for your accounts that are not working?  There needs to be an entry in there for all three email addresses used with the correct username and password for the email address. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue: </p><p>1. Clear Thunderbird Cache: </p><pre>  Sometimes, cached data can cause issues. Try clearing Thunderbird's cache:   - Open Thunderbird.   - Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.   - Click on Open Folder next to Application Basics.   - Close Thunderbird completely.   - In the folder that opens, locate and delete the `cache2` folder. </pre> <p>2. Check Date and Time Settings: </p><pre>  Ensure your computer's date, time, and timezone settings are correct. Incorrect settings can sometimes trigger security warnings. </pre> <p>3. Verify Google Security Settings: </p><pre>  Double-check the security settings in your Google account:   - Go to your Google account settings (<a href=""https://myaccount.google.com/security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myaccount.google.com/security</a>).   - Look under Third-party apps with account access and ensure Thunderbird is listed and allowed.   - If Thunderbird is listed, try removing it from the list and re-adding it after attempting to set it up again in Thunderbird. </pre> <p>4. Try a Different Browser: </p><pre>  When you click on ""Allow"" in Thunderbird to authorize access to your Google account, it opens a browser window. Try using a different browser to see if the issue persists. </pre> <p>5. Check Thunderbird Updates: </p><pre>  Ensure Thunderbird is up to date. Sometimes, updates include fixes for OAuth2 authentication issues. </pre> <p>6. Firewall and Security Software: </p><pre>  Temporarily disable any third-party firewall or security software that might be blocking Thunderbird's connection to Google servers. Ensure Windows Defender or any other antivirus software is not interfering. </pre> <p>7. Re-add Gmail Account in Thunderbird: </p><pre>  After performing the above steps, attempt to re-add your Gmail account in Thunderbird:   - Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings   - Click on Account Actions &gt; Add Mail Account.   - Follow the prompts, including OAuth2 authentication steps. </pre> <p>8. Contact Thunderbird Support: </p><pre>  If the issue persists after trying these steps, consider reaching out <a href=""https://www.omegletv.click/"" rel=""nofollow"">to</a> Thunderbird support or checking their community forums for additional assistance specific to Thunderbird's OAuth2 issues. </pre> <p>By systematically checking these steps, you should be able to trace out and resolve the problem preventing you from re-installing your Gmail account on Thunderbird. </p>",therobertscott56,true,0,0
