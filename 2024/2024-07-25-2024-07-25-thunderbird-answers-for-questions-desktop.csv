Would that make any difference? That's the only other thing I can think of.  Why would it work one day and not the next? Frustrating. </blockquote> <p>Internet speed only becomes an issue when the message size is large and you have outgoing email scanning enabled (it significantly delays sending usually).  With both those things you can experience timeouts on the connection,  but those usually generate an error message as the timeout aborts the transfer that has commenced. </p><p>However sometimes outgoing scanning messes up the connection and a newer version ""just gets installed"" and the problem goes away. (Think Crowdstrike, they released a very good example of a poor update, but these software updates that you are not even notified of are occurring sometimes daily with security software that is deeply embedded in your system.) </p><p>What is far more common is sending or receiving or both are blocked by antivirus products because the version of Thunderbird is new and their rather dodgy software firewalls have not received a note from home that Thunderbird has a new version, but I really do not think that was your issue as the server was contacted and refusing connection. This sometime is the result of too many incorrect password attempts say, which results in a timed lockout for a day or until someone at the provider lifts it. </p><p>But if it is working,  lets just leave well enough alone. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue: </p><p>1. Clear Thunderbird Cache: </p><pre>  Sometimes, cached data can cause issues. Try clearing Thunderbird's cache:   - Open Thunderbird.   - Go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information.   - Click on Open Folder next to Application Basics.   - Close Thunderbird completely.   - In the folder that opens, locate and delete the `cache2` folder. </pre> <p>2. Check Date and Time Settings: </p><pre>  Ensure your computer's date, time, and timezone settings are correct. Incorrect settings can sometimes trigger security warnings. </pre> <p>3. Verify Google Security Settings: </p><pre>  Double-check the security settings in your Google account:   - Go to your Google account settings (<a href=""https://myaccount.google.com/security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myaccount.google.com/security</a>).   - Look under Third-party apps with account access and ensure Thunderbird is listed and allowed.   - If Thunderbird is listed, try removing it from the list and re-adding it after attempting to set it up again in Thunderbird. </pre> <p>4. Try a Different Browser: </p><pre>  When you click on ""Allow"" in Thunderbird to authorize access to your Google account, it opens a browser window. Try using a different browser to see if the issue persists. </pre> <p>5. Check Thunderbird Updates: </p><pre>  Ensure Thunderbird is up to date. Sometimes, updates include fixes for OAuth2 authentication issues. </pre> <p>6. Firewall and Security Software: </p><pre>  Temporarily disable any third-party firewall or security software that might be blocking Thunderbird's connection to Google servers. Ensure Windows Defender or any other antivirus software is not interfering. </pre> <p>7. Re-add Gmail Account in Thunderbird: </p><pre>  After performing the above steps, attempt to re-add your Gmail account in Thunderbird:   - Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings   - Click on Account Actions &gt; Add Mail Account.   - Follow the prompts, including OAuth2 authentication steps. </pre> <p>8. Contact Thunderbird Support: </p><pre>  If the issue persists after trying these steps, consider reaching out <a href=""https://www.omegletv.click/"" rel=""nofollow"">to</a> Thunderbird support or checking their community forums for additional assistance specific to Thunderbird's OAuth2 issues. </pre> <p>By systematically checking these steps, you should be able to trace out and resolve the problem preventing you from re-installing your Gmail account on Thunderbird. </p>",therobertscott56,true,0,0

I followed the guidance that you provided, changing the server settings as instructed.  i set Firefox to allow cookies as indicated. But now when I try to get messages in TB I get a full-screen message from Microsoft saying that I need to allow cookies for connection to occur.

First, log in to your Hotmail account through a web browser to check for any security alerts or unusual activity that might require a password change. Ensure that your Thunderbird is updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for authentication issues. You may need to re-authenticate by removing and re-adding your Hotmail account in Thunderbird, which will prompt a new OAuth authorization. Verify your server settings in Thunderbird to match Microsoft's current recommendations, particularly the authentication method (usually OAuth2 for IMAP). Additionally, if you have two-step verification enabled, consider using an app password. If these steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to change your password as a last resort to comply with any new security protocols Microsoft has introduced. </p>",basika0911,false,0,0

Immediately on starting I was warned again about cookie settings so I allowed these, checked all the settings again, and attempted to send an email. A MS pop-up requested my PW, so I input it, and at last all seems to work! F.i. I had to remove and re-add the Hotmail account in my Android phone, changing the settings as necessary.

The addon is as far as Microsoft is concerned another application.  So it needs the administrator of the exchange tenant to allow it access, just as Thunderbird needed to b3e allowed access.  The page you have will pass a request to the designated authority for that tenant. </p> <blockquote>publish your calendar (all events) .. this will generate two links HTML + ICS .. </blockquote> <p>Generally speaking any ICS file linked to on a URL will be loaded read only.
