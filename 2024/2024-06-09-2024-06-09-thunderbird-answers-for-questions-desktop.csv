You might find that, by contacting the IP department at your university, they will freely give  you what you need. Short of that, since you think it's built on Microsoft, you might do search engine lookup for office365 settings. As an example, (although not necessarily what you need), I found this:  <a href=""https://lazyadmin.nl/office-365/office-365-smtp-settings/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lazyadmin.nl/office-365/office-365-smtp-settings/</a>  Try that and do NOT enter password during setup to see how the fundamentals go. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
