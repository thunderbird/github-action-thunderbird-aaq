Thunderbird retains size of message window and opens subsequent messages in same size window as prior message. That is, it does not increase or decrease based on line length of message. That has been my experience, although I have not seen it in print anywhere. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Betas have bugs and are not backward compatible with release versions and are not actively supported here except for routine issues.  I suggest putting the current release version on both PCs. If there is a compatibilities.ini file, just delete it. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
