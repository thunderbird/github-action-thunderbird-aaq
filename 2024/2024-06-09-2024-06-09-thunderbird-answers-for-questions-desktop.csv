It did not solve the issue. Although this is a seemingly minor issue, I do occasionally need to reinstate an item from trash or ""junk"".  This now requires that I log on to the server and send it to myself.  In addition, I periodically need to look at ""junk"" to make sure nothing is flagged erroneously.  Any idea how to analyze and fix this behavior?  It seems like I am the only one who has it.  (I have even done a full virus scan). </p><p>Update: This is interesting.  I have the very same issue on my laptop, but only with my main mail account (which is a Gmail account, masked by my domain name).  The Hotmail account shows the deleted ""trash"" and also shows emails in the ""junk"" folder.  I have checked my Gmail settings.  There is nothing there that might cause this.  I wonder if this could be caused by my Network settings.  There was a recent change to  those settings because my mail was being flagged and returned as undeliverable when sent to certain users with address of <a href=""http://sbcglobal.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sbcglobal.net</a>. </p>",hccsc005,false,0,0

That setup would seem to address what you're seeing. I got the idea because you mention putting trash on local folder and being able to put a trash message there, yet there are other messages in the online trash folder, and the online folder cannot see your trash folder (because it is on local server). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
