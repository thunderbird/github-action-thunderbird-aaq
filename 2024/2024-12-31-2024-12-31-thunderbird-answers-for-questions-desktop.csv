(If much fewer, just highlight the folder, rightclick and select 'copy to folder'  This is a delicate step because IMAP was not designed for high volume uploads. the intent of the filter is to slow the process a bit.  - once done, spot check to verify you have the messages in the account prior to deleting the local folders. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
