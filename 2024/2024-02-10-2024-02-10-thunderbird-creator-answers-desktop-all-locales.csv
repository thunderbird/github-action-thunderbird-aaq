About a week ago, one of my hotmail accounts started giving me a ""fail to log in"" message. The other accounts work fine. The ""fail to log in"" will go from 2 or 3 times to 15 to 20 times in about an hour or so but every time, sooner or later will work and then it will be fine for a few hours and then start again. I have had these accounts running on TB for well over 10 years with no problem and I have not changed anything in the Server settings or anywhere else. The account I am having the issue with has been running on TB since TB started with no problems until now. I assume that TB may be having some issues with the Outlook platform but I have not changed anything there either and I have no problem logging into <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> directly.
