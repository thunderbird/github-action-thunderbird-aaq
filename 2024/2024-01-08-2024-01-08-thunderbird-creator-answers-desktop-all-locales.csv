Using version 102 and all previous versions for many years with few problems. I have tried to update to SuperNova a couple of times. It takes my All Mail folder and divides it into two identical 'Archives/@gmail.com/All Mail' folders and half of my subfolders are in one of them and the others are in the second one. There is no rhyme or reason as to which ones it decides to seperate as far as I can tell. It makes it time consuming and inconvenient to find what i want, especially as it now runs off the page despite choosing Compact view.

I'll receive a meeting confirmation email when someone books, and linked from that email is an .ics file I can import to Thunderbird calendar. This all works fine except that meetings imported don't respect the default reminder setting. No reminder is set at all for these meetings - I have to edit each event manually to append the reminder to match what I have saved in the Reminder Defaults section of Settings (15 mins). </p><p>Meetings added to my calendar in other ways (i.e. an invitation direct to my inbox) respect and apply the 15min default. This places the blame on Calendly so I looked at the .ics files I'm getting from there and find no TRIGGER reference at all.  I imported an unrelated sample .ics file with the TRIGGER explicitly defined and this works, but in the absence of a TRIGGER reference in the Calendly files, my expectation is that the default reminder time would be applied. </p><p>Any advice on what may be happening? </p><p>Thanks </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",mail1974
