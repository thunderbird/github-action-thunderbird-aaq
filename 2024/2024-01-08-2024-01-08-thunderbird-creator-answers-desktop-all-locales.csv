I don't understand why Thunderbird, the most fully featured desktop email client doesn't offer scheduled send and has to rely on a third party add on to offer this feature?

Using version 102 and all previous versions for many years with few problems. I have tried to update to SuperNova a couple of times. It takes my All Mail folder and divides it into two identical 'Archives/@gmail.com/All Mail' folders and half of my subfolders are in one of them and the others are in the second one. There is no rhyme or reason as to which ones it decides to seperate as far as I can tell. It makes it time consuming and inconvenient to find what i want, especially as it now runs off the page despite choosing Compact view. Why is this happening, and how can I fix it? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",symetec
