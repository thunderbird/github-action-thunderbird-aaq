Sending and receiving emails is working correctly. The problem is viewing what is in the inbox, it shows a certain number in the inbox  but not all of those messages are showing up, some are missing. I've played around with the settings but I didn't see anythng that could help me out. On my own computer this works correctly, when I see a number in the inbox, it does show all of those email messages. Not sure what is going on, maybe it's simple like a setting not done correctly, or I missed something. Anyway, any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1640309;,t51

Settings are defaults, security is set to minimum, and I'm getting timed out errors from the outgoing server.  Same issue with two different  Macs (Mini and MB Air), both running Mac OS Sonoma.  Changing ports has no effect. Can send mail from the same Spectrum account via my iPhone, and Spectrum's webmail works fine, so the problem seems to be a new incompatibility of Spectrum with either Thunderbird or Mac OS. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",jpdemers1
