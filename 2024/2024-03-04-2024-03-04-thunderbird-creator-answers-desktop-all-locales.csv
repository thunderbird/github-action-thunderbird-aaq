Sending and receiving emails is working correctly. The problem is viewing what is in the inbox, it shows a certain number in the inbox  but not all of those messages are showing up, some are missing. I've played around with the settings but I didn't see anythng that could help me out. On my own computer this works correctly, when I see a number in the inbox, it does show all of those email messages. Not sure what is going on, maybe it's simple like a setting not done correctly, or I missed something.
