Sending and receiving emails is working correctly. The problem is viewing what is in the inbox, it shows a certain number in the inbox  but not all of those messages are showing up, some are missing. I've played around with the settings but I didn't see anythng that could help me out. On my own computer this works correctly, when I see a number in the inbox, it does show all of those email messages. Not sure what is going on, maybe it's simple like a setting not done correctly, or I missed something. Anyway, any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1640309;,t51

Settings are defaults, security is set to minimum, and I'm getting timed out errors from the outgoing server.  Same issue with two different  Macs (Mini and MB Air), both running Mac OS Sonoma.  Changing ports has no effect. Can send mail from the same Spectrum account via my iPhone, and Spectrum's webmail works fine, so the problem seems to be a new incompatibility of Spectrum with either Thunderbird or Mac OS. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1640340;,jpdemers1

But I am finding it very hard to distinguish those in bold from other messages that have been read and are not bold. Is there anything in advanced settings that would allow me to change the fill colour in the listing box, or perhaps the colour of the type, in order to distinguish unread messages more visibly from those I have read? Thanks! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",clivechafer

Moving around between new and archived mails is confusing. The new mails mus be closed on the banner and the archived mails right on the top. Which means that during working like that I close Thunderbird itself many times, have to restart the profile again etc. Not very speed improving. </p><p>I see two options: First: open arhived e-mail not as an extra window but within the mail screen second: make it possible to point to a local map within ""local maps"", or make it possible to archive in local maps outside Thinderbird, hence in any local map on my computer (or NAS server) Then the user interface with a banner for opened e-mails is similar for archived mail and new ones. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",firefox@vangelder.nl

I uses POP account settings.  I can only find a setting that deletes the trash on exit, but that is too quick.  I need more time to recover email from the trash in case I am later alerted to the fact that something I thought was trash turns out to be important.  Usually a week or two will suffice.  After 30 days, it's a pretty safe bet that anything in the trash is actually trash, so then I want to delete it automatically.  Seems like there must be a setting for this somewhere.  Anyone know if there is one?  If not, how do we request that it be added as an option?  Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ppriu
