Syncing works correctly between Thunderbird and iCloud (both ways).  However, new entries created in Thunderbird (although correctly syncing with iCloud on the net) do not appear in the Mac Contacts app on the Mac desktop. Strangely, these entries appear on my iPad Contacts app. It is only entries <strong>created in Thunderbird </strong>that do not sync through to the desktop Contacts app. Yet I can create a new entry in my desktop app and it syncs through to Thunderbird correctly.  I can also edit any entry on Thunderbird created on an Apple device and the changes go through to all my devices.  It seems that the format used when creating a new entry in Thunderbird is creating a problem in the syncing process between my iCloud account and the desktop app. Any ideas? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1647113;1647154;,harlin1
