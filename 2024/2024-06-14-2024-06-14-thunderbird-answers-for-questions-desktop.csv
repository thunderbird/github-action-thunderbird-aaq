A few suggestions: - I suggest compacting daily, not automatically, but set for manual. That ensure someone sees it. - I also suggest having a backup policy and administer to it. This is the business. The discussion forces the owner to either take ownership of the data, or put all faith in Comcast that nothing will ever be lost. The policy should be in writing and discussed and understood. One option might be a separate, local server that backs up everything on the fly. This is the business. Keep in front of management the problem that will happen if email is lost.  - I suggest you consider an archive policy to preserve old, non-current, messages. That may be downloading and archiving to a cloud server. For example, a conversation with a customer form 1995 doesn't need to be instantly accessible.  - I also suggest, although some here will disagree, to set the update feature OFF for thunderbird. This is a business and should not be susceptible to automatic software upgrades. It just takes one update that doesn't work (or is interrupted by an antivirus) to have you pulling your hair for hours or more.  - good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
