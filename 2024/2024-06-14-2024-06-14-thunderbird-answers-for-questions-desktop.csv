I have been dealing with this problem myself, as a user, for six months of intermittent problems.  I described an overview history of my attempts to deal with it in my first email on thsi problem sent today.   I am trying to suggest that the KB article about Outlook and TB  for 2024 on this site, and the cited Microsoft article, had some effect but did not solve the problem. So I am trying to invite support people to realize that.  </p><p>At present, I think I have come up with an alternate solution which so far has worked for about 2 and 1/2 days at 100%--better than any other solution since January when the problem began.  </p><p>My present solution (not mentioned in previous Thunderbird KB articles as near as I can tell), for a personal Microsoft account working smoothly with TB in 2024 is:  </p><p>1) Turn on 2FA for Microsoft account. 2) Obtain app password from Microsoft account. 3) In TB Server settings, have Imap server set to imap.outlook [or is it outlook.imap? I forget) and Normal password. </p><pre>4) Have SMTP server set to outlook [NOT Office365] and Normal password (not Qauth2). [5A. I left cookies enabled also.]  5B. Restart Thunderbird. 6. When at start-up TB promprts to enter password for IMAP, enter the new App password. 7. When TB prompts for SMTP password, enter the new App password.  </pre> <p>This procedure seems to work, allowing me to continue for the 10th year to use TB with hotmail. Nothing else that I've read anywhere has since January allowed my TB on Windows 10 desktop to work consistently without continuous reports of password errors and authentication requests.  I would be happy to learn more if there is something that actually applies to my situation to learn. Otherwise, I am trying to save other people the trouble that I've had for many months when I have tried to follow posted guidance that doesn't work for my case. I described the history of those troubles earlier.  Thank you again.  Best regards. </p>",kmartinp,false,0,0

If my solution remains 100% to have ended all authentication and password problems between TB and Hotmail (so far, in day 3, it's still 100%), I think it suggests that there is something more error-prone about the way TB handles Qauth and authentication for residential hotmail users than the way it is handled by other kinds of software....Users like me depend on the TB community to make this smooth and seamless and not just a duct tape ""maybe"" kind of solution, even if Microsoft is less popular to many tekkies than other email servies.  Please fix the TB code so it is just as robust with Qauth2 when logging on to outlook.imap as the outlook app itself.  </p><p>Thanks.  </p><p><br> </p><p>Thank you. </p>",kmartinp,false,0,0

A few suggestions: - I suggest compacting daily, not automatically, but set for manual. That ensure someone sees it. - I also suggest having a backup policy and administer to it. This is the business. The discussion forces the owner to either take ownership of the data, or put all faith in Comcast that nothing will ever be lost. The policy should be in writing and discussed and understood. One option might be a separate, local server that backs up everything on the fly. This is the business. Keep in front of management the problem that will happen if email is lost.  - I suggest you consider an archive policy to preserve old, non-current, messages. That may be downloading and archiving to a cloud server. For example, a conversation with a customer form 1995 doesn't need to be instantly accessible.  - I also suggest, although some here will disagree, to set the update feature OFF for thunderbird. This is a business and should not be susceptible to automatic software upgrades. It just takes one update that doesn't work (or is interrupted by an antivirus) to have you pulling your hair for hours or more.  - good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
