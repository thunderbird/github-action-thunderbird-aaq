How do I access the contents of the Inbox folder?  TB won't load it and it crashes the program when I try.   </blockquote> <p>OK, we must change our strategy. Does TB crash immediately on startup?  As long as TB is still responsive go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Disk Space: click on ""Clear Now"", then go to Indexing and uncheck ""Enable Global Search and Indexer"". </p><p>If this doesn't work, open the TB profile folder following this description <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_finding-your-profile-without-opening-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_finding-your-profile-without-opening-thunderbird</a> In the profile folder search for rhe file <strong>global-messages-db.sqlite</strong> and delete it. Then open the subfolder ""Mail"", open the account folder pop.xxx.xx and delete the file <strong>Inbox.msf</strong>. On restart TB will take some time to rebuild the Inbox.msf and the global-messages-db.sqlite files (you can follow progress in the left corner of the status bar).  </p><p>If TB still hangs, force-quit the application. Go again to the Profile folder &gt; Mail &gt; pop.xxx.xx, rename the big Inbox file to <strong>Inbox-1</strong> and delete the Inbox.msf file. This manipulation neutralizes the big Inbox and and on restart forces Thunderbird to create a new Inbox which will download the messages still being on the server! </p><p>By this manipulation at least you should get a Thunderbird which no longer becomes unresponsive. But there still is the fate of the big Inbox which seems to be damaged and the question how to recover all the messages stored in it.  [If you had a Mac or Linux PC it would be easy to cut the big Inbox file into <strong>smaller</strong> Mbox files of 1 GB or 500 MB each by a simple command line in the Terminal] There are Mbox-Breaker tools in the Internet, some free for smaller files or paying for big GB files. I can't test them because I have a Mac. </p><p>You could also open the big Inbox file in a text editor and cut it manually in two or three or more smaller mbox files (copy &amp; paste method).

It never comes up.  Any way to force that? </p><p>I know it is sometimes difficult to come across as sincere, but your response definitely didn't come across as sincere, more like a jerk.  Maybe I should just move on to another email client that is more responsive? </p>",Lokimeister,false,0,0

For each folder that you want to be able to search, including ""Trash"", right click on the folder name, select ""Properties"", and click on ""Include messages in this folder in the Global Search results""m then ""OK"". Indexing will take a little time if your folders are big or many. The Activity Manager should tell you when the indexing for each folder is done. </p><p>2. Try your typical searches and note the results. </p><p>3. Let us know your search terms and how well the searches worked. </p><p>Rick </p>",user213815874572776100201782415079883066567,false,0,0

I believe that repairing is helpful when, e.g., messages are not appearing in the list of messages because an index specific to that folder is corrupt. </p>",user213815874572776100201782415079883066567,false,0,0
