So thing go pear shaped on the very next released update because the underlying problem on your system has not been addressed. </p><p>I am forced to guess,  because your description does not offer anything to go on,  but generally the issue is Thunderbird was originally installed as a 32bit version and at some point in the last few years has been updated to a 64bit version.  This means that the location the executable file is stored triggers Thunderbird to abandon your exiting profile. based on the rules it has for profile per install. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation</a> </p><p>This ""feature"" is a royal PITA and the developers apparently just can not see the forest for the trees.  They think it is great and my attempts over the years to get a sensible change implemented have not only fallen on deaf ears,  the developers express a lack of understanding of just what the problem is.  They do not grasp how infuriating the thing is to average people. (me included) </p><p>So your profiles.ini file is not corrupt,  so proceeding like it is is just perpetuation the problem.  Use the profile manager as described in the article,  or the command line as I describe in this old bog post from 2019 to force Thunderbird to use the right profile, instead of applying the band-aid. <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2019/09/i-lost-my-profilemail-on-update-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2019/09/i-lost-my-profilemail-on-update-to.html</a> </p><p>Once Thunderbird has been told this profile for this version of Thunderbird the ongoing issues should cease. At least until you move the profile to a new device,  or change user names or change the 64 V 32 bit versions. (some have to revert to 32 bit version to make MAPI work from their accounting package.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Please check in task manager to see if there is already a process running before you click the link.  That will at least start the diagnostic process as to what is happening. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

About mid screen you should see ""Show only display names from my address book""  unchecked it. </p><p>I am guessing you have two individuals in the address book with the exact same email address, so Thunderbird is replacing the address on the incoming email with the first it finds in the address book. </p><p>Fundamentally it is actually a bad idea for husbands and wives to share an mail address.  It appears to be fairly common in some localities especially in the USA, but it harks from a time when snail mail arrived at an address and it was then sorted as to which household member it was addressed to.  What you are experiencing is that email really does not allow for this household addressing.  You can make it sort of work.  But eventually it will trip you up. </p><p>A friend of mine was doing something similar sharing an address and when her partner predeceased her she lost all access to the historical mail and access to the account because it was not ""hers"" for months.  Until all the legal stuff with the estate was finalized. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
