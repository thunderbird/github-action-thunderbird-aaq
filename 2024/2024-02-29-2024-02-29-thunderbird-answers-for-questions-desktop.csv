If yes then you need to switch it off or create a tunnel for Thundebird to use. Gmail and many servers do not like VPN because gmail is expecting your computer IP address and if it's getting something else the server thinks someone is trying to hack your account so may just block access. </p><p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Are you running any program that uses the 'localhost' eg: Apache&nbsp;?

They do not grasp how infuriating the thing is to average people. (me included) </p><p>So your profiles.ini file is not corrupt,  so proceeding like it is is just perpetuation the problem.  Use the profile manager as described in the article,  or the command line as I describe in this old bog post from 2019 to force Thunderbird to use the right profile, instead of applying the band-aid. <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2019/09/i-lost-my-profilemail-on-update-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2019/09/i-lost-my-profilemail-on-update-to.html</a> </p><p>Once Thunderbird has been told this profile for this version of Thunderbird the ongoing issues should cease.

I checked my Profiles folder in %appdata% and found that my number of profiles has grown from one to four!  Two are regular #.default folders and two are #.default-release folders.  In the Profiles folder, I see them like this (renaming the alphanumeric names with simplified a-d lettering for convenience): </p><p>a.default-release b.default c.default d.default-release </p><p>In this case, c.default is my original profile.  I have no idea where the other ones came from. </p><p>I opened the Profile Manager as suggested to see what's going on.
