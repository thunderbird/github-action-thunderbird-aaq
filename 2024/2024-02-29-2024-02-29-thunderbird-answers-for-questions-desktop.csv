If yes then you need to switch it off or create a tunnel for Thundebird to use. Gmail and many servers do not like VPN because gmail is expecting your computer IP address and if it's getting something else the server thinks someone is trying to hack your account so may just block access. </p><p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Are you running any program that uses the 'localhost' eg: Apache&nbsp;?

I would not expect it to be a firewall problem as Wireshark shows TB successfully making the connection to the imap port (993) but failing in the TLS handshake (the server resets the connection). Also, the OAuth signin is obviously allowed for the SMTP submission, and all that is the standard https port anyway. </p><p><strong>VPN:</strong> I am not running a VPN (and it would be unlikely to be the culprit, for the same reasons given above for the firewall). </p><p><strong>Localhost:</strong> I don't see why this would matter at all, but anyway TB and wireshark were the only programs running. </p>",mortenlarsen,false,0,0

Please check in task manager to see if there is already a process running before you click the link.

It appears to be fairly common in some localities especially in the USA, but it harks from a time when snail mail arrived at an address and it was then sorted as to which household member it was addressed to.  What you are experiencing is that email really does not allow for this household addressing.  You can make it sort of work.  But eventually it will trip you up. </p><p>A friend of mine was doing something similar sharing an address and when her partner predeceased her she lost all access to the historical mail and access to the account because it was not ""hers"" for months.
