I've been using Thunderbird since Eudora went extinct back in the 90's, and I have dozens of (single and multi-criteria) filters in place. The only ones that don't work are the ones where I'm trying to filter based on URLs in the message body. I don't see how a screenshot is going to help someone understand what I'm after. FWIW, I've added the text that accompanies the URL as a filter criteria, but IMHO, I shouldn't have to do that and I'm afraid it will sweep up some non-intended emails along with the ones I want to filter. </p>",jsimmonstx,false,0,0

I'm gonna call out the people that say that, because TB can identify the body of a message, and can therefor escape the html into plain text. I see no technical reason - from a programming standpoint - why TB cannot be made to run a filter against html. I've been a programmer for over 40 years, and I've written more than my fair share of html parsing code. It ain't hard to search for text in a html stream. </p>",jsimmonstx,false,0,0

It's not a matter of coding proficiency, but of designing to a target audience.

(As an off-topic comment: you mentioned Eudora being extinct, but my dear spouse has used it daily since version 3, somewhere around 1997. And I'm too smart to try and take it away from her. It works flawlessly. We bought 7.1 in 2007 and that was the last true version. ) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The SPF and DKIM refer to settings that need to be in your server (not in Thunderbird). I suggest you share these messages with your email provider to get it fixed. Google (and many other email providers) have been getting tougher in past couple of years on security, and your issue has been posted here regularly as others have had the same problem. (Brief overview: Gmail sees your email address as johndoe@xxx.com, but also sees that the email account is hosted at <a href=""http://zzz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zzz.com</a>. The server at <a href=""http://zzz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zzz.com</a> has no indicators that your account is hosted there, so Gmail refuses the message.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
