That is why your space is so large, all those duplicates. Duplicates happen because something (antivirus? firewall? some monitoring software?) is interrupting or placing a hold on thunderbird folders. When thunderbird tries to update an account and cannot, it creates a new name, and that causes duplications. I suggest browsing through them for the latest date. The IMAP account will repopulate, but be careful in reviewing the POP to avoid deleting the one that may have most recent messages.

I looked at the computers on which Thunderbird has properly loaded all email addresses, and they are set up with these .com host names. </p><p>It's so strange. As I said, I was able to add the info@beatitbugs.com to my desk's computer this morning. Now I am setting up a new Mac for my boss and I cannot add info@beatitbugs.com even though I am doing everything the same as this morning. </p><p>Are the .ca hostnames only for Canada and that's why the article isn't showing it to me? Would it harm anything for me to try to set up the email addresses on this new Mac with those .ca hostnames? </p>",JadeandPearl,false,0,0

To do that,  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder - exit thunderbird (IMPORTANT) - you are now in the profile, back up three times in File Explorer and then copy the folder named Thunderbird to somewhere else.  - now start and uninstall the 32-bit version. At end, it may prompt on whether to delete data folders. DO NOT ALLOW.  - now install the 64-bit version and it should be okay, as all settings are in the profile, not the software. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
