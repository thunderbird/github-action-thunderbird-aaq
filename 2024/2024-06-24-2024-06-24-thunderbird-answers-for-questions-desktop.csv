I have not looked at the article in almost a decade (April 2014) so most of the links to providers will be dead.  However the background is still valid and the last thing I would recommend it leaving Thunderbird running for a month while you were away. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Perhaps you need to right click in the tab and select close all other tabs from the menu.  While there is no technical limit on the number of tabs you can have open,  they each consume system resources and ultimately may affect how fast your computer can run. </p><p>However Alt+1 is the shortcut the spaces toolbar suggests when I hover over the icon that takes you back to the inbox and folders. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-06-24-01-37-23-9d859a.png""> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The only time it responds to a single click to see mail what when the reading/message pane is active (ctrl+F8 toggles it on and off) </p><p>Just try pressing  (alt+1) to switch open tabs to the folder tab with your inbox </p><p>AS I personally do not like most of the user interface changes that came with V115 I have customized a lot of settings in the application.  But one thing that has not changed in the last 10 years is the three pane view of mail with a folder pane, mail list and reading pane. If it had gone missing I would have followed it out the door. </p><p>I also use the Wide view which places two columns in the top half of the windows and the email in the bottom half (with the reading/message pane turned on. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I've been using Thunderbird since Eudora went extinct back in the 90's, and I have dozens of (single and multi-criteria) filters in place. The only ones that don't work are the ones where I'm trying to filter based on URLs in the message body. I don't see how a screenshot is going to help someone understand what I'm after. FWIW, I've added the text that accompanies the URL as a filter criteria, but IMHO, I shouldn't have to do that and I'm afraid it will sweep up some non-intended emails along with the ones I want to filter. </p>",jsimmonstx,false,0,0

I'm gonna call out the people that say that, because TB can identify the body of a message, and can therefor escape the html into plain text. I see no technical reason - from a programming standpoint - why TB cannot be made to run a filter against html. I've been a programmer for over 40 years, and I've written more than my fair share of html parsing code. It ain't hard to search for text in a html stream. </p>",jsimmonstx,false,0,0
