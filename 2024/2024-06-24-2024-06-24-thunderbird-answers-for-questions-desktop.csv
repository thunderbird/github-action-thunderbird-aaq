I see no technical reason - from a programming standpoint - why TB cannot be made to run a filter against html. I've been a programmer for over 40 years, and I've written more than my fair share of html parsing code. It ain't hard to search for text in a html stream. </p>",jsimmonstx,false,0,0

There can be several reasons, but it's best you contact your mail service provider as the problem is not caused by TB (or any other mail client).  If your messages contain several links or remotely-hosted images, perhaps included in a signature, that can trigger spam filters at the recipients' server.  See if the same error shows when you send a plain text test message without a signature. </p><p>As for the 'server expired' (timeout) error, that can be caused by antivirus that scans outgoing mail.  If the antivirus is not MS/Windows Security/Defender, set your antivirus to not scan the TB profile folder or outgoing mail or secure connections.  Better, if it's something like Avast/AVG/Norton, remove it and use the built-in Windows AV. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

(Brief overview: Gmail sees your email address as johndoe@xxx.com, but also sees that the email account is hosted at <a href=""http://zzz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zzz.com</a>. The server at <a href=""http://zzz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zzz.com</a> has no indicators that your account is hosted there, so Gmail refuses the message.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

That is why your space is so large, all those duplicates. Duplicates happen because something (antivirus? firewall? some monitoring software?) is interrupting or placing a hold on thunderbird folders. When thunderbird tries to update an account and cannot, it creates a new name, and that causes duplications. I suggest browsing through them for the latest date. The IMAP account will repopulate, but be careful in reviewing the POP to avoid deleting the one that may have most recent messages.

I have an earlier version (102.5) so I'll upgrade but I don't think the problem is that I have a corrupted address book (I never any other problems with it). But I'll see if this works. It's just so stupidly frustrating that it doesn't simply let me click and drag from my main address book into one of the many folders I have in ""my groups"", which it always did in the past. </p>",sufried,false,1,0

A long time ago, I made a huge set of folders under ""my groups"" because that's how it was done, and I was able to add hundreds of addresses to each folder with the click &amp; drag method. For whatever reason, I also had that one within the Personal Address Book (the NCO one). I just tested it--I grabbed an address of someone and dragged it in, and it worked! </p><p>But then I tried to figure out how I could drag any of the folders in ""my groups"" into the same place as the NCO one, and I couldn't, and there was no ""move"" function. </p><p>So clearly, if I need to create a new group list, I would start it in the same place as the NCO one, but that doesn't help with the thousands of names I have within all my other group lists (I teach and I make films, so I need a lot of groups to email people info about stuff...) </p><p>Anyway, if you have any idea how a group from there can be moved up into the PAB area, please let me know. Thanks again! Su </p>",sufried,false,0,0

Lists are bound to the address book that contains the underlying contacts.  But I don't see the necessity to move the lists from the 'my groups' address book to Personal Address Book; you would have to first copy or move the contacts from 'my groups' to PAB (drag and drop to move, hold Ctrl while dragging and dropping to copy), then recreate the lists under PAB, then add to the lists by drag and drop from PAB.  Not much would be gained, and the lists would function the same way they do now in separate address books. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
