Thunderbird was extremely reliable, but since default threads introduced it is now unreliable are now very difficult to remove as all I want to do is view each email individually (no linking to anything)  and search by name, date, or specific word. The experience of using Thunderbird is now frustrating because of threads that seem impossible to remove, time sorting etc. I have even tried going back to an older version, but lost a lot of mails in doing so. </p><p>My question after reading all the possible methods of removing Threads and having no success, would the wonderful creators of Thunderbird possibly consider creating an email browser version which simplified would give a viewing experience without any threads, or even an option of threads.. just going back to an older version of no threads at all without losing data? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1663245;,info11634

Strangely, they're all from 2016. </p><p>I already tried manually looking for the emails in Thunderbird, permanently deleted trash emails, and compacted folders, but even after that and restarting the computer several times Kaspersky still finds them. Unfortunately, because of the ban on Kaspersky in the USA, I can't post to their message boards to ask for help. </p><p>So, is it safe to delete the file 'trash?'

I used Mac Mail for the last 20 years, I know that is pretty good, but I was told Thunderbird is at least function, if not as 'pretty' (some say).  </p><p>I dont use the Quick Filter box as I have a ton of local folders and usually just need to find an email which could be anywhere, but i KNOW it's there.  </p><p>I begun testing it. Noticed a few things so wondering if someone can advise if this is just me, or normal behaviour... </p><p>In the global search, I finally realised (i think anyway) that it does not actually search everywhere, far from it. For instance, I searched for emails many times and it said they don't exist, so i panicked thinking they were lost, but no, I dived into Deleted Items and there they were. I store deleted items for 3 months, and often refer back to them for past purchase receipts or similar in the rare occasion that I need it again for some reason. </p><p>- It doesn't seem to search (doesn't find anyway) in my Imap Deleted Items folder,.  OR the Local Folders </p><p>- It isn't searching/finding emails in my Local Folderrs, which is a HUGE problem as 95% of my email is stored in those. Why wouldn't a global search find stuff in my local folders? I have tested it and confirmed it's not searching in any of them. </p><p>- I have ebay messages in my INBOX, from a username starting with perrie134 - I tried BOTH the quick filter and the CTRL K search, searching for 'perrie134' and then 'perr' and ZERO messages come up. Does the search not include 'from' info? </p><p>As far as I can tell, the search is not working at all. So I am hoping something must surely be wrong my end, but grateful if someone can comment. I can't use a program that can't find emails when I type in information included in 'from' and 'subject' areas, but at this point it's failing in every way. </p><p>Appreciate any advice/thoughts.
