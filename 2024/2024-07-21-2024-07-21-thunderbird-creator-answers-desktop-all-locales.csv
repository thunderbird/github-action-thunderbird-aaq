Thunderbird was extremely reliable, but since default threads introduced it is now unreliable are now very difficult to remove as all I want to do is view each email individually (no linking to anything)  and search by name, date, or specific word. The experience of using Thunderbird is now frustrating because of threads that seem impossible to remove, time sorting etc. I have even tried going back to an older version, but lost a lot of mails in doing so. </p><p>My question after reading all the possible methods of removing Threads and having no success, would the wonderful creators of Thunderbird possibly consider creating an email browser version which simplified would give a viewing experience without any threads, or even an option of threads.. just going back to an older version of no threads at all without losing data? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",info11634
