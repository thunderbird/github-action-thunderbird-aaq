I store deleted items for 3 months, and often refer back to them for past purchase receipts or similar in the rare occasion that I need it again for some reason. </p><p>- It doesn't seem to search (doesn't find anyway) in my Imap Deleted Items folder,.  OR the Local Folders </p><p>- It isn't searching/finding emails in my Local Folderrs, which is a HUGE problem as 95% of my email is stored in those. Why wouldn't a global search find stuff in my local folders? I have tested it and confirmed it's not searching in any of them. </p><p>- I have ebay messages in my INBOX, from a username starting with perrie134 - I tried BOTH the quick filter and the CTRL K search, searching for 'perrie134' and then 'perr' and ZERO messages come up. Does the search not include 'from' info? </p><p>As far as I can tell, the search is not working at all. So I am hoping something must surely be wrong my end, but grateful if someone can comment. I can't use a program that can't find emails when I type in information included in 'from' and 'subject' areas, but at this point it's failing in every way. </p><p>Appreciate any advice/thoughts.
