Noticed a few things so wondering if someone can advise if this is just me, or normal behaviour... </p><p>In the global search, I finally realised (i think anyway) that it does not actually search everywhere, far from it. For instance, I searched for emails many times and it said they don't exist, so i panicked thinking they were lost, but no, I dived into Deleted Items and there they were. I store deleted items for 3 months, and often refer back to them for past purchase receipts or similar in the rare occasion that I need it again for some reason. </p><p>- It doesn't seem to search (doesn't find anyway) in my Imap Deleted Items folder,.  OR the Local Folders </p><p>- It isn't searching/finding emails in my Local Folderrs, which is a HUGE problem as 95% of my email is stored in those. Why wouldn't a global search find stuff in my local folders? I have tested it and confirmed it's not searching in any of them. </p><p>- I have ebay messages in my INBOX, from a username starting with perrie134 - I tried BOTH the quick filter and the CTRL K search, searching for 'perrie134' and then 'perr' and ZERO messages come up. Does the search not include 'from' info? </p><p>As far as I can tell, the search is not working at all. So I am hoping something must surely be wrong my end, but grateful if someone can comment.

I've checked my web mail and they are still showing there. My other account on Thunderbird still has all folders. I've checked the settings and they are the same in both. When I go to 'subscribe' by right click there's no archive folder listed there. Checking the server settings local directory it only has the inbox as the pic I'll post. How can I get my archive folder and subfolders back? Please understand I'm 69 and not real well, and although I do a lot of simple tech stuff I'm not really up with this sort of thing! Hope someone can help please. 🙏 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1663335;,cheryl.h

Ik heb mijn spam en junkfolder bekeken welke berichten vals waren en welke ik zeker ken de junk folder wordt zo wie zo geleegd. nu weet ik niet wat gedaan. bij mijn provider kan ik ook via email de mails bekijken, daar was niets aan de hand. Ik ga ook eens proberen met opnieuw opstarten, eens kijken of dat helpt? verder blijf ik van andere berichten. ik kan thunderbird ook proberen op mijn laptop kijken of daar ook het probleem van toepassing is. Ik hoop dat u mij hierop een antwoord kunt geven. Of ik mijn gegevens of e-mails nog kan back-uppen of in het ergste geval het programma opnieuw installeren, maar dat is echt het laatste dat ik zou willen doen. nu kreeg ik juist nog een e-mail binnen en deze is wel goed binnen gekomen. maar toch had iets meer geweten, zoals ik al melde hierboven.  </p><p>Met vriendelijke groenten,  Leppens Mark </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,nl,1663432;,leppens.mark35
