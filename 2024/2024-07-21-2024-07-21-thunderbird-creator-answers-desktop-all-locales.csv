Thunderbird was extremely reliable, but since default threads introduced it is now unreliable are now very difficult to remove as all I want to do is view each email individually (no linking to anything)  and search by name, date, or specific word. The experience of using Thunderbird is now frustrating because of threads that seem impossible to remove, time sorting etc. I have even tried going back to an older version, but lost a lot of mails in doing so. </p><p>My question after reading all the possible methods of removing Threads and having no success, would the wonderful creators of Thunderbird possibly consider creating an email browser version which simplified would give a viewing experience without any threads, or even an option of threads.. just going back to an older version of no threads at all without losing data? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",info11634

C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\8man8wy0.default\Mail\<a href=""http://pop.secureserver-1.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.secureserver-1.net</a>\trash// </p><p>It is simply named 'trash' and has no file type (file type just says 'file'), and is for a mail server I don't use anymore (pop.sercureserver). It also says it hasn't been modified in four years. </p><p>The reason I want to delete it is because Kaspersky antivirus detected four dangerous objects there that it can't resolve or delete and won't let me quarantine. Strangely, they're all from 2016. </p><p>I already tried manually looking for the emails in Thunderbird, permanently deleted trash emails, and compacted folders, but even after that and restarting the computer several times Kaspersky still finds them. Unfortunately, because of the ban on Kaspersky in the USA, I can't post to their message boards to ask for help. </p><p>So, is it safe to delete the file 'trash?'  And would I need to delete Trash.msf and/or the folder Trash.sbd also? </p><p>Any assistance would be much appreciated, thank you. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",lord.severitus
