My system language is German. i don`t see the Charms to select Search, unless I am supposed to search on top right, like the screenshot shows. When I do so, there is no result, which might have to do with the language. I cannot open Thunderbird. </p><p>When using the alternative (Alternatively, you can find your profile by pressing the Windows Key key and then start typing: %APPDATA%\Thunderbird\Profiles\) there is also no result due to the search term being in English, I suppose </p><p>Thank you for your reply, but I need more information please or the correct translation to German for %APPDATA%\Thunderbird\Profiles\ </p>",janalakegarda,false,0,0

The name is 'everything' and it is free at <a href=""https://www.voidtools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.voidtools.com/</a>   download and install and start it. It's very small and is the fastest search tool on the planet. Once started, enter prefs.js and within 2 seconds, it will have found it. I use Everything almost every day when searching for a file.  Let me know if you get this resolved. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you see NSTMP files, they can be deleted. Over time, other problems may have surfaced, causing the POP account folders to appear more than once, such as inbox, inbox-1.
