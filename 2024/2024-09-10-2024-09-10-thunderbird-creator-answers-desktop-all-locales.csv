That is, some email clients appear to be sending to what's in the 'From:' field, not the 'Reply-To:' field (or the X-Google-Original-From one). The Venues address is only used by me, where the Punters address is shared with two other band members, so it matters what email address people reply to. </p><p>I've examined the account settings for both email addresses in Thunderbird and in Google, and can't work out what's going on. </p><p>I've been using this email setup for the last decade.

Reading or deleting these messages will either reduce the boldface entry or remove the message from the message pane, but the red dot notification icon and new message count persists.  The only way to clear these seems to be to expand the Unified Inbox to show all email accounts, and then simply click sequentially on the account names until the notification drops from the Windows tray.
