Therefore forgive my mistakes.  </p><p>I installed Thunderbird 128.2.0esr (64 bit, German language) on Windows 10 to check it out as an alternative to MS Outlook.

I assume - after setting up Thunderbird - it will be rarely used - there is also the alternative by using the right mouse button on any of the columns - but it takes column space. Is it possible to hide/remove the column picker? </p><p>In my humble opinion above - next to ""display options for message list pane"" - would be a better place. </p><p>Thank you very much, Reinhard </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1673715;,Goshmos_Castle

Let's call them 'venues@gmail.com' and 'punters@gmail.com'. </p><p>I access both accounts using Thunderbird 115.13.0 (64-bit), under Linux Mint. </p><p>When someone emails the band on the Punters address I reply to it in Thunderbird, which automatically sets my From: address as punters@gmail.com. </p><p>What happens next is that my reply appears in the Sent Items for BOTH Punters and Venues. The copy in the Punters sent folder says that it's from ""Punters &lt;punters@gmail.com&gt;"", but the copy in the Venues sent folder says it's from ""Punters &lt;venues@gmail.com&gt;"". </p><p>When I examine the headers, there's extra stuff in the copy in the Venues account, specifically a 'Received: from' entry that makes it look like the email has been routed via a Google server, so suspect this might be a Google issue and not a Thunderbird one, but I'm not sure. </p><p>The email headers for the two copies include the following lines: </p><p>Punters copy: </p><p>From: Punters &lt;punters@gmail.com&gt; Reply-To: punters@gmail.com </p><p>Venues copy: </p><p>From: Punters &lt;venues@gmail.com&gt; Reply-To: punters@gmail.com X-Google-Original-From: Punters &lt;punters@gmail.com&gt; </p><p>The problem I have is that when people reply back to my reply, while most often they're sent to punters@gmail.com, sometimes they're sent to venues@gmail.com. That is, some email clients appear to be sending to what's in the 'From:' field, not the 'Reply-To:' field (or the X-Google-Original-From one). The Venues address is only used by me, where the Punters address is shared with two other band members, so it matters what email address people reply to. </p><p>I've examined the account settings for both email addresses in Thunderbird and in Google, and can't work out what's going on. </p><p>I've been using this email setup for the last decade. I'm not sure when this started happening, but possibly only within the last 6 months or so. </p><p>Has anyone seen this behaviour before and know how to stop it? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Piers66
