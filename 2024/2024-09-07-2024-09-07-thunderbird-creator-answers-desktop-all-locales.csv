That is, I just get code-- no message. Really annoying! I saw another comment on here that suggested one needed to repair folder; it seems to me I'm always repairing my inbox (because I thought perhaps I wasn't receiving all my messages, but the problem may have been from the sender).  I don't have any paid virus scan regularly scanning my PC-- except maybe Windows Defender, or whatever it's called these days?  I am using Win 11. But I don't think I have any viruses, either. I often run Win Defender or free Malwarebytes-- but not whilst receiving email. I have never had a virus that I'm aware of. The problem just started.  Should I re-install Thunderbird?

Well, I just found an interesting temporary fix: I send the offending message to ""junk"", then say it isn't junk, and send it back to my inbox: then it displays as it should. I tried to edit my original message here on Thunderbird with this new ""fix"", but was unable to. And it still doesn't solve why messages in my inbox load this way to begin with; but I thought it was interesting as a diagnostic feature.  </p><p>I am still wondering whether to reinstall Thunderbird...  </p><p>This has nothing to do with virus scans, because I don't have any going 24/7, that I'm aware of.

Utilizzo Thunderbird ormai da parecchi anni senza problemi fino ad un paio di mesi fa. Ultimamente mi è impossibile lavorare in queste condizioni: non riesco a trovare mail ricevute o già spedite, la ricerca con e senza filtri non dà risultati. Inoltre l'invio dei messaggi, anche senza allegati è lentissimo. Preciso che ho moltissimi messaggi nelle caselle di posta. Inoltre anche la ricezione si è molto rallentata. Non è più immediata come prima. Ho fatto controllare l'account  ma non siamo riusciti a risolvere il problema che si presenta prevalentemente su 2 pc  dei 5  che utilizzano Thunderbird ""in rete"". Scusate la poca dimestichezza con termini tecnici ma non so più che fare.  Grazie a chi mi potrà dare qualche consiglio.
