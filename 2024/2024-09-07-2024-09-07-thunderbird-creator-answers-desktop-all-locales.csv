That is, I just get code-- no message. Really annoying! I saw another comment on here that suggested one needed to repair folder; it seems to me I'm always repairing my inbox (because I thought perhaps I wasn't receiving all my messages, but the problem may have been from the sender).  I don't have any paid virus scan regularly scanning my PC-- except maybe Windows Defender, or whatever it's called these days?  I am using Win 11. But I don't think I have any viruses, either. I often run Win Defender or free Malwarebytes-- but not whilst receiving email. I have never had a virus that I'm aware of. The problem just started.  Should I re-install Thunderbird?

Well, I just found an interesting temporary fix: I send the offending message to ""junk"", then say it isn't junk, and send it back to my inbox: then it displays as it should. I tried to edit my original message here on Thunderbird with this new ""fix"", but was unable to. And it still doesn't solve why messages in my inbox load this way to begin with; but I thought it was interesting as a diagnostic feature.  </p><p>I am still wondering whether to reinstall Thunderbird...  </p><p>This has nothing to do with virus scans, because I don't have any going 24/7, that I'm aware of. Maybe Windows, though-- I'm never quite sure what it is doing. But no other 3rd party virus scans.

Utilizzo Thunderbird ormai da parecchi anni senza problemi fino ad un paio di mesi fa. Ultimamente mi è impossibile lavorare in queste condizioni: non riesco a trovare mail ricevute o già spedite, la ricerca con e senza filtri non dà risultati. Inoltre l'invio dei messaggi, anche senza allegati è lentissimo. Preciso che ho moltissimi messaggi nelle caselle di posta. Inoltre anche la ricezione si è molto rallentata. Non è più immediata come prima. Ho fatto controllare l'account  ma non siamo riusciti a risolvere il problema che si presenta prevalentemente su 2 pc  dei 5  che utilizzano Thunderbird ""in rete"". Scusate la poca dimestichezza con termini tecnici ma non so più che fare.  Grazie a chi mi potrà dare qualche consiglio.

Each mail account is configured to use their own credentials for Outgoing Server (SMTP). No sharing of SMTP credentials between accounts. </p><p>I have used the ""Customize From Address"" w/o creating an identity with my own domains a few times (the one-off use case, as described by TB). It is working with TB in general for each of my domains.  </p><p>Now on 2 occasions I realized that sending via ""Customize From Address"" from customaddress@mydomain1.com ended up being sent to Outgoing SMTP-Server of @mydomain2.com. Therefor failing on submission. </p><p>Will try to enable some sort of logging in TB to find out why that is happening - not sure if that will provide enough detail to find out why this is happening. </p><p>Are there any recommendations you have or good resources on how the emailaddress of ""Customize From Address"" is matched with the correct Outgoing SMTP Server? </p><p>Thanks starfish </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1673208;1673225;,sparklingstarfish

I have plenty of folders and subfolders and on left side in window with folders and subfolders sometimes but very often are displayed subfolders of - sometimes one and sometimes more folders. This happen without any click on main folder. Because my folder tree is pretty long this cause that folder that I need for my work is suddenly out of my desktop and I need to scroll to see it. Or I have to click on each displayed folder to hide subfolders. Is there any chance to avoid this kind of behavior.  Thanks.

Until now! </p><p>Since 1-2 weeks the programme does not download my emails anymore. I have to go to my hosting company and download my emails from my various domains, which is a pain. I read your ""solution"" in the help section, but it does not help as yet. I don't know what I might have done to change the settings, but when clicking on ""Get Messages"" no text at the bottom bar apears that it is looking for mail, but only a blue coloured bar at the right bottom on my screen apears and when completed disappears again. When I then go to my host company (Dot5Hosting) I can find my new emails. </p><p>What do I need to do to solve this problem? Thank you very much in advance for your solution(s).
