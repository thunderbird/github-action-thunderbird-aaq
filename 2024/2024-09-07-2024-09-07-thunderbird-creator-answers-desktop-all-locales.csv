That is, I just get code-- no message. Really annoying! I saw another comment on here that suggested one needed to repair folder; it seems to me I'm always repairing my inbox (because I thought perhaps I wasn't receiving all my messages, but the problem may have been from the sender).  I don't have any paid virus scan regularly scanning my PC-- except maybe Windows Defender, or whatever it's called these days?  I am using Win 11. But I don't think I have any viruses, either. I often run Win Defender or free Malwarebytes-- but not whilst receiving email. I have never had a virus that I'm aware of. The problem just started.  Should I re-install Thunderbird? Thx, </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",twilightgold
