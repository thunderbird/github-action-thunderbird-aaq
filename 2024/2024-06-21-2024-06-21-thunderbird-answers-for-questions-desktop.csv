My suggestion first is to contact your email provider to confirm whatever is needed to secure a new password. If your credit cards are with your bank, contact them immediately, as they should be able to confirm who you are because they can verify your mailing address-- an that may also be true for the email provider. Once you have those two, you can start contacting various persons who will need to know of the loss. Going FORWARD: My suggestions:  - establish a cloud backup service. It doesn't need to be a fancy one, just one that does daily backups of key files.  - some possible candidate files to back up would be  </p><pre>  - backup of browser profile, as it has passwords embedded   - backup of a a file with email passwords. there is a free utility at <a href=""https://www.nirsoft.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nirsoft.net/</a> that makes file of browser passwords and thunderbird passwords.    - a text file of credit card numbers and the 800 number for help  </pre> <p>Be SURE to create a password for the cloud backup that you will remember.  As as aside, Thunderbird does not have any offline storage of your accounts, so we cannot assist here. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
