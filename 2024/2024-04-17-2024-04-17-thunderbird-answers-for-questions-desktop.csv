Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there.

Thunderbird is just passing on the password you typed, or the password you told Thunderbird to remember. If the latter one doesn't work anymore try to login to your account via webmail. If your password somehow got lost, you'll have to check with your email provider about password reset options. Typically the password for sending and receiving messages is the same.

Gmail is not terribly responsive, and depends on reliable consistent internet...and high speed so I am not always waiting for the network. 3.

Ideally Thunderbird would keep a copy of every email on on my laptop.  </p><p>Thunderbird seems like the ideal desktop application to handle this but I don't think it is set up to work properly for me.   I thought IMAP would be the preferred protocol, but it seems that with imap Thunderbird only keeps headers on the laptop...and downloads the full email when you try to open the email.   This is problematic for me if this is correct.  I now think this means TB looks on the server each time I open an email...which may be causing my delay as TB has to wait for the server..?

That, alone, will save over 125GB.  - if you see any files with NSTMP in their names, they are interrupted compactions and can be deleted.  - another item to review is presence of the  folders named Allmail or Important.
