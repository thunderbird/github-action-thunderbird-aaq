A quick summary of those steps: - exit thunderbird on old PC - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird  to external media  - install thunderbird on new PC if not already done. Be sure to exit thunderbird if running - copy the backed up thunderbird folder from external media to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming which will overwrite the default thunderbird folder there - restart thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The importance of copying the Thunderbird folder (and not just the profile) is that the thunderbird folder contains two important item: the actual profile that is active AND the profiles.ini file that points to it. When thunderbird starts, it reads the profiles.ini file to know which profile to open. By copying both together, you guarantee that it will work. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

To be a bit clearer here. Delete on exit tries to connect to the imap sever so is triggering the TLS issue  - Checking mail server capabilities as  it attempts to log in. When Delete on exit  is unset the additional login attempt does not occur and Thunderbird exits gracefully. Hope this helps </p>,richard.duffin,false,0,0
