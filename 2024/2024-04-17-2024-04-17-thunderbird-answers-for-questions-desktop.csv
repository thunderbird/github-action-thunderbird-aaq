A quick summary of those steps: - exit thunderbird on old PC - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird  to external media  - install thunderbird on new PC if not already done. Be sure to exit thunderbird if running - copy the backed up thunderbird folder from external media to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming which will overwrite the default thunderbird folder there - restart thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
