Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there.

Thunderbird is just passing on the password you typed, or the password you told Thunderbird to remember. If the latter one doesn't work anymore try to login to your account via webmail. If your password somehow got lost, you'll have to check with your email provider about password reset options. Typically the password for sending and receiving messages is the same.
