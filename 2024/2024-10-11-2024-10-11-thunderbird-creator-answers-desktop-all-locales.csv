I refer to the ‘new’ imposition imposed by Microsoft with their ‘new’ authorisation and authentification nonsense when attempting to log in to account/s via Thunderbird. Why this is necessary when it is possible to log in via the usual manner direct is any body’s guess. My personal opinion is that it is a sordid and underhannd way of forcing us to subscribe to Outlook 365? Cynical me? For numerous reasons I need  and use 6 e-mail accounts, sadly all Microsoft (<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>. .co.uk and last but not least <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>). No need to explain why the excellent Thunderbird is used and has been for nigh on 15 years+. Over the past couple of months I have tried every conceivable configuration supplied by the support team and other poor users in the same position as me. None have solved my problem. I surely cannot be alone? I do not object to change if it is of benefit but this is madness. For the time being Thunderbird is redundant and the daily grind of signing in individually via Microsoft faces me everyday. Both time consuming and arguably pointless. If someone has a definitive solution please let me know. There must be one? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",under.pressure
