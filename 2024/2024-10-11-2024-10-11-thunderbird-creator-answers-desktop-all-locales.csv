I refer to the ‘new’ imposition imposed by Microsoft with their ‘new’ authorisation and authentification nonsense when attempting to log in to account/s via Thunderbird.

No need to explain why the excellent Thunderbird is used and has been for nigh on 15 years+. Over the past couple of months I have tried every conceivable configuration supplied by the support team and other poor users in the same position as me. None have solved my problem. I surely cannot be alone? I do not object to change if it is of benefit but this is madness. For the time being Thunderbird is redundant and the daily grind of signing in individually via Microsoft faces me everyday. Both time consuming and arguably pointless.

Google sends me a bounce message rejecting the calendar acceptance notifications because they are not signed with DKIM, since my DMARC settings require all messages to be signed with DKIM.  However, the recipient still sees my calendar response in their Google calendar, which is interesting.  I checked my sent messages and was surprised to see that the calendar acceptance from Thunderbird is sent without the normal DKIM signature configured on my email server.  I run Postfix with port 587 for sending email using the submission protocol, and Dovecot on port 993 (IMAP/S).  I may be able to set my Postfix installation to sign the calendar notifications with DKIM using a header check, however, that requires some advanced configuration and I'm not really sure it's possible-- I also noticed that my normal header checks do not seem to trigger when sending these calendar notifications.  My question would be why Thunderbird acceptances/declines are not sent through the normal SMTP channels that would trigger a DKIM signature.
