How this can be, when I'm told that TB requires that file to open, I don't know. </p><p>A search or my entire disk finds one other profile, in a folder ""...\Profiles\Importable"" that has a prefs.js, but that one is from over a year ago. The prefs.js file in that profile is not set to readonly itself, but both the profile folders show a [-] (not a checkmark) in the box for readonly status for the folder. </p><p>The date on the profile under ""importable"" tracks with my attempt at restoring my TB installation after buying a new PC. However some of the files in the supposedly used profile show as more recent that in the one under ""Importable"". </p><p>What is a series of steps to get things to work, including TB reporting correctly where it is reading profile information from? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1680781;1680790;1680793;1680796;,asmusf
