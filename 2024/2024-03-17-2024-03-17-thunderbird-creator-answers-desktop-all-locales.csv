What seems to happen is that the new window will contain the tab I was working with (address book, settings, etc.) and a tab for my mail, but that mail tab will have switched to a different mailbox. And then the new window that opened behind the other one will have a tab for my mail focusing on whichever mailbox was selected before. </p><p>This is driving me absolutely crazy!
