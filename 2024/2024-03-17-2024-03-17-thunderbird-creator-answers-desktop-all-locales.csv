My account was originally provided to me by my school and did not know account data like this was stored locally. After reinstalling thunderbird and reobtaining my account info thunderbird is telling me I have a wrong configuration, username or password. The configuration is automatically done when my school suffix is seen and I have rechecked my password and username multiple times to make sure I am not mis-inputting it. I have since asked the school for my info and after inputting it, it still does not work. Am I doing something wrong or is this an issue I have to resolve with the school? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1642682;,nickgarlinski
