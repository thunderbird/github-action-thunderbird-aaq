Please no leading spaces,  it places the entire paragraph on a single huge long line. </p> I found your quote from David in his reply to you here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1431898#answer-1646010"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1431898#answer-1646010</a> although why you quote him without a link for context I really do not understand.  With the quote in context,  I have half a chance of trying to comprehend what you are on about.  But only half,  because I also really don't get your word picture as anything but a poor grasp of threading.  This statement is most certainly not accurate. <blockquote>  The term ""threaded"" has two meanings or definitions or uses or whatever, which makes asking for help all the more difficult</blockquote> <p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(online_communication)"" rel=""nofollow"">Threading </a>is a very specific way of sorting email in a single folder in Thunderbird's implementation and this is expanded further with a dedicated conversation view for individual emails.  The following images illustrate threading in Thunderbird. </p><p>Threading in the list view. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-04-07-17-10-20-9d28ff.png""> </p><p>Threading in the cards view <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-04-07-17-12-20-71168e.png""> </p><p>There is also a sort menu for the folder on the same bar as the quick filter which enabled and disabled the sorting of messages by thread for the folder which can also be accessed from the main menu bar. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-04-07-17-14-58-39dbec.png""> </p><p>That is threading in a nutshell.  It can be accessed from a number of locations in the user interface, including the main menu bar.  But the concepts are the same, regardless of the method of access. The choices you make affect the currently selected folder.  In the <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#"" rel=""nofollow"">support topic</a> which has been repeatedly linked, are further steps you can take to eliminate threading as a default,  something that was introduced as a new default about 18 months ago with version 102 </p> <blockquote> All this does is hide e-mails that are even threaded or unthreaded</blockquote> <p>I think you are perhaps the only one of millions of users with that experience.  However I think the experience is more perception rather than fact.  Once a folder is no longer threaded,  individual emails are sorted in the list in the sort order specified , rather than having them appear in the thread group. SO while whatever email you have selected will be retained when the threading is turned off,  other emails will be sorted into the list in their own position and may simply disappear from view based on their new list location.  But nothing is supposed to be hidden at all. </p><p>If you want to see the conversation the email belongs in, which from what I am putting together is more what your expectation of a thread is, right click the message and choose to open the email in conversation.  This is basically the same as Threaded view,  but an on the fly search is undertaken for any messages stored anywhere in your profile that belong in the more holistic view of the topic as a conversation.  The following is a extract from a conversation tab. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-04-07-17-27-54-25c68f.png""> </p><p>Note the addition of a location column on the right which shows the folder the message was located in. </p><p>There is another loose and incorrect interpretation of a thread in relatively common usage,  as the quoted replies within a single email.  This is not a thread and never has been.  But like many old wives tales it refuses to go away.  Unfortunately education is no way to eradicate these incorrect terms as those who use them cling to them like they are alternative facts and those correcting them are the ones in the wrong. </p><p>There is an addon that emulated the Gmail approach to conversations, called conversations,  you might want to have a look at it as your expectation of a thread appears to be more in line with the google way of looking at things as a conversation rather than as a thread. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/?src=ss</a> </p><p>Personally I have modified my settings to place copies of replies in the same folder as the message which they are replying to as that includes my reply in the basic threaded view. (Account settings &gt; copies and folders) But that is me making allowances for the way the software works.  It does have a limitation that original messages are not threaded when I get a reply to them,  but the conversion view takes care of those few where the entry in my inbox is obviously a reply to something I sent. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
