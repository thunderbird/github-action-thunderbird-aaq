Calendar events may have important information in the event details, like program agenda or travel directions.  Being able to print an event is really rudimentary...a person wouldn't really even think that it cannot be done.  So, the work around is to use the Windows program Snip and Sketch to take a picture of the entire event and then print that.  Just unbelievable at this stage of Thunderbird's development.  Not being able to do print an event is kind of like a word processing program excluding the letter 'x' because it isn't used much.
