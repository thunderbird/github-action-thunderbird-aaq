Before I do a replace, I’d like to give a description of the folder Thunderbird that I created just prior to the move to W11. There is something that puzzles me and causes me to hesitate. I will begin with a somewhat detailed description of the Thunderbird folder (that you can probably skip over) and then a cause and question about my hesitation. The Thunderbird folder was one of the subfolders of C:\Users\rsuth\AppData\Roaming\. It is 8.94 Gb, containing 72 subfolders and 11067 files. Two of the files are installs.ini and profiles.ini. Four of the subfolders are Crash Reports (1010 bytes, 101 files, subfolder events), Pending Pings (empty), Profiles (5.16 Gb, 467 files, 33 subfolders; one of the subfolders is odp….default, containing the files times and json, the other subfolder is gqf….default-release, containing many files and subfolders), and another subfolder named Thunderbird. This second named Thunderbird (3.77 Gb, 34 subfolders, 497 files) has three subfolders: Crash Reports, Pending Pings, and Profiles as well as the files installs.ini and profiles.ini. My hesitation is based upon a folder named Thunderbird containing a subfolder with the same name. So my questions is this: does one Thunderbird folder containing a subfolder with the same name effect the instructions you gave to shut down Thunderbird, then replace the current Thunderbird folder with the first one I described above, or does something else/different need to be done before any replacing? </p>",I_Rufus,false,0,0

It means that someone has made a faulty copy &amp; paste action with another (?) Thunderbird folder in the file explorer. Does the sub-folder Thunderbird contain a Mail and an ImapMail folder? Anyhow you can proceed to the replacement as I indicated in my first reply. If it succeeds we'll explore the sub-folder Thunderbird a bit later. </p>,Mapenzi,false,0,0

No matches found for ImapMail. The search for the word mail found two folders named Mail. The date modified on each was only 1 minute different than the other. (Actually, the search found two more folders with mail in their titles: <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a>. Their dates modified were only 1 minute apart.) I looked at the properties of the two Mail folders. The properties were not the same. 3.70 Gb for 1, 5 Gb for the other; 59 files and 63 files; 6 folders both. </p><p>So then I tried your suggestion: “Thunderbird shut down - replace the actual ""Thunderbird"" folder in ...\AppData\Roaming\... with the saved copy and restart TB.” I did that and then loaded Thunderbird -  and it appeared with most – if not all – of the settings that had been there before the W11 upgrade! After a moment’s pause, Thunderbird, as usual,  asked me to enter my password so that I could download my email from Comcast.  I did so. Thunderbird’s response was that the password was incorrect, try again. So I did – and got the same result. I then shut down Thunderbird , my other open programs and the computer itself. After a few minutes, I rebooted and loaded Thunderbird. It works!! It looks like what I remember from before the W11 problem. The settings, folders, etc. are what I remember – or very close.  </p><p>So I begin by saying thank you for the help that you’ve given. I feel comfortable again, but with a tiny bit of hesitation. I want to wait until tomorrow morning, after a complete night’s shutdown, before I try Thunderbird again. Right now I feel that all will be fine, but I will wait until then before I click the “Solved the problem” button. </p>",I_Rufus,false,0,0

There seems to be a new problem that I assume is somehow related to the original and, possibly, to the fix that just occurred. The new problem relates to speed.  When I first start Tbird, it takes a fairly long time for the window to pop up and ask me to enter my password. After I enter it, it still takes a fairly long time to download whatever new mail might be out there. While all this is happening, the little blue line in the lower right corner is active.  </p><p>Another mystery: I access my comcast email account using Firefox and I see a couple of new emails in the list.

I tried again several  minutes later and the message appeared on Tbird at 5:38. I’m confused. What I plan to do tonight and/or tomorrow morning, is to try to copy what I have done today: look at the list of emails on Comcast, using a web browser, then trying to download the email using Tbird.

There was an immediate quest for my PW, which I entered. The thin blue line continued for about a minute, then an error message appeared, about a failure to connect. Nevertheless, I clicked Get messages. About three minutes later, the new email was delivered. Tbird seemed to work fine from then on. I have used Tbird for a long time, perhaps 15 or 20 years. I have never had a problem/error relating to the number/size of emails in my various folders, inbox being one of a dozen. Until I read your message, I was not aware of “compact”. I did some reading at the linked site and, honestly, I will need to reread it once or twice more for it to sink in. One aspect that caught my attention was the option to select to automatically compact in the future. I think that, perhaps, that option was the default whenever it was that I initially installed Tbird.  In any case, I thought I would look at my compact settings. I started with the section of the page headed “How can I configure compact?” The very next line begins with the symbol for the Tbird menu (3 horiz lines). The menu on my Tbird page does not have a Preferences option. I explored a little and found the section at Settings &gt; Network &amp; Disk Space. I looked at my hard drive and saw that I have more than 700Gb of free space, so I do not feel the need to compact. But it was interesting to read. The next time I restart my computer, I will look to see if what I described at the top of this message happens again. Either way, I will post it here. </p>",I_Rufus,false,0,0
