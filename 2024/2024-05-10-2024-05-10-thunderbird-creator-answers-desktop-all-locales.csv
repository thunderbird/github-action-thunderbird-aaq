In the last week, when I open TB (on a mac OS10.15.7) I am asked to enter the password for these two accounts. I have not changed the passwords for these two accounts anywhere else so I don't know why TB suddenly wants me to enter them. No matter what password I enter here, I am told the login failed and am asked to enter a new password. I enter a new password  and go back to being asked for passwords again. </p><p>What password is TB looking for? Where is it stored so that I can look for it? When I go to Settings/Privacy and security/Saved passwords only passwords for the two gmail accounts are shown. Where can I find the passwords for the POP Mail Server and how do I reset them? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",hunterbr

I select items in the inbox/index of the UI and it isn't updating the email view pane. </p><p>Sometimes I select in the index, it highlights the message, doesn't update and then 10-15 seconds later, the UI does a big update like it had hung on something, and it just ignores my selection completely and selects whatever it wants.  This is crazy.   </p><p>I'll add I have a ""unified folder"" and despite the 3 accounts inboxes included from accounts configured to never auto update, IT ALWAYS does updates whenever it wishes.  Again, this is crazy.  Like it can't be supposed to work like this&nbsp;?  </p><p>So:  Is this thing single threaded&nbsp;?

No updates I've made in last few months have improved anything. </p><p>Really don't want to leave but I'm about to try using it on Mac and Linux to compare and at same time I just configured all this in apple mail for the first time in maybe 10 years.  This is something I never ever thought I'd do. </p><p>Last thought, I use same accounts, on iPhone (Boxer) and many iPads.
