So now i am trying to move one of my <a href=""http://bigpond.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bigpond.com</a> email accounts to TB, the account moved over ok, but its not bringing over any of my inbox, sent, draft, or other folders with it at all. </p><p>the bigpond account in TB works for new messages in and out, but none of my emails previous and older emails from outlook came with it. i have removed the account twice and still same issue. there was a warning or something that popped up during the first time i tried this with bringing the bigpond over to TB, cant remember what it said, but something along the lines of bigpond isnt trusted or veryifed certificate. i cant really recall.  but maybe that is why. i copied the same settings from outlook 2007 to TB, i even tried setting them to pop for one try and them imap the next try, i still dont know. </p><p>is there a way to find the log warning message any where on TB as to what happen during the first try of adding the bipond account, maybe that will help you guys narrow down the issue. As that warning does not come up any more when i remove and try to add the account again, it just happened the first time.  i though if hotmail can work easily ( being so old ) then bigpond should definitely have no issues.  maybe its a pop or Imap issue, i dont know&nbsp;??? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",dj.moonwalker
