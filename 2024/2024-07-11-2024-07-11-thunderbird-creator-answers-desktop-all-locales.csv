So now i am trying to move one of my <a href=""http://bigpond.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bigpond.com</a> email accounts to TB, the account moved over ok, but its not bringing over any of my inbox, sent, draft, or other folders with it at all. </p><p>the bigpond account in TB works for new messages in and out, but none of my emails previous and older emails from outlook came with it. i have removed the account twice and still same issue. there was a warning or something that popped up during the first time i tried this with bringing the bigpond over to TB, cant remember what it said, but something along the lines of bigpond isnt trusted or veryifed certificate. i cant really recall.  but maybe that is why. i copied the same settings from outlook 2007 to TB, i even tried setting them to pop for one try and them imap the next try, i still dont know. </p><p>is there a way to find the log warning message any where on TB as to what happen during the first try of adding the bipond account, maybe that will help you guys narrow down the issue. As that warning does not come up any more when i remove and try to add the account again, it just happened the first time.  i though if hotmail can work easily ( being so old ) then bigpond should definitely have no issues.  maybe its a pop or Imap issue, i dont know&nbsp;??? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",dj.moonwalker

I have been using Firefox and Thunderbird for many years with no problem until last week.  I logged onto Google so I could leave a Google review for a friend's restaurant and when I was finished, when I went to go to my Thunderbird account to send an email, suddenly a new box opens and will not allow me to access my Thunderbird account without first singing into Google?!?  I do not want to ever have to sign onto Google and this is all new.  I want to get Google off my Thunderbird.  I can access my email only from Google.  No thank you.  I hope someone has some idea on what I should do.  Thank you, Philip </p><p>I also redownloaded Thunderbird to no avail. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",PhilipFournier

The <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/sensitivity-header/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">Sensitivity Header</a> is not compatible with the current version of Thunderbird and Thunderbird itself does not seem to have this simple function.  </p><p>Is there any Thunderbird developer here? I suppose this is not a compliacated implementation (you already have options for receipt and delivery status headers, I suppose adding the sensitivity tag wouldn't be anything hard). Would you please consider this for your next release?  </p><p>Thanks a lot! </p>",protect-your-privacy;,thunderbird,protect-your-privacy,en-US,"",kralpatr

I need a way to automatically track sent emails that have not yet received a reply. My goal is to have a folder that dynamically contains all my sent messages that haven't received any response. Once a reply is received, the message should automatically disappear from this folder. </p><p>Here is a more detailed description of what I am trying to achieve: </p><p>Sent emails are automatically copied to a specific folder. This folder should only contain sent messages that have not yet been replied to. Once a reply to a sent message is received, the original sent message should automatically be removed from the folder. I have tried using the saved searches feature, but it does not fully meet my needs as it does not dynamically update based on replies received. </p><p>Is there a way to accomplish this with the current version of Thunderbird, or is there a plugin or extension that you can recommend to achieve this functionality? If this feature is not currently available, I would like to request its consideration for future updates. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your guidance on how to set up this functionality or any recommendations you may have. </p><p>Best regards, Chris </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",k.wojtkowiak
