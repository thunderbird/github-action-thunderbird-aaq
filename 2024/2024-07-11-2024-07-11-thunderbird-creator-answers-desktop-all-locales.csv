As that warning does not come up any more when i remove and try to add the account again, it just happened the first time.  i though if hotmail can work easily ( being so old ) then bigpond should definitely have no issues.  maybe its a pop or Imap issue, i dont know&nbsp;??? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1661594;1661642;1661647;,dj.moonwalker

This folder should only contain sent messages that have not yet been replied to. Once a reply to a sent message is received, the original sent message should automatically be removed from the folder. I have tried using the saved searches feature, but it does not fully meet my needs as it does not dynamically update based on replies received. </p><p>Is there a way to accomplish this with the current version of Thunderbird, or is there a plugin or extension that you can recommend to achieve this functionality? If this feature is not currently available, I would like to request its consideration for future updates. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance.

I understood this MBOX file only can be opened and see the contents through Thunderbird. We have a few questions to use this program properly. See the questions below and answer, please. 1. This file has been imported and visible with the same file name and the quantity of the 30,044 emails sign. However, the contents are not shown up after we click the file through Thunderbird. The contents were actually popped up a few days ago and currently are not visible at all. Please explain this happening and let us know how to manage these contents to check. 2. Even though we make these MBOX files imported in the Thunderbird program, we couldn't make sure that it is possibly open to see since it has disappeared in the program as said in a 1st question. We currently have this MBOX mail in the computer and would like to keep it in an external hard drive to open this file to see in the future. We wonder if it is possible to import anytime and on any device if they download the Thunderbird program and have the same MBOX file.   3. We are not familiar with the MBOX format, and Google didn't let us export the whole quantity of the 64GB emails (there are missing emails in specific beginning periods which are not able to be seen as the same as the emails at the Gmail account). We would like to know if we could trust this MBOX and Thunderbird program with no more missing emails.  </p><p>We might need to make a call to discuss more about the program and the file after checking your response. </p><p>Thank you.
