This was not a problem, as I looked at the subject and sender and decided for myself. I now get no messages prefixed ***SPAM***,  I can however, get these with webmail. I did not change any settings, this just happened. I have tried playing with the security spam settings but this does not fix the problem. My computer runs Linux Fedora, always the latest version. Any help/suggestions greatly appreciated. Cheers Steve </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",steve611

In the past we used gmail and we saw how every email Moodle sent was in the ""Sent"" folder. Now we switched to a custom email account from our hosting and since we did that we cannot see the emails Moodle sent. I decided to try Thunderbird to see if I could see it there but I still can't. I checked the option ""Copy in Other"" so it saves the email in the Sent folder. It works when I send an email directly from Thunderbird but not if I send an email from webmail or Moodle. </p><p>Any idea of why this is happening? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,es,"",daniel.garcia
