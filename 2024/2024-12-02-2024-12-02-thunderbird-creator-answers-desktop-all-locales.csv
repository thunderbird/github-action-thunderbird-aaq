A message referred me to Apple and I made an appointment in Glasgow to take my Mac for the repair. I plugged my Mac in before I left - and it recovered itself! </p><p>However all my Thunderbird emails, files and settings have totally disappeared! Apparently a Thunderbird update is responsible. I have spent hours on the phone trying to get help. I have spent hours with CHATDGP talking me through stuff. The data seems to be on my machine but whatever I do I can't get Thunderbird to work. I am at my wits end. I have all my work files in Thunderbird and have no access to anything.  </p><p>This is the second time recently that my Thunderbird files have vanished. I had to pay an expert to come to my house and restore the first time, but he is very ill at the moment and unable to leave home. </p><p>Please help me. I would be very grateful to have my Thunderbird back and working correctly. I am on macOS Monterey, version 12.7.6 (21h1320).  </p><p>kind regards Helen 07836 707504 UK </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Hely

Email cannot be sent out.,"<p>Email errors started occurring on or about November 25, 2024. Multiple calls and tech support with Spectrum techs and hours of troubleshooting brought about O results.  I obtained all necessary protocols for configuring email to Spectrum requirements and for sending and receiving, but I still get outgoing errors.  I have been using Thunderbird for 5 years or more now and never had any issues until now.  Upon inspection through Thunderbird tools/setting/ looking at ""SAVED"" passwords,  I no longer see ""IMAP"" or ""MAIL"" access protocols.  It was there previously.  I also disabled all my firewall and vpn settings and still cannot send out any emails.  I have thoroughly checked out both my personal email setting and my small business email settings and everything as it relates to Spectrum is correct.  Spectrum said one thing they found was that the email settings (specifically, would not resolve with the server because of a syncing problem).  Spectrum did all they could to resolve on their end, but the issues, as they see it now resides on the Thunderbird side.  In an effort to resolve the issues, the Spectrum tech looked and looked for a phone number for Thunderbird and said this is the first time he has never found a number that one can call for some sort of assistance. Emails directly to Thunderbird are very, very slow.  And to compound the issue, there are no lists I could find is a repository for error codes and no valuable tech support or specifications could be found that provides any real help for resolution.  So now I am making a last ditch effort to contact Thunderbird for a one on one phone conversation that will resolve all the issues I have encountered.  Hopefully with your immediate reply, we can resolve these issues and I will be able to help others resolve these same issues.  These issues are not just isolated to me.  There are literally hundreds maybe even thousands of people out there with the same issues.  PLEASE contact me asap.  Thank you for your time. (PS.  I do receive some messages via email, but sending out is the issue) </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",la_muse
