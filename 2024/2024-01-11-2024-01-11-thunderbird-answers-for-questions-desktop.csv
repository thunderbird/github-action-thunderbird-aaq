Now, it may be that the problem is the accounts already exist, but obviously I do not want to lose all my past emails by closing the old accounts and opening a new one. What is needed is to add a new server in a standalone entry (I cannot find anywhere to do that). That way I could add the"" three"" servers,with different descriptors, logon user (ie domain) add &amp; password, but the same server address and point the other email addresses (keeping domains matched) to the appropriate one.
