For example, of the other person reads the message first, the server marks it read. Then, if you open that account later, the message appears read. BUT, if you both access the server prior to either of you reading it, Thunderbird brings in the unread copy. Now, it shows as unread for both of you. When one of you reads it, the status of unread remains for the other. So, you need a plan. One possibility would be to use a tag you both agree to and set that when a message has been read. Test it first, as some servers don't monitor tags. Another possibility is to set up a folder for read messages and drag it there after reading it. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
