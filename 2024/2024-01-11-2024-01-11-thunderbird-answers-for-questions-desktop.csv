The second part of the suggestion worked out perfectly for me.  Thanks. Gil. </p> <h6 id=""w_"">========</h6> <p>Bing It seems like you are experiencing an issue with the Provider for Google Calendar extension in Thunderbird. According to a Mozilla Support Forum post, this issue can occur when you have multiple calendars set up in Thunderbird and the Provider for Google Calendar extension is not properly configured. Here are some steps you can try to fix this issue: </p><pre>   1. Open Thunderbird and click on the Calendar tab.    2. Right-click on the calendar that is duplicating events and select Properties.    3. Click on the CalDAV tab and make sure that the URL field is set to the correct URL for your Google Calendar.    4. Click on the Advanced tab and make sure that the Refresh on Display option is checked.    5. Click OK to save your changes. </pre> <p>If the issuce persists, you can try disabling and re-enabling the Provider for Google Calendar extension in Thunderbird. To do this, follow these steps: </p><pre>   6. Open Thunderbird and click on the Tools menu.    7. Select Add-ons from the drop-down menu.    8. Find the Provider for Google Calendar extension and click on the Disable button.    9. Restart Thunderbird.    10. Repeat steps 1-2 and click on the Enable button next to the Provider for Google Calendar extension.    11. Restart Thunderbird. </pre> <p>If none of these steps work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the Provider for Google Calendar extension in Thunderbird. I hope this helps!

Google are phasing out anything but oauth authentication,  so even if you get it to work in the sort term,  at some point your account will be included in the changes and it will suddenly stop working and you will not know why.

Doesn't seem to matter which security/authentication settings I choose (also there's no box to input a password in the SMTP settings). </blockquote> <p>Oddly you will note there is no box to input your password for your incoming account either.  That is because passwords are stored separately to account setting in an encrypted file.  When there is no password and one is required,  or Thunderbird can not connect using the password it has,  it will ask you for a password and save it if you click the appropriate box in the request. </p><p>Just as a complete aside,  Thunderbird knows what are the correct setting for a Gmail mail account.  It get them from here <a href=""https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/gmail.com</a>  If they do not work out of the box,  the issue is almost assuredly not Thunderbird.  Things like antivirus programs that think they are helpful and others like VPN's account for more setup failures than just about anything else.  The choice of POP account type when that has not been enabled in the google account settings (it is disabled by default by Google) is another common stumbling block for gmail.  Then there are those optimizers like ccleaner that disable cookies and delete Thunderbird settings ""to protect your privacy"" oauth does require cookies. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

For example, of the other person reads the message first, the server marks it read. Then, if you open that account later, the message appears read. BUT, if you both access the server prior to either of you reading it, Thunderbird brings in the unread copy. Now, it shows as unread for both of you. When one of you reads it, the status of unread remains for the other. So, you need a plan. One possibility would be to use a tag you both agree to and set that when a message has been read. Test it first, as some servers don't monitor tags. Another possibility is to set up a folder for read messages and drag it there after reading it. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
