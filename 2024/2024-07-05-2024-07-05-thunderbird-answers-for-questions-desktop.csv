It in no way is involved in the creation or display of the archive folder. </p><p>The msf file is entirely transitory and while the metaphors are largely mixed it represents an index of mail in the Thunderbird folder it is named for and contains sufficient information to load data into the user interface.  It is not the mail.  You can delete them and they will be automatically regenerated, although some things like the sort order are lost with that process..  Thunderbird will recreate the folder lists and mail lists without them. </p><p>You mail and the critical part of the import is the MBOX files and these files have no file extension at all.  You mention them,  but have you looked in them with a text editor? (I recommend notepad++ simply because it come with the huge files MBOX represents usually much better than the Windows notepad) </p><p>The layout of an MBOX file is largely a stacked one after the other representation of the text that forms the email as it travels the internet.  Open the file and examine the X-Mozilla-Status: for a few of the emails.  What is set in there?  Normal read emails have a X-Mozilla-Status: 0011 </p><p>The fact you are generating Zero length index files indicates there is nothing in the MBOX file to index,  so I would be guessing the status is actually set to deleted.  But have a look! </p><p>The other newly appearing issue is folks leave the quick search toolbar open (Ctrl+ Shift+K) with the unread or search criteria in the search and they see no mail as this information has not been cleared and the folder content does not match the criteria. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However here goes my attempt to explain the 000b status </p><p>X-Mozilla-Status: 000b  is binary 1011 Deleted 0x00000008 = Bin 1000 So that accounts for the first 1 Read 0x00000001 = Bin 0001 So that accounts for the last 1 Send Successfully 0x00000002 = Bin 0010 And that is our second last binary digit </p><p>So the message flagged as 000b was read, sent and deleted.  The assumption about last digits and display is I think just that, an assumption that really has no basis in fact. Setting the status to 1 will make them appear as read as the source shows. </p><p>I have no idea why this could suddenly occur specifically,  but if the folders are stored on an IMAP server in an IMAP account (and as such are not really local archives) simply loosing connectivity to the server can see everything in the local store set to deleted pending a new refresh from the canonical store (The IMAP mail server) as to what the folder contains just as would occur with an IMAP inbox or other folder. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I spent hours searching for the settings I needed to use for the email setup and having the worst time going in circles through the microsoft atricles where most of them are either out of date or they call things by old names or they are showing instructions for depreciated things and there is no way to know what to look for unless you already know how to do it.

Like you I will go with 5,  but you do have to have IMAP and SMTP enabled on the exchange server, so 1 and 3 are also required from an admin perspective as they are disabled by default in exchange and have been for many years.  (Thanks Microsoft for disabling the standards based protocols in your application by default only enabling the proprietary protocols used by outlook and exchange activsync.) </p><p>You are correct through that Thunderbird only offers oauth for known/approved domains.  The protocol requires that an application secret be sent when authentication is initiated,  sending the one for say yahoo does not meet the requirements.  It must be the one Microsoft issued to Thunderbird for their server. So there is currently no way short of manual code changes to add a ""new"" oauth domain. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

If you don't have on site servers, you can't create connectors. </p> <ol><li>2, basically saying go into Microsoft Entra ID and make sure you don't have any security defaults that would block IMAP or SMTP.  No this isn't necessarily off by default actually, at least it wasn't in mine. </li></ol> <ol><li>3 Ensure that modern authentication is enabled for both IMAP and SMTP.   Problem here is language.  There are no settings that SAY modern authentication.  Basically they are saying in the Exchange Admin &gt; settings &gt; Mail flow settings.  Under Security don't check the boxes for <strong>Turn Off SMTP AUTH Protocol for your Organization </strong>  and <strong>Turn on Legacy TLS Clients</strong> </li></ol> <ol><li>4    Create App Passwords for Users with 2FA Enabled </li></ol> <p>I did this, When I set app passwords and tried to use the Normal Password log in, it didn't work. There are two different places for this.  One is when you are setting things to allow for self service password resetting and first signing into the account where you need a phone number or something set up on the account to be able to recover or change the password, that needs to be enabled which I already had enabled.  The other is that you can actually Enforce having to use 2FA for all sign ins (don't do that.) Now all the stuff I read about having to make everyone have 2FA required was a trip down the rabbit hole.  No, what is needed is that everyone who is going to do this needs to have a 2nd factor for authentication available and in the system.  Basically, they need to have a way in the system for self service password reset because they will need it to give permission for Thunderbird to get access to their email.  But you don't have to require that they have to use 2FA EVERY TIME THEY LOG IN!!!  That is actually totally unacceptable for students in an education environment since many students don't have full time access to a cell phone (especially when they are in school.) I was able to create a brand new account to test this.  As long as the account has already logged into microsoft once and entered the phone number or something to be able to do password recovery, that account can set up thunderbird for their email.  The ONLY thing I needed to do differently for any of my member accounts was to change the hostname for the incoming and outgoing servers and it worked just fine.  Perhaps somewhere in the Thunderbird documentation or help we could make note that Microsoft tenets with their own custom domain names need to use these settings to get things to work with thunderbird.  Change the Host Names first, then you can set OAuth.  I had to change the Port for the SMTP also. </p><pre>    For the incoming server, use the following settings:            Server Type: IMAP Mail Server            Host Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>            Port: 993            Connection Security: SSL/TLS            Authentication Method: OAuth2 </pre> <pre>      For the outgoing server, use the following settings:            Host Name: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>            Port: 587            Connection Security: STARTTLS            Authentication Method: OAuth2 </pre>",tclynx,false,0,0
