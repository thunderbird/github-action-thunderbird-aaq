I downloaded and installed Thunderbird on the new machine, which has Windows 11.  I entered my name, email bcde@nc.rr.com and password.  It had IMAP configuration on the screen and when I clicked 'Done', it gave me the error ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password.""  When I tried changing it to POP and clicked ""Done"", I got the same error.   </p><p>There is a 'configure manually' link, but I do not know how to do that.  Please let me know what I should do. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Bruce Elsheimer bcde@nc.rr.com </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1644940;,bcde
