I downloaded and installed Thunderbird on the new machine, which has Windows 11.  I entered my name, email *@nc.rr.com and password.  It had IMAP configuration on the screen and when I clicked 'Done', it gave me the error ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password.""  When I tried changing it to POP and clicked ""Done"", I got the same error.   </p><p>There is a 'configure manually' link, but I do not know how to do that.

I already got an email account in Thunderbird but that will stop within a few months.  I did find the needed information on my iPhone: My name for the use off capital and lowercase letters; my iCloud email address; my password which is my Apple ID, I presume. The result is: 'It is not possible to log in to the server. Probably an incorrect configuration, username or password'.   The username and password are correct (got it from my iPhone, and the mailserver iCloud does work perfect on my iCloud mailprogram (iPhone, iPad, PC). So maybe the configuration, see appendix, isn't ok but I did get that from Thunderbird. Do I overlook something?

How to restore?,"<p>I was exploring this new 115 of Thunderbird and ended up wiping the message viewer off the screen. </p><p>To start with, I have my TBird 115 as it came ""out of the box.""  Three columns, Inbox folder tree on the left, Cards List in the center, and message pane in the right side.  </p><p>I messed everything up when I widened the Cards list to the right edge of the window, where the &lt;---&gt; arrowhead disappeared and all there is to the right side is the window resize arrow from my Linux system and that awful slim Jim scroll bar. </p><p>I recovered my message pane using F8 key; it is below my short list of email in the Cards View.  See the attached screenshot. </p><p>I would like to return things back to as they were with the three columns as described above.  I forgot, too, where I turned on Classic View.  There is a checked box in Settings somewhere.  Or is it a menu?  I need some help, please. </p><p>May I suggest a limit somewhere short of the right-side edge of the window and short of the scroll bar to only widen the message pane ""so far,"" such that one can recover from pushing it that far, using the same means to return it with the double arrow. </p><p>OS:  Linux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon   Thunderbird 115  MintBox Mini 2 Pro computer </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1644960;1645065;,FirefoxinUbuntu

(Although applying filters to all messages in the folder appear to move the messages, but I do not see an update to an affected folder to which a message was moved.) In order to move and see the messages in the affected target folder(s) I currently have to find that each folder, right click, select ""Properties"", then click ""Repair Folder"". There does not seem to be rhyme or reason to which folders, and I do not know which are affected until a message comes in that should be moved to that folder. Due to the number of folders I have, the logical thing would be to trigger ""Repair Folder"" on all folders. </p><p>(Yes, I have searched, and I have read ""How do I repair ALL forlders?""

Bounce from zero inbox to full inbox…,"<p>Good afternoon,  </p><p>I usually read my emails in Thunderbird on my MacBook Pro or via the standard mail app on my iPhone. In addition, I have been experiencing the problem day in and day out for years now that once I have checked my email, read it and distributed it in an organized manner across my email accounts and folders, towards an empty inbox again… unfortunately I can start all over again a little later because the emails then jump back to the inbox... usually this occurs a few times. You can imagine that this takes me a lot of unnecessary energy. Do you have any possible advice or solution? That would be such a relief!

This has been going on consistently every month for about 5 months now,   I can still send messages.  I can only get my messages if I go to the AOL server.  AOL claims it is not their problem because the messages can be seen on the server and it is the third party mail apps where the problem is.  Thing is, it happens to all of my devices with different apps at the same time.  Thunderbird on windows, Gmail on Andriod,  and the mail app on iOS.   This does not happen to all of our accounts, just the same one or two every month. They want me to purchase a service plan.

For several decades I collected and collated all my mail from the several different POP servers I've used, but did not know that Thunderbird could treat the IMAP-based Google mail server as if POP. </p><p>So, for the past several months, I have been very, very happy to have my GMail recent email traffic integrated with the others. </p><p>What I have not discovered how to accomplish is the retrieval of a trove of some rather important emails exchanged and retained on the GMail server from about 2012 through 2021.  I know that I could forward those emails to one of my other POP accounts and they would be sent to my Thunderbird front end as newly-arrived emails and I will do that if there is no way to achieve what I would actually like to achieve which would be the ability to coerce the server and client into treating the old emails as fresh, so that I could receive and catalog them without the distorted history that would appertain by forwarding them -- showing up as forwarded from rather than sent from the original parties and carrying a modern date rather than the historically-correct one. </p><p>Coercing the server side into restoring the old emails to an UnRead state does not have the desired effect.  Any suggestion from anyone who has faced a similar conundrum and solved it would be much appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1645023;1645026;1645027;1645029;,Terry.Corbet
