I downloaded and installed Thunderbird on the new machine, which has Windows 11.  I entered my name, email bcde@nc.rr.com and password.  It had IMAP configuration on the screen and when I clicked 'Done', it gave me the error ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password.""  When I tried changing it to POP and clicked ""Done"", I got the same error.   </p><p>There is a 'configure manually' link, but I do not know how to do that.  Please let me know what I should do. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Bruce Elsheimer bcde@nc.rr.com </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1644940;,bcde

I already got an email account in Thunderbird but that will stop within a few months.  I did find the needed information on my iPhone: My name for the use off capital and lowercase letters; my iCloud email address; my password which is my Apple ID, I presume. The result is: 'It is not possible to log in to the server. Probably an incorrect configuration, username or password'.   The username and password are correct (got it from my iPhone, and the mailserver iCloud does work perfect on my iCloud mailprogram (iPhone, iPad, PC). So maybe the configuration, see appendix, isn't ok but I did get that from Thunderbird. Do I overlook something? Thanks for helping. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",brtdkstr

How to restore?,"<p>I was exploring this new 115 of Thunderbird and ended up wiping the message viewer off the screen. </p><p>To start with, I have my TBird 115 as it came ""out of the box.""  Three columns, Inbox folder tree on the left, Cards List in the center, and message pane in the right side.  </p><p>I messed everything up when I widened the Cards list to the right edge of the window, where the &lt;---&gt; arrowhead disappeared and all there is to the right side is the window resize arrow from my Linux system and that awful slim Jim scroll bar. </p><p>I recovered my message pane using F8 key; it is below my short list of email in the Cards View.  See the attached screenshot. </p><p>I would like to return things back to as they were with the three columns as described above.  I forgot, too, where I turned on Classic View.  There is a checked box in Settings somewhere.  Or is it a menu?  I need some help, please. </p><p>May I suggest a limit somewhere short of the right-side edge of the window and short of the scroll bar to only widen the message pane ""so far,"" such that one can recover from pushing it that far, using the same means to return it with the double arrow. </p><p>OS:  Linux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon   Thunderbird 115  MintBox Mini 2 Pro computer </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1644960;,FirefoxinUbuntu

(Although applying filters to all messages in the folder appear to move the messages, but I do not see an update to an affected folder to which a message was moved.) In order to move and see the messages in the affected target folder(s) I currently have to find that each folder, right click, select ""Properties"", then click ""Repair Folder"". There does not seem to be rhyme or reason to which folders, and I do not know which are affected until a message comes in that should be moved to that folder. Due to the number of folders I have, the logical thing would be to trigger ""Repair Folder"" on all folders. </p><p>(Yes, I have searched, and I have read ""How do I repair ALL forlders?""
