About half of the times I start T-bird, I get a message saying that login to server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> with username xxxxxxxx@hotmail.com failed; the other accounts never do this. T-bird offers to retry, but that usually ends with a repeat of the same message. I've learned that if I let it open, with time, the e-mails do appear, though I don't know how or why. I've also been using Libreoffice successfully for months now though I doubt that anything to do with this.

To help keep your account secure, Microsoft will no longer support the use of third-party email and calendar apps which ask you to sign in with only your Microsoft Account username and password. To keep you safe you will need to use a mail or calendar app which supports Microsoft’s modern authentication methods. If you do not act, your third-party email apps will no longer be able to access your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, Hotmail or <a href=""http://Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Live.com</a> email address on September 16th. </p><p>What do you need to do? </p><p>If you are receiving this email, you are currently using an email or calendar app that uses a less secure authentication method to connect to your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> email account. You will need to upgrade your third-party mail and calendar app to a version which supports modern authentication methods. </p><p>Microsoft provides free versions of Outlook for your PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices which can be easily downloaded and connect to your email account. Using an updated version of an Outlook application will ensure you are connecting in the most secure way. </p><p>How can you set up your Gmail, Apple Mail, or other third-party mail application? </p><p>Various non-Microsoft applications will have their own steps for connecting to your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> email account using modern authentication methods. See our help article - Modern Authentication Methods now needed to continue syncing Outlook Email in non-Microsoft email apps. However, you may need to contact the creators of those applications to provide you with instructions.
