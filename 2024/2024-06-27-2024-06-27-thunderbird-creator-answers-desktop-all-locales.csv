It has a labeled ""mail window"" having 5,044 messages in a folder named under the internals of the Profile as ""Family"" and ""Family.msf"".  Under ""Family"" are at the next level called ""Archive-A"" and ""Archive-A.msf"". (This may not be a kosher ""archive"".) I tried to use NanaZip to prepare as a zip by Exporting it the other laptop's Thunderbird in our house, but the process seemed to hang before that could do it.  Maybe there had to be two levels, I dunno.  Maybe getting from a .ZIP to a .SBD.... </p><p>Even if that had resulted in a useful .ZIP, I'm not at all clear how I could I succeed in importing it into the main profile on the other TB computer. I am defeated at this point. </p><p>I wish I had a ""Thunderbird for Dummies"", or at least a manual + a lexicon with acronyms. </p><p>Could someone help me out?   </p><p>Thanks! </p><p><br> ~Steve </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1659290;,oudeheis

Una de las mayores diferencia que encuentro en el correo, es el tratamiento de los datos adjuntos. En Outlook si hacías un click en el adjunto podías ver una previsualización sin tener que abrirlo o guardarlo. En thunderbird, creo que solamente puedes o guardarlo o abrirlo, por lo que abre un nuevo programa.  Yo en muchos casos sólo quiero previsualizarlos para decidir que hago con ellos. No necesito abrirlos. ¿Es posible tener esta opción? Gracias Hello, our company is a new Thunderbird user. We were previously using Microsoft Outlook. One of the biggest differences I find in the email is the way attachments are handled. In Outlook if you clicked on the attachment you could see a preview without having to open or save it. In thunderbird, I think you can only either save it or open it, so it opens a new program.  I in many cases just want to preview them to decide what to do with them. I don't need to open them. Is it possible to have this option? Thanks </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,es,"",j.rodriguez18782

Unfortunately, the Thunderbird I seem to have I am finding very difficult to use. Things like what to view, and how to arrange the various elements to view. Also, I seem to have a long list of messages in the inbox etc which takes a very long to time to load. I'm just wondering whether to uninstall it, and try again. Advice on setting it up would be welcomed.
