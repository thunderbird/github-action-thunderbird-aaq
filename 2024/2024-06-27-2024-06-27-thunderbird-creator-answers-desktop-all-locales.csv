This somehow became over 600G in size. Everything works and compacting seems to be getting done since it's been working some weeks now. Yet this ten-fold increase in size is unwieldy and very difficult to backup. Perhaps related, I notice that M'soft's ""new"" free Outlook app is present and perhaps running on this computer. And all the e-mails I send from my main Hotmail account are listed twice in the T-bird sent folder. About half of the times I start T-bird, I get a message saying that login to server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> with username xxxxxxxx@hotmail.com failed; the other accounts never do this. T-bird offers to retry, but that usually ends with a repeat of the same message. I've learned that if I let it open, with time, the e-mails do appear, though I don't know how or why. I've also been using Libreoffice successfully for months now though I doubt that anything to do with this.
