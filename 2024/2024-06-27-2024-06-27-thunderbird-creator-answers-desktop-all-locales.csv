It has a labeled ""mail window"" having 5,044 messages in a folder named under the internals of the Profile as ""Family"" and ""Family.msf"".  Under ""Family"" are at the next level called ""Archive-A"" and ""Archive-A.msf"". (This may not be a kosher ""archive"".) I tried to use NanaZip to prepare as a zip by Exporting it the other laptop's Thunderbird in our house, but the process seemed to hang before that could do it.  Maybe there had to be two levels, I dunno.  Maybe getting from a .ZIP to a .SBD.... </p><p>Even if that had resulted in a useful .ZIP, I'm not at all clear how I could I succeed in importing it into the main profile on the other TB computer. I am defeated at this point. </p><p>I wish I had a ""Thunderbird for Dummies"", or at least a manual + a lexicon with acronyms. </p><p>Could someone help me out?   </p><p>Thanks! </p><p><br> ~Steve </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1659290;,oudeheis
