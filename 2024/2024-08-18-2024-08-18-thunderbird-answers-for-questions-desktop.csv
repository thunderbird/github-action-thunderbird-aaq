Click 'server settings' for each account that uses <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> and look at the bottom line that points to local directory. Assuming you have three such accounts, you will see one pointing to the <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>, one pointing to <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>-1, and another to the -2. That will help you confirm which account is using each. Since you have the prior messages backed up, you can merge them with the current account,and it is a two-step process. You need the importexporttools addon for this.  - create local folder for old inbox  - highlight and rightclick and select importexport option to import mbox. select and click ok.  - now highlight again, rightclick and select importexport option to export as eml.  - now, highlight the accounts INBOX, rightclick and select importexport option to import eml. select the emls and click ok - repeat this for sent folder and any other saved folders.  - once done, you can delete local folders. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
