Unfortunately, I don't think that it is possible? </p><p>However, I can create a Saved Search Folder that exclude messages that matches the search criteria.

Click 'server settings' for each account that uses <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> and look at the bottom line that points to local directory. Assuming you have three such accounts, you will see one pointing to the <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>, one pointing to <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>-1, and another to the -2. That will help you confirm which account is using each. Since you have the prior messages backed up, you can merge them with the current account,and it is a two-step process. You need the importexporttools addon for this.  - create local folder for old inbox  - highlight and rightclick and select importexport option to import mbox. select and click ok.  - now highlight again, rightclick and select importexport option to export as eml.  - now, highlight the accounts INBOX, rightclick and select importexport option to import eml. select the emls and click ok - repeat this for sent folder and any other saved folders.  - once done, you can delete local folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I simply used the importexporttools to import all of the mboxes in the localhost directory, and that restored all of my inbox, sent, junk and trash from the missing Hotmail account going back to 2007. </p>",ellis.freedman,false,0,0

Allmail is a duplicate of all other messages and this forces thunderbird to do double maintenance and downloads take twice as long and disc space twice as much. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0
