Click 'server settings' for each account that uses <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> and look at the bottom line that points to local directory. Assuming you have three such accounts, you will see one pointing to the <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>, one pointing to <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>-1, and another to the -2. That will help you confirm which account is using each. Since you have the prior messages backed up, you can merge them with the current account,and it is a two-step process. You need the importexporttools addon for this.  - create local folder for old inbox  - highlight and rightclick and select importexport option to import mbox. select and click ok.  - now highlight again, rightclick and select importexport option to export as eml.  - now, highlight the accounts INBOX, rightclick and select importexport option to import eml. select the emls and click ok - repeat this for sent folder and any other saved folders.  - once done, you can delete local folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The message is sent via Thunderbird, but the receiving server checks authenticity of the host server for the original email, which is your email provider. Problems may be with the SPF and/or DKIM setting. I followed the links you provided and they pointed to fixing it from the sender's account.  <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/troubleshoot/email-delivery/ndr/fix-error-code-550-4-4-7-in-exchange-online?"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/troubleshoot/email-delivery/ndr/fix-error-code-550-4-4-7-in-exchange-online?</a>  </p><p>Your email provider should recognize the symptoms here. Many email providers are implementing tighter security and it hits users, such as you, without warning. I worked a few days ago with another person whose email situation was similar to yours, in that his were all being rejected by Gmail. The error you are receiving would happen with any email client, but not when using a webmail client. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Keith) </p><p>It says Quote: ""Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups: (????@sbcglobal.net) Your message wasn't delivered. Despite repeated attempts to deliver your message, the recipient's email system refused to accept a connection from your email system. Contact the recipient by some other means (by phone, for example) and ask them to tell their email admin that it appears that their email system is refusing connections from your email server. Give them the error details shown below. It's likely that the recipient's email admin is the only one who can fix this problem. For Email Admins No connection could be made because the target computer actively refused it. This usually results from trying to connect to a service that is inactive on the remote host - that is, one with no server application running.
