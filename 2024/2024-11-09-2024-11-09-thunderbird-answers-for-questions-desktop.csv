There is also a unified view that shows say inbox and as sub folder the relevant account inboxes. </p><p>Don't wonder,  just install it.  If you don't like it uninstall it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Check the quick filter is not set to your last search.  Or only stared, unread etc.  That appear to have been tripping some. Still an issue?  Is the number displayed inside brackets like (15).  That occurs when there is a sub folder and the count includes the mail in the sub folder. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Whatever;  I suppose I have to workaround by moving stuff I can see from the inbox into other folders.  I have observed that when I delete stuff I no longer want, I get to see older emails, so that should work. Thanks again, Zyg </p>",zyghilwoj,false,0,0

They continue to exist but are largely a spent force outside of the USA.  They do mail and really do not document very much at all about that.

Yahoo offer some form of non standard <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501"" rel=""nofollow"">IMAP </a>which only downloads mail using an apparent IMAP server of the name <a href=""http://export.imap.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">export.imap.mail.yahoo.com</a> this appears on the face of it to be a download only service,  but I honestly do not understand how such a thing could exist and still be called IMAP.   They also offer real IMAP server using the name <a href=""http://imap.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.yahoo.com</a> but somehow limit the mail that it will download to local storage. </p><p>I can understand their reluctance to fully synchronization huge mail stores as it probably is quite costly. Just uploading and downloading the theoretical 1 terabyte of mail in each account must cost them dearly.  Let alone the constant updates and readjustments as folks move their mail from folder to folder.  But they are the ones that offered huge free storage for mail of 1 terabyte.  Google offered 15Gb and don't appear to have an issue where the infrastructure is not in keeping with the marketing promises.  . </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
