Basically use whatever was set up previously. If you feel this is something you want to do. Overwrite everything and use all the old profile etc which includes address book, calendar, preferences etc then let us know and we can provide additional information. </p><p>But if you have decided to do things differently and swap from a Pop to now use an Imap you need to be aware IMAP works very differently from POP. </p><p>In Pop all emails in all folders are stored on your computer. There is no synchronising of any folder. Pop is a completely independent copy on your computer. You can choose to leave a copy of messages on the server or not. </p><p>Imap accounts can only display whatever is on the server. All imap folders synchronise with server folders. If you delete anything from webmail account it will get deleted from imap account and vis versa. You have the ability to choose whether to download full copies or only headers and this can be done on a per folder basis. You can also choose to limit x amount of emails in any folder which are kept as fully downloaded emails. You can download full copies in all folders and then perform a backup so you can keep a copy comletely independent of the server. But, you cannot truely regard any imap folder as an independent copy from the server. </p><p>You can import mbox files from old profile, but they need to be imported into 'Local Folders' mail account. If you then want to get some back onto the server - you highlight small batches of imported sent emails, right click on highlighted emails and select 'Copy-to' and choose the imap account default  'Sent' folder. REpeat gradually. Please be aware this can take time and servers do have limits on what can be uploaded to server via imap and these limits are very different from the usual send limits. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

You are one of a very few reporting such an issue.  If you profile is stored locally do you see this?  My guess is no. </p><p>Thunderbird is built on the expectation the profile folder will be located on the local drive and accessible in extremely short time frames,  not the long lead times we commonly see in Network access where bandwidth is measured in MegaBits per second instead of the local storage where it is measured in Gigabytes per second. </p><p>Now generally on a quit network without much happening Thunderbird will perform reasonably well on  network share of NAS,  but it is something that is version dependent and network saturation dependent. Thunderbird is not tested accessing a network share for it's profile,  so essentially any access change could see a version arrive with serious access issues on the network.  I have seen a number over the years. </p><p>A couple of examples are <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1537784"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1537784</a> and <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1497819"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1497819</a> I am sure there are many more. </p><p>I am pretty sure you are seeing some sort of race condition where Thunderbird asks for the file,  but does not get it so just writes an empty one and gets on with life by asking for a password.  I should point out that for accounts with the oauth authentication method there is no password stored,  only the oauth token. So password manager without passwords are becoming somewhat normal anyway. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have the profile on the NAS for a reason...and haven't tried moving it so I can't confirm your suspicion its the NAS location.  I looked at your links and saw one indicating it was adding ""tmp"" to some files when it can't access them.  I searched the profile folder and didn't have any such files now, but next time the error arises I'll look again. </p><p>I'll add that the problem is (very) intermittent.  I'll have it several times over a few days, and then weeks or months with no issue.  </p><p>Also, if I start Thunderbird when not connected to the network...I just get an error that the profile cannot be found.  When connected...it starts up.  From loose memory, I think the issues arose more often (but not always) right after startup/login.   Assuming the connection was busy with startup nonsense--that might support your busy/slow traffic theory.   </p><p>I'll also add details about the oauth tokens.  Normally I will see them and a lot of passwords listed in the saved password list of Thunderbird.  As I noted above, the passwords will disappear, but the oauth tokens are still listed.  That said...they are 'broken' too.  Just as I need to re-enter passwords, a popup dialog box appears from Microsoft/Outlook that asks for more info (sometimes just the password for the account and sometimes it demands I give it the recovery email for those accounts and get a code sent there.  While you didn't say it directly, I got the impression you were implying that because they are 'tokens' they aren't/shouldn't be affected.  They are.

I do encourage you to set Thunderbird to NOT upgrade for now until you feel comfortable with 115. That setting is at settings&gt;general from the menu icon (three short stacked bars) in upper right. Taking the time to familiarize yourself with 115 will take much less time than your other option, that of reverting to a prior version.  </p><p>Should you prefer reverting to a prior version route, we can still assist but it's  crap shoot we don't recommend. Your first step would be to do a full backup of the profile. Then, to select one of the releases since 52 and 115. Possibly 102 would be a start? Going that route is a step backward and you would need to install the release, copy in the profile, see if it works to your satisfaction.
