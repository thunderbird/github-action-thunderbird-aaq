There is also a unified view that shows say inbox and as sub folder the relevant account inboxes. </p><p>Don't wonder,  just install it.  If you don't like it uninstall it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Check the quick filter is not set to your last search.  Or only stared, unread etc.  That appear to have been tripping some. Still an issue?  Is the number displayed inside brackets like (15).  That occurs when there is a sub folder and the count includes the mail in the sub folder. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Whatever;  I suppose I have to workaround by moving stuff I can see from the inbox into other folders.  I have observed that when I delete stuff I no longer want, I get to see older emails, so that should work. Thanks again, Zyg </p>",zyghilwoj,false,0,0
