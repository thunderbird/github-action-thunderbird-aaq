You can enable and disable threading.  You can filter eg show only unread mail by using the 'Quick Filter' icon for show unread mail.

But it does make it obvious what keystroke activates the quick filter.  Sorry, but there is nothing to be done about that.  The same as global search displays the shortcut to that function. and the menu displays the shortcut for the Find feature. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Please note: - people can define keyboard shortcuts for a variety of programs which overwrite what TB thinks is the shortcut. That by itself means the shortcuts it displays on such a prominent place is not integral and static enough.  - yes I find it odd and disturbing from a UI stand point - and very unconventional - to post shortcuts symbols inside a search box where the brain find it curious that there are characters in the middle of that field - if you know what I mean.   Bad UI design, in my view. - shortcuts can be defined elsewhere, like in documentation. </p>",rezganj,false,0,0
