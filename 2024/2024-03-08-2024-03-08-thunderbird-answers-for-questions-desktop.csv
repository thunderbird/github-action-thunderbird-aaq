It checks whether the IP address is pointing to the same domain, i.e. example@domain.com.

Sometimes, the error message focuses on DKIM and SPF settings within the email host server.

As far as I can tell, the Dangerous Directories article pertains to where you can RELOCATE A MAILBOX using the ACCOUNT MANAGER; it might well be relevant, though at the moment I can't see how. My problem is upstream of that, having to do with where I can simply CREATE A NEW PROFILE by browsing within the PROFILE MANAGER.  I'm having difficulty creating a new profile anywhere else but in the ...cache/thunderbird directory where the default-default and default profiles live, as shown by the the Local fields. I suppose I'm looking for a Dangerous Directories for profiles, analogous to the article on mailbox locations. Or maybe I'm just missing something: entirely possible too. But I suspect a bug, given that failed attempts get handed off to the strange location in the /run directory. </p>",chingas1,false,0,0

I can create mailboxes on my IPhone but not on my IPad. All I get on the IPad is Inbox, Send and Trash and it will not let me create a new one for future email filling.  Even more puzzling is that I have 20- IPhone mailboxes, with saved emails, and they don't/won't transfer to IPad. Both Apple and Xfinity have spent lots of time in trying to solve my issues; they erased the IPad and rebooted several times; reloaded; tapped; banged and tested my IPad (it's only 5 months old) and as far as hardware is concerned, it runs perfectly. I can still watch my saved emails, w/ lectures, etc. and play them on my IPhone but the video image is very small. It would be nice to watch stuff on the IPad. </p>",2tomgrande,false,0,0

Maybe I can make table view a bit more usable by sorting columns etc, if I must, but I'd really like to use Card View for all folders, as well as unthreading all conversations (I like every email to be listed, not threaded conversations), and sorted by data descending.
