As far as I can tell, the Dangerous Directories article pertains to where you can RELOCATE A MAILBOX using the ACCOUNT MANAGER; it might well be relevant, though at the moment I can't see how. My problem is upstream of that, having to do with where I can simply CREATE A NEW PROFILE by browsing within the PROFILE MANAGER.  I'm having difficulty creating a new profile anywhere else but in the ...cache/thunderbird directory where the default-default and default profiles live, as shown by the the Local fields. I suppose I'm looking for a Dangerous Directories for profiles, analogous to the article on mailbox locations. Or maybe I'm just missing something: entirely possible too.

You will notice that there's not much you can do here. If you want a more full featured way of tweaking the permissions of your flatpaks, I recommend installing flatseal - a tool devised to do just that. </p><p>`flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal` </p><p>Then you run flatseal and go to Thunderbird and scroll down to the Filesystem section. Here you can try granting the flatpak the permission to access other directories like home or even all directories on the host. Then restart Thunderbird and hopefully this solves your problem. </p>",linuxflower,false,0,0

Even more puzzling is that I have 20- IPhone mailboxes, with saved emails, and they don't/won't transfer to IPad. Both Apple and Xfinity have spent lots of time in trying to solve my issues; they erased the IPad and rebooted several times; reloaded; tapped; banged and tested my IPad (it's only 5 months old) and as far as hardware is concerned, it runs perfectly. I can still watch my saved emails, w/ lectures, etc. and play them on my IPhone but the video image is very small. It would be nice to watch stuff on the IPad. </p>",2tomgrande,false,0,0
