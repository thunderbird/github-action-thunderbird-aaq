That option appears to have been set for those people replying to you, as Thunderbird has no facility to remove portions of messages.  </p><p>- Regarding spam, this is a teaching process, wherein you can click messages that are flagged as spam and click 'not spam' and return to desired folder. It is generally advised to do this periodically for both good and spam messsages to help Thunderbird 'learn' how to manage your email.

You will notice that there's not much you can do here. If you want a more full featured way of tweaking the permissions of your flatpaks, I recommend installing flatseal - a tool devised to do just that. </p><p>`flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal` </p><p>Then you run flatseal and go to Thunderbird and scroll down to the Filesystem section. Here you can try granting the flatpak the permission to access other directories like home or even all directories on the host. Then restart Thunderbird and hopefully this solves your problem. </p>",linuxflower,false,0,0

Both Apple and Xfinity have spent lots of time in trying to solve my issues; they erased the IPad and rebooted several times; reloaded; tapped; banged and tested my IPad (it's only 5 months old) and as far as hardware is concerned, it runs perfectly.
