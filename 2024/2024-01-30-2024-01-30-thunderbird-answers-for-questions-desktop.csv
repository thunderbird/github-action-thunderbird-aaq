Existen las carpetas de correos en el perfil del Thunderbird?  Estabas usando una cuenta de correo pop3 o imap, lo recomendable es usar imap ya que lps correos estan en el servidor.

You got me looking in the right direction but unfortunately it did not solve the problem. </p><p>I failed to mention in the original post that I'm using TB 115.7.0 (64-bit). </p><p>When I go to settings, I see the two accounts with different email addresses, which short circuited my analysis. </p><p>Your response got me to looking at the ""Edit SMTP server ..."" selection.  And, for account B, I found the user name listed was that for account A.  So I changed the user name and set the description to be unique for account B. </p><p>Returning to account A and checking the server info, I found that both the description and the user name for account B had ""propagated"" to account A.  So I changed account A to a unique description and the correct user name, returned to account B and found the account B info had been changed to that for account A. </p><p>At least for this version of TB, it seems that the critical item is the server name and that TB only allows one instance.

Account Settings, Outgoing Server (SMTP), create 2 gmail smtp servers, then select each account in the left pane of Account Settings and point to the correct server in the smtp drop-down.

Many email hosts want confirmation that this is a legit account. There may be more, but that is my first thought. This should be set for all of the SMTP server setups. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The solution might be port 465 and SSL/TLS. I don't know the defined settings of your email provider, and even those may be wrong, as we see that issue daily.

We have seen many posts where the sender's email address is self-hosted and does not have appropriate DKIM and/or SPF settings on the server -- something only the email provider can do or the account owner with direct access to cpanel. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
