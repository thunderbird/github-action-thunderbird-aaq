I raised an issue about how much time it took me find an answer to a question by searching through Thunderbird help, including this forum. As an example, I used the time it took me to find an answer to the question of setting the default sender.  @christ1 did not answer the question in the example, but answered another question. I didn't need an answer to either question. I was raising the issue of how long it took to find an answer to what turned out to be a  fairly straightforward question: How do you change the default FROM address that comes up when you click on a mailto link on a website?  In my reply to @christ1, I pointed out that I already had the answer to that question. I had given it my original post. So there was no need to attempt to answer it (and it was irrelevant to provide an answer to a different question).  I am not objecting to how long it took @christ1 to reply.  I am complaining about how long it took me to find the answer on my own.  The title of my post begins ""Help not helpful.""   Users of this forum should search the forum before making a post in case the question is already answered. That's what I did. I searched for changing the default sender. After reading many irrelevant queries and answers, I finally found the answer buried in a long thread.  So my question again is: Why did take so long?  How could I have better asked the question? Is there a user manual? If not, why not? As I noted in my original post,  the meaning of ""default sender"" is ambiguous. The first question someone attempting to reply should ask is: What do you mean by default sender: 1) the ""mailto sender"" 2) the SMTP for an account or 3) the default identity for an account?  The question @chist1 answered is none of these,  because the answer addresses changing the sender while sending the message, not changing the default. </p>",rmrubinsl,false,0,0

In fact, I wish more users would browse first, as I see questions on several topics repeatedly posted. Generally, when a person posts a clear question, they receive an answer within a fair period of time, but few questions are of that ilk. A challenge is that there are multiple resources. I just was at the knowledge base: <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a>, and entered 'how to set default email address' and the solution appeared immediately, but that does not mean all questions are immediately answered. Yes, it does sometimes matter how the question is asked. So, to me, there is no answer to your question. This forum is a living entity, as is the knowledge base.
