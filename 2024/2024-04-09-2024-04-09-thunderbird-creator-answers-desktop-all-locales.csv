When I start Thunderbird the system pulls messages from the server without issue. I can then interact with the messages as normal, until the next pull happens (either automatic or manual via Get Messages). After this new messages show up in the lists, but if they had not been opened yet the contents of the message stay blank when selected, with ""Loading message..."" in the left lower status bar. This does not seem to change over time, loading the message never seems to end. At the same time composed messages cannot be sent, they are stuck at the state ""Assembling Message"" which they can't get out of. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",gmkeros
