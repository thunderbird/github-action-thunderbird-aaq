One of the things I loved about Mail is that it's very easy to read. Each column is scalable, and the text is well-prioritized and large enough to clearly see the sender's name and read the subject line. In Thunderbird, there's so much on my screen--all at about the same size and color--that I'm having trouble parsing the information, especially when trying to refer back to messages marked as read.  </p><p>I know I can scale columns to adjust the width, but that doesn't increase the text size. I don't need or want to see 11 messages at once; there's simply too much information in each little box, all displayed at the same priority level, that it creates a wall of text that feels overwhelming, especially when I'm flipping between multiple client projects throughout the day. (Also, a side note: I have text set to 16pt, but it's displaying at 6 or 7, tops.) </p><p>My questions are these: </p><p>1. How do I enlarge the contents of the left and center columns so I can read them more easily on a small screen? I don't need to see 11 messages at once. Three or four is fine. </p><p>2. How do I flip the priority so the sender is bold and the subject is smaller or a lighter grey? I freelance for multiple clients, so it's more important for me to know who a message is from than what it's about (knowing the former usually answers the latter).  </p><p>3. Is there a way to make the date and time smaller and lighter, especially for read messages? These are fourth-level priority items, but they're depicted on my screen with the same priority as everything else in every box in every column on my entire screen.  </p><p>4. How do I stop Thunderbird from downloading every message I've ever received without disappearing them into a secret archive? It's downloading messages from 2018 that I'd like to keep on my mail server and see at a glance when logged directly into that service, but not see in my daily Thunderbird inbox.  </p><p>5. How do I make Thunderbird show me ALL received messages in a thread when I select the drop down arrow from the center column? Right now, I have a thread with 6 messages from 3 people, but the 4 most recent messages (the ones I need) are only visible if I scroll down to the bottom of the right-hand pane. I'm sure there's a reason for hiding the 4 most recent messages, but that's too much guesswork for me. If Thunderbird can only display 3 messages in a thread, then how do I set it so that it shows the 3 most recent, not the 3 oldest? </p><p>I know this is a long message, and I apologize for that, but I've searched for answers before coming here and couldn't find what I needed. </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1646522;1646543;1646546;1646595;1646670;1646961;1647709;1647729;,user398
