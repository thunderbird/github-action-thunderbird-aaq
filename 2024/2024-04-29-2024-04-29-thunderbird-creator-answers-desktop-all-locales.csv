Has [Sent] Doesn't appear to contain anything in either Junk and Trash folders. But, they do when I open GMail in my browser. My secondary E-Mail has no [Gmail] folder but does have Sent Mail, All Mail, Junk, Spam, Trash (empty), Trash and 3 that I created. This E-mail seems to function more completely. Is there a ""repair install"" a file to edit or something else to get me back to 100% operational? Can send folder properties if helpful.

Následnou kontrolou jsem zjistil, že je to asi u třetiny archivovaných zpráv-nemohu třeba vyvolat koupené letenky! Některé archivované zprávy se přitom uložily dvakrát, poprvé bez obsahu či s nesmyslným shlukem písmen, napodruhé s normálním obsahem. Vo se s tím dá dělat? Ztratil jsem jistotu uložených věcí... </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,cs,"",karel.mrak

This morning I received an email from a family member, written in German. Underneath the original message was an automated translation into English by Deep-L. I didn´t ask for this translation. I speak German as a second language, as well as other languages, and I enjoy using my linguistic abilities. Furthermore, I don´t like my private messages being passed to a database without my permission. If I want a translation of a message, I´ll ask for it. </p><p>This is evidently a new, annoying feature. I had an email exchange in German with someone just a few weeks ago without this intervention.  I have tried searching the settings tab on Thunderbird, but have not discovered anything about Translation settings (not under Language settings, as far as I can see).  </p><p>How do I disable Thunderbird sending emails for unwanted translation? Thank you for your assistance. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1650136;,ian_tupper
