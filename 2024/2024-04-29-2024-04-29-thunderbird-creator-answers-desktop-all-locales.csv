Has [Sent] Doesn't appear to contain anything in either Junk and Trash folders. But, they do when I open GMail in my browser. My secondary E-Mail has no [Gmail] folder but does have Sent Mail, All Mail, Junk, Spam, Trash (empty), Trash and 3 that I created. This E-mail seems to function more completely. Is there a ""repair install"" a file to edit or something else to get me back to 100% operational? Can send folder properties if helpful.

Následnou kontrolou jsem zjistil, že je to asi u třetiny archivovaných zpráv-nemohu třeba vyvolat koupené letenky! Některé archivované zprávy se přitom uložily dvakrát, poprvé bez obsahu či s nesmyslným shlukem písmen, napodruhé s normálním obsahem. Vo se s tím dá dělat? Ztratil jsem jistotu uložených věcí... </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,cs,"",karel.mrak

This morning I received an email from a family member, written in German. Underneath the original message was an automated translation into English by Deep-L. I didn´t ask for this translation. I speak German as a second language, as well as other languages, and I enjoy using my linguistic abilities. Furthermore, I don´t like my private messages being passed to a database without my permission. If I want a translation of a message, I´ll ask for it. </p><p>This is evidently a new, annoying feature. I had an email exchange in German with someone just a few weeks ago without this intervention.  I have tried searching the settings tab on Thunderbird, but have not discovered anything about Translation settings (not under Language settings, as far as I can see).  </p><p>How do I disable Thunderbird sending emails for unwanted translation? Thank you for your assistance. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1650136;,ian_tupper

For me, that's a security breach risk so big, that I cannot understand how someone would be willing to accept it, but there are thousands of people accepting it, so I'm not sure if I'm missing something here... </p><p>I would really like to start working with this software, since I think it could be exactly what I've been looking for for a long time, but the Email is the entry door to almost any application, web or plattform you use, and it's the entry door to changing their passwords and taking control over those apps, webs or plattforms and, since I do not really know how add-ons really work ""in their inside"" I am unsure how big the risks here are when installing one, even without having to give them access to your own computer. </p><p>I hope I explained my problem understandably and hope you can tell me something here. </p><p>Many thanks in advance for your time and have a nice week! </p><p>Yours sincerely, Me. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,es,"",lulodolz
