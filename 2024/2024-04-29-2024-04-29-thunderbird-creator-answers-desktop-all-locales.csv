After manually sorting messages by topic into designated folders, the search engine appears to correctly identify and list all relevant messages (as shown in picture 1). However, when I attempt to open a message from the search results, the subsequent window is blank (refer to picture 2). This suggests that while the messages are displayed in the search results, they cannot be accessed as their links lead to empty pages. </p><p>I have temporarily resolved this issue by rebuilding the global database using the steps provided in the following link: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database</a>. This fix, however, only applies to existing messages, and the indexing breaks again for new messages. </p><p>Similarly, toggling the search indexing on and off for specific folders only indexes the messages that were present during the indexing process. This problem persists across multiple installations of Thunderbird, indicating it is not isolated to a single instance of the software. </p><p>Is there any option that I should set for correct messages indexing? </p><p>Is there any setting I should adjust to ensure messages are indexed correctly? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",przemek.nico

It did eventually do it, and downloaded the mail, but I am not sure why the reluctance to check on demand by the user. </p><p>It is possible it may just not be REPORTING that it is checking, but failing to get mail I know was there kind of makes that less likely. </p><p>The earlier versions, from 5 years ago, worked very well in this regard... always checked on startup and when told to, always reported the activity in real time as the check proceeded.
