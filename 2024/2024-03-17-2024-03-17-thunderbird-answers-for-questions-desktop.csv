Thought there might have been a way to 'select all' of the 'to' addresses in an email and create a new list from it. Just that there are 60 emails to add to a new list&nbsp;:-( </p>,misterjat,false,0,0

It used to be a star in older versions of Thunderbird. So you don't have to manually type 60 contacts. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
