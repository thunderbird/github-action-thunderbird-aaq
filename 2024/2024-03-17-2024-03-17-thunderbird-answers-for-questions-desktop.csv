Sadly I cannot sit next to you and observe, but I have been around a while and seen many cases of this nature. </p><p><strong>How to get that tab to open in a new window and display the tab 'Address Book' in a tab plus it will always show the Folder Pane and focus on the default account Inbox.</strong> </p> <ul><li> Right click on the 'Address Book Tab and select 'Move to new window' </li><li> Right click on the 'Address Book Tab and  press 'W' key it will open in a new window </li><li> Press the key which displays drop down options (as if you had performed a right click - it is usually located next to the 'Ctrl' key on the right side of keyboard) and press 'W' key.  </li></ul> <p>Actually the number of people who seem to accidentally rest their hands on the bottom keys on a keyboard is a lot more common than you imagine. So if you pressed 'W' and issue occurred then it's highly likely you had part of your hand resting on the drop down key at same time. </p><p>But it's also possible to do it without pressing any keys. This method is also quite common because people go to move the mouse and auto press the left button without really knowing this is something they had done and it causes no end of confusion.  </p> <ul><li> Click on mouse whilst mouse pointer is hovering over the tab title and drag to beyond any window edge.  </li></ul> <p>So in effect you think you are just moving the mouse to a desired spot and do not realise you are doing more by depressing that button.

Open Settings in a new tab, so that there are now two tabs: Mail and Settings 2. Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings tab or enter ""config editor"" in its search field to reveal the ""Config Editor..."" button 3.

Move the mouse cursor in an upward direction without pressing any mouse buttons </p><p>The moment the mouse cursor moves upward, the Advanced Settings tab will suddenly jump into its own window.

All clicks are only mouse down and up events, and I've confirmed this by watching the list of events that are passing through my mac. </p><p>I think this bug is also related to having a toolbar that contains buttons whose style is set to ""Icons above text"". At the very least I can trigger it much more easily when switching between tabs where one tab has a toolbar containing icons only, and the other has icons and labels below the icons. This causes the tab bar to change position every time I switch between the tabs, which <em>might</em> be part of what's triggering the bug. So if you have trouble reproducing the issue with the above steps, I recommend modifying the Settings tab's toolbar so that it contains at least one button, and setting its button style to ""Icons above text"", so that when you switch between Settings and Advanced Settings, the tab bar's position shifts significantly. </p><p>I don't suppose there's any way to work around this bug, is there? Either way, it looks like me or someone else will need to file a bug report and hope it gets fixed in the near future. </p><p>edit: I submitted a bug report.
