Instead I see on that Bugzilla post people waste several months on endless discussions about how many years it should become. If Mozilla wants Thunderbird to become an alternative to Outlook, a tool that people use all day to organize and plan their work, don't treat serious regressions this way. </p>",firefox2144,false,0,0
