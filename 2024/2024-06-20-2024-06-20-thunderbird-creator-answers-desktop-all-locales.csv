I was trying to clean out old stuff and deleted all the messages in Archives.  Then I emptied the trash.  BIG MISTAKE! all my gmail accounts now have an empty inbox.   I'm not sure if when I delete a message from inbox, if it also deletes it from Archives.  Why does TBird store my gmail inbox in archives?  My configuration file is still 8GB, so maybe they are still out there somewhere. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1658180;,patnsandy

It has behaved for ten to fifteen years.  Last time someone at ATT fixed it.  I have been on the phone or on screen with ATT most of my waking hours since Sunday.  (In the process I lost my internet, my landline, my cell connection, etc.)  Everything is restored except the connection between Thunderbird and ATT.  Everyone thinks changing my password will do it.  Done it four times.  It gets me into the  ATT mail.  I have replaced the password in Thunderbird settings with it to no avail.  Is there anything you can think of?   Not only is Thunderbird more attractive than ATT, I have thirty years of mail boxes there, a continuation from Eudora.  I will appreciate your wisdom. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mskinsey

I haven’t been able to send a receive any emails since. I got an error message that said that sending the password did not succeed and that there was a server error on <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a>.  That was followed up by an error message that said that the login to that server failed. I tried entering the password I had but it didn’t work, so I changed the password and the new password didn’t work. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve tried turning off the computer and turning it back on, closing Thunderbird and reopening it. I hope you will be able to get this problem resolved quickly.
