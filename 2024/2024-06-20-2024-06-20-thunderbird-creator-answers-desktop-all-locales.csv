I was trying to clean out old stuff and deleted all the messages in Archives.  Then I emptied the trash.  BIG MISTAKE! all my gmail accounts now have an empty inbox.   I'm not sure if when I delete a message from inbox, if it also deletes it from Archives.  Why does TBird store my gmail inbox in archives?  My configuration file is still 8GB, so maybe they are still out there somewhere. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1658180;,patnsandy

It has behaved for ten to fifteen years.  Last time someone at ATT fixed it.  I have been on the phone or on screen with ATT most of my waking hours since Sunday.  (In the process I lost my internet, my landline, my cell connection, etc.)  Everything is restored except the connection between Thunderbird and ATT.  Everyone thinks changing my password will do it.  Done it four times.  It gets me into the  ATT mail.  I have replaced the password in Thunderbird settings with it to no avail.  Is there anything you can think of?   Not only is Thunderbird more attractive than ATT, I have thirty years of mail boxes there, a continuation from Eudora.  I will appreciate your wisdom. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mskinsey
