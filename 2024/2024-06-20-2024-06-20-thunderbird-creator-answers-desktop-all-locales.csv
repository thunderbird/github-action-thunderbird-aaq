It has behaved for ten to fifteen years.  Last time someone at ATT fixed it.  I have been on the phone or on screen with ATT most of my waking hours since Sunday.  (In the process I lost my internet, my landline, my cell connection, etc.)  Everything is restored except the connection between Thunderbird and ATT.  Everyone thinks changing my password will do it.  Done it four times.  It gets me into the  ATT mail.  I have replaced the password in Thunderbird settings with it to no avail.  Is there anything you can think of?   Not only is Thunderbird more attractive than ATT, I have thirty years of mail boxes there, a continuation from Eudora.  I will appreciate your wisdom. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1658383;1658673;1658681;1658693;1659966;1659967;1659975;1659977;1660018;1660199;1660207;1660215;1660227;1660236;1660239;1660242;1660245;1660262;1660313;1661150;,mskinsey
