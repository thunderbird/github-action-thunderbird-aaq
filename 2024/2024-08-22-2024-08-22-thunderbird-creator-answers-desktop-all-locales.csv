Will this automatically update the server name in the msgFilterRules.dat file, or do I have to edit it to replace all references to ""<a href=""http://pop.interchange.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.interchange.ubc.ca</a>"" with ""<a href=""http://pop.mail.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.ubc.ca</a>"". </p><p>If it is not safe to do this, or it is unlikely to fix the problem, any advice as to what to try instead would be greatly appreciated!  </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",builtinbc

I have a KVM attached. My basic setup is, when the main PC (my home PC with the above specs) is connected to the KVM, I get my main monitor in the center screen with a secondary monitor on the left. When I switch the KVM, my center monitor shows the macbook on the right side (work monitor). When I switch back to the Windows 11 computer, everything goes back to the previous position except Thunderbird. </p><p>Here is something I've tried so far that seems to fix it, but it is odd that no other applications have this problem. If I make the secondary monitor on the left my primary monitor, and dock thunderbird on the left half of that monitor, when I switch the KVM to the macbook and back again, it seems to remember correctly where Thunderbird belongs (along with every other app). But if I go back to having the large center monitor the primary display, and switch the KVM away and back, everything goes back to where it was except Thunderbird for some reason. </p><p>I tried to run the system with the left monitor as the primary for a while and I use keyboard shortcuts too often which end up popping up items over on the side monitor all of the time which is more irritating. So I am wondering if there is something built into Thunderbird that specifically conflicts with remembering it's position when the KVM switches back. </p><p>It seems that the real problem is the fact that the center monitor is not only disappearing, but that the center monitor is switching between being the primary monitor and then suddenly being unavailable. Like Windows 11 is trying, only in the case of thunderbird, to remember it's last position relative to the primary monitor as opposed to its position relative to the last time the computer ran in a specific monitor configuration. </p><p>Thoughts? Should I report this to Microsoft maybe? Since this only happens with Thunderbird, is it something built into Thunderbird? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",steve.social
