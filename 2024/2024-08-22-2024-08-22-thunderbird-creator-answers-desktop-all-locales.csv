Will this automatically update the server name in the msgFilterRules.dat file, or do I have to edit it to replace all references to ""<a href=""http://pop.interchange.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.interchange.ubc.ca</a>"" with ""<a href=""http://pop.mail.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.ubc.ca</a>"". </p><p>If it is not safe to do this, or it is unlikely to fix the problem, any advice as to what to try instead would be greatly appreciated!  </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",builtinbc
