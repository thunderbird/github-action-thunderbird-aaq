Verify that the folder exists, and that filters point to a valid destination folder.""  (N.B. &lt;folderName&gt; is a placeholder here, for example it might be ""Trash"") </p><p>I can then select the destination folder in the ""Choose folder ..."" dropdown menu and run the filter, but whenever I restart Tbird, I get the same error all over again.  </p><p>In the msgFilterRules.dat file for this account, I see lines like these: ""actionValue=""mailbox://&lt;username&gt;@pop.interchange.ubc.ca/&lt;folderName&gt;"",  e.g. actionValue=""mailbox://&lt;username&gt;@pop.interchange.ubc.ca/Junk"" </p><p>[N.B. &lt;username&gt; is a placeholder for my actual username </p><p>I'm wondering if this is due to a mismatch between the POP server name and the name of the  POP mailbox folder in the Finder. Is it safe to change the name of the latter to ""<a href=""http://pop.mail.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.ubc.ca</a>"", and should this fix the problem? Will this automatically update the server name in the msgFilterRules.dat file, or do I have to edit it to replace all references to ""<a href=""http://pop.interchange.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.interchange.ubc.ca</a>"" with ""<a href=""http://pop.mail.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.ubc.ca</a>"". </p><p>If it is not safe to do this, or it is unlikely to fix the problem, any advice as to what to try instead would be greatly appreciated!  </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",builtinbc

One of them works fine the other I get ""user authenticated but not connected"" I turned off ipv6 globally and specifically for <a href=""http://outlook.office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office.com</a> and tried relogging even revoked the app and allowed it again.  Sending emails somehow works but it keeps loading even after the email is received.  I'm on Linux tried both native and flatpak app.  These account also work just fine through davmail. The irony is that the account which doesn't work recommends Linux users to use thunderbird that's what promoted me to switch to it instead of davmail. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ismail.soudi
