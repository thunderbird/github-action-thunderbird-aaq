Verify that the folder exists, and that filters point to a valid destination folder.""  (N.B. &lt;folderName&gt; is a placeholder here, for example it might be ""Trash"") </p><p>I can then select the destination folder in the ""Choose folder ..."" dropdown menu and run the filter, but whenever I restart Tbird, I get the same error all over again.  </p><p>In the msgFilterRules.dat file for this account, I see lines like these: ""actionValue=""mailbox://&lt;username&gt;@pop.interchange.ubc.ca/&lt;folderName&gt;"",  e.g. actionValue=""mailbox://&lt;username&gt;@pop.interchange.ubc.ca/Junk"" </p><p>[N.B. &lt;username&gt; is a placeholder for my actual username </p><p>I'm wondering if this is due to a mismatch between the POP server name and the name of the  POP mailbox folder in the Finder. Is it safe to change the name of the latter to ""<a href=""http://pop.mail.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.ubc.ca</a>"", and should this fix the problem? Will this automatically update the server name in the msgFilterRules.dat file, or do I have to edit it to replace all references to ""<a href=""http://pop.interchange.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.interchange.ubc.ca</a>"" with ""<a href=""http://pop.mail.ubc.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.ubc.ca</a>"". </p><p>If it is not safe to do this, or it is unlikely to fix the problem, any advice as to what to try instead would be greatly appreciated!  </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",builtinbc
