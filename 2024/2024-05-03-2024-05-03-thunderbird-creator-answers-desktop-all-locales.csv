I don't know how to send without it.,"<p>I have three different computers that I can use Thunderbird to access my hotmail account. All three computers can have the exact same server settings. One computer refuses to send emails unless I cancel the send and immediately resend.. Thunderbird ver 115.10.1 (64-bit) Windows 10 Home Ver 22H2 IMAP Mail Server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>  Port 993 Connection Security SSL/TLS Authentication 0Auth2 Outgoing SMTP Server <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> Port 587 Connection Security STARTTLS 0Auth2 Take Note All three machines can have identical settings listed above or various changes like Normal Password instead of 0Auth2 and/or an Outgoing server can be <a href=""http://smtp-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp-mail.outlook.com</a> with normal password or 0Auth2... One computer must be cancelled will sending and when resent, it goes... no problem...immediately. If I don't cancel and wait, for it to send on the 1st attempt, it will eventually timeout on the outgoing server. Then I might have to reenter a password. Very annoying. I have been doing this for years. It is my workaround.... </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",je_lowe

I can only see a couple of lines of text at the most and am unable to reduce the height of the incoming list of emails as previously in order to increase the height of the viewing panel.  I have been helped to increase the font size of the overall layout so that I can now read it better but the green button to declare that my problem has been solved tells me that the page isn't working! </p>,"",thunderbird,other,en-US,"",christine81
