When I write an email over time it gets saved in my draft folder, but I get multiple copies and when I send it the previous versions remain in my Draft folder. So I end up with email messages, some of which have been sent and some are genuine drafts that I need to finish. If I wanted to keep a different version I'd probably amend the title. So my questions: How do I tell which has been sent and which is still a draft to complete and do I have to delete the old versions myself or ideally can I set it so that when I edit the message and save the new draft it overwrites the previous one?
