I don't know how to send without it.,"<p>I have three different computers that I can use Thunderbird to access my hotmail account. All three computers can have the exact same server settings. One computer refuses to send emails unless I cancel the send and immediately resend.. Thunderbird ver 115.10.1 (64-bit) Windows 10 Home Ver 22H2 IMAP Mail Server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>  Port 993 Connection Security SSL/TLS Authentication 0Auth2 Outgoing SMTP Server <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> Port 587 Connection Security STARTTLS 0Auth2 Take Note All three machines can have identical settings listed above or various changes like Normal Password instead of 0Auth2 and/or an Outgoing server can be <a href=""http://smtp-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp-mail.outlook.com</a> with normal password or 0Auth2... One computer must be cancelled will sending and when resent, it goes... no problem...immediately. If I don't cancel and wait, for it to send on the 1st attempt, it will eventually timeout on the outgoing server. Then I might have to reenter a password. Very annoying. I have been doing this for years. It is my workaround.... </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",je_lowe

When I write an email over time it gets saved in my draft folder, but I get multiple copies and when I send it the previous versions remain in my Draft folder. So I end up with email messages, some of which have been sent and some are genuine drafts that I need to finish. If I wanted to keep a different version I'd probably amend the title. So my questions: How do I tell which has been sent and which is still a draft to complete and do I have to delete the old versions myself or ideally can I set it so that when I edit the message and save the new draft it overwrites the previous one? Thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1651001;,slatography
