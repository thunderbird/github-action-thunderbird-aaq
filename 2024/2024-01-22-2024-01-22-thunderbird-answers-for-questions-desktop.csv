This immediately results in duplicate text versions (the first 20kb) in the profile folder named with the file extension WDSEML and stored in folders with the extension .mozmsgs  </p><p>I have never found any tools in Thunderbird to manage these files,  other than to disable the windows search in preferences and manually delete the files and folders created by the option.  In my case I deleted over 130,000 small text files. </p><p>This discussion from 10 years ago pretty well covers this mess. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1027528"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1027528</a> </p><p>Then there is the global search.

Then you have the involvement of the windows shadow copy service.  This can take huge amounts of space and about the only way to know if a file is included that I have found it to select it in the file manager and check in properties for previous versions. </p><p>Then there is the failed setup an account attempt,  or the I deleted an old account result.  Both of these actions will create/leave a folder in your profile.  Each account you set up has it's own folder created.  This folder is named for the server your mail service uses.  In your case <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a>.  Each attempt to create another yahoo account will create a new folder.  so if you have trouble getting it to go and keep trying the wizard you might have 20 folders with dead account setups in them.

Used to be an issue when we measured drives in megabytes and low gigabytes. Not such an issue these days with big drives,  it allows for mail recovery after the event.

This protocol is rather odd in that you initially enter your password to allow it to function,  and then it just works using a token issues in the process by the server.  A bit like a bus token from so long ago.   </p><p>When the token you initially got when you entered your password expires the system reissues a new one and this can go on for a long time (My experience was over a year)  but one day Google decides you need to reauthorize the thing and the oauth windows I see in this topic pops up out of the blue. </p><p>Google do not publish a list of reasons that they reissue these requests instead of just offering a new token,  but I changed my internet service provider and the next time I accessed my mail google wanted me to re-authenticate.  Initially I guessed it was the change in IP address,  but it could have been the change of provider (The IP address is registered to the ISP, not you)  But using a VPN could also well cause a re-authentication request as you physical location is changed by the VPN,  that is how they work. </p><p>I see one reference to AVG in the bug report. I dumped it as an ongoing problem child some 15 years ago.  It was not doing a good job and was in my face all the time when I turned of it's useless email scanner.  But is that the common denominator for those that needed to change the defaults? </p><p>I also see there that these family accounts are not available for use in email clients. <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/thread/127545584/i-have-created-a-supervised-account-and-i-m-want-to-add-it-to-my-mail-app-in-mac-but-its-offline?hl=en&amp;msgid=128001398"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/thread/127545584/i-have-created-a-supervised-account-and-i-m-want-to-add-it-to-my-mail-app-in-mac-but-its-offline?hl=en&amp;msgid=128001398</a> </p><p>Then there is the third option everyone has and most ignore.  The antivirus.  You might want to compare notes as the which you use,  but they are all bad.  Basically they hack what are encrypted connections to scan the content and in the process sometime just mess it up completely.  Using unrecognized encryption certificates and generally not doing very well at all. Often these products need to be disabled or removed to make the system function correctly as they are burrowed so deeply into the internals of the operating system. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-01-23-01-43-07-1e17fc.png""> </p><p>I am guessing this is some sort of ""you have had to many tried in this session"" from Google.  If a system reboot does not clear it,  you might have to wait 24 hours until google decide to release the bad attempts lock.  You might want to look in your google account online for any warning of bad things.  I have even seen Google block the mail because they want you to click ok on some new change to their terms of use so a session using a browser is essential for trying to work out what google want you to do. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

To share a few comments: conversation view can be turned off with a menu selection, and the order of messages can be easily changed in similar fashion, and Thunderbird also has the ability to show a count of unread messages on the toolbar from the settings menu. On the things you don't like, your suggestions should go to connect dot mozilla dot org to be reviewed, as this forum is only to assist in Thunderbird as it exists today.

Your initial post was implicitly stating 'I don't know Thunderbird and it's flawed.' rather contradictory and I have a tendency to overreact - my apologies. Let me start:  - first, click the alt key to cause the menu bar to appear. then, click view&gt;toolbars and tick it to keep it. I have no idea why the default shuts it off and you can later turn it off if that gives you more screen space, as there is a hamburger (three lines) menu icon on upper right - but it provides few features.  - okay, if you highlight a folder, you can click view&gt;sort by an click 'unthreaded.  - the default message list pane is called 'card view'. If you click the icon to the right of the 'quick search' bar above the message list pane to switch to table view. That view lets you easily toggle the top bar to change sort order.  - for lazy or compact viewing, there is view&gt;density and view&gt;font   - Thunderbird excels in font management, allowing sender to have preferred font and size, while freeing recipients to their own preferences or to force to use senders, as preferred.  - if you browse the forum much, you will frequently see references to the config editor (settings&gt;general) at bottom right of pane. This opens many settings that are officially 'blessed' for user customization. For example, to change the default for NEW folders from threaded to unthreaded, do this:  Click settings&gt;general and open config editor and locate the mailnews.default_view_flags  line and change value to 0  </p><p>Okay, that's a start. Let us know as you discover more items.  There are other common modifications, such as default font size setup, but I hope this is a start.   </p><p>Suggestion: Thunderbird is susceptible to having profiles become corrupt if antivirus programs interrupt updates.

Right click and select customize and you can put frequent buttons to be always available. One of the available buttons is VIEW. I suggest dragging that to the bar as in clicking it you and change from viewing all messages to just viewing unread messages, or even a custom view that you specify in a custom filter.  </p><p>It is possible to change font size of unread, even to change its color, but that is a CSS issue.
