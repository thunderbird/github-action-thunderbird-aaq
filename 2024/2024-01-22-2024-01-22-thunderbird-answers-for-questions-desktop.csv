At the bottom of that mailbox folder there were 6 or so messages with nothing but what looked like Chinese characters--not random symbols, but actual text. There were also a couple of emails at the bottom that showed now data in the message view (such as the summary information when looking through the list of emails) and the email bodies showed the source of the email. I looked at about a dozen other emails in the list of 22,000 or so emails and they all looked fine, except for the last half dozen or so. </p><p>I checked this behavior against Mail.app's view of the end of that mailbox folder and none of those peculiarities were present. </p><p>I'd really love to switch to Thunderbird permanently but I need to understand this problem before I can commit to that.&nbsp;:) </p><p>If there's anything that I can provide you to aide in figuring this out, please let me know and I'll provide what I can. </p><p>Also note that I had to remove the IMAP account--it was causing me to run quite low on disk space.
