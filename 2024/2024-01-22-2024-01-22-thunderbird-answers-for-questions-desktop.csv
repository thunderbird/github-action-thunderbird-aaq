The strength of Thunderbird, of course, is that it is free to use. I do understand your frustration: people coming from Eudora complain that Thunderbird doesn't act like Eudora, people coming from WindowsLIve complain that Thunderbird doesn't act like WindowsLive, and the same from other clients. To share a few comments: conversation view can be turned off with a menu selection, and the order of messages can be easily changed in similar fashion, and Thunderbird also has the ability to show a count of unread messages on the toolbar from the settings menu. On the things you don't like, your suggestions should go to connect dot mozilla dot org to be reviewed, as this forum is only to assist in Thunderbird as it exists today.
