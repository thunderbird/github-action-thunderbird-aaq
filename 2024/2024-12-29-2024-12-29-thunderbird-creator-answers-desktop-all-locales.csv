I got two folders that can't be deleted and can't be used and they're dirty and won't let me move anything into them. When I close and reopen the program, those two folders become 4 folders, multiplied and one can always be deleted and appear again. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,sr,"",monoplast022
