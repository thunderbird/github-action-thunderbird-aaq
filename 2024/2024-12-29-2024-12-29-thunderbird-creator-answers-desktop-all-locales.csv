I got two folders that can't be deleted and can't be used and they're dirty and won't let me move anything into them. When I close and reopen the program, those two folders become 4 folders, multiplied and one can always be deleted and appear again. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,sr,"",monoplast022

When I try to write an email and add an attachment (e.g., a photo), the system file manager opens. After selecting the file, it doesn't appear in Thunderbird. Sharing a file from the file manager via Thunderbird results in the same issue. Only when sharing a file through the system Gallery app to Thunderbird can I attach and send it successfully. In the permissions settings for Thunderbird, I only see options for Camera and Contacts. There is no option for Files and Media. I couldn't find a solution to this problem anywhere. Does anyone have any suggestions? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",panzanussi
