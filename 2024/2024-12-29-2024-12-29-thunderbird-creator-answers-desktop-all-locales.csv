I got two folders that can't be deleted and can't be used and they're dirty and won't let me move anything into them. When I close and reopen the program, those two folders become 4 folders, multiplied and one can always be deleted and appear again. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,sr,"",monoplast022

I have a Cox email account, and about a year ago they switched to using Yahoo.  It's been working fine until last month. When I open TB, the inbox count of unread messages keeps climbing, but it's not adding new emails.  I think it's actually adding duplicates of already downloaded emails.  Some of which it looks like it is adding several copies, like 3 or 4. Can you tell me where to start? Many thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ljcaputo
