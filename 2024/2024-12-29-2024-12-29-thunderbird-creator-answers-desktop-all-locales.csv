I have a Cox email account, and about a year ago they switched to using Yahoo.  It's been working fine until last month. When I open TB, the inbox count of unread messages keeps climbing, but it's not adding new emails.  I think it's actually adding duplicates of already downloaded emails.  Some of which it looks like it is adding several copies, like 3 or 4. Can you tell me where to start? Many thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ljcaputo

Please allow (or just enable my default) that the controls to search in mails/delete mails etc are moved to the bottom of the screen so you can easily reach them on as mobile phone (just like blue Mail does it). </p><p>Second smaller request: please make the email list less ""crowded"" somehow the fonts and density are hard to read. Again have a look at blue Mail for how to do this a bit better. Could also be an option. </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,"",aherz81

How do I change it to back it was?   I did make a backup of my Thunderbird before I reinstalled it (months ago), how can I transfer my address book from that copy to the new copy?
