The issue, from my perspective (as I also cope with this issue), is that Thunderbird creates a new draft every xxx minutes depending on your settings. After sending, the draft is deleted, but all the remaining ones are still there. The email host just sees them as pending messages. I mitigate this by setting the time interval to save at a higher number. Another option I use on one account is setting the draft folder to local.

I suggest emptying trash and junk and compacting to reduce the profile size. You're right, that IMAP will self-restore if needed. I am not familiar with 32-bit, but the profile is just data, not software. On restarting on new PC, if there is an incompatibility message, exit and look for a compatibility.ini file in profile and delete it. Keep the old PC until all is stable. Sometimes, an error or oversight happens during transfer. In such rare instances, though, any missing data on old PC can be copied  and replaced piecemeal with windows file explorer.  Once everything is working, I suggest using same copy steps to create a backup. And do that regularly. If you encounter a problem, don't act quickly; pause and let us know.

It is a simple text file that you can open with Notepad. That file has the name of the profile in use and will identify the right one.

Did you make the copy with Windows File Explorer? The names should be identical to the names as shown on old PC. Did you accidentally use Mozback instead? This needs to be checked. Look at profile on old PC and compare names to what you copied.  - I have never used the Administrator role. That's all I can share on the topic.

I say that because some users are very familiar with windows file explorer and others are not.  - exit thunderbird - locate profile and do a copy and paste, in effect duplicating it.  - on the copied folder, rename it unique to no longer have the 'copy' in the name  - start thunderbird, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles - click 'create profile'  - click next - enter shortcut, possibly other person's first name, e.g., SAMANTHA - click 'choose' button, locate and select the profile you copied, click finish and launch - you are now using Samantha's profile. delete all accounts and local folders that are NOT Samantha's.  - exit thunderbird  - on desktop, rightclick the thunderbird icon and insert  -p a space or two to the right of thunderbird.exe  and save - now, click the icon and Profile Manager will start, showing Samantha's profile and yours. Select yours and now set a default to ensure that the option is always presented. AND, DELETE all accounts and folders that were Samantha's. You now have two profiles, one for Samantha and one for you.  - now, go to settings&gt;privacy&amp;security and set a primary password if desired to ensure Samantha does not access your profile. When Samantha access the PC for her profile, she can do the same. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
