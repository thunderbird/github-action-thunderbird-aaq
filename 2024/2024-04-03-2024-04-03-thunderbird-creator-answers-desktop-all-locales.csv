I am assuming that during settup and dabling on the new work station I have manipulated a setting and now there is an inconsistancey. I just can't seam to find it.

Možná to bylo i neprovedenou aktualizací, ale od té doby, když si zasíláme/přeposíláme emaily mezi sebou ve firmě, došlá pošta se instantně neobjeví u příjemce jako v minulosti. Co jsem odpozoroval, byla prodleva snad 10 min než se nová pošta v doručených objevila. Tak jsem pátral v nastavení a narazil jsem v nastavení účtu -&gt; Nastavení serveru -&gt; Kontrolovat nové zprávy každých 1+ min (defaultně bylo nastaveno zmíněných 10 min). Aji když toto pole odkliknu, tak nová zpráva se mi zobrazí pouze když kliknu na doručenou poštu nebo daný emailový účet a dám Přijmou zprávy. Kde v nastavení prosím nastavím, aby se mi doručené zprávy zobrazili instantně nebo s maximálně pár sek. zpožděním? Toto <em>zpožděné</em> zobrazení doručeným zpráv mi moc nedává smysl.

I have a problem with the calendar function however which I have to use now. I'd like to have an audio alert and/or window pop-up forcing interaction for any event in my calendar, let's say 15 min ahead. I tend to overlook the small notification pop-ups in the bottom right corner of the screen since they also vanish automatically after a few seconds. </p><p>I can get these small bottom right corner pop-ups to appear for any event by using the global notification preferences in the Edit Calender options. However, I can not globally activate an audio alert or a window requiring interaction for upcoming events. I can just activate a reminder manually for each and every event, which is a lot of work, naturally. So, is there a way to activate a reminder (not a notification, which is the bottom right pop up I assume) globally for any event in a calendar? </p><p>Can also be done by an add-on or by manually changing source files, if anyone has suggestions in this direction. </p><p>Thanks in advance, trashmaster </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",trashmaster
