I'd like to have an audio alert and/or window pop-up forcing interaction for any event in my calendar, let's say 15 min ahead. I tend to overlook the small notification pop-ups in the bottom right corner of the screen since they also vanish automatically after a few seconds. </p><p>I can get these small bottom right corner pop-ups to appear for any event by using the global notification preferences in the Edit Calender options. However, I can not globally activate an audio alert or a window requiring interaction for upcoming events.

So, is there a way to activate a reminder (not a notification, which is the bottom right pop up I assume) globally for any event in a calendar? </p><p>Can also be done by an add-on or by manually changing source files, if anyone has suggestions in this direction. </p><p>Thanks in advance, trashmaster </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",trashmaster
