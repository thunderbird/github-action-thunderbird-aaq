The PDF file could be correctly downloaded and open from Outlook.  Similarly, on the smartphone the problem did not occur. the problem is inside Thunderbird. The computer is running Windows 10 22H2 64 bit, connected via WLAN , effective  download speed as measured on the PC 14.5 Mbit/sec, upload speed 2.3 Mbit/sec, Ping 21 ms- The email account is xxx@outlook.com, IMAP The problem happened for two different emails received from different sources with different PDF attachments, in one case 1.2 MB (but Thunderbird is showing an attachment of 240 KB, email received on 2024.09.09) , in the other case 1.7 MB (email received on 2024.09.18) . in the latter case, at a later time, the email could subsequently open correctly the attachment, although I did not remember having changed anything in the meantime on my side.  In all cases, the emails opened correctly in Thunderbird and the text of the email body was always correctly displayed, but instead of opening the attachment, a blue line was shown on the screen. After clicking on the attachment and having saved it on the desktop, the message from Adobe was popping up, indicating that the file was corrupted and could not be opened. I tried to recoved the first file with online recovery tools, the result was that some pages of the PDF were damaged.    in the first case the installed Thunderbird version was 128.2.0, in the second case 128.2.1, I guess.  My impression is that some data exchange between Thunderbird and the Microsoft server of <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> was causing the problem.
