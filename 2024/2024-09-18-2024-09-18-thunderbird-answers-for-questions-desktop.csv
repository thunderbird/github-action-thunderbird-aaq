There is no need to change to a different profile if a new provider is the only reason. The new account can be added to the existing profile. My experience on this forum is that users sometimes cause more problems when copying profiles. If you do copy the profile, be sure to copy it when thunderbird is not running. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you delete from computer, IMAP's sync feature also removes from server. You can manage this somewhat by not storing content on computer, just headers.
