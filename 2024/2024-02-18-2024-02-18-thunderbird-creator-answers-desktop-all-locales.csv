It will still send email through this account and downloads and sends email to my Gmail account. Emails were no longer pushed to my phone as well from this account, so after troubleshooting I pointed a finger at my email and Internet providers. They tried to help, going so far as to remote onto the computer to check settings. The desktop computer is hardwired (LAN) and all mobile devices are Wifi.  In the course of trying to ""fix"" the issue I did a hard reset of my router/modem (CX30), and emails started being pushed to my phone again. So, I may have had a security setting on the Wifi side of the router that was not compatible.  However, *nothing* I can figure out will let me access the email server from my desktop computer through Thunderbird. I removed all emails from the server to get rid of corrupt email that might have blocked downloads, and manually reset all of the security settings in Thunderbird based on what I was able to find in the forums. I have switched ports from the current recommended 995 and security settings back to 110 with *no* security settings and nothing I have tried so far works.
