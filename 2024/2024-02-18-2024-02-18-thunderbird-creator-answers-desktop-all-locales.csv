They are from varied sources, some duplicates, but mostly new senders I've not received before. No, I don't want to have to set filters for EVERY single new one I receive. I have a life beyond setting up email controls for such an invasive problem. Why are these messages getting through to my inbox in the first place? That didn't used to happen. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1637243;,darleenm

It will still send email through this account and downloads and sends email to my Gmail account. Emails were no longer pushed to my phone as well from this account, so after troubleshooting I pointed a finger at my email and Internet providers. They tried to help, going so far as to remote onto the computer to check settings. The desktop computer is hardwired (LAN) and all mobile devices are Wifi.  In the course of trying to ""fix"" the issue I did a hard reset of my router/modem (CX30), and emails started being pushed to my phone again. So, I may have had a security setting on the Wifi side of the router that was not compatible.  However, *nothing* I can figure out will let me access the email server from my desktop computer through Thunderbird. I removed all emails from the server to get rid of corrupt email that might have blocked downloads, and manually reset all of the security settings in Thunderbird based on what I was able to find in the forums. I have switched ports from the current recommended 995 and security settings back to 110 with *no* security settings and nothing I have tried so far works.  Any further suggestions? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1637242;,slmorrison

After I have transferred the domains and set DNS to the new server IP, I always have the problem, that my existing thunderbird imap mail accounts don't work properly anymore.  K9 mail on my android devices doesn't have this problem. Sending mails does work, but the imap connection to my mail accounts is broken. I tried using the IP of the new server instead of its DNS name, but this didn't help either. The only way that works, is to add a new account. This is very nagging as I then need to manually edit all my adapted settings and my various mail identities. Is it a generic problem with TB, possibly with the server certificates? Or is there another way to change the imap server of an existing account? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",ffsync5
