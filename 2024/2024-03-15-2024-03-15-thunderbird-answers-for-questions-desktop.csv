My Mailwasher program was also not seeing which messages had been read, and continued to show them on the server, so maybe their was a temporary glitch with the ""Mark as read"" feature.

It is very common for the entire account creation connection to be blocked by antivirus products that are simply interfering in the process,  so if you have a product that scans email I suggest you disable it while you configure your account.
