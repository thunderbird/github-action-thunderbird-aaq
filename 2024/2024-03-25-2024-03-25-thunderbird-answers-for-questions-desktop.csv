That was basically it. Some of settings for how mailbox contents are displayed were not transferred over, so I had to set them on the Mac, and I had to enter the password for my ISP's mail service a couple of times, but other than that, export/import seems to have worked the way one would hope it would. </p><p>It is beyond me why this utterly straightforward approach to moving TB from one machine to another doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.
