I never quite found the unread mail, and don't know for sure that that is the problem, but I think I understand what's going on. </p><p>Are you familiar with the ""Unsubscribe"" option? It shows up when you right-click on the account name. It is NOT in the normal SETTINGS menu. It allows you to hide folders that are included in the IMAP account's list of non-deletable folders. So they're still present in the IMAP account, but they are not shown in Thunderbird. </p><p>I love this feature and have used it to get rid of all the folders I don't want to see.
