That was basically it. Some of settings for how mailbox contents are displayed were not transferred over, so I had to set them on the Mac, and I had to enter the password for my ISP's mail service a couple of times, but other than that, export/import seems to have worked the way one would hope it would. </p><p>It is beyond me why this utterly straightforward approach to moving TB from one machine to another doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere. If there's a hidden drawback to it, I'd be grateful to be told about it. </p>",LangfristigerFFUser,false,0,0

An option to try for your old profile is to use Tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbird installation to point to your old profile. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0
