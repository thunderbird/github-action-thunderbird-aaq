Perhaps the worst is retaining 100,00+ email on a mail server when your pop connections has to work hard to leave them there.  It is designed to delete them on download.  The popstate.dat file has some 100,000+ entries for each and every email you have is the settings is ""until I delete them"" or a last downloaded if it is leave on server. </p><p>Both rely absolutely on the integrity of the popstate.dat file. </p><p>So, here I am asking if the hard disk in the Windows 7 device is even still stable storage.  Have you checked the drive using chkdsk?  Have you defragmented the drive using the windows tools for doing same? </p><p>There are arguments that windows NTFS file systems (the default) do not need to be de-fragmented like fat32 predecessor did,  but it is an inescapable fact that de-fragmentation does a pretty good job of identifying failing drives and drive sectors on magnetic drives.  That the device is a windows 7 laptop,  it does not make me think recent release product.  Given Microsoft tried to end sales of windows 7 in 2014.  So check the drive for errors.  It might be attempts to write to the file are failing as the physical hardware level.  It's storage location has not changed from what you have done I would not think. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Go to Account Settings (Under the triple bar/hamburger icon).  Select Server Settings in the left menu.  The setting you're looking for is ""Check for new messages every [] minutes"".  It defaults to checking every 10 minutes, but you can set it as low as 1 minute. </p><p>You can always click the ""get messages"" button to instantly check for new messages when needed, but it sounds like your use case calls for more frequent automatic downloads.  I hope this helps. </p>",surrealdreams,false,0,0
