At that point, check the box in the prompt to have the password saved.

So if the email used a table to format the positioning of content, then in Plain Text mode that 'table' formatting would be removed. But if bullets were used in a html then they should still display in plain text mode. </p><p>Currently, I do not know what is contained in the source. Can you offer some info? </p><p>Check if email has been sent with both plain text and html. Select email so it displays in Message Pane In the headers area - Click on 'More' and click on 'View Source' It opens in a new window. Look for these lines: </p> <ul><li> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""UTF-8"" </li><li> Content-Type: text/html; charset=""UTF-8"" </li></ul> <p>If contents only have the text/plain option then email was only sent as plain text. If it has both then email was composed using html, but it's likely you are viewing it in Plain Text mode. </p><p>What do you see in the source?  </p><p>Providing there isn't anything too sensitive - it would be handy to post images of what you see. </p><p>Then I'll know what settings you currently use, what info is in view source and the image showing results. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
