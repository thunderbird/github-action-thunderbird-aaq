I have not made any changes to settings but I get smtp error when trying to send. I have 3 accounts and my gmail one works but not the other 2. The only difference I can see is the 2 that aren't working are POP3 whereas the gmail one is IMAP but surely that only affects receiving, not sending? Very occasionally an unsent email has miraculously been sent but mostly I get the smtp error. I checked with my ISP and they found not errors and suggested online webmail.

But transfering the folder and files proves difficult, the copy/paste function does not work properly so I can't just click and drag. My thunderbird folder is approx. 20g, could that be the reason? Furthermore, I cannot delete the previous POP3 account or the local folders. Any idea why?

Periodically, and it seems to coincide with either one of those updating, I have had an ongoing issue with my ability to click on links in my email and have them automatically open my browser (if not already open) or to open in a tab when Firefox is already open.  At some point while suffering with this condition it will 'just fix itself' and work sometimes for months or years then do it all over again.  I have tried over the years to fix it myself and have read &amp; tried every suggested solution that can be found.  I can open my emails in AOL, click on any link and have it open in Firefox.  This leads me to believe the problem is with T-bird and not any settings in my browser but just in case I have examined settings in both apps and not found a cause or solution.  I have tried every suggested fix in 'config' and have even removed and reinstalled T-bird three different times over the years but to no avail.  I really hate having to start over with a new installation especially since it doesn't fix the problem but has caused no end of headaches trying to retrieve my address book and re-customize my email program back to how I like it.   PLEASE!  Mozilla it's time to fix this ongoing problem that quite obviously plagues so many users out there.
