I have not made any changes to settings but I get smtp error when trying to send. I have 3 accounts and my gmail one works but not the other 2. The only difference I can see is the 2 that aren't working are POP3 whereas the gmail one is IMAP but surely that only affects receiving, not sending? Very occasionally an unsent email has miraculously been sent but mostly I get the smtp error. I checked with my ISP and they found not errors and suggested online webmail. Messages send fine through there but I'd rather use Thunderbird. Any suggestions please? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",greg152
