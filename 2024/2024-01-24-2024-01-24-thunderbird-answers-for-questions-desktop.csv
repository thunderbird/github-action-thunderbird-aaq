There is a minimize button for windows in apple products I am sure, perhaps she should be using it if she wants to go back there later.  I sometimes close Thunderbird's main window and just leave the email I am working on to remove distraction, but that state is really just the program half closed down,  the main thread is gone,  just some child windows are still open.  It is not getting mail or doing most of the background tasks except perhaps spell checking.   </p><p>I just click the launch icon again open Thunderbird again,  but I really consider my leaving mail windows open post closing the application something of a fringe use case. </p><p>But you can't switch to the main window when it is closed.
