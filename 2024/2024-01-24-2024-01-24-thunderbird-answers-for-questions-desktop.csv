The date received is whenever you added the mail to the account.  IMAP is <strong>NOT </strong>a filling system.  Despite many folk thinking it is at least something like that. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

There is a minimize button for windows in apple products I am sure, perhaps she should be using it if she wants to go back there later.  I sometimes close Thunderbird's main window and just leave the email I am working on to remove distraction, but that state is really just the program half closed down,  the main thread is gone,  just some child windows are still open.  It is not getting mail or doing most of the background tasks except perhaps spell checking.   </p><p>I just click the launch icon again open Thunderbird again,  but I really consider my leaving mail windows open post closing the application something of a fringe use case. </p><p>But you can't switch to the main window when it is closed.  It is not an accident, or some oversight.  Once the developers finally remove the reading of mail in a separate window then it will not even be an issue will not have legacy windows to leave open. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
