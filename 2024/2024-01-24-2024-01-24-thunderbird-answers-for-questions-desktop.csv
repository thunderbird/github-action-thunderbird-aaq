Your problem is that you need a unique SMTP server for each email address. To do that:  - go to account settings and scroll to Outgoing Servers SMTP) and click each SMTP server to note the email id being used. I encourage placing that for documentation purposes in the Description field.  - now go to account settings&gt;account for each of those three and verify that the associated SMTP server (shown on bottom line) matches the email address of the account.  - now return to the Outgoing Servers (SMTP) pane and create new SMTP server settings for each of the other email accounts that you have, following same instructions as above. Since all of them use the same server, the technical info for each should be the same, other than the email address and description field. Now, repeat the account settings&gt;account review for each of those to verify that each of them now are associated with the correct SMTP server.  NOW, send a test email to verify that the setup works. If there are error messages, post back here for review so we can get one account working properly, and then you can apply any corrections to the other SMTP servers.  </p><p>This may seem very technical, but once you start, it's really rather straightforward. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Regardless of what you think.  The problem is at Hover.   They (google)  are not complaining about your mail client,  or your home IP address.  They are complaining about a specific sender addresss of 65.20.63.221  which as I said earlier resolves to <a href=""http://altprdrgo05.altice.prod.msg.synchronoss.net"" rel=""nofollow"">altprdrgo05.altice.prod.msg.synchronoss.net</a>   </p><p>There is an invalid SPF record for <a href=""http://synchronoss.net"" rel=""nofollow"">synchronoss.net</a> which probably does not help things, <a href=""https://www.spf-record.com/spf-lookup/synchronoss.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spf-record.com/spf-lookup/synchronoss.net</a>  All this is a direct result of Googles announced tightening of their deliverability standards. Hover do not meet them (I assume this synchonoss are providing services to Hover, it is the only way I can get them into the email equation) and until you ask Hover for help I doubt you will make any progress at all.  You are certainly not going to make any here. </p><p>Thunderbird has no involvement in DKIM, DMARC SPF it is all managed at a server level using DNS </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
