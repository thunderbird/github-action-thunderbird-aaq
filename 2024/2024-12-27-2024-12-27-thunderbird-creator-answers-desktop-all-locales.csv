Is there any way to recover from this dilemma? When I click on the Thunderbird icon, the first thing I see is Enter your Primary Password. I enter my last PW. No success. So I click on Cancel. Up comes a partial TB screen and another request for the Primary PW. Click cancel again and there is TB with all my old emails.  It is trying to connect to the host server by sending login information repeatedly. It eventually times out and asks for the Primary PW again. I can get my email by connecting to the ISP (<a href=""http://Frontier.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Frontier.com</a>), but I really miss my TB. It has now been many months and I have all the emails since TB stopped working.  I know I can change my email address and start over but what I would really like to do is pickup from where I left off. I can't believe I am the only person to have this happen. I have tried using the Forgot Password option but to use that you need the Primary PW and I have neither of them. I am open to trying anything. </p><p>Larry Kamberg ldkamb@frontier.com </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1697948;,ldkamb

I shutdown my computer (MacOS Sequoia) and went away for a few days, and now Thunderbird hangs when I try to use it. I have one main email account which I access with POP, and a couple of other accounts which I access with IMAP. I can access the downloaded messages in the Inbox of the POP account that I downloaded before going away, but I can't read any other folders (I have many folders since I've used Thunderbird for so long), or access the IMAP accounts. Thunderbird shows that I have new mail waiting on the POP server, but it hangs when I try to download them. It does not show mail waiting on the IMAP accounts, although I know new mail is there. </p><p>I have tried re-installing Thunderbird, and rebooted the computer, with no change. When Thunderbird hangs, it eats memory until the system runs out, and I have to use Force Quit to terminate it. </p><p>It's the first time I've had a problem with it! </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1697969;1697973;,caroline144

The problem is that I tried everything, went to all blogs but nothing is working for me. In the end, I did the following: </p><p>1. Deleted the hotmail account and added account again. 2. Deleting the old passwords for microsoft365 and inserting new in Thunderbird. </p><p>With the following settings as attached. </p><p>The incoming settings are good with IMAP the only issue is with the out going SMTP server and password settings. </p><p>I suspect the problem is that I am using other microsoft365 accounts open on my PC in other tabs, thats why its not working. This means, Thunderbird is not intelligent enough to see whether the outgoing request is for the configured account. It takes the system managed or 365 managed outgoing server settings and tries to put the password (which is a wrong password for this account), and everything messes up. </p><p>Any suggestions? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",gtauseef
