Is there any way to recover from this dilemma? When I click on the Thunderbird icon, the first thing I see is Enter your Primary Password. I enter my last PW. No success. So I click on Cancel. Up comes a partial TB screen and another request for the Primary PW. Click cancel again and there is TB with all my old emails.  It is trying to connect to the host server by sending login information repeatedly. It eventually times out and asks for the Primary PW again. I can get my email by connecting to the ISP (<a href=""http://Frontier.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Frontier.com</a>), but I really miss my TB. It has now been many months and I have all the emails since TB stopped working.  I know I can change my email address and start over but what I would really like to do is pickup from where I left off. I can't believe I am the only person to have this happen. I have tried using the Forgot Password option but to use that you need the Primary PW and I have neither of them. I am open to trying anything. </p><p>Larry Kamberg ldkamb@frontier.com </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1697948;,ldkamb
