This would be something I could understand, since the same @domain.tld part makes the decision for TB somewhat random. However, this is not the case with me. </p><p>Let me describe my problem a little more detailed, should have done in the first place. </p><p>Account setup: </p> <ul><li> other unrelated fremailers </li><li> alice@mydomain1.com, uses <a href=""http://smtp.mydomain1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mydomain1.com</a> with alice credentials, collects all email for @mydomain1.com </li><li> bob@mydomain2.com, uses <a href=""http://smtp.mydomain2.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mydomain2.com</a> with bob credentials, collects all email for @mydomain2.com </li><li> no other accounts with @mydomain1.com or @mydomain2.com are configured in TB </li></ul> <p>Sending email via ""customize from address"" as e.g. charlie@mydomain1.com (no charlie TB identity created with alice@mydomain1.com)  This email then ended up being sent out via SMTP server of bob@mydomain2.com - making it hard for me to see a reason for that decision. </p><p>It is just an occasional problem, happened 2 times in 6 months now. I am not able to reproduce it so far, even using the same addresses involved again and again. </p>",sparklingstarfish,false,0,0

The selection of SMTP server is dependent on the from address, so there is possibility of a bug somewhere. Finding it, though, would probably require explicit details on both of your accounts and the various customizations that you did. I am NOT requesting that info, just advising my opinion. My 'guess' is that you're customizing 'too much'...&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

However, we are just users such as yourself, neither developers or employees, but giving of our free time to assist others. If I may offer a suggestion: when posting a problem, the more information you share in post increases the likelihood of a response. For example, knowing POP or IMAP, whether thunderbird was just updated, release version of thunderbird, plus any error messages. Knowing that, a volunteer may be more apt to respond, as the volunteer may have ideas for a possible solution. If you still do not have the ability to send messages, is that because the Send button is missing, or the 'new message' button is missing? If it is the 'new message' button, click view&gt;folders and tick 'folder pane header' to restore it. If the 'send' button is missing from compose window, let me know and I'll provide further info. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

For POP, there is only one download folder, so the spam folder online is not eligible, and the junk folder would not have the feature I mentioned because that feature is not available for POP.

It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  </li><li>  select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  </li><li>  select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. </li><li> if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) </li><li> In settings&gt;composition, set Sending Format to 'automatic' (just my preference, not required) </li></ol> <p>NOTE: if font size is still too small, try a larger number, such as 20. the numbers in thunderbird are points, not pixels. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If it's using IMAP the e-mails never leave MicroSoft's server, unless you delete them, and Thunderbird is only a tool to view them.  If it's set to use POP3 then they are downloaded to your computer and the originals probably deleted.  If there's uncertainty it's best to keep this method as a last resort.  As an aside if your e-mails are on your computer you really should look into how to make backup copies as hard disks can fail and you'd loose the lot. </p><p>I'm on HotMail and here are the settings that work fine for me:— </p><p>Server Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> Port: 993 User Name: &lt;my name&gt;@hotmail.com Connection security:  SSL/TLS Authentication method: OAuth2 </p><p>Now click 'Outgoing Server (SMTP) in the left hand column.
