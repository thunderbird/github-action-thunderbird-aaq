However, we are just users such as yourself, neither developers or employees, but giving of our free time to assist others. If I may offer a suggestion: when posting a problem, the more information you share in post increases the likelihood of a response. For example, knowing POP or IMAP, whether thunderbird was just updated, release version of thunderbird, plus any error messages. Knowing that, a volunteer may be more apt to respond, as the volunteer may have ideas for a possible solution. If you still do not have the ability to send messages, is that because the Send button is missing, or the 'new message' button is missing? If it is the 'new message' button, click view&gt;folders and tick 'folder pane header' to restore it. If the 'send' button is missing from compose window, let me know and I'll provide further info.
