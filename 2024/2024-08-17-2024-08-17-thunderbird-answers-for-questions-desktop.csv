(I just looked it up to get the link and it was closer to 15,  how time flies)  No one read it so it basically lapsed into history, along with the user manuals for just about every other software product on the planet. There is a copy, here but it is very very dated <a href=""https://archive.flossmanuals.net/thunderbird/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.flossmanuals.net/thunderbird/</a> </p><p>Really this forum is a great way to have someone do the searching for you if you can't find what you want.

Anything prior to that can really only be considered a pointer. </p><p>Fundamentally email is a relatively complex topic which for most folk ""just works""  (It is usually not the software than the book of instructions is required for).  It is a more than passing understanding of the IMAP and POP mail protocols and forthcoming will be the Microsoft Exchange proprietary protocol and the highly reliant and basically broken technology used to ""scan"" incoming mail by ""security"" software that generates most of the support noise. </p><p>Finding someone in industry that actually understand mail,  rather than Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook is often something of a challenge.  Microsoft embarked on a very successful ""in education"" product placement, including steep discounts, a generation ago.  Now we are seeing graduates that only know Microsoft,  have never used a non Microsoft product for business office suite use and have little understanding of the the underlying technologies. </p><p>Mail on the whole is not difficult, because it is about matching connection parameters set by the mail provider with those on your machine and after that it ""just works"".

Those would be your message folders.  TO activate the addressbook in thunderbird, click tools&gt;import&gt;importfromafile&gt;importaddressbook&gt;sqlitedatabasefile and then locate and select the discovered abook.sqlite.
