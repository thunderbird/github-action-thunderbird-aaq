It is a more than passing understanding of the IMAP and POP mail protocols and forthcoming will be the Microsoft Exchange proprietary protocol and the highly reliant and basically broken technology used to ""scan"" incoming mail by ""security"" software that generates most of the support noise. </p><p>Finding someone in industry that actually understand mail,  rather than Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook is often something of a challenge.  Microsoft embarked on a very successful ""in education"" product placement, including steep discounts, a generation ago.  Now we are seeing graduates that only know Microsoft,  have never used a non Microsoft product for business office suite use and have little understanding of the the underlying technologies. </p><p>Mail on the whole is not difficult, because it is about matching connection parameters set by the mail provider with those on your machine and after that it ""just works"".

TO activate the addressbook in thunderbird, click tools&gt;import&gt;importfromafile&gt;importaddressbook&gt;sqlitedatabasefile and then locate and select the discovered abook.sqlite.
