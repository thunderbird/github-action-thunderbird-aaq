Both versions are up to date - see the attached screen shots.  In the version running on my desktop (20240114 Win7-Pro TBird 115.6.1 (32-bit).png) the emails appear with columns. This is the format I am used to and which I like. In the version running on my laptop (20240114 Win7-Pro TBird 115.6.1 (64-bit).png) the emails appear in a different format, which takes up a lot more screen space and doesn't let me sort them by columns. I think I made the change myself, but I cannot remember how I did it. I have looked long and hard but unsuccessfully for a way to revert to the column layout. How do I revert to the column layout? Thanks for your advice in advance.

Clients TB 115.6.1 64bit (without addons) Os Win 10 22h2 full updated If I open a mail saved in the network or on the desktop and I open it with thunderbird closed it's open fast as I expect, but If I open it with thunderbird already open it is extremely slow, especially on low budget computers, but this behaviour is noticeable also on high end computers. There are some trick that I can do to avoid this? I've tried also to enable/disable the hardware acceleration if avaiable, without notice any improvement. The only way now to avoid this problem is to open the *.eml with another program if thunderbird is open.

Now I have retired and I want to try again with Thunderbird.  So I downloaded the current version (115.6.1. 64-bit) and installed it.  I find that it remembers my previous account settings, and over a thousand contact details, which I no longer need (or want) now that I have stopped working.  It is also looking for work email accounts which no longer exist.  I assume that Thunderbird archived all these data in a folder somewhere on my PC when I uninstalled it years ago.  Now I would like to get rid of these settings, account details and contacts, and return Thunderbird to its out-of-the-box settings so that I can start again from scratch.  Is there a quick and easy way to do this, without affecting any other systems on my PC? </p><p>Thanks all. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1630489;1630492;1630497;,olivermoffatt
