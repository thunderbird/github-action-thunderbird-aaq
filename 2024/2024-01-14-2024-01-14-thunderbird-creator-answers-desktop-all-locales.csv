Just a blank page. I don't have a backup. How can I resolve this issue? Tried the troubleshooting mode, but didn't help. I've been using TB since 2006, and have thousands of emails in my profile, so can't just create a new profile. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1630433;1630469;,kenyo1229

Both versions are up to date - see the attached screen shots.  In the version running on my desktop (20240114 Win7-Pro TBird 115.6.1 (32-bit).png) the emails appear with columns. This is the format I am used to and which I like. In the version running on my laptop (20240114 Win7-Pro TBird 115.6.1 (64-bit).png) the emails appear in a different format, which takes up a lot more screen space and doesn't let me sort them by columns. I think I made the change myself, but I cannot remember how I did it. I have looked long and hard but unsuccessfully for a way to revert to the column layout. How do I revert to the column layout? Thanks for your advice in advance.
