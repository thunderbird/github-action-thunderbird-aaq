Found the global-messages-db.sqlite file going to my Library Folder and finding it in the Thunderbird folder and deleted it after closing Thunderbird.  Waited a few mins, opened it back up and waited a few mins before doing a search. </p><p>But again anything that is IMAP it can find fine through a server search, but unfortunately Local Folder searching still broken and nothing showing up. </p>",museionmusei,false,0,0

If the sending address is in the address book and it is selected for white listing,  then Thunderbird will not classify mail from that address as junk. </p><p>What the folk over at Microsoft do with hotmail I have no idea. I gave up trying to understand their machinations years ago. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Some have settings to allow bypassing email, and that should be pursued to prevent this happening again. The free Windows Defender (as of Win 10 and 11) does not cause the interruption. Now, on your problem, are you seeing any error messages? Can you receive messages? If seeing error messages, please post exactly what is in the message. Also, can you post a screenshot of the SMTP server settings? That is viewable at 'account settings' and scroll down left side to 'Outgoing servers (SMTP).  Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Try this:  - highlight the inbox  - click view&gt;sort by and tick 'unthreaded' (if menu bar isn't visible, click alt key)  - OR, click the icon to right of 'quick filter' above message list pane and click sort by unthreaded there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you use that small icon on right side of tool bar (called the hamburger menu), select view&gt;layout and tick classic. If that isn't visible, you can click the alt key to display the menu bar and from there you can select View&gt;layout and make your selection. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
