I try to get other advices before submitting a bug from my point of view. </p><p>Actually, yes I had to use an addon to get the feature ""minimize to tray on close"". It is named FireTray.

OK, lets say it is not due to TB, despite the best would be that it has natively this feature. &nbsp;:-) </p><p>In the other hand, I'm afraid I will have to live with this problem because I need that feature, to save room in my taskbar, and I cannot close &amp; reopen everytime, considering the starting time (a dozen seconds to wake the server and update) due to Lightning. &nbsp;:-( </p><p>But with the addon disabled, I could reproduce the behavior of getting a duplicate window by clicking on the calendar tab on the fly, with the mouse not static.

For ""resident"" applications, when dismissed, I prefer not to have them in the main taskbar and in the background of the screen. Then minimizing to a small icon in the tray on the right is interesting. They ""disappear"" with only that icon remaining. It displays the count of unread messages. </p><p>More interesting is that the program does not really close if you have the standard reflex of hitting the close icon, what would imply the long starting time (up to a dozen seconds) when you need it again, which is frequent with emails and calendar. In order to really close it, you need to use the menu Quit. </p><p><strong>But the major interest is that the alerts from the calendar work when it is running, not if it is closed&nbsp;!</strong> So for me it must run permanently, and hidden when I do something else. </p><p>I use Thunderbird on Linux Mint, but it must behave the same on Windows.
