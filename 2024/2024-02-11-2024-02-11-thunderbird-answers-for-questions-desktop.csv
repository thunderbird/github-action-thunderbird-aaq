If the sending address is in the address book and it is selected for white listing,  then Thunderbird will not classify mail from that address as junk. </p><p>What the folk over at Microsoft do with hotmail I have no idea. I gave up trying to understand their machinations years ago. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If so, I suggest retesting with the addon disabled to verify exactly what is not working properly.

If this is a feature request, it should be posted at <a href=""http://connect.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">connect.mozilla.org</a>. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Some have settings to allow bypassing email, and that should be pursued to prevent this happening again. The free Windows Defender (as of Win 10 and 11) does not cause the interruption. Now, on your problem, are you seeing any error messages? Can you receive messages? If seeing error messages, please post exactly what is in the message. Also, can you post a screenshot of the SMTP server settings? That is viewable at 'account settings' and scroll down left side to 'Outgoing servers (SMTP).  Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
