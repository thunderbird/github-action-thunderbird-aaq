The history file contains addresses optionally copied when sending messages. The other abooks are subsets and recreated as you add contact lists and they are then identified by the prefs.js file. The base are the two files I mentioned.

Since your profile is in a non-typical location, I suggest this strategy: - exit TB  (this is IMPORTANT) - copy c:\users\rhhut\New TB Profile...    to external drive  - for easy restore after full TB install, also copy  - c:\users\rhhit\appdata\roaming\Thunderbird   (because the file that tells TB where the profile is is there)  (Note: the old profiles at ... appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles are no longer needed and can be removed if desired)  THEN, if a full restore is needed: - install TB and exit - copy the New TB Profile..   to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;  - copy the backed-up Thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming  to replace the thunderbird folder created by the TB install - start TB and all should be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
