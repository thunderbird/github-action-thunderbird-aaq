I try to get other advices before submitting a bug from my point of view. </p><p>Actually, yes I had to use an addon to get the feature ""minimize to tray on close"". It is named FireTray.

For ""resident"" applications, when dismissed, I prefer not to have them in the main taskbar and in the background of the screen. Then minimizing to a small icon in the tray on the right is interesting. They ""disappear"" with only that icon remaining. It displays the count of unread messages. </p><p>More interesting is that the program does not really close if you have the standard reflex of hitting the close icon, what would imply the long starting time (up to a dozen seconds) when you need it again, which is frequent with emails and calendar. In order to really close it, you need to use the menu Quit. </p><p><strong>But the major interest is that the alerts from the calendar work when it is running, not if it is closed&nbsp;!</strong> So for me it must run permanently, and hidden when I do something else. </p><p>I use Thunderbird on Linux Mint, but it must behave the same on Windows.
