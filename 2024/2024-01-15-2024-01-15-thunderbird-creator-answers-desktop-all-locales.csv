After pressing Next, the same page opened in Firefox, and after selecting my account there and pressing Next, I simply got a generic page with the title ""500.

I can access Gmail through Firefox without problem, and my Gmail account worked just fine yesterday with Thunderbird.

However, I have noticed that in the latest Thunderbird version (I'm using 115.6.1) the Compact folder starts automatically compacting all subfolders under the current one. This is a big problem for me: under the inbox, which I need to compact fairly often because all messages pass through it, I have literally hundreds of subfolders, some of them dating from more than 20 years ago, when I used Netscape Communicator. Those folders are ""read only"" (I only have them for reference), and I do not want to modify them in any way, to avoid risking their contents. Thus, I DO NEED for Thunderbird to stop compacting subfolders automatically. Is it possible? How can it be done? </p><p>Also, after a folder compacting has started, what's the best way of cancelling it, short of closing Thunderbird? I understand that the compaction process is quite safe, as it copies all data to a fresh file, but would rather not risk data loss. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,es,"",ajgelado

All goes well until the final phase when it tries to validate the password.  The final message says ""Unable to log in at server.

I've changed passwords, checked, re-checked, verified, checked re-checked and re-verified the domain's POP3 and SMTP server names and port addresses all to no avail.

Also, I can't log in to some accounts because the companies use 2-step authentication that involves sending codes to my email addresses instead of codes texted to my phone.  This has reached near crisis proportions as I cannot reach those companies except online which requires 2-step authentication using those email addresses that I cannot set up again in Thunderbird. </p><p>I'm willing to take screenshots at each step if that will be helpful.  I'm afraid that I've dealt with the problem for so long that I'm making the same mistake repeatedly but not recognizing that I'm doing so. </p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1630582;,rabbithutch1

After the upgrade, which obliterated my hard drive of several important things, I am reinstalling TB. I always used an NAS directory for Thunderbird, and have email records going back nearly twenty years.  I installed TB 115 and have tried several ways to get it to recognize my profile directory on the NAS to no avail. I tried copying data into the default directory the 115 install is looking at. The about:profiles shows it is looking in the correct directory, it produces a parent.lock file in that directory when I run the program. It does not give me my email, or contacts. I do not use the calendar or to-do lists. </p><p>My system is an AMD K6-6400K with 16 GB and a 500 GB drive. Though programs are loaded on the drive ALL data is stored in an NAS. There is about 375 GB available on the C drive. </p><p>I have used the cmd line to pull up profile manager, added a profile, pointed it to the data that is on the NAS, a parent lock file is created there too but it shows me no mail.  </p><p>I have edited the profiles.ini file manually to have the program look at the directories, both the NAS and a local directory which has had the old files entered. Neither worked. </p><p>I tried opening TB and creating a new profile and pre-loading the info there, nothing. I've been at this for days now.  I have uninstalled and removed manually all TB folders and reinstalled older versions to give that a go but without effect.  I am no Luddite (Many years ago I owned a system integration, assembly and install company doing networking for the military as a civilian contractor.) but someone has to explain this to me like I am a five year old. There is no reason having my email back should be this difficult! </p><p>PLEASE give me a hand? </p><p>My TB directory appears in C:\Users\owner\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird My old data folder was on a network drive at M:\Users\owner\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\profiles\k5zbs5az.default When I manually enter the M: address in the profiles.ini file, it ""corrects"" it to C:\Users\owner\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\ even though the switch 'relative' is off. </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/zpfeu8eu.default Default=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-beta IsRelative=0 Path=C:\Users\owner\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=0 Version=2 </p><p>[Install5D388C1349709B37] Default=C:\Users\owner\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Locked=1 </p><p>Running the Mozilla application with a specific profile using command line arguments brings up the program but no mail.

Thunderbird on both of these computers is the 32-bit version and kept up to date (version 115.6.1). I know how to point Thunderbird to use the profile on the USB drive via the profiles.ini configuration. Recently, I bought a new desktop computer and downloaded Thunderbird from the download web page. UNBEKNOWNST TO ME it downloaded the 64-bit version without giving me a notice or a choice. I edited the profile.ini file to point to the profile on the USB drive and it did not work well. The calendars were disabled, no mail folders appeared and no email accounts appeared. My contacts were OK. So, I shut down the new desktop and I put the USB drive in my old desktop, ran the 32-bit Thunderbird and it now looked as dysfunctional as it did on 64-bit Thunderbird. Ooof. Dead in the water.  </p><p>Fortunately I had a 2-month old backup and restored that profile after renaming the damaged profile folder on the USB hard drive. I then copied over the mail folders from the damaged folder to the restored profile folder so I would have all the latest mail. I also copied over any files in the main folder of the damaged profile that had not been changed by the 64-bit program on the new desktop computer. Fortunately, when I ran 32-bit Thunderbird, all my email from the last 2 months was there. Some recent calendar entries were missing and I had to redo the POP protocol for one of my 5 email accounts I manage with Thunderbird as I did a couple weeks ago. Yay! I immediately backed up the USB hard drive. </p><p>So, any clue why this happened? I am planning to make a test on the new desktop. I uninstalled the 64-bit version and installed the 32-bit version. I am going to restore the 32-bit profile folder from the backup to a USB stick with just the profile folder to see if it works as it does on my old desktop and laptop by just editing profile.ini (and installs.ini) as it is on those two systems. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",raymond.pilch
