After pressing Next, the same page opened in Firefox, and after selecting my account there and pressing Next, I simply got a generic page with the title ""500. That's an error"" and a simple text asking me to try again later. No matter what I do, even trying different browsers, the result is the same. I can access Gmail through Firefox without problem, and my Gmail account worked just fine yesterday with Thunderbird. I have not changed Thunderbird's configuration for months, and OAuth2 authentication has worked without problem since I activated it back in 2022. What can I do? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,es,"",ajgelado

When I send an email to someone, in the Sent folder it inaccurately reports who the email has been sent to. Usually, it says the email has been send to the previous person I've emailed, even though it hasn't. Can you help in fixing this? </p><p>I have attached a screenshot illustrating the issue.  </p><p>Many thanks in advance </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Fuffyfuffy

However, I have noticed that in the latest Thunderbird version (I'm using 115.6.1) the Compact folder starts automatically compacting all subfolders under the current one. This is a big problem for me: under the inbox, which I need to compact fairly often because all messages pass through it, I have literally hundreds of subfolders, some of them dating from more than 20 years ago, when I used Netscape Communicator. Those folders are ""read only"" (I only have them for reference), and I do not want to modify them in any way, to avoid risking their contents. Thus, I DO NEED for Thunderbird to stop compacting subfolders automatically. Is it possible? How can it be done? </p><p>Also, after a folder compacting has started, what's the best way of cancelling it, short of closing Thunderbird? I understand that the compaction process is quite safe, as it copies all data to a fresh file, but would rather not risk data loss. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,es,"",ajgelado
