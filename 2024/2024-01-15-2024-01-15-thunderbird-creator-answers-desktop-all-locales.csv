After pressing Next, the same page opened in Firefox, and after selecting my account there and pressing Next, I simply got a generic page with the title ""500. That's an error"" and a simple text asking me to try again later. No matter what I do, even trying different browsers, the result is the same. I can access Gmail through Firefox without problem, and my Gmail account worked just fine yesterday with Thunderbird. I have not changed Thunderbird's configuration for months, and OAuth2 authentication has worked without problem since I activated it back in 2022. What can I do? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,es,"",ajgelado

When I send an email to someone, in the Sent folder it inaccurately reports who the email has been sent to. Usually, it says the email has been send to the previous person I've emailed, even though it hasn't. Can you help in fixing this? </p><p>I have attached a screenshot illustrating the issue.  </p><p>Many thanks in advance </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Fuffyfuffy

However, I have noticed that in the latest Thunderbird version (I'm using 115.6.1) the Compact folder starts automatically compacting all subfolders under the current one. This is a big problem for me: under the inbox, which I need to compact fairly often because all messages pass through it, I have literally hundreds of subfolders, some of them dating from more than 20 years ago, when I used Netscape Communicator. Those folders are ""read only"" (I only have them for reference), and I do not want to modify them in any way, to avoid risking their contents. Thus, I DO NEED for Thunderbird to stop compacting subfolders automatically. Is it possible? How can it be done? </p><p>Also, after a folder compacting has started, what's the best way of cancelling it, short of closing Thunderbird? I understand that the compaction process is quite safe, as it copies all data to a fresh file, but would rather not risk data loss. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,es,"",ajgelado

I managed to drop them in the process of going to version 115; I don't know how but I did. </p><p>Now when I try to add them back I can get through the process (Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Actions &gt; Add E-Mail Account) and enter the user name, email address, and mail server names and port settings for the various domains I use.  All goes well until the final phase when it tries to validate the password.  The final message says ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" </p><p>I've done everything I know to do to fix this.  I've changed passwords, checked, re-checked, verified, checked re-checked and re-verified the domain's POP3 and SMTP server names and port addresses all to no avail.  I'm having trouble with my ISP's (grandecommunications purchased by Astound Communications)  support on issues with email addresses that use their domain (@mygrande.net) but I'm also having the same problem with gmail domain (@gmail.com) addresses. </p><p>I would abandon the email addresses if it weren't for the fact that some of the email on servers is critical and needs to be downloaded to my system.  Also, I can't log in to some accounts because the companies use 2-step authentication that involves sending codes to my email addresses instead of codes texted to my phone.  This has reached near crisis proportions as I cannot reach those companies except online which requires 2-step authentication using those email addresses that I cannot set up again in Thunderbird. </p><p>I'm willing to take screenshots at each step if that will be helpful.  I'm afraid that I've dealt with the problem for so long that I'm making the same mistake repeatedly but not recognizing that I'm doing so. </p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1630582;,rabbithutch1
