However, I have noticed that in the latest Thunderbird version (I'm using 115.6.1) the Compact folder starts automatically compacting all subfolders under the current one. This is a big problem for me: under the inbox, which I need to compact fairly often because all messages pass through it, I have literally hundreds of subfolders, some of them dating from more than 20 years ago, when I used Netscape Communicator. Those folders are ""read only"" (I only have them for reference), and I do not want to modify them in any way, to avoid risking their contents. Thus, I DO NEED for Thunderbird to stop compacting subfolders automatically. Is it possible? How can it be done? </p><p>Also, after a folder compacting has started, what's the best way of cancelling it, short of closing Thunderbird? I understand that the compaction process is quite safe, as it copies all data to a fresh file, but would rather not risk data loss. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,es,1631872;1631880;1631885;1631890;1632086;,ajgelado

Also, I can't log in to some accounts because the companies use 2-step authentication that involves sending codes to my email addresses instead of codes texted to my phone.  This has reached near crisis proportions as I cannot reach those companies except online which requires 2-step authentication using those email addresses that I cannot set up again in Thunderbird. </p><p>I'm willing to take screenshots at each step if that will be helpful.

I installed TB 115 and have tried several ways to get it to recognize my profile directory on the NAS to no avail. I tried copying data into the default directory the 115 install is looking at. The about:profiles shows it is looking in the correct directory, it produces a parent.lock file in that directory when I run the program. It does not give me my email, or contacts. I do not use the calendar or to-do lists. </p><p>My system is an AMD K6-6400K with 16 GB and a 500 GB drive. Though programs are loaded on the drive ALL data is stored in an NAS.

Thunderbird on both of these computers is the 32-bit version and kept up to date (version 115.6.1). I know how to point Thunderbird to use the profile on the USB drive via the profiles.ini configuration. Recently, I bought a new desktop computer and downloaded Thunderbird from the download web page. UNBEKNOWNST TO ME it downloaded the 64-bit version without giving me a notice or a choice. I edited the profile.ini file to point to the profile on the USB drive and it did not work well. The calendars were disabled, no mail folders appeared and no email accounts appeared. My contacts were OK. So, I shut down the new desktop and I put the USB drive in my old desktop, ran the 32-bit Thunderbird and it now looked as dysfunctional as it did on 64-bit Thunderbird. Ooof. Dead in the water.  </p><p>Fortunately I had a 2-month old backup and restored that profile after renaming the damaged profile folder on the USB hard drive. I then copied over the mail folders from the damaged folder to the restored profile folder so I would have all the latest mail. I also copied over any files in the main folder of the damaged profile that had not been changed by the 64-bit program on the new desktop computer. Fortunately, when I ran 32-bit Thunderbird, all my email from the last 2 months was there. Some recent calendar entries were missing and I had to redo the POP protocol for one of my 5 email accounts I manage with Thunderbird as I did a couple weeks ago. Yay! I immediately backed up the USB hard drive. </p><p>So, any clue why this happened? I am planning to make a test on the new desktop. I uninstalled the 64-bit version and installed the 32-bit version. I am going to restore the 32-bit profile folder from the backup to a USB stick with just the profile folder to see if it works as it does on my old desktop and laptop by just editing profile.ini (and installs.ini) as it is on those two systems. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1630755;,raymond.pilch
