Right-click on a desktop icon to see where each is stored. If in program files (x86), that would be a 32-bit version. Is one a beta? what are their release numbers (click help&gt;about to see that). Some installs might accidentally uninstall both. If one is running the version you want, I would just go into Windows file explorer and delete the one not wanted. That sends it to the recycle bin. Start thunderbird and if all is working -- which I expect, you're done. If not, you may have deleted the wrong one. In recycle bin, just click to restore and start over. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
