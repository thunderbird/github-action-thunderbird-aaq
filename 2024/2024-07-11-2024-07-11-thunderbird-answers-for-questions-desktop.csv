So your settings for Yahoo or even Gmail have no relevance to what Microsoft decide is their requirement.   </p><p>This is the settings Thunderbird will use for outlook domains. <a href=""https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/hotmail.com</a> </p><p>Now to the important part of this.  You have two accounts with Outlook for every mail address.  One to receive mail,  which will be an IMAP or POP account unless you use the OWL addon.  The other will be an outgoing account and it will use the port 587.  Your incoming account will use port 993 or 005 depending on if it is IMAP or POP.  I know you probably find all this confusing,  but setting up a mail client is an exercise in copying what the provider tells you to use,  not creative guessing. </p><p>Most folk that have issues setting up account with outlook have issues with their antivirus causing the process to fail. I use windows defender which has few components that mess with mail.  Third party antivirus products have spam, scam and advanced threat detection,  which means generally it is that far integrated in the download process that when it fails,  everything fails.  I do not have that sort of product and have no issue.  I also do not use a VPN which is another prime cause of mail download failures. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
