While it may be something odd in the way Thunderbird or the addon implements caldav that is only affects the desktop application would indicate that the problem is there. It would also be super handy if the well resourced Apple folk told you,  and us via you, what the problem was with the Thunderbird contacts so a bug could be filed for Thunderbird if that was the appropriate action. </p><p>When I googled this I kept getting references to something called groups/labels and it is quite probable that Thunderbird does not use one of the groups you have subscribed in your contact app.  Perhaps not even allocating one as Thunderbird has address books, not contact groups. I notice that the specification has there proprietary fields for company names,  and knowing how apple like to get their name out there,  it may be the desktop is looking for some apple code in the type  Somewhere like the namespace which is normally blank <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350#section-10.2.3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350#section-10.2.3</a> </p><p>Based on this <a href=""https://github.com/jobisoft/DAV-4-TbSync/issues/299"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jobisoft/DAV-4-TbSync/issues/299</a> it would appear that all syncing is actually done by Thunderbird natively, and not by the addon so this is not a case of you are using an addon,  so it is a problem with the addon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

While you don't have addons it disables more than that.  It has also, for reasons that defy me, fixed problems permanently.  Or so folk have reported. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
