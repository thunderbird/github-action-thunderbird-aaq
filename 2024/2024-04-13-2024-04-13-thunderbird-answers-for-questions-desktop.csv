I want to bring the local folders from the old computer into the local folders on the new one. </p><pre>    History:  For years the email,   ***@rochester.rr.com    (always used TB), got so many scam emails coming in that I only looked at it once in a while.  I was getting up to hundreds of emails a day, 99% were junk.  About a year ago I bought the new computer and put TB on it and used my email on that, generating new local folders. I just retired and finally have time to address this.  I want to merge the local folders from the old computer into the new one.     More info:  On each computer I sorted all emails by Correspondents, so I could get rid of pages of junk at a  time.  Once I had gone through about 65,000 emails, I was able to stash what was left in designated local folders.  This cleared out the inbox, and now I can easily clear it out day by day.  I did get a new email, </pre> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>@yahoo.com,   and added that to TB on my new computer.  Soon I want to close the old email (and stop paying for it), but need to combine the local folders  on the new computer to sort/purge them. </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <pre>    Let me know if you need anything else     Thanks, Bob </pre>",bput71,false,0,0

Then, create a filter to move the folder contents to the imap folder . the filter slows the process and minimizes loss. be sure to check when done for possible lost messages, as IMAP was not designed for large uploads. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

But like a load of government regulation,  their definition may be so laissez-faire as to be useless,  or so tight as to require a printed copy on archive paper and bound in velum for storage in the doomsday vault. (Even though they are not seeds) </p><p>So I guess I pop into lecture mode to try and illustrate some of the issues around your request.  I also hope to provide enough information that you can make a decision. </p><p>First there are some jurisdictional issues.   I am aware that most on this forum are from North America with a good sprinkling of those from the UK,  personally I am from Australia and have to deal with my own national and state archival laws. </p><p>The US government maintains a registered of data formats and their special requirement for reading.  The one for Thunderbird native MBOX format is here. <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000383.shtml#sustainability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000383.shtml#sustainability</a>  I do not know if the Smithsonian using a conversion to MBOX in their archival process is a good thing for your ""easy to access"" of not.  But to put a more global twist on it the UK national archives have this to say <a href=""https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/720"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/720</a>  I should also perhaps point out that an MBOX file is basically a load of EML file stacked one after the other.  EML being the native format of many email programs over the years when saving individual email to disk,  not the least of which was the venerable outlook express. </p><p>So fundamentally I am suggesting that the native file format is actually readily understood and convenient in many places and for long term archival purposes.  But it might not satisfy someone that only understands Outlook for email and Microsoft Word formats for electronic storage. </p><p>Thunderbird does have an addon, the <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">importExportToolNG</a>  This tool can make sort work of exporting the contents of a folder to a number of, what I would consider common, file formats,  but some really do not lend them selves to email.  Especially if there are attachments involved. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-04-12-23-44-14-0e9869.png""> </p><p>This image is from the import export tools menu and as you can see there are to common PDF,  which almost everyone jumps at.  Supposedly secure (unless you have acrobat to edit it), easy to read and commonly understood.  But if the topic of the email was an attachment... nothing is saved about that.  Basically most of the ""non email"" formats make copies that are the same as a printed copy.  So no forensic details that might be required for litigation for instance. </p><p>For this reason I recommend EML (one file per email) or MBOX one folder of email stored together as this can be simply imported and exported from email programs everywhere (except maybe Microsoft) and at a technical level do not modify the archived email in any way.  </p><p>But does that help or hinder,  I really have no idea, as I have no idea what ""easy to access"" means to the person that is requiring it. My local progress society still prints everything and attaches it to the minutes as correspondence. Anything else that say is just not allowed. As correspondence for the last 100 years is stored somewhere in someones shed an passed from secretary to secretary, it may be useful so some local historian one day, if the silverfish do not eat it first. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

While it may be something odd in the way Thunderbird or the addon implements caldav that is only affects the desktop application would indicate that the problem is there. It would also be super handy if the well resourced Apple folk told you,  and us via you, what the problem was with the Thunderbird contacts so a bug could be filed for Thunderbird if that was the appropriate action. </p><p>When I googled this I kept getting references to something called groups/labels and it is quite probable that Thunderbird does not use one of the groups you have subscribed in your contact app.  Perhaps not even allocating one as Thunderbird has address books, not contact groups. I notice that the specification has there proprietary fields for company names,  and knowing how apple like to get their name out there,  it may be the desktop is looking for some apple code in the type  Somewhere like the namespace which is normally blank <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350#section-10.2.3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350#section-10.2.3</a> </p><p>Based on this <a href=""https://github.com/jobisoft/DAV-4-TbSync/issues/299"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jobisoft/DAV-4-TbSync/issues/299</a> it would appear that all syncing is actually done by Thunderbird natively, and not by the addon so this is not a case of you are using an addon,  so it is a problem with the addon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Because there was no obvious answer, we tried setting up a new User to see if that overcame the problem - but with the same result. I requested that the problem be submitted to Apple Technical Support and he assured me that that would be done. Whilst we were screen sharing he was also researching his data base but with no answers. He stated that in his quick search of Mozilla/Thunderbird it appeared that Thunderbird may have some different 'format' options for the entries (my non-technical words) and that a different format might solve the problem. I could not see how to access these options.  This is similar to your comments regarding proprietary fields.  However the new address entries I created in Thunderbird were only test entries with a name - all other fields were usually left blank. This does not necessarily mean that the Apple Desktop app was being confused by the Thunderbird field versions even though they were blank. I do not have groups in any of my Address/Contacts apps so that will not be a cause. Many thanks for your response. </p>",harlin1,false,0,0

Spectrum have significantly tightened their requirements around sending mail.  Now you will need to have one Outgoing server (SMTP) configured for each incoming account and each identity (the settings above incoming server for your account) will need to specify an SMTP server that uses the same authentication (user name) as the incoming account.  Your non spectrum/twc email accounts can not send mail from spectrum servers.  You will need to use whatever outgoing server is provided with those accounts.  This an exact reverse of the historical situation where your provider <strong>required </strong>you to send using their servers and comes as quite a shock to long term customers that battled with sending under the old policies. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
