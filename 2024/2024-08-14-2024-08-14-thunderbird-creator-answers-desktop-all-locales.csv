If the user clicks on an email between those dates the message pane shows the from, to and subject of the last email he was able to view, not the correct information, and the message is not displayed.   The problem first occurred on 8/1 (don't know what caused it then) and on 8/14 after user opened a Word document attached to an email and printed it.  At both times he was running 128.0, and a subsequent update to 128.1 didn't resolve the issue.   Repairing the folder on 8/1 appears to have deleted all the messages that would not display, this is confirmed by a reduction in the byte size of the inbox.  On 8/14 I copied the inbox (but not the .msf) to local folders, when I opened it the .msf was built with 0 bytes and the ""problem"" messages were not displayed although this time the byte size of the inbox didn't change.

The headers with the recipient names and subject were fine. Just nothing in the message pane, and also there were no attachments that had I sent to some of the recipients. In a internet search of similar problems in a  previous Thunderbird forum, one person advised to right click the problem folder and then click ""repair"". After doing that and restarting the program, I was now shocked to discover that my latest ""Sent"" emails going back a couple of years were now completely missing. I opened every one of my various folders but could not find those missing ""Sent"" messages anywhere. Even  files that ""sent"" folder that I had moved to other folders the past couple of days did not have any content in their message pane. However, my messages that I sent today were fine. My PC is an HP with Windows 10. My internet provider is Comcast, and I have used Thunderbird for many years as my email client with no problems - until now. The missing ""sent"" emails are all business emails that I sent to various clients, so I would really like to get them back if possible. BTW, my PC did an automatic hard shutdown during the night for what I think was for maintenance and to load some Windows updates. Therefore, I had to do a full start-up this morning.
