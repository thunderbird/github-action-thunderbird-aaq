Most grateful for assistance to finally get rid of these phantom folders. </p><p>Problem: Multiple folders in an IMAP account that simply will not delete. </p><p>Symptom: Folder exists in an IMAP account that has all folders as sub-folders under Inbox. Some folders are empty and appear greyed out and italicized. Deleting them sends them to the Deleted folder (or if the appropriate setting is changed, to be immediately deleted). Emptying the Deleted folder appears to get rid of the deleted folders, but restart and they reappear. </p><p>Attempted Fixes: As suggested in various places, have tried these things, none of which work: </p> <ul><li> Immediate delete (setting and also simply deleting in the Deleted folder) </li><li> Creating a new folder of a different name and renaming it to the affected folder, then deleting -- would not rename new folder, and phantom folder remained </li><li> Completely removing the account (settings and data) and recreating </li></ul> <p>Other Actions: I have checked the actual IMAP account via a webmail interface and none of the folders exist in the account. </p><p>Configuration: </p><pre> Application Basics </pre> <pre>   Name: Thunderbird    Version: 128.1.0esr    Build ID: 20240730200333    Distribution ID: </pre> <pre>   Update Channel: esr    User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/128.1.0    OS: Windows_NT 10.0 19045    OS Theme: </pre> <pre>   Launcher Process: Enabled    Multiprocess Windows: 0/0    Fission Windows: 0/0              Enabled by default    Remote Processes: 1    Enterprise Policies: Inactive    Google Location Service Key: Missing    Google Safebrowsing Key: Missing    Mozilla Location Service Key: Missing    Safe Mode: false    Memory Size (RAM): 31.9 GB    Disk Space Available: 50.5 GB </pre> <pre> Mail and News Accounts </pre> <pre> ... 13 unrelated accounts remove ... </pre> <pre>   account14 (mail server name changed):      INCOMING: account14, , (imap) mail.xxx.yyy:993, SSL, 3      OUTGOING: , mail.xxx.yyy:465, SSL, 3, true </pre> <pre> Libraries </pre> <pre>     Library      Status      Expected minimum version      Version in use      Path </pre> <pre>       RNP (OpenPGP)        OK        0.17.1        0.17.1.MZLA.128.1.0esr.botan        C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\rnp.dll </pre> <pre>       OTR        Failed to load.

Usually, after a few minutes things settle down, the messages come through and all is well but it is a nuisance. I would switch to using Outlook but it cannot send multiple emails which I periodically need to do and I don't want to encourage Microsoft's near monopoly of computer technology.  </p><p>I have tried accepting coookies as advised elsewhere in here and tried turning on O Oath as my authentication method but this just got me another error message saying this authentication ""was not supported on this platform"" (whatever that means??) Anyway, I reverted to using ""simple password"" which does eventually work. </p><p>I looked at 2 factor authentication but that proved to be impossible to understand and, in any case, I rarely carry a 'phone with me and do not want to clutter my 'phone up with more apps. I use 2 factor authentication on a lot of my confidential accounts and none of these were as complicated to set up as this one and certainly did not invole scanning QR codes and installing special apps.  </p><p>Will this bug be fixed by more updates to Thunderbird or is there some other way of solving this problem. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",colrose.b
