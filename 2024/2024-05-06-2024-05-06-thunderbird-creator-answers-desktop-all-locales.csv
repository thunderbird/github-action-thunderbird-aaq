This also happens if I use the menu bar Insert -&gt; Links... </p><p>All other Thunderbird windows remain functioning, and I can effectively continue working, but the frozen draft window will remain on screen until closed through Task Manager. </p><p>This only happens when creating a Link, not inserting other objects, like an Image. This problem also does not happen with Thunderbird on Ubuntu. </p><p>I am running version 115.10.1. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any tips that could be of help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",KI89
