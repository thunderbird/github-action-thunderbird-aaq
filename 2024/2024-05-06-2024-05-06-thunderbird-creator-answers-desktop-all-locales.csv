When starting Thunderbird it comes up with three almost empty windows, one over the other. No data is filled in and when clicking on the window it says in the upper left corner: Starting page - Modzilla Thunderbird (no response) / (actually in German) Startseite - Modzilla Thunderbird (Keine Rückmeldung). The small login popup is also seen in the window but doesn't accept any typing and shows also 'Keine Rückmeldung / no response'. I can only stop the process on Windows level. I would be very grateful if you could help me with this issue. I cannot get to my emails anymore.

This was done to several extensions which are not marked as incompatible including ""NestedQuote Remover"" and ""Unmangle Outlook Safelinks"". Removing and uninstalling them solves nothing. Indeed, the button to install from the market does not work. I had to save to and then install from a local file to test this. </p><p>I am not in trouble-shooting mode, but I have found that ""Load Temporary Add-on"" in debugging works for the current session. </p><p>(I tried searching Google and this forum to no avail.... only turning up irrelevant thread  about older versions, Firefox etc.) </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1651602;1651604;,belg4mit
