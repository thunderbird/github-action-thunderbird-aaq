I have read so many threads about Band-Aid solutions for this as it seems to be a well established problem - so come one TB- solve it so it doesn't happen!! <strong>Anyway these are the solutions that have worked best for me </strong> </p> <ol><li> Use the <strong>esc key</strong> when your email freezes - this unfreezes the email instead of having to force close thunderbird - and then you can chose to paste the http link instead of insert. </li><li> If you have two screens  - <strong>move your email to the opposite screen </strong> and try again - I found that the link screen dialogue box seems to have a preferred space between itself and the email (so incongruous) </li><li> Click Alt+spacebar to open the move dialogue box which allows you to move the email and sometime reset the location of the link dialogue box </li><li> Turn off hardware acceleration in settings general (at the bottom) </li><li> close thunderbird and open in safe mode by holding shift whist clicking TB.  at the prompt: 'Reset toolbars &amp; controls', 'Make changes &amp; restart'.  </li></ol> <p>But this should not be an ongoing problem - its super annoying and needs to be addressed </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",leanne3
