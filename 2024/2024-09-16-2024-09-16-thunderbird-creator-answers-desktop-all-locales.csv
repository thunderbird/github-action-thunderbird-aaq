When I started Thunderbird, my main e-mail has the subject matter, date and time, but doesn't display the message. All my other e-mail identities are unaffected. All e-mails from previous dates are displayed properly. New messages today are displayed correctly. I tried to forward one of the messages to another address, and it came out blank. I tried starting  it in Troubleshooting mode, but it made absolutely no difference. How do I view the messages? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1674783;1674791;,lowellmorton

Everything looks right; choosing continue takes me to Xfinity logon page. With proper username ( and third party app allowed in Comcast settings). it then shows the ""Let's Go"" button. Clicking that results in an ACCESS DENIED/permission issue to the server. Using another browser (including FF) lets me log in fine. Spent 2 hours with Xfinity support who claimed to have made some account adjustments that ultimately did nothing. Would like to be able to add Xfinity account to Thunderbird ( I do have latest version). Thoughts and advice appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",Rivergoat

I am now on version 115.15.0. Suddenly today the performance of the UI is abysmal. Even selecting a different folder to view in the navigation pane can take over a minute to complete.

When it does show something, it is usually indexing an inbox, but I have 5 accounts with inboxes, so this is no help. How can I see which inbox is being indexed? Some posts say that there should be a pause button in the Activity Monitor for the indexing activity, but I don't see any such thing.
