I removed all passwords from Thunderbird to see if it was conflicting with the new password and it still did not work. So, I removed the account entirely to start from scratch and when I went to add the account back into Thunderbird it had a problem. It gives me an error message: ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password.""  </p><p>I have made sure the email address and password are correct so I am not sure what other configuration to use. I tried both IMAP and POP and neither would allow me to set up the account. Any suggestions? </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",Ronnie

The Sept 15 email starts on Sept 15 and has a few messages with the same subject concluding with one today, Sept 16.  Would like to have that sorted as Sept 16, not Sept 15.

Replacing the text with lines and lines of numbers and letters, 2. Removing the ""From"" and ""Subject"" lines and the message, leaving the message blank, BUT adding an attachment that has nothing to do with the recipient; 3. Sending some sent messages to trash after I have tagged them. I use emails like a paper trail, to check, to see if there are any emails I am still waiting to hear an answer back on, etc. Thunderbird has been my favorite email client since I was first told about it.
