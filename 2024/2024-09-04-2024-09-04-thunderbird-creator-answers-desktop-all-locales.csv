I have no spam filters set in thunderbird or the email acct. I worked with the email account support and verified that it is not the Account email doing it. If I log in directly to the email account messages are handled correctly. As soon as i open thunderbird it moves inbox msgs dated  08/30/24 and later to the spam folder. HELP, please </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",wplachy

Each time they asked for a donation when installed, I contributed because Thunderbird is an awesome platform to use. I am in electronic security field, and have to use legacy software for older platforms I have out there, as I have been in this field for 54 years, and started my own business 23 years ago. IP video, access control, security systems, etc etc. I have Windows 7 Pro desktops and laptops, and Windows 10 Pro machines as well.  Daily I send pictures I take during the day, with my iPhone and email them to myself, to convey each and every job or project I work, kind of a daily record I keep in Paperport that I have done for years. Last evening I sent several emails with pictures of the past week, I can view them on my Inbox message page, typically, and then save all to the specific folder needed. Done this for years. </p><pre> Well, tonight, I emailed several pictures from projects I worked on today, greatly detailed, and when I went to open them in my Thunderbird account, the pictures would not display as normal, within the message opened, and when I saved them to a folder, they were invalid and would not open. File size is there, but no viewable image, does show the proper file name, iPhone IMG_1793.jpg, for example, but would not open. </pre> <p>If I try and open with Windows Photo Viewer it notes can't display this picture because the file is empty. </p><pre>  I opened my Thunderbird in another Laptop, with Windows 7 Pro, same thing... </pre> <p>I opened my other Laptop, Windows 10 Pro machine, in Thunderbird, the same message shows the image within the message, as it did on Windows 7 did just last night. </p><pre> With 2 of my Windows 7 Pro Machines doing the same thing, am I being pushed out of using Windows 7 Pro by this means??? </pre> <p>Every time I have loaded Thunderbird on another of my Desk tops or Laptops, I have donated. Because I appreciate what it does for me. These images are just an example, some had my CC info, could not attach that!! </p><pre> Please help me.
