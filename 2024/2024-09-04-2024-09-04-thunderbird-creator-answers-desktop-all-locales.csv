Daily I send pictures I take during the day, with my iPhone and email them to myself, to convey each and every job or project I work, kind of a daily record I keep in Paperport that I have done for years. Last evening I sent several emails with pictures of the past week, I can view them on my Inbox message page, typically, and then save all to the specific folder needed. Done this for years. </p><pre> Well, tonight, I emailed several pictures from projects I worked on today, greatly detailed, and when I went to open them in my Thunderbird account, the pictures would not display as normal, within the message opened, and when I saved them to a folder, they were invalid and would not open.

Recently the old computer crashed. On my new computer, I was able to restore almost all my Thunderbird files--about 3 GB (6500+ files).  [Only 3 files were listed as ""Restored, but the file's contents may differ from the original.""--a tiny percentage so I'm not concerned about them.]   From the Carbonite restore report, it appears all the files have been restored from an ""old location"" to a ""new location"".  All the old locations (a list of 150+ pages) have exactly the same names as the new locations--in Thunderbird.  When I open Thunderbird, however, I don't see any of those restored files.   </p><p>When I reinstalled Thunderbird on the new computer, I did set up three e-mail accounts so I could take care of my regular business.   </p><p>I tried using the Thunderbird import function.  I tried importing both from ""profile default"" choice and by choosing what I thought was the correct profile folder. Both selections got an error message saying:  ""Import Failed Unexpectedly.  More information may be available in the Error Console."" </p><p>Several questions: </p><p>1) Where is the Error Console? </p><p>2)  Should I first remove all the current e-mail account information from Thunderbird and try to import to Thunderbird with Thunderbird completely empty?  (I have all the current e-mail backed up, so I am willing to do this.) </p><p>3)  Is it possible that if I remove the current e-mail account info that, since the restored files are listed as being in what appears to be the correct location, they will just pop up automatically (Hey I can dream!)? </p><p>4)  At 3 GB, are my restored files too big to import--can they be imported by breaking down into smaller pieces? </p><p>5) Is there another procedure I should be using? </p><p>Thank you for your help.
