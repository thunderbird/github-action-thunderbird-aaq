I have no spam filters set in thunderbird or the email acct. I worked with the email account support and verified that it is not the Account email doing it. If I log in directly to the email account messages are handled correctly. As soon as i open thunderbird it moves inbox msgs dated  08/30/24 and later to the spam folder. HELP, please </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",wplachy
