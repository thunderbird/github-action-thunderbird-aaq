I always do so in attachment format, as APWG requests. However, if any individual attachment spam exceeds about 150K (give or take a few K's), the whole message gets rejected due to a (very) old SMTP (RFC2821) protocol limiting line length (998 relevant characters) within the message as measured by carriage return/line feed (CRLF). I think the rule is delineated as 4.5.3.1 within RFC. I can still forward such messages as attachments via Gmail, and I believe Yahoo, but not if I use Thunderbird as a suite to send. Is this a deficiency on Thunderbird's part, a bug, or something they intentionally have in place? And is there a workaround-? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",veryproicelandic

The reason for this is that I want to keep an offline only archive because it is more secure. </p><p>I currently only see options to delete everywhere after N days or delete locally after N days, but I want to keep local and delete from the server. It looks like the server software my email provider uses doesn't have a setting for it either, so doing this in thunderbird is my best chance of getting ut done. </p>",mobile;customize;android;firefox-1240;,thunderbird,emails-thunderbird,en-US,"",nielsl
