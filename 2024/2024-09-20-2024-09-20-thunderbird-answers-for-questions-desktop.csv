Because my system partition was fully and my Thunderbird data took about 60GB I wanted to move it to a data partition on the same drive (C: -&gt; H:). I found a tutorial that explained to shut down Thunderbird. Move/Copy the profile folder form C:Users\x\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\profiles\profile-name.default to the new desired location on H:. Then create a new Thunderbird profile via the profile manager that points to the new location and set it to default. Then turn on Thunderbird and thats it. It did it and it seem to work first. Everything was there after checking in Thunderbird. Then I decided to delete the old profile folder to free space up on C:. When I turned Thunderbird on again some stuff was missing. There are local folders, a gmail account and three email accounts from another provider. The local stuff and gmail look good, everything on its place. But the folders from the other provider are missing completely. Only the inboxes are there. But since they were kept empty always I can't tell if thats correct or a problem. The owner always kept the inbox empty by moving stuff to other folders (inside the account). But they are all not shown since the second start. </blockquote>",danhnguyen240293,false,0,0

It seems ""basic authentication"" has been disabled so OAuth2 is now required (<a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online</a>). I confirmed this by creating an app-specific password and using it with ""Normal Password"". I was unable to add the account. </p><p>So I switched back to the Thunderbird default of using 'Authentication Method: Oauth2' for both incoming and outgoing server settings. I removed the account, the OAuth credentials, and revoked/removed the app from the Microsoft account (see attached). The only thing I didn't do was remove the authenticator from the account. I restarted Thunderbird, added the account, went through the login process, and it asked for permission to link Thunderbird with my account (the second pop-up we were looking for). I logged in successfully and messages started downloading immediately. However, the issue remains when authenticating/sending messages via the SMTP server. </p><p>I can't entirely agree that using OAuth requires the removal of the authenticator from my Microsoft account unless, of course, it's a Thunderbird-specific requirement. Authenticating the IMAP server in Thunderbird works fine. Authenticating the SMTP server using OAuth2 works in 3 other non-thunderbird email clients. I don't see why IMAP would authenticate but SMTP would not. I also do not feel comfortable removing 2 factor from this account for security reasons so if this is a requirement to use Thundbird, unfortunately, I will have to find another solution. </p><p>I feel there is a bug with Thunderbird. I'll admit I'm not very technical, but the fact is that everything is configured correctly and IMAP works. The account works correctly in eMclient for PC / MAC, Mail (for android) all of which use OAuth2 to authenticate.  </p><p>One final thing to note - <a href=""http://Fastmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Fastmail.com</a> is configured using OAuth2 and works correctly in Thunderbird with 2 factor/authenticator attached to the account. </p>",nicksasso21,false,0,0
