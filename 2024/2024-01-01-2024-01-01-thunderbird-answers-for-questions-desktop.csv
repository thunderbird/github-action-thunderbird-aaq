It is that simple. </p><p>Unfortunately most of the issues arise when the new install asked for account details and folk supply them  all their mail downloads again because the use IMAP and then they complain that their local folders did not transfer, despite than not actually doing anything to casual a transfer to occur, like actually making a copy of their existing profile,  or importing it using the import feature. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
