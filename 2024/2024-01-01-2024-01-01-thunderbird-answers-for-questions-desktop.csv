The strange thing is, is that the max connections I ever have at any given point in time is 2, my laptop and my iphone, so theoretically this should not be happening whether I set to 2 or 3 or 5 or 10. And regardless if I change anything or not, the problem persists. Also, this problem continues to exist even if I have had my iphone app closed. Not sure if this means after every time I use the Mail app I have to also reboot the iphone instead of just closing the app? </p><p>What doesn't make sense to me is how decreasing the server connections is supposed to solve the problem? Can anyone explain this? </p><p>Also I made a post here with comments and questions about a month ago, but now that I am looking for it to see if there was a reply, it no longer exists.

Why you would create a new profile for a calendar year I have no idea.  I have been using the same Thunderbird profile for a decade.  A from Matt = I use folders in the profile to yearly archives.

SO I KNOW where they are. </p><p>Q for Matt = And How have you done this ""Yearly Archives"" retaining all email accounts and sub-folder info (Inbox, Sent)&nbsp;????? I have spent years trying different ADD-ONS, to no avail. </p><p>Q to Matt If you have been using the same ""email"" default "".thunderbird"" foled for many years, how BIG is it. I Changed the structure of my emails as I was sick to death of waiting 5-7 minutes for 40+ Gigabyte of email files to open into memory. As emails as in all the joke attachments, other important attached documents, and the fact most people I communicate with have the A4-A5 page sized signatures with Images, and fancy layouts, that multiple every-time I reply and they reply. </p><p>A from Charles = YES. I made an error. As in the previous 5 years moving Profile folder and actual email data folders has worked. TB has changed something, and it didn't work this year. TB actually found 2 year old email data (from god knows where.) I DO this so I could find email accounts that become compromised (spam or abused). I am able to compress the emails, deleted the account and files. Then I create a different account(s) as needed. It is also a security measure as my emails are not where ""everyone"" else expects them to be. </p><p>So do you understand that I have multiple Profiles, and multiple separate ""email storage"" folders. At the end of the year, I can compress emails, BACK THEM UP to 3 or 4 locations. I also, after a lot of mucking around Integrate, them in to another Profile titled 2020-all. This has all the years emails under different E-Mail Years sub-folders. This Profile takes 4-5 minutes to load. FYI Some of us can't afford the latest, flashy, fastest, 200core CPU 256Gig Ram PC upgrade every year. We make do with what we have. Q for Matt..... Do you consider this or the fact that all the ""back-up"" ADD-ONS don't work. The last 4-Star backup did actually back-up all my emails.... INTO ONE SINGLE Sub-Folder. Completely useless. Microsoft Outlook uses a ""file"" that you can compress emails on an annual Basis, and then just move it, and created a new ""file"". If you need to access older year emails, you can simply load that file as &lt;Year-Name&gt;. It may take minutes to load but it doesn't affect your current emails, and you can UN-LOAD it when done. TB still has no equal to this. Above is my attempt. </p><p>A- I have followed the advice from this forum that you copy profile to new location (similar to move to new pc), but it is like you expect us to have everything in the /Home/.thunderbird/ folder. We can no longer change this default folder. Same as all the ""Color Add-Ons that Don't Work either"" We must put up with basic colors unless you want to D/L some Theme. Most themes are not as advertised. What I do is also easier for Daily &amp; Monthly backups as I know the direct Path to the Emails. I can restore anything that becomes corrupted.
