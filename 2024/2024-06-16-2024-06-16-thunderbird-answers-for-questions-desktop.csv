If you reinstall the saintburry software again and it continues to be an issue as it is now, it will have to be replaced by the company in question or is still working on this. </p><p>Or you can try today to start up in a trouble shooting mode for Thunderbird and remove any existing apps or add-ons that could work against this subject, which concerns Sainsburys and Tescos. </p><p>You will also be able to manually opt for this removal and do it without any trouble shoot mode. But choose better. </p><p>Or you can check in Thunderbird's Trouble shoot mode to see if your email traffic has improved while both email accounts have not yet been deleted or updated.

Do this - click 'account settings' - scroll down left side until you see 'Outgoing Servers (SMTP) and click it - if you and he share the PC, there should be a separate SMTP server for each of you. If not, that is the problem. If there is one for each of you, edit the 'Description' field for each to be unique, such as HERS and HIS.  Then click 'account settings' click the identified for your account, look at bottom line that shows SMTP server link.

Your husband may have his set to use normal password but is using with no connection security.  For you, I think it would be safe to delete the passwords and let thunderbird prompt again. You can do that by clicking settigs&gt;security and clicking the 'saved password' button and then 'show passwords' and then highlight the two rows for your account and delete them. exit thunderbird and start over. It 'should' prompt for password.  However, you've had enough problems, so I suggest creating a full backup prior to doing that. to create a good backup, do this:  - exit thunderbird - IMPORTANT - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to somewhere else  </p><p>Then, if problems surface on fixing password, you can repeat the process  - exit thunderbird - copy the backedup thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata]roaming  to overwrite the current thunderbird folder.  </p><p>Okay, I probably told you more than you wanted.
