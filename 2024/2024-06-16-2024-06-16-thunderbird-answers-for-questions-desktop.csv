It seems BULK is spam to Yahoo...When I did that the items in BULK went into TB spam! Any other mapping issues should I be aware of? </p>,oldbob2,false,0,0

It is stated that most problems have been resolved and reimbursed. You can see if you can get your login details on paper from your saintdburry s email account and keep them safe. </p><p>Try clearing the software and scan app completely from saintburrys side to see if the problem was with the installed app. Or the contact between the two of Thunderbird and third parties. </p><p>Reinstall this again if you have removed Saintburry's software and icone.exe from it and use a cleaning tool such as cccleaner, which can be found on the net as before. And a refresh of the Thunderbird software in advance if you do so here chooses. </p><p>saintburrys s mail will be a bit more difficult to install or reinstall manually or may also prove to be extensive. </p><p>take the time to configure this carefully during reinstallation. The possibility that after the major fix of this SaintBurry's store your email account has been affected and third parties may have arisen for scanning apps or software accounts from this. </p><p>Delete your account from Saintburry's Thunderbird software for a while and reinstall it after removal, make backups of your data in advance and for this and if necessary reinstall the Thunderbird software temporarily for reuse with that of Saintburry's internet stuff and software, check whether your Thunderbird account works again as it should before you go shopping again. If you reinstall the saintburry software again and it continues to be an issue as it is now, it will have to be replaced by the company in question or is still working on this. </p><p>Or you can try today to start up in a trouble shooting mode for Thunderbird and remove any existing apps or add-ons that could work against this subject, which concerns Sainsburys and Tescos. </p><p>You will also be able to manually opt for this removal and do it without any trouble shoot mode. But choose better. </p><p>Or you can check in Thunderbird's Trouble shoot mode to see if your email traffic has improved while both email accounts have not yet been deleted or updated. Send a test email to yourself. This is also an option for this. </p><p><br> Greetings Firefox volunteer </p>",Googlethunderbird,false,0,0

Compare the email address in the account with the email address in the SMTP server settings. Do you have more than one account? Do you have more than one account with the same email provider? You will usually find the problem if you assume the error message is correct. If you have just one account, it is usually easy. If you are unsure of the problem, post a screenshot of account settings pane and one of SMTP server pane. If you use identities, those should also be posted. If you have more than one account with the same email provlder, you may be using the wrong SMTP sever with one of the accounts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

I would love to post screenshots of the message but my keyboard PrintScr key doesn't seem to work, so I am stuck.  I can send email through my server so I'm not totally dead in the water, but it's very inconvenient.  It's especially aggravating to see that my husband's email is working just fine.  No idea why all of a sudden it doesn't recognize me.  Thanks for the answer and I will keep trying stuff.  Linda </p>",ljmd5,false,0,0
