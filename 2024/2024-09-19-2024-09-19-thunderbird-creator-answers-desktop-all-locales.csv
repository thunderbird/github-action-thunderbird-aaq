I'd also had microsoft making my life hell with their OAUTH and cookies  shenanigans. I could only access my outlook/hotmail accounts by using outlook in a browser which I really hate and is why I started using Thunderbird years ago. Anyhoo, since I managed to install 102.15.1 again and sort out microsofts problem I've found that my address books have disappeared. I've seen answers to other peoples problems mentioning profiles etc. but that just baffles  me. I just want my address books back, ( both collected and personal ) as it makes it so much easier when addressing emails to just type the first couple of letters and then choose from the results rather than having to ytype the complete address. So if any can help I'll really appreciate it, Thanks. Alf J alf.j.slawson@outlook.com </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",Alf.J

As of the 16 Sept 2024 this has method has not been successful and I have had to resort to Mail on my iPad. This is not very satisfactory as all history and contacts are with Thunderbirds.

However now all those mails that first showed up blank are completely missing from my inbox.

But when I attempt to open them theyâ€™re empty again. </p><p>It seems to be an indexing issue, which Iâ€™ve tried to resolve by removing the indexing file (to a different location just in case). Then starting up Thunderbird again to rebuild the file, sadly this did not resolve the issue. </p><p>Normally I would just re-sync these emails from online, however due to an issue with my mail provider these are no longer available there. </p><p>I know the emails are still there stored locally, but I canâ€™t access them anymore. </p><p>Can anyone help? </p><p>My mail account uses POP </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1675463;,arkotaxidiaris
