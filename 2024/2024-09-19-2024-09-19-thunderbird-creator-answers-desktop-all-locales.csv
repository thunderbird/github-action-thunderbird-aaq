I've seen answers to other peoples problems mentioning profiles etc. but that just baffles  me.

However, I have been experiencing multiple issues with this platform. Not only is it difficult to use and impossible to automate emails, but I also keep losing emails, and it doesn't filter spam correctly. As a result, I receive phishing emails that I can't report, and they keep coming. </p><p>Since this morning, I've been encountering even more unusual problems. When I try to open an email with an attachment, an old email from about a year ago opens instead, containing a PNG attachment that has nothing to do with the current email. In other words, when I open a new email with an attachment, I can't see its content; I just see this old, unrelated email. This issue only occurs with new emails that have attachments; older emails and emails without attachments are not affected. </p><p>The IT team of my company has tried to assist me but hasn't been able to find a solution. Additionally, I've been attempting to switch to another email platform like Outlook or any other compatible tool, but I can't seem to access my account. I've tried so many times that I'm now getting an error message saying I've reached the maximum number of attempts and have failed the password check. I have also tried uninstalling Thunderbird from my computer to reinstall it, but for some reason, Thunderbird won't uninstall either. </p><p>I have videos documenting these issues if needed. This is a very urgent matter, as these emails are high-priority, and I need to respond to them but can't because I can't view their content. </p><p>I kindly request your immediate assistance to resolve this issue. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,es,"",cecilia6

I have Mac OS 12.7.6 and I noticed in the release notes for 128.2.1esr (64-bit) that this latest version's System Requirements are MacOS 10.15 or later.  Does that mean that I should not have downloaded the latest version, and if so, how can I revert to an earlier version of TB that will allow me to use Tabs and Shrunked Image Resizer?  I thought that Thunderbird was capable of recognizing which version of Mac OS I have and thus would not suggest I update to the latest version of TB if it won't work as it did with an earlier version of TB.
