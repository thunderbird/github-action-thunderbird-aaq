I don't that if that is the problem. </p><p>I have two email accounts which are both using IMAP.

I tried to send the emails and it won't send and I have received a note ""Invalid Recipient Address. Signatures 2024 is not a valid email address because it is not of the form user@host. You must correct it before sending."" I have done similar many times in the past with success so do not know what to do. It is urgent that I get this email out.
