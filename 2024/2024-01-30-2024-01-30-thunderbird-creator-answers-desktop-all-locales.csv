BUT, emails are still getting through, and I am still able to send them.  The message gives me the option to 'Retry', 'Enter new password' or 'Cancel'. Each time, I have clicked on to 'cancel' but after a while, the message will pop up again. It is rather frustrating, as I have to stop what I am doing just to click 'Cancel'. As it is checking on three '<a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>' accounts, the message pops up all at once for all three. It is frustrating, and I am not sure if ALL emails are in fact getting through.  When I click on the 'Junk' folder, it will give me the same pop up message, and although the top of the folder states there are 1 or 2 Junk emails, I cannot view or delete these. I have tried to look at Microsoft Outlook directly, but all seems fine there. No issues. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1633978;,alnali
