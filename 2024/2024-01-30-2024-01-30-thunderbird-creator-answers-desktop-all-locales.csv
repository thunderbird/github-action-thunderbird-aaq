BUT, emails are still getting through, and I am still able to send them.  The message gives me the option to 'Retry', 'Enter new password' or 'Cancel'. Each time, I have clicked on to 'cancel' but after a while, the message will pop up again. It is rather frustrating, as I have to stop what I am doing just to click 'Cancel'. As it is checking on three '<a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>' accounts, the message pops up all at once for all three. It is frustrating, and I am not sure if ALL emails are in fact getting through.  When I click on the 'Junk' folder, it will give me the same pop up message, and although the top of the folder states there are 1 or 2 Junk emails, I cannot view or delete these. I have tried to look at Microsoft Outlook directly, but all seems fine there. No issues. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1633978;,alnali

The problem comes up when you click a ""mailto"" from a web page. The FROM address that was coming up was not one I wanted.  Asking the question about the default sever brought up more than 150 discussions. Only after reading many them for more than half an hour,  did I find the answer: In Account Settings, select Account Actions, then select Set as Default.  Why isn't there a searchable user manual that would provide the answer to a simple question quickly? OK, the question may not be that simple because 'default sender' may be ambiguous. It might refer to the default SMTP server (the one used if you specify ""Use default server"" in your account settings for outgoing server). Or it could be the default identify, if your account has more than one identity (others, like me, may be pleased to learn you can have more than one identity in an account). In my case case, it meant the default account. But the number of meanings is finite. If a user queries for the default sender, the help facility should present the alternative meanings and ask the user which one is wanted. Wikipedia a disambiguation function. Can't Thunderbird have one as well? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1634925;1634979;1634981;1634986;1634994;1635017;,rmrubinsl
