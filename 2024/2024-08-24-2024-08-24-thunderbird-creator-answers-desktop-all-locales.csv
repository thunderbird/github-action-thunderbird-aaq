After changing some Thunderbird settings, I suddenly found that addresses no longer self-complete when I begin an address in an e-mail. The addresses are all there in the address book, but not ""connecting"" to my mail. Please advise what I need to do to get the addresses working again. Thank you! </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",caroGlou9815
