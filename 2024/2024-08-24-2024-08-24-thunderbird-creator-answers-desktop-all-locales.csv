A few days ago I saw that when I deleted a message it did not go the the Trash folder. When I look at the properties of that folder it shows a blank for location and while the message is deleted from the inbox it disappears. I do not know how that location was lost or how to restore it to it's previous value. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",9v04dxj7
