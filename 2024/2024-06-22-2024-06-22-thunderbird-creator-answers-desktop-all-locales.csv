But every couple of minutes I get a nag screen asking me to login to <a href=""http://login.live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.live.com</a>.  I dismiss the nag screen, and can still transmit and receive e-mails.  This screen is initiated by a Thunderbird process (I know this because if I kill a Thunderbird process in task manager, the screen goes away and everything works as expected.  ) </p><p>I really want no part of the Windows ""Live"" thing, and have no idea of what ""helpful"" changes it wants to make, and so I do not login.   </p><p>""Settings"" are set up with cookies set to yes.  OAuth2 seems to be selected.   </p><p>I see no settings that I could use to suppress the nag ... is there anything I can do??? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>Jonathan </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",JonathanWexler

I have checked my Junk box, Deleted Box, and my filters from __@Bell.net, from which I download to T-Bird. That email addr or URL is NOT blocked, and I have put that addr on my ""SafeSenders"" List. </p><p>I don't see that email anywhere else in T-Bird Folders,, and the sender had to call me, and resend from a diff address, their own Gmail acct.! </p><p>And I can send to them, to few ppl in that office,... And I don't get any emails from anyone @the URL, meaning no other staff from that URL can send anything to me! </p><p>Did I accidentally classify it as JUNK, but I never received anything from the beginning,.. So I do NOT believe I would have set it as Junk... </p><p>I have checked ALL settings in T-Bird and at <a href=""http://__Bell.Net"" rel=""nofollow"">__Bell.Net</a> in my settings, but to no avail. </p><p>Pls help, Much appreciated, Az </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",AzeemH
