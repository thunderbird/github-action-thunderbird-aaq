I have checked my Junk box, Deleted Box, and my filters from __@Bell.net, from which I download to T-Bird. That email addr or URL is NOT blocked, and I have put that addr on my ""SafeSenders"" List. </p><p>I don't see that email anywhere else in T-Bird Folders,, and the sender had to call me, and resend from a diff address, their own Gmail acct.! </p><p>And I can send to them, to few ppl in that office,...

I have tried several ""fixes"" listed on the internet, but no luck so far.  I'm running Thunderbird V 102.5.0 (64 bit) on Windows 11.  This does not happen to any other programs that I may be running, only TB and only after I delete the 2nd or 3rd email in my sbcglobal account.  It doesn't happen with my gmail account that I have running in TB also.  The freeze lasts a couple of minutes, and then reoccurs after I delete 2 or 3 more emails. It seems to only affect my ""inbox"" and not ""sent"" or ""trash"".  Sorry if this has been asked and answered before, but I was unable to find it here.  Would appreciate any assistance to point me in the direction of a solution.  Thanks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1658576;,dcfz52z
