It doesn't happen with my gmail account that I have running in TB also.  The freeze lasts a couple of minutes, and then reoccurs after I delete 2 or 3 more emails. It seems to only affect my ""inbox"" and not ""sent"" or ""trash"".  Sorry if this has been asked and answered before, but I was unable to find it here.
