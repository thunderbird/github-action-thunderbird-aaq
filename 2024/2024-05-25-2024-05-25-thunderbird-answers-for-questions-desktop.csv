Second, the down-and-dirty answer is that your profiles.ini appears to be pointing to a location that does not contain a usable profile.  Now, did the old PC have thunderbird on drive C in standard location? Is that also true for the new PC? If so, I suggest this:  - be sure Thunderbird is not running on either PC - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media on old PC2 - copy the thunderbird profile from the backedup media to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the existing thunderbird folder - start thunderbird   </p><p>If that does not work, there is likely something unusual in your configuration and more info will be needed. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

(bad thing) I shut down TB. Went to the old computer did the %appdata% copied the old profile and profile.ini to a zip file and move it to a usb drive to move to the new computer. Each time I shut down TB before coping the profiles in either direction. </p><p>When that all failed and I got the above message I uninstalled TB. However the first time I forgot to delete the TB folders. So that made a mess of things. </p><p>After I realized that I needed to delete the folders I uninstalled TB again, deleted the folders and reinstalled TB. This time I allowed TB to start but then shut it down and did not allow it to set up any accounts. I then shut down TB and moved over the old accounts to the new computer and got this same message. </p><p>I opened the profiles.ini file to check where it was pointing and it is pointing at the file. So I have no reason to think that the profiles.ini file is the problem. </p><p>So that doesn't seem to be the issue. I honestly feel it must be something with the old computer running maybe an older version of TB that I haven't checked that the newer version isn't backwards compatible.  I'm sorry for making the assumption that this was some sort of tech support for TB and a refund for my contribution.  </p><p>I've been using TB for over 20 years now and have never had this problem before.  </p><p>I think what has happen is that my wife never updates TB, I'm not sure if TB self updates I can't remember ever seeing that it did. She may have such an old version that even the back up can't be read by the newer version. Let me try to update the old computer and try to do the back up again and see if that matters. </p><p>I am pulling out my hair with this issue and would seriously hope that a tech from TB would see this and think, oh that's an issue we need to address. </p>",fkenisky,false,0,0

I move that to a usb drive and them move the usb drive to the new computer. I open tb go to file open import and find the file and import those files to a folder I create called credit card? </p><p>Like I said it's a crazy work around but it would take less than 3 days. </p>,fkenisky,false,0,0

If the old PC is still accessible, please do the steps I suggested and report back. Copying the thunderbird folder is usually successful because it contains both the profile and the profiles.ini. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you have the profile already on external media, a simple approach is this:  - install the importexport addon  - create new folders in Local Folders for each message folder to be imported  - highlight one of the new folders, rightclick and select the importexport option to import mbox file. - browse to the profile and select the desired message folder (and IGNORE the msf files).  - repeat the above for each message folder  (NOTE: in the old profile, POP message folders will be in the Mail folder and local folders will be in Mail\Local Folders folder.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Aprobé todo tipo de contenido remoto y aún así no se resolvió. Es curioso porque el flatpak también tiene deshabilitado el contenido remoto pero solo bloquea las imágenes, el contenido como texto y diferentes secciones como los diferentes puestos y demás contenido sí se visualizaba. </p><p>La verdad no quiero pensar que usar Flatpak sea la solución, no he tenido problemas con otras aplicaciones en snap, aunque tengo entendido que la versión snap la administra Canonical y la flatpak el Team TB, tal vez algo tenga que ver en eso. </p>",elijosuevallejos25,false,0,0
