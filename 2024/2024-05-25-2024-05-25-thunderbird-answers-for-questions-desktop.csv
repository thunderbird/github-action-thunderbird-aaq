Second, the down-and-dirty answer is that your profiles.ini appears to be pointing to a location that does not contain a usable profile.  Now, did the old PC have thunderbird on drive C in standard location? Is that also true for the new PC? If so, I suggest this:  - be sure Thunderbird is not running on either PC - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media on old PC2 - copy the thunderbird profile from the backedup media to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the existing thunderbird folder - start thunderbird   </p><p>If that does not work, there is likely something unusual in your configuration and more info will be needed. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

(bad thing) I shut down TB. Went to the old computer did the %appdata% copied the old profile and profile.ini to a zip file and move it to a usb drive to move to the new computer. Each time I shut down TB before coping the profiles in either direction. </p><p>When that all failed and I got the above message I uninstalled TB. However the first time I forgot to delete the TB folders. So that made a mess of things. </p><p>After I realized that I needed to delete the folders I uninstalled TB again, deleted the folders and reinstalled TB. This time I allowed TB to start but then shut it down and did not allow it to set up any accounts. I then shut down TB and moved over the old accounts to the new computer and got this same message. </p><p>I opened the profiles.ini file to check where it was pointing and it is pointing at the file. So I have no reason to think that the profiles.ini file is the problem. </p><p>So that doesn't seem to be the issue. I honestly feel it must be something with the old computer running maybe an older version of TB that I haven't checked that the newer version isn't backwards compatible.  I'm sorry for making the assumption that this was some sort of tech support for TB and a refund for my contribution.  </p><p>I've been using TB for over 20 years now and have never had this problem before.  </p><p>I think what has happen is that my wife never updates TB, I'm not sure if TB self updates I can't remember ever seeing that it did. She may have such an old version that even the back up can't be read by the newer version. Let me try to update the old computer and try to do the back up again and see if that matters. </p><p>I am pulling out my hair with this issue and would seriously hope that a tech from TB would see this and think, oh that's an issue we need to address. </p>",fkenisky,false,0,0

If you have the profile already on external media, a simple approach is this:  - install the importexport addon  - create new folders in Local Folders for each message folder to be imported  - highlight one of the new folders, rightclick and select the importexport option to import mbox file. - browse to the profile and select the desired message folder (and IGNORE the msf files).  - repeat the above for each message folder  (NOTE: in the old profile, POP message folders will be in the Mail folder and local folders will be in Mail\Local Folders folder.) </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

The versions are both 64k both are one version apart from each other and that should not have any effect. The only other thing I can think is that HP has some sort of contract with MS that forbids them loading anything that isn't MS without some sort of work around but that was about 5 years ago and thought I saw some law suit against MS that stopped that practice. I tried to move the profiles over again after deleting the old profiles on the USB and got even more frustrated. So I don't know what else to do but to just use this POS that is seemingly beginning to look like a MS product full of features and no ability. Yes I'm very frustrated after 4 days of trying to figure out this puzzle.  I just wish a TB tech would see this and jump on it to solve the problem. It can't be the location problem. It just can't be. I've done this from computer to laptops many times more than I'd can count and have never had this much of a problem. Whatever happen to the time when you could install it on the new computer, copy the profile, move it to the old computer and volla it worked? Even the export import is a task in futilities and more perplexing because it has a 2 gig limit.  Oh and for some reason when I exported from the old computer it deleted (as if thinking on it's own) that I was backing up the email and needed to get rid of the space. So now my wife can't go back and worse than sneaker net and open both computers and look at one old email to verify the sender and it's content and then look at the new computer and type in the old information manually. Technology has really taken us from banging rocks on walls to doing it on computers. David thanks for repeating yourself but that really didn't help, the problem extends beyond coping the old profile into the new one. And the locations are pretty much unchanged on both. It's a home computer so there isn't any company idioms needed to point to somewhere different. This is a TB problem. </p>",fkenisky,false,0,0

That is, try just using your online account for a few days to see how your account's capacity for mail goes. That is, the first thing to confirm is the source of the problem. If you work from your online account for a few days and accumulate lots of messages, only to then start thunderbird and see them all disappear, then there may be a problem in Thunderbird itself or the settings. But if you have the same problem from the online account, then the source is your email provider. Do keep us posted. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I would reference the images you posted,  but I have to hit the back button to get out of them because they some how make the close button for the image disappear.  The forum softwaree has some odd things happen occasionally </p><p>But you are posting an image showing that the server that is not responding is 211.29.132.250.  That is an undecorated IP address.  Did you manually set it,  or is your computers DNS system completely messed up?  My feeling is the latter as your earlier topic show a ""friendly address"" in your settings. </p><p>That server should be in your settings as <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a> and the error should be reported using the same friendly name.  That it is appaearing as it is says there are issues outside of Thunderbird related probably to DNS services.  But I can only guess.  As Optus supplies all DNS services,  unless you enable DNS over HTTPS in Thunderbird settings (Which I did on day one it was available) then any failure of DNS has nothing to do with Thunderbird.  It might have to do with your choice of antivirus product, VPN or connection hardware.  What it does not have anything to do with it Thunderbird, unless you have changed the defaults as I said. </p><p>Then you posted an image of a million and one issues with some Google site <a href=""http://Apidata.Googleusercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Apidata.Googleusercontent.com</a> This to the best of my knowledge this is the Google calendar site you get your calendar from.  But you are having issues with the validity of the encryption certificate.  </p><p>It is interesting that about 99% of the issues I see reported about the validity of certificates are caused by antivirus programs using self signed and untrusted certificates to orchestrate their man-in-the-middle hack that they call scanning.   This is especially so when the site is a well known one from a major internet player.  That is a probably two problems that could be your antivirus product. </p><p>Then we have this topic  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1447648"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1447648</a> </p> <blockquote>""Unable to connect to IMAP server. You may have exceeded the maximum number of connections to this server. If so, use the Advanced IMAP Server Settings dialog to reduce the number of cached connections."" I do not have that option under Advanced Server Settings. I'm using POP3 mail server with Optusnet.</blockquote> <p>Fundamentally I think your port was wrong, as an IMAP server was responding,  not a POP one.  But it could also have been the entire server name and port.  Given clear issues with DNS shown here.  Anything it possible really.  I think I should just ignore this lot. </p><p>Then we have this mess <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1448153"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1448153</a> were we see <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-05-23-16-31-59-8a2c5f.png""> </p><p>Start by changing the name.  It is an SMTP server not IMAP and the username used is more important than the type.  I would suggest ""Optus whenangelscry"" as the name so you can be sure you have the right one set in your incoming server settings.  It makes sorting issues with incorrect outgoing servers much easier to identify if the names used make what is what clear.  </p><p>Port 25 has been deprecated for sending mail from users to servers for most of the last 20 years.  But Optus are still hanging in there using it.  Port 25 has a dual purpose because of their choices and that is not very often a good thing.  But there is nothing we can do about that.  Except point and shake our heads. </p><p>Interesting point here is ""connections error 10060"" per google is a timeout.  So again I am seeing issues most likely cause by an antivirus solution.  Despite my distaste for the Optus settings,  the problem is probably in the antivirus. </p><p>Then we have <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1442125"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1442125</a> another example of timeouts manifesting in password requests is my guess. Especially in the light of all the other related problems. The advise you were given is valid as far as it goes,  but it is probably antivirus again causing connection issues through timeouts which result in the fallback of asking you for the correct password as the one stored does not appear to be working. </p><p>So that is four for four probably attributable to the antivirus. </p><p>Then we get to this <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1439007"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1439007</a> </p> <blockquote>Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: IP 110.32.62.0 is not authorised to send mail for domain <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>. See <a href=""http://www.open-spf.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-spf.org</a>. </blockquote> <p>This is probably a result of the fact the world does not use port 25 for user submissions any longer,  so the Optus server is getting confused about what is a new submission and what it should relay.  By relaying to hotmail telling them the mail is from 110.32.62.0, which incidentally appears to be <a href=""http://mail.n110-32-62-0.rdl21.qld.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.n110-32-62-0.rdl21.qld.optusnet.com.au</a> spo pasrt of their mail system in QLD,  but not an address they advertise as a permitted sender.
