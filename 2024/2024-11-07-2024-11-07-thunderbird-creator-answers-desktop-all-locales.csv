I had the Geek Squad from Best Buy upgrade my Hp Envy laptop internal storage from 512 GB to 2 TBs Oct 29-31, 2024.  I use Thunderbird and have done so for at least 19  yrs. I was told that I would need to download all the application programs again after the upgrade , but that all my data would be stored on the download they did from my internal storage to the new storage.  I successfully reinstalled the Thunderbird Program.  However I am missing all my contacts in my address books except for 24 names and addresses.  I truthfully don't know how many I had in each address book  but as I said I have been using this program for 19yrs. So it was in the hundreds.  The Geek Squad member tried to fix this but was unable to locate the correct file that the address contacts might be located, I think he tried a mab file.  They said that since it was a third party app that I should try Thunderbird Support.  Have I lost all my addresses or is there a way to search for them using my new internal storage?.  Since this is an HP laptop with a Microsoft 11, it has OneDrive so I am sure that there is a complication in finding the file once I know the type of file I need to be looking for.  Thanks for any advice  you can give on this matter. </p><p>Madeleine Mitchell, </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1686367;,Rngmaddy
