If I click on the ""Invite Attendees"" button an ""Invite Attendees"" dialog appears with an email address already loaded in the first line.  In my instance, this email address isn't mine!  It is an alias on our corporate Zimbra email system that hasn't been used for 15 years, but is nowhere in my Thunderbird v102.15.1 client.  It also isn't in any of my Thunderbird accounts.  Where can I define this? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1651375;,BPaul_H

If I click on any folder like Inbox or Junk the most recent messages are downloaded for that folder. I have set Server Setting to:  1)Check for new messages at startup (which seems to work) 2) Allow immediate server notifications when new messages arrive (does not seem to work) In the past IMAP did not require periodic checking for new messages, as the server received them Thunderbird displayed them, so I have not set Check for new messages every X minutes. In the past many mail servers did not like auto checking more frequently than every 15mins (not sure if this still applies these days). Are there any other mail settings in Thunderbird that may prevent Auto Download of new messages as they arrive.  I have the latest Thunderbird ie 115.10.1 (32 bit) Supernova I have four mail account all on different servers same problem with all. Last time I used MSOutlook (which I don't use anymore) it worked fine so I'm leaning toward this being a Thunderbird issue. Windows firewall set to allow Thunderbird Router set for DMZ to machine just in case.&nbsp;;&gt;) Am i missing a new Thunderbird setting I cannot find? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",compufix89
