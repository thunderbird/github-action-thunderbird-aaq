Fundamentally I think the apple address book is just not really a starter with apple limiting it to read only. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I understand one is POP and two are IMAP, and you are attempting to create a fourth? Is it a separate email account from the other three? You mention one account is not working. Is your attempt to set up another account an attempt to rectify that? Please share details and that may help others here who may have suggestions. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I just found out that I could create a pop account however the emails were not coming into Thunderbird. We had created some new imap account in Thunderbird but I have found that If I delete a message it is deleted everywhere which was a concern when we have a couple of email accounts we both access on our desktops. One is the one that is giving me a problem on my husband's computer. I was trying to create an Imap account of the one that the yahoo tech changed the original incoming pop to <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a>. That is the one that was not getting emails on Thunderbird but I now I am not able to send out anything at all. </p><p>Another question that I have noticed. If I try to do outgoing mail on I now see I have several smtp's listed with one that is a default. I actually didn't know that was happening. How do I fix that since I have yahoo, google and one cox left which is not letting me send stuff out. </p><p>I have a couple of photos here. Please understand I am not far from being an expert of savvy on this stuff.   </p><p>Another question, for yahoo it requires a third party app with a different password. I am not suppose to use the same 3rd app password on ALL my thunderbird yahoo and cox accounts, am I?  </p><p>This has been an absolute headache! I will appreciate any help that I can get. </p>",celiat,false,0,0

IMAP tends to be preferred when the account needs to be consistent across multiple PCs and/or phones. You appear to have ten email accounts, and I agree that can be difficult to administer My first suggestion is just housekeeping on the SMTP servers. Here are my suggested steps to get the fundamentals in order: ' - for each SMTP server, enter the email id it is for in the 'Description' field. That is just documentation that will be useful later.  - then, for each account, select the account pane (the one that shows the SMTP server link at bottom) and adjust as needed to point to the correct server. The email id will appear as part of the name, since you updated the Description field. </p><p>Now that they are all updated, check to see which are working ok, and we can go from there. On the Yahoo question, I believe you need a separate App password for each of the Yahoo accounts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
