Fundamentally I think the apple address book is just not really a starter with apple limiting it to read only. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I understand one is POP and two are IMAP, and you are attempting to create a fourth? Is it a separate email account from the other three? You mention one account is not working. Is your attempt to set up another account an attempt to rectify that? Please share details and that may help others here who may have suggestions. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I'm not sure how he did it. My understanding is that as the archives are saved locally on the hard drive of my old pc, they are not transferred automatically. </p>",ClassyGlass,false,0,0
