I just found out that I could create a pop account however the emails were not coming into Thunderbird. We had created some new imap account in Thunderbird but I have found that If I delete a message it is deleted everywhere which was a concern when we have a couple of email accounts we both access on our desktops. One is the one that is giving me a problem on my husband's computer. I was trying to create an Imap account of the one that the yahoo tech changed the original incoming pop to <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a>.

Please understand I am not far from being an expert of savvy on this stuff.   </p><p>Another question, for yahoo it requires a third party app with a different password.

IMAP tends to be preferred when the account needs to be consistent across multiple PCs and/or phones. You appear to have ten email accounts, and I agree that can be difficult to administer My first suggestion is just housekeeping on the SMTP servers. Here are my suggested steps to get the fundamentals in order: ' - for each SMTP server, enter the email id it is for in the 'Description' field. That is just documentation that will be useful later.  - then, for each account, select the account pane (the one that shows the SMTP server link at bottom) and adjust as needed to point to the correct server. The email id will appear as part of the name, since you updated the Description field. </p><p>Now that they are all updated, check to see which are working ok, and we can go from there.

No other client that I use now (Outlook, emClient, email acces in Vivaldi browser) do this folder tree expansion - indeed, in Outlook it helpfully shows the Send/Receive process in detail and it carries on quite happily during the synchronisiation. </p><p>Thanks again for picking this up, Matt. </p>",psh2,false,0,0

The worse affected one is a large, in term of folders and messages, account where I only download the headers due to limited local storage on the laptop - in fact this differs between the laptop where I download headers only and my main machine where I download the messages since I'm not short on space there. I'll try changing that and see what happens. There are probably over 100 folders with 1000 or more messages in all (I guess I could do a recursive count on the msf files to get the folder count - is there a way to get the message count?). I should split this up and maybe move old messages to a local folder, but if I do that then I would only have access to these historic mails from Thunderbird and, at this stage, I don't want to tie myself that closely to one client. I could set up another IMAP account on my own doman for old mails and not synchronise with Thunderbird which would probably help. </p><p>The issue is that the whole folder tree expands, including all nested folders even though the vast majority of folders will not have been changed - it's not only the folder tree leading to folders that might have to be resynchronised that open (I'm probably not explaining this very clearly - apologies). </p><p>I'll change the download options, get a count of the total number of folders (either brush up my Linux or knock up a Powershell script), set up logging and see what happens. </p>",psh2,false,0,0

The drop down menu on the Trash folder includes the line ""Empty Trash"" which works and in prior version this was always present on the Junk folder drop down.  I'll continue searching but if you or anyone has any other ideas i'd greatly appreciate it.  While it is possible to delete the contents of the Junk folder this was and is the easiest way to accomplish that and I had become used to it over the years. Thanks </p>",bobmct,false,0,0

There was a time when it was about the only way to import outlook PST content to Thunderbird until bug in the importer were fixers years ago.  Now  not so much. </p><p>2. Avast offers instruction on how to force Thunderbird to use it's self signed certificates.  Personally I find the process rather poor security.  The certificates are issued in a chain of trust,  Avast chooses not to have their business audited and meet the costs of same to be included,  so ask users to reduce their security so the company can hack into your communications. </p><p>3 The certificates that will be offered will be current, what is happening is a web page is loading and the web server has current certificates as the same <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> server is used for all versions of Thunderbird.  The problem is Avast substituting the certificates issued by the web site for it's own which Thunderbird rejects. </p><p>4 Uninstall Avast and try both your W11 install and Thunderbird and be pleased how all your issues suddenly cease.  Not removing avast in Windows 10 and 11 will activate Windows defender.  So you are not on windows without an antivirus. </p><p>To be honest defender is all I use after paying for products that slowed my devices,  messed up communications and drove me almost mad with false positives for the proceeding 20 or more years. </p><p>AN FYI,  this is some of the Avast issues that have been documented in relation to Thunderbird.

I took this to be the official recommendation from Mozilla. You'll notice that the article is undated. </p><p>2: I use Avast but yes, I'm always suspicious of companies that are selling higher levels of security cos there's always an unstated ""trussst in me..."" clause and never any info on their internal security policies, employee vetting procedures etc. (Russian or Chinese antivirus anyone?) </p><p>I'd already seen A: that 38 thought it was current and refused to upgrade itself, and B: after exporting certs from Avast and importing into TB, they still weren't visible in TB - so this created an expectation of problems to be solved.  Perhaps if things had gone smoothly from the start I'd have back-tracked rather than trying to fix. </p><p>Anyway once I'd figured out how to upgrade properly and port properly, it all went very smoothly, all the certificate issues disappeared, and it now works fine. </p><p>So thanks again. </p>",malcolm.storey321,false,0,0
