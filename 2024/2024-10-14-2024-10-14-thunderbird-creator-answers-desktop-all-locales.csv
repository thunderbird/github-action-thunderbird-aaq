I have a recurring event that was initiating by an outside invitation. If I try to delete a single occurrence, by any means, it always reappears after a while. It disappears from the calendar and from the ""Events this month"" pane, but reappears after a while or immediately after starting thunderbird. ""By any means"" includes when the event initiator sends a cancellation notice and the cancellation is accepted, using the delete key from the ""events"" pane, using the delete key when clicking on the item in the calendar, or right clicking on the item in the calendar and finding one's way to ""delete only this occurrence"". This is making the calendar almost useless.
