Randomly, I begin getting this message when trying to send an email: Sending of the message failed.  Unable to authenticate to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.googlemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.googlemail.com</a>. Please check the password and verify the 'Authentication method' in 'Account settings / Outgoing server (SMTP)'. The password is correct, it's never changed. I can login to gmail online and login in with it. I can see my messages, but I can't login through Thunderbird. The stupid thing is I can download messages from the account, I just can't send any back. I've spent hours in total going through Gmail and Thunderbird settings and can't find where the fault lies and eventually have to just stop using the account. Can anyone suggest what the problem is? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1685299;,addyjustforregistering
