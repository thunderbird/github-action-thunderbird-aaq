When it was being copied, it said something about an error or something but I just ""let it go"" and clicked ok and then it appeared to finish transferring to the external drive so that I could move to new computer. In fact it didn't copy to drive, I moved it there... So it was no longer on my old laptop... I go back to new laptop and am having problems getting the profile to load with thunderbird... So i go back to my old one, discover that profile is missing, ok, i have a back up, put it back, it all loads ok but since as i said before it didn't apparently copy correctly, it all gets set up fine but i have lost ALL of my email! All of the account settings etc are fine but no email is there... I am devastated, I have years and years of stuff that I considered important.. Is there any way this can be fixed? Is there any place that I can find this email now that I no longer have the full profile as it was? I hope I have been clear... Please help! Thank you... I feel so foolish for thinking that I could simply do this like I had in the past and not realising the profile had not copied correctly...

My wife's install on a Lenovo ThinkPad T530, again running Mint, periodically, and at random intervals, suddenly stops working to replies to incoming emails.  The incoming mail always works perfectly, but if one hits Reply to a message, a screen opens, with the message being replied to,  properly displayed, but the Subject field frozen, and the text window to enter the reply equally frozen.  When in this condition, attempts to send a new message to the sender, by going through the Address Book, choosing the recipient by name and then Write, has exactly the same issue - frozen input fields. The only resolution is to reboot the computer, when it all works normally until the next random freeze.  (Closing TB and reopening it does not fix it.) Mint takes charge of updates of TB, and we have kept all updates up to date, as well as Mint itself, so I do not think this is an update issue.  (We currently have TB  115.16.0esr) The problem happens only on the older Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, not on my HP desktop.  Anything further I can add to document the situation?  Any ideas, (other than ""Reboot whenever it happens"", (anywhere from a day or two, to weeks))? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1685525;1685576;1685581;,dmaxwell1

I tried restoring the Thunderbird folder from an earlier date and the address book displays correctly.  However if I close and re-open Thunderbird the address book has gone.  After trying this numeous times I saw a message ""Migrating cardbook DBImage 5/8"" as shown in the attached screenshot.
