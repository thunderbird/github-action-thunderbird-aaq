I can login to gmail online and login in with it. I can see my messages, but I can't login through Thunderbird. The stupid thing is I can download messages from the account, I just can't send any back. I've spent hours in total going through Gmail and Thunderbird settings and can't find where the fault lies and eventually have to just stop using the account. Can anyone suggest what the problem is? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1685299;1685315;1685331;,addyjustforregistering

I was changing to a new laptop... Have done so before... Copied my profile folder... When it was being copied, it said something about an error or something but I just ""let it go"" and clicked ok and then it appeared to finish transferring to the external drive so that I could move to new computer. In fact it didn't copy to drive, I moved it there... So it was no longer on my old laptop... I go back to new laptop and am having problems getting the profile to load with thunderbird... So i go back to my old one, discover that profile is missing, ok, i have a back up, put it back, it all loads ok but since as i said before it didn't apparently copy correctly, it all gets set up fine but i have lost ALL of my email! All of the account settings etc are fine but no email is there... I am devastated, I have years and years of stuff that I considered important.. Is there any way this can be fixed? Is there any place that I can find this email now that I no longer have the full profile as it was? I hope I have been clear... Please help! Thank you... I feel so foolish for thinking that I could simply do this like I had in the past and not realising the profile had not copied correctly... I feel sick, thank you for listening, any help is appreciated... </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",xeniaaidonopoulou1971
