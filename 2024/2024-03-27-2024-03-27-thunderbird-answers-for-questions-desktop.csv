That leads me to ask how I can accomplish that. I've evaluated how I envision archiving my mail off-line and came to the following: </p><p>- I want to automatically copy all email from my imap account to local folders each time Thunderbird syncs with the server - I want to keep the existing folder structure; meaning sent email are copied to a local ""sent"" folder. Trash to a local ""trash"" folder, inbox to a local inbox folder etc. - I also want to download and store attachments to local folders - If a new (sub) folder is created on imap, i want to automatically create that same folder in my Local Folders - After copying all mail and attachments to local folders I want to delete any mail older than 100 days from my IMAP but preserve them locally. - If something gets deleted of my IMAP after it was copied over to Local Folders it is not deleted from Local Folders. So If I deleted a submap on my IMAP the submap is not deleted from Local Folders. </p><p>How can I achieve this? I studied mail filters but I see no ways to copy from a certain (sub)folder. Nor do I see ways to detect a new sun folder and create it locally. </p><p>Do I need plugins to achieve my desired result? And if yes, which plugins? Of course I had a look myself but I found nothing about creating folders automatically, and most references to plugins are many years old leading my to worry that these plugins might be outdated or buggy. </p>",nielsl,false,0,0

Using POP for local storage is the best approach because it is designed to be stand alone from the server. </p><p>IMAP is synchronized IMAP is not.  POP has just a maildrop which is general considered to be the inbox and recognizes no folders, IMAP does.  Those are the realities.  Automated archiving is possible specifying a local folder 5to archive to,  but really I would not recommend it.  Nothing that copies/moves large numbers of emails from an IMAP server/account to local folders can really be considered to be a reliable process. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have provided you with links to your providers website where they contradict your assertion entirely.  Perhaps years ago they were correct.  That is no longer the case. Correct them now is the obvious solution to your dilemma. </p> <em><p>ggordets <a href=""#answer-1644755"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>My inability to send happened suddenly yesterday.  </blockquote> <p>Was that perhaps when spectrum finally withdrew support for the legacy Road Runner server names.  Just because it used to work does not mean it will continue to work.  I find that my system is actually unable to resolve <a href=""http://smpt.san.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smpt.san.rr.com</a> to an actual address on the internet.  So there is nothing suggesting to me that the server even exists any longer.  </p> <em><p>ggordets <a href=""#answer-1644755"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>I am thinking that the Spectrum tech that helped my may have overlooked something.   </blockquote> <p>Clearly as they missed you using unsupported server settings. Some sources suggest you can <a href=""https://rotundasoftware.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044978653-Why-are-my-emails-from-RoadRunner-coming-back-as-undeliverable"" rel=""nofollow"">no longer use</a> road runner email addresses,  but that is not correct. The stories have been floating around for years now because Spectrum support is so poor many customers just give up and assume the thing can not work. </p> <em><p>ggordets <a href=""#answer-1644755"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>As you pointed out his testing did not prove anything.  </blockquote> <p>Correct,  but it does meet the Spectrum's service outcome of not supporting anything but their webmail.  Their point of view is if your webmail works they have met their support and service obligation. You have email that works. </p> <em><p>ggordets <a href=""#answer-1644755"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>I am thinking I should give it another try with Spectrum support.  </blockquote> <p>It would be a waste of time when simply correcting your server settings which are <strong>not </strong>correct, as published publicly by your mail provider would immediately provide a solution.  I can not guarantee that is the only problem,  but until it is corrected nothing further in the diagnostic process can occur. </p> <em><p>ggordets <a href=""#answer-1644755"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>Is there anything else besides incorrect settings within Thunderbird that could cause my inability to send messages? </blockquote> <p>Many, many things.  But unless you use the settings provided by your email provider for connection to their server anything else is moot.   </p><p>That question is like asking me if there is any other reason your car could not take you shopping despite your to refusal fill the empty gas tank.
