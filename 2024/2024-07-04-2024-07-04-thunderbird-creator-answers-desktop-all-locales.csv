While running version 115.12.1 32bit on Win 10, I had need to delete one of the filters.  When I went to Menu Bar &gt; Tools &gt; Message Filters the Message Filters window does NOT show ANY filters regardless of which account (I have 20 and checked each) is selected.  I have also searched my HDD, located all copies of msgFilterRules.dat and opened ones that might be related to the account in question.  ALL of the msgFilterRules.dat files that I checked had only 2 lines.... version=""9"" and logging=""no"", except for the problem account where I had turned on logging and the .dat file showed ""yes"".  I also went to yahoo and checked to see if I might have created the filter on the server side.  However, according to yahoo, they discontinued the forwarding filter in 2021, so it's not happening there.  I need to know how to find the forwarding filters and edit them. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1660299;1660303;1660305;1660307;1660310;1660314;1660331;1660338;,moremail2trash

First, I have five accounts set up. I am running two add-ons (Provider for Google Calendar, and Quicktext). I am currently running a snap version 115.12.2 of Thunderbird on both machines and they both are running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Plenty of RAM and plenty of free disk space. </p><p>Here are the two issues... </p><p>1. More often than not, when an email comes into one of the inboxes and I am viewing the unified inbox there are two copies of the same email. If I switch back to the actual inbox of the account it only shows the one. This is very aggravating and when you start trying the delete emails from the unified inbox it gets all hosed up and I end up having to go to each individual mailbox to delete the messages.  </p><p>2. This somewhat relates to issue one... Sometimes when an email is deleted from the unified inbox, a blank record remains like in the image. This shows only one but sometimes there are multiple ones. Of course, if I go to that message's inbox it is not there. </p><p>I have tried all the common things like deleting the index files to let the indexes rebuild, comparing folders etc., and again, this has been a persistent problem since day one. Any insight or solution would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thank you! Mike </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1660518;1660519;1668307;1678135;1678139;,emailme3
