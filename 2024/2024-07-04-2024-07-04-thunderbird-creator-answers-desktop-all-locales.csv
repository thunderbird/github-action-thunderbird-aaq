I also went to yahoo and checked to see if I might have created the filter on the server side.

I've been slogging along using my Gmail reader since then but I need my address books from TB for my business. I really need to get this fixed.  </p><p>I've read all the questions/replies on this and have uninstalled and reinstalled TB. My Appdata/Roaming/TB file only has 5 files in it: Crash Reports, Pending Pings and Profiles plus a couple of 1 KB config files. Don't know if this is right or not.  </p><p>When I search the Profiles folder using .ini, I get this Notepad info: </p><p>[Install8216C80C92C4E828] Default=C:\Users\*\Documents\yvfr1fi4.default Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile3] Name=thunderbird IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/kavosmqu.thunderbird </p><p>I have this yvfr file on a thumb drive and I tried uploading that into the roaming/TB file but I still get the same error message.  </p><p>Any help greatly appreciated! Thank you. </p>",42skidoo;davidsk;,true,false,false,";category:fix-problems;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;product:thunderbird;solver_id:6034775",4,0,0,,,
