While running version 115.12.1 32bit on Win 10, I had need to delete one of the filters.  When I went to Menu Bar &gt; Tools &gt; Message Filters the Message Filters window does NOT show ANY filters regardless of which account (I have 20 and checked each) is selected.  I have also searched my HDD, located all copies of messageFilterRules.dat and opened ones that might be related to the account in question.  ALL of the messageFilterRules.dat files that I checked had only 2 lines.... version=""9"" and logging=""no"", except for the problem account where I had turned on logging and the .dat file showed ""yes"".  I also went to yahoo and checked to see if I might have created the filter on the server side.  However, according to yahoo, they discontinued the forwarding filter in 2021, so it's not happening there.  I need to know how to find the forwarding filters and edit them. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",moremail2trash
