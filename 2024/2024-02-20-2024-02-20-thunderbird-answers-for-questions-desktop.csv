To do that, I suggest:  - exit thunderbird - copy the profile elsewhere, whether to an external drive or to another place on disk. the profile is at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird  - reinstall thunderbird and exit - copy the saved profile thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the default thunderbird folder - restart thunderbird and everything will be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

View it in a spreadsheet program and compare to the csv file that you want to import.  - adjust the columns in your csv to mirror the columns in the exported csv.  - now the import should go smoothly. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If they are not found online, then your email provider is possibly rejecting them as spam. You might also check with senders to see if they receive messages about their emails not being sent. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
