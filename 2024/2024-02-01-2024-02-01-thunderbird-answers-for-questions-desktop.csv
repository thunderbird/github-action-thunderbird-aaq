But I'll offer some thoughts:  - the View&gt;font size feature is supposed to modify size of Thunderbird text, such as folder list and message list panes.  - the settings pane options for font are to address the size of message text font size.  </p><p>There is an option in config editor (at settings&gt;general  near bottom of that pane) that changes everything. You might try that but be careful.  0. first exit TB and  make a copy of prefs.js, just in case you have problems. This is IMPORTANT 1. Start TB and in settings&gt;general scroll down to config editor on right side.  2. enter  layout.css.devPixelsPerPx   the default is -1.0  try increasing slightly, as it can quickly get too big. try something such a 1.2 or so for starters.  3. If still too small, increase just a tiny amount, such as 1.8 or 2.0.  If you increase to the point that thunderbird is impossible to read because font fills the screen. that is your clue to exit thunderbird, restore the backup of prefs.js and start over. The intent here is to adjust TB font size, not message font size.  </p><p>If that helped, then you can focus on message font size. Info on that is here:  Okay, this may sound strange, but here is the real way to set fonts on Thunderbird. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
