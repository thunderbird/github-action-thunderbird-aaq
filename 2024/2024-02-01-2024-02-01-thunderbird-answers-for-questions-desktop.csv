On reflection however I decided to see what I could find on line about killing; perhaps I could learn something. I found out that I could and did.  I found the following reference: ‘https:// <a href=""http://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/classic-sysadmin-how-to-kill-a-process-from-the-command-line’"" rel=""nofollow"">www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/classic-sysadmin-how-to-kill-a-process-from-the-command-line’</a>.  I learned what a process is in this context, what a PID is and how to be a killer, also in this context.   Before starting the killing I discovered that the PIDs for the same process change from time to time; so I had to  run command ‘ps aux|grep thunderbird’ again.  That step taken I was able successfully to run the following two commands: ‘kill -p 4872’ and ‘kill -p 4897’.  After testing by running the ‘ps’ command again: those two processes did not appear.  “Thanks to you “christ1”; now at my command Thunderbird flies open: problem solved! </p>",cwkheard,false,0,0

But I'll offer some thoughts:  - the View&gt;font size feature is supposed to modify size of Thunderbird text, such as folder list and message list panes.  - the settings pane options for font are to address the size of message text font size.  </p><p>There is an option in config editor (at settings&gt;general  near bottom of that pane) that changes everything. You might try that but be careful.  0. first exit TB and  make a copy of prefs.js, just in case you have problems. This is IMPORTANT 1. Start TB and in settings&gt;general scroll down to config editor on right side.  2. enter  layout.css.devPixelsPerPx   the default is -1.0  try increasing slightly, as it can quickly get too big. try something such a 1.2 or so for starters.  3. If still too small, increase just a tiny amount, such as 1.8 or 2.0.  If you increase to the point that thunderbird is impossible to read because font fills the screen. that is your clue to exit thunderbird, restore the backup of prefs.js and start over. The intent here is to adjust TB font size, not message font size.  </p><p>If that helped, then you can focus on message font size. Info on that is here:  Okay, this may sound strange, but here is the real way to set fonts on Thunderbird. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,2,0

I set up a different Thunderbird instance connected to 2 gmail accounts and the results are in fact different. In this case I do see the ""OpenPGP"" badge where you indicated and it implies that the message verified (it gives a notice about a mismatch because the sending address is different than the address listed on the key, and I assume that it would also [or instead] mention that the signature failed to verify if that were the case). </p><p>Another difference is the number of attachments. When using the protonmail accounts I get 2 attachments, one with the public key and one with the signature. With gmail only the public key is attached. I'm not sure what is causing this difference, but it seems likely to be related. </p><p>Protonmail has a guide for setting up the bridge with Thunderbird but doesn't mention anything about PGP keys. Probably because most people probably use the Protonmail-generated PGP keys and aren't trying to do separate signatures/encryption before sending. I'll post here if I'm able to find any more information or get it working. </p>",skyvine,false,0,0

I'm not sure what the right thing to do here is because I could see spoofability from checking all signatures or checking only one specific signature. Probably the UX needs to be updated to provide information about multiple signatures when they are present. But I'm not a Thunderbird developer and have no idea how much work that would take, or how common this use-case is. On the Protonmail side, they could let me upload a secondary public key as valid and only sign it with the Protonmail-generated key when the message is not already signed; again, I am not a Protonmail developer. </p><p>So for the moment at least it seems the answer is ""Protonmail and Thunderbird are currently incompatible if you want to sign messages from your computer"", and probably Protonmail is incompatible with this workflow generally unless other clients handle this situation better. </p>",skyvine,false,1,0
