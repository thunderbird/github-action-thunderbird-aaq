Whilst it is possible to access then via their specific accounts held with Microsoft this is time consuming,hence the preference of Thunderbirdb which up until now has been trouble free for approx 15 years. This unnecessary development makes me wonder why I only need a user naame aand password to access via Microsoft. I have tried every method kindly provided by other users to no avail. Can anyone provide the correct server setting for both IMAP and SMTP? As I have said these 'new' authentification/s are in my opinion tantamount to using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.
