My old email address was [edited] @fidnet.com. MY new email address is [edited] @gmail.com. I need to get Thunderbird on my new email.  I have already paid for additional security under my old email address. How do I get thunderbird for my new email and transfer the additional security to it?  I have been searching google on how to accomplish this and it is as clear as mud. I am not technically savvy, therefore need human support. I do not have a record of a password for my account. Please call or email me with information in laymanâ€™s terms of how to make the transfer to my gmail.
