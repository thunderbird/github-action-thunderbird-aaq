The solution was to change the smtp Outgoing settings, which works but only once: Telstra (email provider) recently upgraded it's security and the Outgoing Server details needed changing to ""<a href=""http://smtp.telstra.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.telstra.com</a>"" with Port 465, SSL/TLS, Normal Password, user name. The old default Outgoing Server was <a href=""http://smtp.bigpond.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.bigpond.com</a> etc. </p><p>I deleted all the old Outgoing Server details and changed the old ""<a href=""http://smtp.bigpond.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.bigpond.com</a>"" to ""<a href=""http://smtp.telstra.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.telstra.com</a>"" etc as the default. All was fine, emails could now be sent. The problem is that when Thunderbird is closed and reopened all the old smtp settings are being restored and the new SMTP settings removed/deleted. Emails now can't be sent again until the smtp settings are changed back to <a href=""http://smtp.telstra.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.telstra.com</a> etc. I've tried the advanced option and removed old smtp settings but that didn't work. Each time Thunderbird is closed the new Outgoing SMTP settings are overwritten by the old values. Is there somewhere on the C drive that I can access to delete the old settings manually or some other solution? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",snowski
