The problem has existed for a couple of days now and is confusing as some emails are sent and others fail. I am receiving mail OK.  Details of my setup are&nbsp;:- I am using a HP All-in-one desktop running Windows 11 with Norton 360. My Thunderbird account settings:  Server type: IMAP mail server  User name: ****@gmail.com  Server name: <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> Port: 993  Connection Security: SSL/TLS  Authentication: OAuth2  Outgoing Server (SMTP): Google Mail – <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> (Default)  User name: ****@gmail.com  Port: 465  Connection Security: SSL/TLS Authentication: OAuth2  </p><p>The problem: I only recently set up Thunderbird and at first it seemed to working OK. However, now when I try to send a message, after some time, I the following error message&nbsp;:- </p><p>""Send Error Message Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> timed out. Try again."" </p><p>What is particularly confusing is that some messages are being sent. I have tried several fixes that I found from the Mozilla, Google and Norton web sites but none of the fixes resolved the issue. Any assistance would be very much appreciated.  </p><p>Regards Mike </p><p>PS: I have 2 email accounts set up in Thunderbird. I just tried sending a test message from the Gmail account to the Bigpond account. From the Gmail account it appears to have been sent but in the Bigpond account an error message appeared as follows&nbsp;:- </p><p>""Could not connect to the mail server <a href=""http://smtp.telstra.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.telstra.com</a>; the connection was refused."" </p><p>I don't know if this is a related issue or I have another one to resolve. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1655248;,MikeF48
