If this folder exists, then click any folder inside it and look for a file called abook.sqlite. That would be the addressbook. If File Explorer does not let you view the folders, you can click View&gt;Show&gt;Hidden items  in File Explorer. The folders will be there if all you did was uninstall Thunderbird, but there is a final prompt on an uninstall on whether to keep data, so it's possible you may have deleted it.   </p><p>If you have done a new install, there may be more than one folder in the Profiles folder, so look for the oldest and largest abook.sqlite. Let me know if you need more assistance. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you ever decide again to leave Apple, please post your questions with some detail on whatever the issue is. You obviously had a problem, but it's not in your posts.

So, from the top:  </p><p>1) I had 3 Apple-mail email accounts which were misbehaving 2) I saw that Thunderbird, which I used to use a long time ago, had come back to life. So I switched two of my email accounts over to Thunderbird Result: Whoops, I could only send mail on a single Thunderbird email account. The second email account simply wouldn't send </p><p>3) I looked on Thunderbird's support pages and realized I was not alone and that the ""answer"" seemed to be to delete the existing Thunderbird email accounts and start from scratch. (Which I refuse to do.)  Result: For the moment I'm returning to Apple mail as the problem I had been having has gone away </p><p>Observation: The ""automatic"" setup for Thunderbird works like a charm, so long as you want ONE email account. If you want more than a single email account, then a set-up recipe or other documentation would be lovely as it would prevent users from screwing up their settings </p>",seh1593,false,0,0
