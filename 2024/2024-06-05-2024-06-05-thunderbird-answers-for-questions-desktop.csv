It does not think; it sends requests for mail to the assigned mail servers and waits for the response. That's as intelligent as it gets. It's like sending a child with an envelope to the post office to deposit in the outgoing mail slot. Whatever happens next is due to the post office. Same goes for Thunderbird. I regularly see posts from users, complaining about decisions that Thunderbird makes. Yet it does not; it is a simple messenger. An excellent one, in that it reliably tells you whatever info it received back from server. But switching servers? It's not that creative.&nbsp;:)  Anyway, I'm glad that all worked well for you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What is the best way to fix this? </blockquote> <p>Toss the Revo product in the bin.  Everyone I have seen on this forum that has used it has made their issues worse by using it.  I have recommended folks reinstall Thunderbird to fix a problem perhaps 10 time a year over the last 10 years and that is always around messed up updates (platform version incompatibilities) or system integration issues. </p><p>Thunderbird is specifically designed as a cross platform program to not use the windows registry for general application settings and the retain the user profile between installs.  So a reinstall is basically going to change nothing. </p><p>By using third party uninstallers you get the satisfaction of doing it your way,  but you also get the burden of recovering any data you deleted in the process that you wanted to keep (your profile with mail and contacts particularly.)

Don't do it. </p><p>If through some miracle you still have you original setup post reinstall  I don't know how but you are saying things that makes me think you did not do a full removal with revo. What exactly is the issue you are trying to fix? </p><p>This weeks apparent popular issue in this forum is Nortons antivirus.  I have had a number of folk that could not get mail and and being warned of potential security issues ahead in Thunderbird. Removing Norton fixed all of their issues with Thunderbird.

When thunderbird is uninstalled, it politely leaves the profile. If you want a full reinstall from scratch, you need to delete the profile after the uninstall. To do that, first ininstall thunderbird, and then locate c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird and delete the thunderbird folder.

But the Spell Check Window covers that up as it blocks the middle of the email body.  It can't be moved in Thunderbird for Mac.  A previous post - now archived - suggested a left click on the (spell check?) window title area would allow moving the window. But that only works on ... Windows ... because it certainly does NOT work on a Mac. No click-drag, left or right, resulted in un-anchoring the spell check window from the center of the email body.  One example is when I used the word Add-ons. The spell check stopped at ""ons"", wanting to correct it to ""one"". If ""ons"" was by itself, I could see that. But I couldn't know that it referred to ""ons"" from Add-ons because the spell-check window covered that text. </blockquote> <p>I don't use anything apple,  so I can't try it for you.
