If this folder exists, then click any folder inside it and look for a file called abook.sqlite. That would be the addressbook. If File Explorer does not let you view the folders, you can click View&gt;Show&gt;Hidden items  in File Explorer. The folders will be there if all you did was uninstall Thunderbird, but there is a final prompt on an uninstall on whether to keep data, so it's possible you may have deleted it.   </p><p>If you have done a new install, there may be more than one folder in the Profiles folder, so look for the oldest and largest abook.sqlite. Let me know if you need more assistance. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So, from the top:  </p><p>1) I had 3 Apple-mail email accounts which were misbehaving 2) I saw that Thunderbird, which I used to use a long time ago, had come back to life. So I switched two of my email accounts over to Thunderbird Result: Whoops, I could only send mail on a single Thunderbird email account. The second email account simply wouldn't send </p><p>3) I looked on Thunderbird's support pages and realized I was not alone and that the ""answer"" seemed to be to delete the existing Thunderbird email accounts and start from scratch. (Which I refuse to do.)  Result: For the moment I'm returning to Apple mail as the problem I had been having has gone away </p><p>Observation: The ""automatic"" setup for Thunderbird works like a charm, so long as you want ONE email account. If you want more than a single email account, then a set-up recipe or other documentation would be lovely as it would prevent users from screwing up their settings </p>",seh1593,false,0,0

My guess -- and it's just that -- is that this may have been your issue. Had you posted that, I'm sure someone could have assisted as, although it's somewhat rare, we've seen it enough to discern the problem. And the fix is a simple one. Anyway, thanks for sharing and best wishes with Apple. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It does not think; it sends requests for mail to the assigned mail servers and waits for the response. That's as intelligent as it gets. It's like sending a child with an envelope to the post office to deposit in the outgoing mail slot. Whatever happens next is due to the post office. Same goes for Thunderbird. I regularly see posts from users, complaining about decisions that Thunderbird makes. Yet it does not; it is a simple messenger. An excellent one, in that it reliably tells you whatever info it received back from server. But switching servers? It's not that creative.&nbsp;:)  Anyway, I'm glad that all worked well for you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
