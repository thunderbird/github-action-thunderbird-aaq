When I reply or forward that message, the message composition window appears with the same red background colour, and with black text. The resulting black text on a red background is hard to read.  </p><p>How can I change the background colour of the reply or forwarded message which I am composing? How can I override the background colour set by the sender in the original message? </p><p>Note that I am asking about the background colour of a message which was set by the sender. I am not asking about how to set the default colour of messages I compose from scratch. Nor am I asking about how to set the background colour of Thunderbird windows or UI elements. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",JDLH
