I've just noticed no emails have come in in the last 6 days. I tried to send myself an email (from another account) which confirmed it wasn't working. I have unlimited storage so it's not a storage issue.  Can you help me solve the problem? Thank you Anna </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1685800;,annamado

User complained about thunderbird freezing up. She sent me a whatsapp screenshot when she opened up the program. It prompted her for a new name/username/password. </p><p>My first instinct was to determine the location of the email data and make a backup copy of it which i did. appdata\roaming\thunderbird\herprofile folder+default folder + the .ini files. </p><p>I have tried: </p><p>-review her SSD - no bad sectors -review cpu temps - all normal -review memory - stable - no errors </p><p>-copying the data away , remove thunderbird completely and reinstall it fresh after reboot. -did a new profile creation and could connect to her live mail servers. -afterwards did an edit of the .ini files to point to the correct folders&nbsp;; the moment i do this , i am again prompted to setup a brand new name/username/password&nbsp;; as if the process restarts. -what is interesting , is that when i modify the .ini files , her contacts are perfectly viewable&nbsp;; thus they are correctly accessed from the profile folders. -i tried the trouble shooter and tried to change folders to the profile folders&nbsp;; no change. </p><p>Out of pure desperation , i did an mbox to PST conversion , and luckily , all of her mail was perfectly exported to pst. She is now on outlook but it it is a dated version. She wants her thunderbird working. </p><p>The app is on the latest version and as a test , i even did a n-1 version download to test - no success. </p><p>It is just as if thunderbird is not happy to accept the actual mail content itself&nbsp;; it just bounces back to the setup prompts of a new account. IF you complete it , the old data is never presented. I have also tried thunderbird.exe -p&nbsp;; to make a new profile from there but no go there as well. </p><p>Any ideas? Any suggestions? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jannie.laubscher
