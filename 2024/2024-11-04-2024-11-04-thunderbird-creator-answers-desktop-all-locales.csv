I've just noticed no emails have come in in the last 6 days. I tried to send myself an email (from another account) which confirmed it wasn't working. I have unlimited storage so it's not a storage issue.  Can you help me solve the problem? Thank you Anna </p>,thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",annamado
