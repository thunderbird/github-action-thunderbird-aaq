I can access the custom domain email account using my iOS/iPhone, and have been using it for awhile, so I believe it's setup correctly at Apple's server end. </p><p>When I enter my email username into Thunderbird to setup the new account, it apparently correctly finds the configurations: IMAP SSL/TLS <a href=""http://imap.mail.me.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.me.com</a> for incoming, and SMTP STARTTTLS <a href=""http://smtp.mail.me.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.me.com</a> for outgoing.  But alas, Thunderbird always then complains: ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" </p><p>Any tips/ideas what I am doing wrong?  I do have Two-Factor-Authentication setup with Apple, and I've registered an App-Specific-Password that I enter into Thunderbird when attempting to setup the new account.  I done this maybe 10 times now and always get the same ""Unable to log in"" error. </p><p>Is Thunderbird unable to handle iCloud+ custom domains? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",kaiserinst
