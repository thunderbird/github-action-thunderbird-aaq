I can access the custom domain email account using my iOS/iPhone, and have been using it for awhile, so I believe it's setup correctly at Apple's server end. </p><p>When I enter my email username into Thunderbird to setup the new account, it apparently correctly finds the configurations: IMAP SSL/TLS <a href=""http://imap.mail.me.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.me.com</a> for incoming, and SMTP STARTTTLS <a href=""http://smtp.mail.me.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.me.com</a> for outgoing.  But alas, Thunderbird always then complains: ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" </p><p>Any tips/ideas what I am doing wrong?  I do have Two-Factor-Authentication setup with Apple, and I've registered an App-Specific-Password that I enter into Thunderbird when attempting to setup the new account.  I done this maybe 10 times now and always get the same ""Unable to log in"" error. </p><p>Is Thunderbird unable to handle iCloud+ custom domains? </p>",other;needsinfo;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1628606;,kaiserinst

I use Google mail via the Google IMAP server. </p><p>For the past two weeks, response times have been very slow. There are several problems that I see: </p><p>(1) When I select a folder, it takes time for the folder to load. Loading used to be instantaneous under previous versions of Thunderbird. Now it is unacceptably slow. </p><p>(2) An incoming mail message shows up in my Inbox, but when I click on it, I get a ""Loading Message"" message and it takes many minutes (e.g.,  more than 5 minutes) to actually load. Note that I can see the message in Google Gmail web interface, but it takes time to show up in Thunderbird. </p><p>(3) When I move a message from my Inbox to a folder, the message reappers in my Inbox. Sometimes I have to move it twice; other times it eventually goes away. </p><p>I am pretty sure you will me this is a problem with Google's IMAP server. But I have not been able to find any reports on Google problems. You might also claim it is my Internet connection, but accessing the Outlook server for my university via IMAP is not showing the same latency. </p><p>I know from the information provided, it is going to be difficult to advise me on this. I also consider myself a fairly advanced user (I do about 30,000 emails per year and generate about 10G of email per year). I have tried things like disabling the calendar and clearing the disk cache - these were suggested by others facing similar problems. Unfortunately they didn't work. </p><p>Any advice would be appreciated. I am close to considering moving to another mail tool because performance has been so troublesome. I hope this is either a Google IMAP problem or some other external issue. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",picone
