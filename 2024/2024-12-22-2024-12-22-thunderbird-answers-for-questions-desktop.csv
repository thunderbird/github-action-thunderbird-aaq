But when installing Norton Safe Email, which is now recommended by Norton, the blocking message ""This email provider is not supported"" appeared after entering my email address, so that the final download of the new program component was not possible. So I turned to Symantec Norton and got the answer: ""I'm really sorry to inform you that your email address does not support our Norton Safe Email because your email provider is not compatible with our Norton Safe Email program.""
