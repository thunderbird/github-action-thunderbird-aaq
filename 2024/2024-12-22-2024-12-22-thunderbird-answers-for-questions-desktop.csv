So I turned to Symantec Norton and got the answer: ""I'm really sorry to inform you that your email address does not support our Norton Safe Email because your email provider is not compatible with our Norton Safe Email program.""

TB attaches a file to an email and faithfully transmits the file. It has no inbuilt capacity to degrade a file. Unlike when you upload an image, say, on FB.

I presume), and I just informed them they could close my support case - literally - today, after running error- and crash-free for about 5 days. Props to you and Mapenzi for helping me sort through this, as it was a learning experience in many ways, beyond changing, moving, and backing up TB profiles during testing.
