Il file PST è di 4,5 GB circa ma la posta vera e propria è di 671 MB di questo sono sicuro perché ho eseguito un backup con la procedura guidata.  Ho trovato una guida su come importare in Thunderbird il formato EML ( come accennavi anche tu) ma MS Outlook non esporta in quel formato nella guida ( posso anche mettere il link eventualmente) dicono  </p><p>""Nella prima pagina della procedura guidata, scegliere file delle cartelle personali da cui si desidera estrarre le email, specificare la directory dove saranno inseriti i file estratti, e come il formato di destinazione scegliere “EML – Prospettive Espresso (RFC822)”. </p><p>Io durante l'esportazione guidata ho solo 2 formati di esportazione per cui mi sono arenato anche qui, ho tentato un escamotage rinominando il file Backup.pst in Backup.eml e ho provato ad importalo in Thunderbird tramite l'addons ImportExportTools ma come mi aspettavo mi dice che il formato non è corretto. </p><p>Ora cercherò di suddividere il pst e vedere cosa succede.

You send me an email.  Within seconds,  before Thunderbird has taken down it's sending dialog sometimes, it has been delivered to the recipient domain.  Then hours or days later that domain sends out nothing,  but a mail server sends an email from a mail client purporting to be from the domain bouncing the email.  This whole bouncing thing sounds really good,  until you realize the server bounces mail,  not a mail client.  This process in effect confirms that not only is there an email address (the original delivery was accepted) but someone is actively messing with the spam and therefore probably reading at least some of it.  THe perfect person to send more spam to.  They are at least looking at it. </p><p>Have a read about how legitimate delivery failure notices from spam lists can get folk blacklisted before you embarque on anything so pointless in the future as replying to a spam email.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_(email)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_(email)</a> </p><p>You want a better solution.  Write to your elected representative and demand change.  Australia legislated some 20 years ago on the subject and SPAM almost ceased overnight.

Not only is the USA CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 too limited to be of much use, <strong>it is not enforced at any level of U.S. government</strong>, as far as I know. </p><p>As to the Wikipedia article, it says, in part: <em>Measures to reduce the problem include avoiding the need for a bounce message by doing most rejections at the initial SMTP connection stage; and for other cases, sending bounce messages only to addresses which can be reliably judged not to have been forged, and in those cases the sender cannot be verified, thus ignoring the message (i.e., dropping it).</em> </p><p>I'm wondering how to turn this advice into reality. How should the SMTP dialog be changed to detect and defeat spam email? Existing SMTP libraries already do various checks, but they may not be enough to detect spammers, who frequently create phone email accounts based on compromised email addresses or website pages. And I really don't see how Thunderbird can help, since it apparently does not have any user control over its SMTP dialog during email sending. </p><p>Can I, as an end user, make such changes to the SMTP dialog of any email sender? Or does this suggestion require a wider design and implementation? </p>",David536,false,0,0

All of those major updates - v91, then v102, then v115, and so - have had various changes. Some of those changes involved format changes for files such as those used by address book.  </p><p>It might seem a bit long winded, but it means you can get each stage done so it's in a state which the next update is ready to use.  I would advise that you create a backup of your Thunderbird profile. if you use Windows OS and default location for storage then it will be here: C://Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> You must exit Thunderbird before you create the backup. See image below which shows you how to locate the 'Thunderbird' folder. </p><p>You would need to get a copy of that <strong>Thunderbird</strong> folder and paste it somewhere appropriate to act as a backup eg: on D: Drive or create a folder on Desktop and call it 'TB-Backup' - in that folder create another folder which has the version number as folder name and put the copied 'Thunderbird' folder into that eg: 'TB-v78' folder. </p><p>After each update if everything is working ok - I would suggest you perform a backup again. In 'TB-Backup' create a new folder with the new version number eg: 'TB-v91' and put another copy of 'Thunderbird' folder into it. Repeat this until you get up to date. Assuming all is working ok. The last version will be whatever is current eg: 128.3.0 If all still ok create the last backup - then you can delete all the other backups and finally empty the Computer Recycle Bin. </p><p>When it comes to installing old versions, I'll suggest specific versions because a few gremlins were being ironed out when each new major version was first released, so these versions were the first ones which were released as an upgrade. Remember to uninstall just the Thunderbird program before installing new version. </p><p><strong>Version 91.1.2</strong> </p> <ul><li> <a href=""http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/91.1.2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/91.1.2/</a> </li></ul> <p><strong>Version 102.2.0</strong> </p> <ul><li> <a href=""http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.2.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.2.0/</a> </li></ul> <p><strong>Version 115.2.3</strong> </p> <ul><li> <a href=""http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/115.2.3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/115.2.3/</a> </li></ul> <p>When you use those links, you then need to click on appropriate OS eg: win64 Then choose your prefered language eg: en-GB for English British Finally click on the exe file link eg: Thunderbird Setup 91.1.2.exe  to download. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
