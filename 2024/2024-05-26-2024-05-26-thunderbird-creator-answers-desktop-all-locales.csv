I download with IMAP and upload with SMTP.  TB did a great job downloading gobs of email from Gmail and converting the labels into folders.  In a couple cases, it created folders, but none of the emails with that label were downloaded into the folder.  FOr example, there is a folder 'PE' and a subfolder "" CD Ads'.  Emails are present in both.  However, in TB, 'PE' is lighter grey and italicized and empty.   </p><p>The folder structure is not an exact match to the label structure.  For example, in the labels, I have an 'Employment' label with 5 employers underneath it.  None of the employers made it into TB. </p><p>I have a few other oddities too, but lets start with these.  I did end up using a normal password to access the account, as 0Auth2 would not cooperate. </p><p>Thanks for you insites! </p><p>Cheers --Mark </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1654469;,mark.w.abbott

The old one was getting slow and \i worried about it failing.  I am old, and have been slow about getting programs on to the new computer.  I got Firefox installed right away, and after a week or two got Thunderbird installed.  My problem has been with Thunderbird.  On the new computer shortly after I got it installed, all of my incoming mails disappeared.  So I went back to using the old computer for email.  It was ok.  This was several weeks ago.  Suddenly this evening all of my emails on the old computer disappeared from the inbox of one of my two email accounts, the one I use most.  Now it has totally locked up.  Still that way after shutting it down and rebooting.   I have looked through the help files and didn't find anything  like my problem.  I do know that I have never deleted messages.  My computers both use imap.  I switched from pop a few years ago when Mozilla suggested the change.  Going to bed now.  will check email in the morning, to see if it will work. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",pkrumm

Io gradirei avere il più recente in alto e non in basso. Ho seguito una guida trovata sul vostro sito che dice di cambiare da 1 a 2 l'impostazione avanzata, nell'editor di configurazione, mailnews.default_news_sort_order, ma non cambia nulla. I messaggi dall'alto in basso sono ordinati dal più vecchio al più recente.  Cosa posso fare per risolvere questo problema? Il mio PC ha windows 11. Grazie </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,"",apatri
