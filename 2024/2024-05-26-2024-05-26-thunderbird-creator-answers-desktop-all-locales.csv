I download with IMAP and upload with SMTP.  TB did a great job downloading gobs of email from Gmail and converting the labels into folders.  In a couple cases, it created folders, but none of the emails with that label were downloaded into the folder.  FOr example, there is a folder 'PE' and a subfolder "" CD Ads'.  Emails are present in both.  However, in TB, 'PE' is lighter grey and italicized and empty.   </p><p>The folder structure is not an exact match to the label structure.  For example, in the labels, I have an 'Employment' label with 5 employers underneath it.  None of the employers made it into TB. </p><p>I have a few other oddities too, but lets start with these.  I did end up using a normal password to access the account, as 0Auth2 would not cooperate. </p><p>Thanks for you insites! </p><p>Cheers --Mark </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1654469;,mark.w.abbott

The old one was getting slow and \i worried about it failing.  I am old, and have been slow about getting programs on to the new computer.  I got Firefox installed right away, and after a week or two got Thunderbird installed.  My problem has been with Thunderbird.  On the new computer shortly after I got it installed, all of my incoming mails disappeared.  So I went back to using the old computer for email.  It was ok.  This was several weeks ago.  Suddenly this evening all of my emails on the old computer disappeared from the inbox of one of my two email accounts, the one I use most.  Now it has totally locked up.  Still that way after shutting it down and rebooting.   I have looked through the help files and didn't find anything  like my problem.  I do know that I have never deleted messages.  My computers both use imap.  I switched from pop a few years ago when Mozilla suggested the change.  Going to bed now.  will check email in the morning, to see if it will work. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",pkrumm

I later replied to say that the problem had gone away. This proved to be very short lived. The problem is that drop-down menus are blank. Thus clicking on ""New Message"" button produces a minimised blank dialog. Thus I am unable to send new e-mails. Clicking on other links such as help, tools, file etc produces narrow blank dialogs. I am able to continue receiving and reading incoming e-mails. Re-starting the computer sometimes produces a short term improvement. I am using an AMD 6 core CPU 32-bit operating system, x64-based processor I am trying to use Thunderbird 115.9 on Windows 10. It used to work, but the recent, continuing malfunction might be due to an automatic update, but I was not aware of the version number until the malfunction happened.   </p><p>Kenneth Whiteley </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1654533;,ksw40
