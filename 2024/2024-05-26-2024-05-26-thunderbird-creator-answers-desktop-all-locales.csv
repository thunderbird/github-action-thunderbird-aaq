E.g., melissa would be found in the email address or subject but not in the body of an email and the window comes up blank.  I have only run into this in recent editions of TB.

I download with IMAP and upload with SMTP.  TB did a great job downloading gobs of email from Gmail and converting the labels into folders.  In a couple cases, it created folders, but none of the emails with that label were downloaded into the folder.  FOr example, there is a folder 'PE' and a subfolder "" CD Ads'.  Emails are present in both.  However, in TB, 'PE' is lighter grey and italicized and empty.   </p><p>The folder structure is not an exact match to the label structure.  For example, in the labels, I have an 'Employment' label with 5 employers underneath it.  None of the employers made it into TB. </p><p>I have a few other oddities too, but lets start with these.  I did end up using a normal password to access the account, as 0Auth2 would not cooperate. </p><p>Thanks for you insites! </p><p>Cheers --Mark </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",mark.w.abbott
