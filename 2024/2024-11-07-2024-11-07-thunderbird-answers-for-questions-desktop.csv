In each folder will be accounts, followed by message folders. There may be duplicates in each profile, depending on whether you changed profiles while using the same account. For example, a POP account would appear such as Mail\&lt;POPaccountname&gt;inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf etc. the msf files are not needed as they are just indexes that thunderbird would automatically rebuid. SO, browse the profiles, looking for the accounts and identify which (usually be most recent update) that interest you.  Then, start thunderbird, install the addon, importexporttools, if not already installed  create a Local Folder for each message folder that looks desirable.folder name should be one that will help you identify the profile and timeframe from which you retrieved the messages.  then, highlight the folder, rightclick, and select the importexport option to import mbox and then locate and select one of the message folders.  repeat this for all such message folders. you will now have retrieved all the messages.  This work is not complicated, and does not need an expert. what it needs is detailed record-keeping of the various message folders and then the time to review the various message folders for whatever you wish to retain. If more assistance is needed, let us know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
