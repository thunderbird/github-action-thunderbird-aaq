It is possible to remove and re-add an email account to Thunderbird without affecting other Thunderbird clients or losing data from calendar, contacts, etc if they are stored locally. You can remove the email account by going to Account Settings -&gt; Account Actions -&gt; Remove Account and then add it again by going to Account Settings -&gt; Account Actions -&gt; Add Mail Account and following the instructions. If you cannot afford to lose your calendar, contacts, etc I would export a copy just in case. </p>",bbonacci,false,1,0

Simply add the new account to the same Thunderbird profile, next to the old one, then you can migrate to your hearts content using the add-on, or directly by selecting multiple messages and moving or copying them over in small batches of about 2000 messages at a time. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

Thunderbird is not some collection of component you can install piecemeal,  it is a single piece of software with various functions.  Thunderbird is software installed on your computer.  What it transfers to other locations on the internet is entirely configurable within it's need to actually function.  That is to get mail it has to send your user name and password to your mail provider etc. To look up your email providers settings it has to send enough information to the sources it can get the information from to determine that the setting can connect to the mail server. </p><p>I think I have already spent more time on trying to explain what is a simple privacy statement which you apparently do not understand.  I suggest you actually read it again and ask specific questions about the things you do not understand instead of lumping in a single statement ""fast and loose personal data collection and flinging about "" as I feel that is so far from what the document says as to verge on complete fiction. </p><p>You can use Thunderbird without setting up an email address. It will be largely crippled as it's primary function is as a mail client,  not an RSS reader.  But that is your choice.  I don't have to put up with it.  Likewise you can use Thunderbird as an RSS reader,  but I don't understand why anyone would use Thunderbird solely as an RSS reader.  There are plenty of probably better dedicated readers out there if you are only going to use the RSS parts. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
