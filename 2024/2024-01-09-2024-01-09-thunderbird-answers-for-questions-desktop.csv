It is possible to remove and re-add an email account to Thunderbird without affecting other Thunderbird clients or losing data from calendar, contacts, etc if they are stored locally. You can remove the email account by going to Account Settings -&gt; Account Actions -&gt; Remove Account and then add it again by going to Account Settings -&gt; Account Actions -&gt; Add Mail Account and following the instructions. If you cannot afford to lose your calendar, contacts, etc I would export a copy just in case. </p>",bbonacci,false,0,0

Since I didn't needed to access all of the e-mails all the time, I needed just to store them for compliance reasons.

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
