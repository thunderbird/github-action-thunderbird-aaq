In mid-Jan I did a ""clean"" install of Windows and installed Thunderbird. Due to a corrupted Windows installation, I had to do another ""clean"" install of Windows 10 Pro. Today I installed Thunderbird version 115.9.0. Everything went well. However, I don't have access to my old - pre-mid Jan profile - which has e-mails and contacts I need to access. <strong>Here's my setup:</strong> Thunderbird installed in D:\Thunderbird New Thunderbird profile is in M:\Thunderbird Old Thunderbird profile is in M:\Thunderbird-OLD </p><p>How do I migrate/import the old messages, address book/contacts, and find out which extension I had installed? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1646093;,paulp575123

In the middle of checking emails the laptop just switched off unexpectedly (still don't know why). I restarted the laptop and was prompted to do a disk check which I did then it booted up fine. I started Thunderbird again but it came up as setting up a new account not recognizing my existing profile accounts which are multiple. I've spent hours searching for a solution, which led me to the prefs.js issue. I followed some instructions to rename the prefs-1.js file which I did and it partially worked but not to my original settings and all accounts. I then copied and renamed an older backup version of the prefs.js file which also worked but then included accounts I didn't have anymore. I'm trying to get back my original prefs.js settings but don't know how to or if it's possible at all.  </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1646242;,sesik1

You're saying the folder is unthreaded, yet the messages appear threaded by subject. Maybe some other voluhteer on the forum will offer some insight."" All the threading help is oriented to something I can set on the menu bar that also includes Date, From, Size, etc.  I wish my threading problem was that easy.  Threading is not chosen, never has been.  Then suddenly April 2, 2024 6:30pm est, all my e-mails that had a thread got threaded, with arrows showing up in the subject of the e-mails. There is a symbol on a different bar with choices like Sort By --&gt; Threaded or unthreaded.  All this does is hide e-mails that are even threaded or unthreaded, but it shows that what happened to me is also called ""threaded.""  The term ""threaded"" has two meanings or definitions or uses or whatever, which makes asking for help all the more difficult.  People keep telling me about the menu when I have a choice of threading, not realizing, as I think David didn't, that threading is also elsewhere in the thunderbird software. And when I choose to show threaded, that e-mail I was sending on April 2 does not show up, but if I search for the file, it does show up.  So it is there, but invisible.  This whole threading situation just gets worse and worse.  I need that file in particular, as it happens. Thanks to anyone who read all this. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1646230;1646400;1646430;,nuffsaid1
