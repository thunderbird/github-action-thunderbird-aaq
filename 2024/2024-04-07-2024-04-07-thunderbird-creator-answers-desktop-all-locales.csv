I started Thunderbird again but it came up as setting up a new account not recognizing my existing profile accounts which are multiple. I've spent hours searching for a solution, which led me to the prefs.js issue. I followed some instructions to rename the prefs-1.js file which I did and it partially worked but not to my original settings and all accounts. I then copied and renamed an older backup version of the prefs.js file which also worked but then included accounts I didn't have anymore.

Threading is not chosen, never has been.  Then suddenly April 2, 2024 6:30pm est, all my e-mails that had a thread got threaded, with arrows showing up in the subject of the e-mails. </p><p>There is a symbol on a different bar with choices like Sort By --&gt; Threaded or unthreaded.  All this does is hide e-mails that are even threaded or unthreaded, but it shows that what happened to me is also called ""threaded.""  The term ""threaded"" has two meanings or definitions or uses or whatever, which makes asking for help all the more difficult.  People keep telling me about the menu when I have a choice of threading, not realizing, as I think David didn't, that threading is also elsewhere in the thunderbird software. </p><p>And when I choose to show threaded, that e-mail I was sending on April 2 does not show up, but if I search for the file, it does show up.  So it is there, but invisible.  This whole threading situation just gets worse and worse.
