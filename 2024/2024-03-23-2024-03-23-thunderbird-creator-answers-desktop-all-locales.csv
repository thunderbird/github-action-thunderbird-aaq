The problem appears to only exist when I send from my desktop, not using webmail. All had been working fine prior to a few days ago. Emails without attachments send fine. Incoming emails (with and without attachments are also fine). I have had several discussions with my internet service provider who claim there is no issue at their end. I have checked my account/server settings in Thunderbird and all seems correct there. I'm using the POP mail server, if that is relevant. Any thoughts or suggestions welcome. Not being able to send emails with attachments if a major impediment. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",grantdixon
