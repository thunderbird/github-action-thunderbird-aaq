The problem appears to only exist when I send from my desktop, not using webmail. All had been working fine prior to a few days ago. Emails without attachments send fine. Incoming emails (with and without attachments are also fine). I have had several discussions with my internet service provider who claim there is no issue at their end. I have checked my account/server settings in Thunderbird and all seems correct there. I'm using the POP mail server, if that is relevant. Any thoughts or suggestions welcome. Not being able to send emails with attachments if a major impediment. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1643638;1643655;,grantdixon

I would like not to export ALL accounts in ONE zip file but I want to have different zips. Is that possible? Why do I want that? I am active in 3 different organisations and I have a private account and - it can almost not be avoided - a google mail account. So when I look for a certain mail I know which zip I have to import and to look for it. Years ago I used MS outlook and I had the possibility to create archives as defined for each account and - if necessary and wanted - for each year. Is this also possible in Thunderbird? If yes HOW?

Jenže, při pokusu o ""donate"" jsem byl znechucen nutností vyplnit nechutně dlouhou řadu osobních údajů. Byl jsem však mile překvapen, že jste nechtěli moje datum narození, rodné číslo a číslo občanského průkazu. Možná, kdybych vyplnil předchozí údaje o bydlišti (jako by číslo karty a jméno držitele nestačilo), následoval by dotaz na rodné číslo. Ne, pánové, opravdu ne. V dnešní době vyžadovat tolik osobních údajů, které ani nejsou třeba k obyčejné platbě... Chápu, že při finanční kontrole musíte doložit své příjmy. Ale kdyby jste zkusili PayPal nebo ideálně Google Pay, věřím, že darů by se Vám sešlo mnohonásobně více. Možná by se hodilo šikovné tlačítko ""donate"" přímo v Mozille. Místa je tam pro něj dost. Přes Google Pay bych Vám moc rád přispěl. Ale takhle ne. Takhle Vám za Vaši práci mohu jedině poděkovat! Takže Vám za Vaši práci děkuji!

1443088,2024-03-23 12:15:14 -0700,2024-03-23 22:32:35 -0700,Problem With Thunderbird Downloading New Email Messages from Server,"<p>My Thunderbird email client application is connected to two different family email accounts.  One account works as usual but recently the second experiences a connection problem.  It sometimes takes as long as ten minutes before a new email message in the server's inbox is picked up by the Thunderbird client and downloaded to the Thunderbird inbox. I have a suspicion it may be related to another Thunderbird symptom described below: At the lower right corner of the display is a blue ""progress"" bar.  Sometimes it is a solid bar displaying progress in a typical manner. But during the long wait for new email to be downloaded from the server, it is a non-solid bar that is alternating back and forth.  It appears that it may be working on something (similar to the circles in some applications that go round and round while working). If I click on the bar when it is in this mode I get the pop-up display described below: The pop-up box title is ""Activity Manager"" and it says the activity is ""Indexing Messages"". This message also contains a ""progress bar"" that is forever at the very beginning of its range. Further information just below the bar says ""Indexing 73 of 1,067 messages in Sent Items (6% complete)."" Several weeks ago this message was at 17 messages. So it appears to have indexed 66 sent messages in several weeks.  If this is what it interrupting the prompt downloading of new email, I won't live long enough for my system to be right. </p><p>Can anyone guess what might be going on? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1643821;,dhaag27
