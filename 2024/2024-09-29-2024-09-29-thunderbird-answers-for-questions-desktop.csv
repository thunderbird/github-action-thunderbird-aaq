Last night:  closed all my applications (including Thunderbird) then shutdown my computer. 2. This morning:  Powered up my computer; the startup process automatically opens Thunderbird. 3. I checked this email folder again.  There were two of these folders again (same name), and both were empty. 4. I closed Thunderbird and deleted file ""C:\Users\Sam\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ardwce2w.default-esr\folderTree.json"", then restarted Thunderbird. 5. The problem folder was still there (two instances) and both were empty. 6. File folderTree.json had been recreated, but a bit smaller than before. 7.

Despite folk thinking it is a good idea, it is a poor choice to have Thunderbird start while the operating system does so.  It can, and has in the past, caused issues only seen when Thunderbird starts in that manner based on timing of other programs starting and services becoming available.  Windows offer you the desktop before it actually is fully loaded,  so starting programs in a partially loaded operating system can be problematical.  So take it out of there for diagnostics at least. </p><p>Next we have files which apparently have numbers after them.  While I am not familiar with this as such It could be Thunderbird escaping the path as it contains an underscore.  But when trying to find something on google,  I see a lot of folks seeing number following file names where the folder is redirected to Microsoft's cloud drive.  Apparently this can happen,  but It is new to me as I don't use cloud storage any more than I have to.  But having startup complete before Thunderbird starts might stop that. </p><p>Copy the file Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker to C:\Users\Sam\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ardwce2w.default-esr\Mail\Local Folders and rename is a baker,  then paste it again with the original name. Start Thunderbird </p><p>Did local folders get two new folders,  both with mail in them? </p><p>The idea of renaming the file to baker is to determine if there is something in the extensive punctuation and special characters that is the problem. </p><p>It will also, by leaving the name unchanged, check my belief that your path to the files is actually the issue </p><p>The string C:\Users\Sam\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ardwce2w.default-esr\Mail\Local Folders\MailStore Export.sbd\Outlook gmail.sbd\Organizations.sbd\_Service Providers.sbd\Health Providers.sbd\Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker is 253 characters long.  The upper limit for windows path is 256 characters.  My guess is Thunderbird adding File:// to the start of the path per UNC conventions will see the file not being read correctly because it is just to far from the root of C: </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

I tried two or three different things, what eventually worked was changing the long file names in Windows Explorer to a short file name, then restarting Thunderbird.  After this, all emails are now visible in the folder with the shorter name.   </p><p>In more detail, here are the steps I tried and what was eventually successful: 1. Within Thunderbird:  - renamed folder from ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker"" to ""Cleveland Clinic - Shelagh Baker"" - deleted second folder named ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker"" 2. Closed Thunderbird, then opened again.  No change.  Still no emails visible in folder. - second folder named ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker"" likely recreated, which I deleted 3. Within Thunderbird: renamed folder from ""Cleveland Clinic - Shelagh Baker"" to ""baker"" 4. Closed Thunderbird, then opened again.  No change.  Still no emails visible in folder. 5. Within Windows Explorer, directory ""C:\Users\Sam\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ardwce2w.default-esr\Mail\Local Folders\MailStore Export.sbd\Outlook gmail.sbd\Organizations.sbd\_Service Providers.sbd\Health Providers.sbd"" - two empty sub-folders exist named baker and ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) 0554d8b9"" - file baker.msf exists - file ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker"" exists - file baker does NOT exist - I deleted the folder named baker - I renamed file ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker"" to baker 6. Start Thunderbird.  Folder baker within Thunderbird now contains all the emails. 7. Within Thunderbird:   - renamed folder baker to ""Cleveland Clinic - Shelagh Baker"" - deleted folder ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker"" 8. Closed Thunderbird. 9. Within Windows Explorer, directory ""C:\Users\Sam\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ardwce2w.default-esr\Mail\Local Folders\MailStore Export.sbd\Outlook gmail.sbd\Organizations.sbd\_Service Providers.sbd\Health Providers.sbd"" - confirmed files exist named ""Cleveland Clinic - Shelagh Baker"" and ""Cleveland Clinic - Shelagh Baker.msf"" - had planned to manually delete any file or empty folder named ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker""; but unexpectedly, found there were no such files or folders 10. Start Thunderbird.  Within Thunderbird confirmed: - folder ""Cleveland Clinic - Shelagh Baker"" exists with all the emails - there is no folder named ""Cleveland Clinic (Sports Medicine Specialists) - Shelagh Baker"" </p><p>Thanks again for your explanations and assistance in fixing this problem.

Investigating the situation on the ground in Seattle Civilian community under community arrest by law enforcement and none pros security guards armed with none constitutional store policies . Policies nation wide . The 100 year campaign on the population of so called low income citizens. The campaign go's like this. The narrative Jim crow must stay alive for best interests of or nation. What's the best interests well you didn't know. Wow I thought all new this story.  But I'll keep it short  . The campaign is to hide the truth about how united state declared there independence from British rule on independence day . The truth is on that day we lost are independence. As well we lost much more then just independence we lost are self worth. Hold up don't think I'm being harsh . Let me explain. Self worth not what you think it is . It's actually when a person is left without property are free speech you can feel like your in a slave state of mind  . Hanse the word self worth. Know the truth is slavery and welfare systems is almost the same thing. Actually the prison system treats you better then section 8 does and dhs . 3 meals. And a coat for free . As well as all other types of free stuff you get from the prison stay. Well get to the states of mind a human goes through when lose his freedom. Let's just say prison is as close to slavery as you can get if not worst because of the chimcal imbalance that impact all citizens once in and released. Know you see this security officer  . We it look like a ordinary possibly miss understanding . But it's why more then just a possible theft search and seize. This security man stopped me coming into the store at the door and requested that i take my backpack off and leave it at the front door with a pill of other citizens backpack was . I told him I would not because one that's not the store policies  . Two because I wanted to witness how he would respond. It didn't take long for him to react. This officer is one of the angry one . The type that will drag you out of the store if you didn't listen. Mind you this is not a police officer. Know how do this man believe he could harass me  . Well because he called Backup to help him kick me out of the store. If I shows weakness him and the store manager and 2 other store that was behind me would of attacked. Trust me this is not a isolated incident. All stores nation wide violate citizens that look low income  . Or homeless regardless of color or creed . The policies is no matter you have money or not if you look like a homeless person with the criteria. , come into the store with backpack on. Or bike, a bunch of bags. Or children coming to buy lunch they will use that policies keep bags at front of store . Or they follow you around the store until you leave  . Or harass you until you get upset and demand to be treated with respect. They don't like when you tell them what your  constitutional rights are . When you to reson with them are try to mind act like there not there they will increase the Jim crow campaign . Level 3 approach is coming up . We already called the police the manager would say . Unusually the threat of calling the police come for the smallest reason. Without evidence of a crime . All what I just said has been going on in community and store properties for more then 100 or more. And retail store got rich off citizens doing business with there institutions. The issues really become a civil rights crime of a century is when a citizen not a criminal didn't leave the store before the police is called  . Most of the time you are apprehended when walking out and told that you couldn't leave until the police officer finish his investigation. And of course the citizens as what investigation. Know this is where citizens lose all since of being in the land of the free when and if the citizens didn't do anything wrong to be under investigation and be held under arrest think to himself I got right. He or she believes that they have rights because the  constitution say you have rights. So he decides to quote the  constitution to officer .
