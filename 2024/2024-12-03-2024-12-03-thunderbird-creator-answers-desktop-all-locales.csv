This design wastes space and reduces the space available for the ""From"", ""To"" and ""Subject"" fields. The designers seemed to assume that everyone would use a very wide compose window. But text is composed and read more easily in a narrower column of text. The attached image shows a typical width in my use.

I sometimes don't check this email account for a week or two at a time. Every time I start Thunderbird and download mail after days of not checking, it starts filtering mail and then crashes after a few minutes. I have a lot of filters. 169 and growing. Some have multiple addresses to filter. According to the filter log, it crashed after less than 2 minutes of filtering, but it seemed like it was chugging away at filtering longer than that before it crashed. If I restart and download a small number of messages it doesn't crash. If I manually run the filters on the inbox, it doesn't crash. Is there something I can try other than checking mail more often?
