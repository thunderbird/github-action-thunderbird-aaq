I have TB set to ""Check for updates, but let me choose whether to install"" but TB never tells me an update is available. I have to go into setting General  and scroll down to see if one is. Is this normal behavior if auto-updates are disabled? </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",webby2019
