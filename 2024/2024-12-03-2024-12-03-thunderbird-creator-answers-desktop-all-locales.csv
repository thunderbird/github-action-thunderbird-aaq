Verify that you have enough disk space, and that you have write privileges to the file system, then try again."" Hi, I have two gmail accounts and I've been having difficulty compacting folders for the last couple of days. Both of them are IMAP accounts, and I typically keep them clean and prefer to save my emails in local folders. I have tried deleting the email accounts on thunderbird and re-adding them. It worked for about 24 hours and I am getting the same message again. Running as administrator has not solved the problem.
