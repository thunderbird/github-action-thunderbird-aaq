Then, once you're comfortable, update the other PCs.  </p><p>In essence, treat Thunderbird as any other business tool: don't change just to change. update when the update keeps you eligible for support and when the update adds useful features. For example, 128 is the current release and 115 was the prior release. Requesting help for any version prior to 115 may go unheeded or you will be asked to upgrade immediately.
