With indexing turned off, you can still search. </blockquote> <p>200 GB sounds like a lot, but more important is the number of messages - because Gloda only indexes (reads) the first 40k of a message).  300K messages is a lot, but shouldn't take more than a day.  But it also shouldn't make your system miserable. </p><p>So I think here indexing is a symptom, which is to say there is an underlying cause which must be resolved. </p><p>One possible cause is antivirus, but there are more, including possible bug in Thunderbird.

Here's what I've found:   </p><p>Disabling indexing makes the global search (CTRL+K) unavailable, meaning Thunderbird doesn't offer any search functionality without it. Therefore, indexing is essential.   </p><p>Disabling my antivirus (ESET) didn’t help. I decided to give Thunderbird a chance to index all messages. This time, I noticed that after closing the program, indexing resumes rather than starting over. This might be because I disabled email program monitoring in ESET.   </p><p>Thunderbird indexed about 5,000 messages per hour, and after around 2.5 days, it managed to complete the process. Currently, the program works faster (like when indexing was off), but there are moments, especially when downloading new messages or ""bringing a folder up to date"", where it slows down significantly and lags and freezing for 1-2 seconds. While it’s annoying, it’s not as slow as it was during the indexing process.   </p><p>For reference, the folder at `C:\Users\(...)\AppData\Roaming\thunderbird\` now takes up 165 GB. Power mode (silent, entertainment, performance) does not make a difference, meaning increased power does not speed up Thunderbird. </p><p>I haven’t tested safe mode yet. Do you think it’s worth trying safe mode with networking, and/or should I take other steps? </p>",Qrzysio,false,0,0

Therefore, if you want to back up some amount of your Gmail messages before deleting, you can copy them to a Local folder (a completely offline, non-synchronized folder).  </p><p>I'm not sure how best to do this in a way that matches what you plan to do in your Gmail mailbox.

If you are using Thunderbird mail client, you need to check the same with your hosting support and find out why the message-id header does not have the right format.
