What your mentioned -- ""highlight several, press Delete once, and they're gone"" -- is what I called <em><strong>one</strong></em> ""Delete action"".

That behavior of multiple unintended ""Delete actions"" is consistent with a number of questions that have been posted here, and that is my concern.

That does mean handling the Delete key differently from other keys (which are allowed to repeat indefinitely until you release the key), and maybe that is the problem, but it seems (to me) justified, given that all keys (and especially Delete) are to some extent interpreted contextually[1] anyway. </p><p>[[1] For example, in the composition window, the Delete key's action is to delete characters or codes, while in the reading window its action is to delete the whole message.] </p>",kaufmann,false,0,0
