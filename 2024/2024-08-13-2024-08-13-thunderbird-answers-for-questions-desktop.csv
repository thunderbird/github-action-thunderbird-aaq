What your mentioned -- ""highlight several, press Delete once, and they're gone"" -- is what I called <em><strong>one</strong></em> ""Delete action"".  But notice what happens if you hold the Delete key down/don't release it immediately? - it continues deleting until released. That behavior of multiple unintended ""Delete actions"" is consistent with a number of questions that have been posted here, and that is my concern. It's the same if you have many selected or just one message selected (because you are in the message window, or because that's where your cursor is in the list view). </p><p>What I'm asking for is ""only <strong>ONE</strong> Delete action per keypress"" - and that there are no more deletions until you release the Delete key and press it again.  That does mean handling the Delete key differently from other keys (which are allowed to repeat indefinitely until you release the key), and maybe that is the problem, but it seems (to me) justified, given that all keys (and especially Delete) are to some extent interpreted contextually[1] anyway. </p><p>[[1] For example, in the composition window, the Delete key's action is to delete characters or codes, while in the reading window its action is to delete the whole message.] </p>",kaufmann,false,0,0
