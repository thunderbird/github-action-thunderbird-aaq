Click ""Done"", and it begins ""Checking password"", and never comes back......... </p><p>I know the Gmail account and password are valid, because I can get mail directly from Google..... </p><p>I'm at a loss...any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1690573;,Richard.Ripley
