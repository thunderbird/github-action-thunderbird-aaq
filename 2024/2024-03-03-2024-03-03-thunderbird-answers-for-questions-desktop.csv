This should occur on all occasions. </p><p>I use a plain text ""almost"" signature in Thunderbird. It always appears never contains preformat in the body,  and it always has a signature separator.  What some experimentation shows is I have the use HTML box checked.  Removing the check brings in the preformat. </p><p>Try it and let me know,  because it really sounds like a bug to me and I can not find anything already open.

It might have nothing to do with the password really,  just that is the point of failure. </p><p>Things like, your internet connection is being dropped or is very slow so things time out,  the server is down,  your firewall is blocking Thunderbird accessing the internet,  or your antivirus has lost the plot and is preventing mail being downloaded with it's scanning  are the common causes. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So it has been my general daily mail account for some 20 years.  It got 10 spam emails one day last week.  That was the high,  other days were like four,  so do not assume everyone is deluged by spam. It appear to be largely a problem in a few countries with inadequate legal controls on SPAM, like the USA.   </p><p>Of last weeks spam in my spam folder one was a SPAM message,  the rest were SCAMS. </p><p>I make extensive use of filtering on the local folders in Thunderbird and find they are as robust as ever.  That means occasionally they appear to run no filters for an hour or so,  but after than they run correctly and pick up the stuff missed earlier get mail cycles. </p><p>What might be happening is you have so many filters that they are simply not getting completed in a timely manner.  It could also be you have IMAP accounts and download timing issues with the message body means that they are somewhat patchy unless you set the filter to run after junk classification if your filter looks at the message body. </p><p>It can get confusing as well if the filter itself has hundreds of conditions in it,  something the manual filtering of SPAM crowd tend to end up with or those with manual blocklists of sending addresses. </p><p>Finally you get access to the text that is displayed in the message contents when you read the email from a filter.  So if the URL is not in the body of the email and visible as such,  you will not be able to filter on it.  You can not access the HTML source of the mail with a filter. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If you send an emails to two people by including two addresses in the To: CC: or BCC:  then the same email is submitted to the mail server and the same email is delivered to both recipients.  The failure of one recipient to be able to read the message probably says more about their choice of mail client than anything else. </p><p>Size being unknown can be an interesting issue, as it would indicate that the message is malformed.  Do these attachments have a common source,  like a security camera. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
