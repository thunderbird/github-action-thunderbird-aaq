So it has been my general daily mail account for some 20 years.  It got 10 spam emails one day last week.  That was the high,  other days were like four,  so do not assume everyone is deluged by spam. It appear to be largely a problem in a few countries with inadequate legal controls on SPAM, like the USA.   </p><p>Of last weeks spam in my spam folder one was a SPAM message,  the rest were SCAMS. </p><p>I make extensive use of filtering on the local folders in Thunderbird and find they are as robust as ever.  That means occasionally they appear to run no filters for an hour or so,  but after than they run correctly and pick up the stuff missed earlier get mail cycles. </p><p>What might be happening is you have so many filters that they are simply not getting completed in a timely manner.  It could also be you have IMAP accounts and download timing issues with the message body means that they are somewhat patchy unless you set the filter to run after junk classification if your filter looks at the message body. </p><p>It can get confusing as well if the filter itself has hundreds of conditions in it,  something the manual filtering of SPAM crowd tend to end up with or those with manual blocklists of sending addresses. </p><p>Finally you get access to the text that is displayed in the message contents when you read the email from a filter.  So if the URL is not in the body of the email and visible as such,  you will not be able to filter on it.  You can not access the HTML source of the mail with a filter. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,2

I actually get the same amount of spam that you get. </p><p>More specifically, I have to say that the spam/scam filtering actually does work sometimes, but doesn't work other times - even when I repeatedly manually run the spam filter. So what I'm getting at is that there should be some sort of filtering diagnostic, e.g., if the filtering isn't working properly, I should get a message saying so, and why it failed. I'd really like to get this problem fixed. </p><p>I can send some of these problem scam/spam emails to some support agent there and say what I am filtering on so they can verify the failure themselves. But, is there any support agent available that can look into this? </p><p>Oh, regarding that URL issue. The scammers are pretty smart, so often the only way I can definitely tell it's a scam/spam message is to mouse over the message content. While there are often lots of links there, I usually find that they ALL point to one crazy-looking URL, and I find that would be a good filtering target. </p><p>Finally, is it possible for me to write an EXE file where I can do the filtering myself?

Isn't that true? </blockquote> <p>No have no idea what other email software does, I use Thunderbird.  But I doubt it as the terms junk and spam are used interchangeably.  Largely driven by the historic email usage of the person making the decisions.  Netscape used the term Junk and Microsoft used SPAM. Yahoo chose to go off on a complete tangent of their own and chose ""Bulk mail"" for the folder name in IMAP and SPAM in their webmail just to confuse everyone. </p><p>I really have no idea what purpose blocking an email address even serves. Chat and NNTP clients and started this madness some 20 years ago and somehow it bled over to email.  Now everyone thinks blocking senders has a real function other that ghosting.  It does not.  I have received SPAM and SCAM mail addressed to me from me.  I don't want to be blocking myself. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender</a> for the official word on blocking a sender. </p> <blockquote> I don't have a Junk folder in either of my 3 addresses. Do I create it/them manually? </blockquote> <p>You will probably have an IMAP account with your provider. In the case of IMAP, the provider decides what the folder is called. Your provider may use the term junk,  they might use the term SPAM is is there choice. They might as in case of yahoo, call it bulk mail.  The folder name is not all that important.  That it has a red flame icon beside it is as that defines it's function. As the document in the first link I posted shows,  you can set a folder name in Thunderbird to receive Junk/SPAM.  But in most cases the IMAP server will over ride that, or you may end up with more than one folder showing as a junk/SPAM folder with the flame icon. </p><p>Thunderbird will use the term Junk for POP mail accounts. When Thunderbird has something to put in the junk folder, it will create it.  The same goes for most local folders really. </p> <blockquote> My Message Filters box is currently empty.

At first, I thought the ghost profile folders were finally gone from my deleted files under local folders, but then I realized that I didn't have my deleted folder fully open yet. So, I think I figured out how to do screenshots the right way without using a cell phone and attached a couple of pictures.   Is it safe to delete each one of the .default files under each Profile folder? As far as I can tell, there is no information remaining in any of those .default files. I tried it on the first one and it disappeared, but the Profile remnant remained above it. However, when I reopen Tbird again later, an empty default file reappears again. Also, with the task manager open, i see that Thunderbird closes completely when I order it to. I am also attaching the result of hitting the up arrow once in file manager. Hopefully, it will all make sense to you. Thx, K. </p>",keithpost1,false,0,0
