So it has been my general daily mail account for some 20 years.  It got 10 spam emails one day last week.  That was the high,  other days were like four,  so do not assume everyone is deluged by spam. It appear to be largely a problem in a few countries with inadequate legal controls on SPAM, like the USA.   </p><p>Of last weeks spam in my spam folder one was a SPAM message,  the rest were SCAMS. </p><p>I make extensive use of filtering on the local folders in Thunderbird and find they are as robust as ever.  That means occasionally they appear to run no filters for an hour or so,  but after than they run correctly and pick up the stuff missed earlier get mail cycles. </p><p>What might be happening is you have so many filters that they are simply not getting completed in a timely manner.  It could also be you have IMAP accounts and download timing issues with the message body means that they are somewhat patchy unless you set the filter to run after junk classification if your filter looks at the message body. </p><p>It can get confusing as well if the filter itself has hundreds of conditions in it,  something the manual filtering of SPAM crowd tend to end up with or those with manual blocklists of sending addresses. </p><p>Finally you get access to the text that is displayed in the message contents when you read the email from a filter.  So if the URL is not in the body of the email and visible as such,  you will not be able to filter on it.  You can not access the HTML source of the mail with a filter. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

I actually get the same amount of spam that you get. </p><p>More specifically, I have to say that the spam/scam filtering actually does work sometimes, but doesn't work other times - even when I repeatedly manually run the spam filter. So what I'm getting at is that there should be some sort of filtering diagnostic, e.g., if the filtering isn't working properly, I should get a message saying so, and why it failed. I'd really like to get this problem fixed. </p><p>I can send some of these problem scam/spam emails to some support agent there and say what I am filtering on so they can verify the failure themselves. But, is there any support agent available that can look into this? </p><p>Oh, regarding that URL issue. The scammers are pretty smart, so often the only way I can definitely tell it's a scam/spam message is to mouse over the message content. While there are often lots of links there, I usually find that they ALL point to one crazy-looking URL, and I find that would be a good filtering target. </p><p>Finally, is it possible for me to write an EXE file where I can do the filtering myself? That way I can be sure the filtering is working correctly. </p>",Don-Peters,false,0,0

If you send an emails to two people by including two addresses in the To: CC: or BCC:  then the same email is submitted to the mail server and the same email is delivered to both recipients.
