Present config has been working for quite a long time. TB manages more mail accounts, of which two connect to my remote server (and two others to gmail and freemail). The day before yesterday evening there was a power blackout while I was using TB. Since then I have the following problem: </p><p>1. First mail account says: ""Could not connect mail server &lt;remote server&gt;; the connection was refused"". Now I cannot even see the sub-folders of this account in TB while the folder files themselves exist. 2. Second mail account (to the same mail server, to another mailbox) works partially, it says after sending an email: ""Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors."" </p><p>Connection to mail server is via ssh portforwarding (for TB smtp is localhost:2525, imap is localhost:1143, ssh tunnels work as I can telnet to them and imap/smtp services respond). What is more, from the home desktop my wife (different local desktop user) can normally access her mailbox (different email address on the same mail server) with the same ssh tunnelling method. She was not logged in and was not using TB when the power crashed. After power had come back I ran fsck, filesystem is clean. </p><p>So I think that some setting(s) must have gone wrong under my TB profile and it is emphasized more by the fact that in the first case error msg the name of the remote server appears instead of ""localhost"". Account settings in TB seems to contain the original server settings (e.g. locahost, 2525, normal password, no connection security, etc.) </p><p>Only strange thing I could find in Troubleshooting list is that under ""Mail and news accounts"" it lists  account2	(imap) localhost:1143	None	Normal password while in the outgoing server column it contains _two_ times the locahost:2525 setting. </p><p>In config editor the mail.server.server2.hostname points to the original name of the remote mail server (instead of localhost???). </p><p>So what can I do if I wanted to avoid deleting the two mail accounts and re-configure them, especially considering the fact that the mailbox size is about 80 GB. </p><p>Any ideas are welcome and appreciated. </p><p>Thanks in advance, KEA. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",dova72

I am connected to a server called Copper..net via IMAP.  (I've set up 2 other email accounts under TB, one of which I will almost certainly abandon and the other, I hope, will become my default server.  But right now, I'm not really using either). </p><p>Most of my emails -- I have over 300,000 -- are stored in local folders.  When mail comes into my Inbox, I generally either delete it, mark it as junk, or once read, store it in a local file. </p><p>Until yesterday, all of my IMAP folders showed up under the <a href=""http://Copper.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Copper.net</a> account.  They also showed up when I went to File subscribe and refreshed the list (other than one episode which I was able to resolve).  Now, they don't show up in either place.  They still do show up normally in the other accounts. </p><p>Since installing Thunderbird, I have managed to transfer most of my local emails from WLM to TB, so I am now down to 3 of my largest folders, containing between 60,000 and 65,000 emails each.  Two days ago, I was able to transfer one of them, albeit with considerable difficulties along the way. </p><p>My method was to set up a new IMAP folder called Transfers.  I COPY emails from the WLM folder to it (in chunks for larger folders).  Then MOVE the emails from the TB Transfers folder to the TB local folder. </p><p>When everything is working properly, that move eventually results in the TB transfer folder being empty, which then results in the WLM transfer folder being empty.  And then I can restart the process. </p><p>If for some reason, the move does NOT empty the transfer folder, I do so manually by deleting all the emails and then emptying the trash.  I then check properties to make sure that the folder is really empty, and if it isn't, use the tools under properties in WLM to manually delete them </p><p>Yesterday, when I tried to do all this again for my 2nd large folder, I found that the transfer box in TB a) often didn't contain all the emails it should have and b) that the ones that showed up as being there wouldn't move at all.  I tried compacting, repairing, getting messages, all to force syncing , but nothing worked. </p><p>And this morning, things went from bad to worse because now my IMAP folders no longer show up at all (except Inbox and Trash).  During this whole time, the inbox has been syncing properly and mostly, promptly. </p><p>Finally, I should add that I did download and add the import/export NG tool and while it worked pretty successfully for small folders, if did not work well for larger ones.  I'm still in dialogue with the developer. </p><p>Any help would be much appreciated; I'm incredibly frustrated. </p><p>P.S. I tried this morning to repair TB, just in case, but using Control Panel, the only option was to uninstall it, which I did not want to do.  I do wonder whether TB has somehow gotten corrupted.   </p><p>I also tried opening in safe mode, which didn't help. I shut my computer off at night, so it's restarted at least once a day.  Yesterday and today, I also restarted during the day in hopes that it might help.
