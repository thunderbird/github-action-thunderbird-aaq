Unfortunately, the inbox of one account is not displayed in the Inbox group, the archive of another account is not displayed in the Archive group and the third account has an entry in the Sent group, but it is out of date. Instead, the current one can be found separately in the ‘Folder’ account.  How can I fix this in the grouping view? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",web104

Come da titolo sto utilizzando Thunderbird cercando di sostituire Outlook. Ho un account Exchange e dopo aver messo i dati su Thunderbird tutto ok per la posta in arrivo. Purtroppo non mi sincronizza quella inviata. Se mando le mail da Thunderbird ovviamente si vedono (e si vedono anche su Outlook), mentre se mando da Outlook non mi vengono sincronizzate su Thunderbird. Non so cosa fare per ""forzargli"" la connessione con la posta inviata. Grazie mille in anticipo per l'aiuto </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,"",hawanaghana

Present config has been working for quite a long time. TB manages more mail accounts, of which two connect to my remote server (and two others to gmail and freemail). The day before yesterday evening there was a power blackout while I was using TB. Since then I have the following problem: </p><p>1. First mail account says: ""Could not connect mail server &lt;remote server&gt;; the connection was refused"". Now I cannot even see the sub-folders of this account in TB while the folder files themselves exist. 2. Second mail account (to the same mail server, to another mailbox) works partially, it says after sending an email: ""Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors."" </p><p>Connection to mail server is via ssh portforwarding (for TB smtp is localhost:2525, imap is localhost:1143, ssh tunnels work as I can telnet to them and imap/smtp services respond). What is more, from the home desktop my wife (different local desktop user) can normally access her mailbox (different email address on the same mail server) with the same ssh tunnelling method. She was not logged in and was not using TB when the power crashed. After power had come back I ran fsck, filesystem is clean. </p><p>So I think that some setting(s) must have gone wrong under my TB profile and it is emphasized more by the fact that in the first case error msg the name of the remote server appears instead of ""localhost"". Account settings in TB seems to contain the original server settings (e.g. locahost, 2525, normal password, no connection security, etc.) </p><p>Only strange thing I could find in Troubleshooting list is that under ""Mail and news accounts"" it lists  account2	(imap) localhost:1143	None	Normal password while in the outgoing server column it contains _two_ times the locahost:2525 setting. </p><p>In config editor the mail.server.server2.hostname points to the original name of the remote mail server (instead of localhost???). </p><p>So what can I do if I wanted to avoid deleting the two mail accounts and re-configure them, especially considering the fact that the mailbox size is about 80 GB. </p><p>Any ideas are welcome and appreciated. </p><p>Thanks in advance, KEA. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dova72
