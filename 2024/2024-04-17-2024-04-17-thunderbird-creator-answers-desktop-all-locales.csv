Our <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> addresses are supposed to (and apparently have) transitioned so that they still work, but are processed through <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a>.   </p><p>It is my turn to be transitioned and I have been successful in doing so to the extent that I can send and receive using my address(es) ...@cox.net through Yahoo web mail and on my Samsung phone.  I have not, however, been successful in either sending or receiving mail using Thunderbird on my desktop. </p><p>I have been successfully using Thunderbird with POP settings for years with four different <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> addresses.  [I'm currently just trying to get two of them working -- unsuccessfully.] </p><p>I am using Windows 10 on a Dell desktop.  I am using Thunderbird 115.9.0 (32 bit).  I have reset the POP and SMTP settings as directed by Yahoo.  One of the errors I receive is:  ""Error with Account ....  Sending of password for ...@cox.net did not succeed.  Mail server <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a> responded (SYS/TEMP) Server Error - Please try again later.""  It then asks me to retry or enter a new password.  I have checked the passwords saved by Thunderbird and they are correct. </p><p>I suspect, that with all the Cox accounts being newly routed through Yahoo servers that I am not the only Thunderbird user experiencing this problem.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Is it likely to help if I uninstall and reinstall Thunderbird?  Would I loose all my mail, etc. if I did that?  [I did the delete and add account in my phone and that was successful, but I wasn't concerned about losing mail there as it is all on my desktop.] </p><p>Thanks in advance. billb1111 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1648400;1648461;1648473;1648541;,billb1111
