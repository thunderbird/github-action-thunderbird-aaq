Our <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> addresses are supposed to (and apparently have) transitioned so that they still work, but are processed through <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a>.   </p><p>It is my turn to be transitioned and I have been successful in doing so to the extent that I can send and receive using my address(es) ...@cox.net through Yahoo web mail and on my Samsung phone.  I have not, however, been successful in either sending or receiving mail using Thunderbird on my desktop. </p><p>I have been successfully using Thunderbird with POP settings for years with four different <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> addresses.  [I'm currently just trying to get two of them working -- unsuccessfully.] </p><p>I am using Windows 10 on a Dell desktop.  I am using Thunderbird 115.9.0 (32 bit).  I have reset the POP and SMTP settings as directed by Yahoo.  One of the errors I receive is:  ""Error with Account ....  Sending of password for ...@cox.net did not succeed.  Mail server <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a> responded (SYS/TEMP) Server Error - Please try again later.""  It then asks me to retry or enter a new password.  I have checked the passwords saved by Thunderbird and they are correct. </p><p>I suspect, that with all the Cox accounts being newly routed through Yahoo servers that I am not the only Thunderbird user experiencing this problem.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Is it likely to help if I uninstall and reinstall Thunderbird?  Would I loose all my mail, etc. if I did that?  [I did the delete and add account in my phone and that was successful, but I wasn't concerned about losing mail there as it is all on my desktop.] </p><p>Thanks in advance. billb1111 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",billb1111

I spent a couple of hours on the phone with tech support but was unable to correct the issue. Changed all of the settings several times, SMTP server, port, security and authentication without success. Tech support suggested using their server but that's a pain. Attached are pictures of the error messages. Thanks. </p><p><br> Tim </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",tim17c
