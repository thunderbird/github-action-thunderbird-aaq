Our <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> addresses are supposed to (and apparently have) transitioned so that they still work, but are processed through <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a>.   </p><p>It is my turn to be transitioned and I have been successful in doing so to the extent that I can send and receive using my address(es) ...@cox.net through Yahoo web mail and on my Samsung phone.  I have not, however, been successful in either sending or receiving mail using Thunderbird on my desktop. </p><p>I have been successfully using Thunderbird with POP settings for years with four different <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> addresses.  [I'm currently just trying to get two of them working -- unsuccessfully.] </p><p>I am using Windows 10 on a Dell desktop.  I am using Thunderbird 115.9.0 (32 bit).  I have reset the POP and SMTP settings as directed by Yahoo.  One of the errors I receive is:  ""Error with Account ....  Sending of password for ...@cox.net did not succeed.  Mail server <a href=""http://pop.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mail.yahoo.com</a> responded (SYS/TEMP) Server Error - Please try again later.""  It then asks me to retry or enter a new password.  I have checked the passwords saved by Thunderbird and they are correct. </p><p>I suspect, that with all the Cox accounts being newly routed through Yahoo servers that I am not the only Thunderbird user experiencing this problem.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Is it likely to help if I uninstall and reinstall Thunderbird?  Would I loose all my mail, etc. if I did that?  [I did the delete and add account in my phone and that was successful, but I wasn't concerned about losing mail there as it is all on my desktop.] </p><p>Thanks in advance. billb1111 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",billb1111

We have been using Thunderbird for years without major problems.  I loaded the latest version of Thunderbird on my new laptop and it seemed to work ok at first.   Now I have a problem with  intermittent failure to send normal  emails on Thunderbird.  My wife has noticed the same problem on her laptop Windows 11.  I asked iPrimus support (who are supposed to support Hotkey) but they say it is not their problem but Thunderbird's. We RECEIVE emails ok, and sometimes pressing SEND will work immediately, sometimes on the second press, and sometimes not at all.  This generates a message ""-- Unable to authenticate Outgoing Server (SMTP), <a href=""http://smtp.hotkey.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.hotkey.net.au</a> -- Check password and verify authentification method in Account settings/Outgoing server SMTP"" We both use Trend virus protection. </p><p>Account name:  <a href=""http://mail.hotkey.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.hotkey.net.au</a> Outgoing Server:  <a href=""http://smtp.hotkey.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.hotkey.net.au</a> Server Settings:   Server name   <a href=""http://pop.hotkey.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.hotkey.net.au</a> </p><pre>                             User name is my email address </pre>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tgvincent

Van de menubalk heb ik intussen alles wel begrepen, dank daarvoor.  Maar ging mij voornamelijk om de mail toolbar, degene die ook bovenin blijkt te zitten, waarin blijkbaar alle mailtjes verschijnen. Maar dit verhinderd mij vaak om meteen bij postvak in te komen. Ik heb al wel geconstateerd dat die mailtjes ook rechts via het pijltje tevoorschijn komen, dat vind ik wel handig. Ik heb helaas nergens de mail toolbar(als dat de bovenste is) kunnen vinden om die te verbergen, zodat ik altijd meteen in postvak in kan komen. Bij voorbaat hartelijk dank voor je reactie.
