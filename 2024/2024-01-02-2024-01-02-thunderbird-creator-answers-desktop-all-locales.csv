1435469,2024-01-01 16:53:46 -0800,2024-01-01 16:53:46 -0800,Change double spacing of the email display,"<p>When I open Thunderbird all the emails are listed BUT they are double spaced. This is not the spacing of an email response, just the way they are displayed when TB is opened. I'm sure it is a simple mouse click selection but it eludes me. Can anyone suggest the choice? There are two computers and one of them displays exactly they way wanted. The other one show each email double spaced before opening it. The attached image is the display I want.  Thanks for any help. </p><p>Larry Kamberg ldkamb@frontier.com </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ldkamb
