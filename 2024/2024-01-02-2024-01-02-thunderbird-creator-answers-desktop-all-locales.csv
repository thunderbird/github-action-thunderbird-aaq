This is not the spacing of an email response, just the way they are displayed when TB is opened. I'm sure it is a simple mouse click selection but it eludes me. Can anyone suggest the choice? There are two computers and one of them displays exactly they way wanted. The other one show each email double spaced before opening it. The attached image is the display I want.  Thanks for any help. </p><p>Larry Kamberg ldkamb@frontier.com </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ldkamb

Version 115.6.0 64-bit on Windows. At some point, not sure when, the body of mail from some correspondents appears in tiny yellow characters on a black background; if it's a response to my email, my text is in small gray letters on black, almost invisible. Changing themes has not helped; the heading can be made light but the body is unaltered. Didn't find anything in Settings that worked either. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ronks1

When I opened it on the new PC, it only downloaded 475 emails. On the old PC, I had over 15,000 emails. How can I get the new PC to downloaded the rest of the emails? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",hashmark28
