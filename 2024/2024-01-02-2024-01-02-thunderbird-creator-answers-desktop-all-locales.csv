This is not the spacing of an email response, just the way they are displayed when TB is opened. I'm sure it is a simple mouse click selection but it eludes me. Can anyone suggest the choice? There are two computers and one of them displays exactly they way wanted. The other one show each email double spaced before opening it. The attached image is the display I want.  Thanks for any help. </p><p>Larry Kamberg ldkamb@frontier.com </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1627740;,ldkamb

Version 115.6.0 64-bit on Windows. At some point, not sure when, the body of mail from some correspondents appears in tiny yellow characters on a black background; if it's a response to my email, my text is in small gray letters on black, almost invisible. Changing themes has not helped; the heading can be made light but the body is unaltered. Didn't find anything in Settings that worked either. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ronks1

What in blazes is going on at Tbird? Who is responsible? Is there anyone who can put it back at once? Yes my subscription is valid.  If all of you refuse my small request, it means I have to PAY my own tech support, which is not fair of you. I don't care who messed it up; I only want my paper back NOW. I have noticed that Tbird is now run by volonteers; is that the problem? PLEASE help. Thank you </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1627738;1627743;,margykr
