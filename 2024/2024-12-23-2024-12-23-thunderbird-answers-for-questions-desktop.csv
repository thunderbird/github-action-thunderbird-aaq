I would assume that it behaves in much the same way as the POP email set up but I don't have experience of the locations of files so you will have to get info from someone else. </p><p>I am assuming that, because this is a trash folder, you are happy to lose ALL the emails contained inside.

Please do not try this on any other file or folder. I have done this on my own OS running W11 and Thunderbird version 128.5.2esr (64 bit). </p><p>I am assuming that the data files in the Trash folder have corrupted which is why I'm suggesting you do the following. If they haven't corrupted and there is a different problem then this won't resolve it. At the very least, you should have eliminated one possibility. </p><p>1. Close Thunderbird </p><p>2. Close all open programs </p><p>3. Make a folder on your desktop and call it what you will </p><p>4. Navigate to the folder named <a href=""http://mail.beijing1980.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.beijing1980.com</a> along the path that's specified in the image you posted (re-attached here). On a Windows computer it would probably be located on the C:\ Drive so starts C:\Users if you're running a Windows OS. Not sure if you're using a MAC as you said 'MAS' in your original post - but I'm guessing that you are. You would need to follow the path and navigate to that folder. </p><p>5. Inside this folder you will have two 'Trash' data files. The .msf file should be fairly small but the other should be around 234KB, the folder size that you told me it was. If it is substantially different, let me know for my info cos it would be good to know that a displayed size was not close to being the same as the data file. </p><p>6. Before we do anything, look at all the file sizes of the other items here. I want you to check that there is nothing overly big (a size in Gb) just in case the reason that no 'disk space' is being offered has to do with another of the files here. Let me know if there is anything overly large. But we can proceed even if there is something. </p><p>7. Move both 'Trash' files to the folder that you created on the Desktop. </p><p>8. Launch Thunderbird. Thunderbird will now realise that it's lost the Trash folder and make you a new one. This is what it does on Windows and I have no reason to see why it shouldn't do this on a MAC. </p><p>9. Look in the window you still have open and two files with the same name starting 'Trash' will have been made. Their file sizes will be minimal. </p><p>10. Check the file size in Thunderbird of the new Trash folder and it should have a zero value (or, better, it won't display any size at all - and it will have no emails inside it). </p><p>11. You should keep the folder on your desktop for a while in case you have any problems and wish to restore the old Trash data files (at the loss of the new ones) but I've done this myself and have not found there to be any. </p><p>The IMAP account is different as TB is only mirroring what's on the Server. I would start by closing TB and then emptying the trash on the server. Then locate the Trash data files on your HD. However, I'm not at all competent with doing this and I'm not sure what the effect would be - I would assume that Thunderbird would just recreate new Trash data files - so you need to ask further advice before proceeding with the IMAP account. </p>",arlev,false,0,0

Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  </li><li>  select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  </li><li>  select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. </li><li> if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) </li><li> In settings&gt;composition, set Sending Format to 'automatic' (just my preference, not required) </li></ol> <p>NOTE: if font size is still too small, try a larger number, such as 20. the numbers in thunderbird are points, not pixels.  </p><p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
