It may be missing or inaccessible.,"<p>I've gone through most of the questions asked regarding this and have tried to follow all of the directions but none of them work.  Let me begin by saying this is the worst time I've ever had at migrating from an old computer to a new computer using TB ever. EVER! This is the worst. I am moving from an ASUS Win11 to a HP Win11 so there shouldn't be that much of a problem. I've done this more than a few times so I know the drill of copying the %appdata% from one place to another.  I have installed uninstalled deleted reinstalled, uninstalled reinstalled deleted three times and keep getting the same problem and have been doing this going on three days. I donated to get his copy and am about to ask for my donation back if I don't get a very simple answer. I keep getting that error message no matter what I do.  I need a very simple walk through on how to get what I am able to save from the old computer into the new computer without a lot of magic and rain dancing and click here and delete this and see if this sticks. I need a very simple take your profile.zip and unpak it here then open TB and do this. PERIOD. The profile is on the same computer not a server.  If I cannot get a quick down and dirty answer please just tell me and I'll ask for my donation back and move to MS outlook and deal with their FU'ed POS.  I really don't know why TB has taken a turn for the worst here. But it's not looking good IMHO. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",fkenisky
