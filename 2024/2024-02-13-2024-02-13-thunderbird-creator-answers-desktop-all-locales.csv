BAD). making it impossible for window manager to properly resize window magnet to other windows 4: - there are large sensibility zones for decoration management catched by TB that make some buttons unreachable in the left bar, and the window manager gadgets i have below (quick launch and desktop management) 5: - there is a new sensibility zone between the top menu bar and the top decoration of windows that give access to some window manager menu, useless at this place, and it reduced the vertical sensibility zone of the buttons, making the click box smaller, and reducing the effective size of buttons, making them harder to click 6: - the unread message count which used to be a nice light blue is now white in a dark grey box, catching the eye more than necessary, slowing me down, and increasing my brain work to focus on what i need to do. also this value is unconsistent; my inbox is curretly shown with 411 total messages, and 630 unread. If i unfold the folder in left column, it seems i have only 89 unread in inbox, and 2 in one subflder, but, to me, 89+2 is not equal to 630. 7: - the file/edit/view menu bar is now BELOW the actions buttons Get/Write/Reply ...  8: - if I roll up the TB windows in the top decoration, any mouse click in the place where the win used to be remains inefficient. So, TB completely broke E17. A shaded win still occupies the screen as if it's unshaded, and more (about 20 pixels below the bottom decoration). 9: - It's 20y the message list was aligned on the top message, so I always made that box half a message taller than an exact message line height multiple, so that the half line white space was a proof I was at the bottom of the list. Now, the list is aligned bottom, and the top line is shown half. I now have no way to know if i am in middle on bottom of list (plus lift is now auto hide). </p><p>i don't have any screenshot from previous version for reference. And half issues are bad interactions with E17 about magnetism, and size of click boxes, and this can't be shown on screenshots; even videos would not help if you can't feel it physically, or never used E17 yourself in the past; you can't know how it used to behave. </p><p>All these changes have an intense negative impact on my work speed. They slow me down. </p><p>TB had almost not changed in 20y of use, but these changes, at the same time, with so many consequences on window manager ... I can't stand it. 20y of habits lost in one evening. Not something you can change at my age. </p><p>I have seen only one improvement (bug fix) in recent TB: ""save all"" attachements works now fine from the menu under the message, and we no longer need to use Save All from top menus (regression bug between TB 1.2 and 1.5, IIRC). </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1636534;1636538;,benoit12
