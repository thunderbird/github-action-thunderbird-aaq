I have not had difficulty receiving email and those messages displaying in the Inbox--but there have been a number of instances where the status bar will report one or more messages have been received, but none display, despite the fact that I do not nor have I ever had filtering in place.  Since I continue to receive emails that display when received, the only thing that concerns me is that there could be messages that are being lost, and I have no idea how to correct the problem and be assured that each and every email is retrieved and displayed.

To help keep your account secure, Microsoft will no longer support the use of third-party email and calendar apps which ask you to sign in with only your Microsoft Account username and password.
