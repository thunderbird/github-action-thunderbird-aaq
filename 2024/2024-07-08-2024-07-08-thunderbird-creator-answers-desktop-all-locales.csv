I have not had difficulty receiving email and those messages displaying in the Inbox--but there have been a number of instances where the status bar will report one or more messages have been received, but none display, despite the fact that I do not nor have I ever had filtering in place.  Since I continue to receive emails that display when received, the only thing that concerns me is that there could be messages that are being lost, and I have no idea how to correct the problem and be assured that each and every email is retrieved and displayed.

However, now whenever I click an email it opens in a new tab. This makes reading them take considerably longer. Is there any way to switch back to having them appear on the side instead of opening a new window/tab? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",General23
