This happened all the time. After a few days I deleted then re-installed Thunderbird, now when I try to set up new mail account it says cannot find settings for email account. I spoke to my mail server account help but they were not helpful, immediately saying it was a third party problem. Please help. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",peroch
