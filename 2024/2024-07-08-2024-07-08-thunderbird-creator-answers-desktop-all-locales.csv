I have always been able to receive emails with attachments before so don't know what to do.  I'd be fine if I saw the email without the attachment but no email shows up at all in Thunderbird, only Yahoo email. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jamesvelasquez1

Then the color selecter boxes on the menu went right back to white.   </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dmsolomon
