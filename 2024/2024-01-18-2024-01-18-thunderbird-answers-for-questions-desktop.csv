Interestingly the reports here appear to only originate in the USA where most of the providers are trying to sell advertising on webmail sites.  But that might be just coincidental.  But I have never seen a report of such outside the USA. </p><p>Clearing the issue might be as simply as changing your mail provider because they don't care and are blocking your outgoing mail.  Or it might involve getting the IP address of your mail server changes or in the case of web site hosting having your mail moved to another server.  It might also be that you need to stop sending SPAM. </p><p>However without specific details of your case,  this topic could fill an encyclopedia without covering anything actually relevant to you specifically. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I guess then my Thunderbird has not been behaving normally for the past 15 or more years, as the trash folder only started expanding open like this very recently. I dont want to empty the trash, I prefer to keep it in there for a while. I would prefer the trash folder stayed minimised when i added to it, and not expand all the way down like it does not, every time I delete a folder. I cant think of any logical reason it does it and it just annoying.  If this is 'normal' and there is no fix, I guess its time to say goodbye to Thunderbird. </p>",vicki.savage.nz,false,0,0

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
