Interestingly the reports here appear to only originate in the USA where most of the providers are trying to sell advertising on webmail sites.  But that might be just coincidental.  But I have never seen a report of such outside the USA. </p><p>Clearing the issue might be as simply as changing your mail provider because they don't care and are blocking your outgoing mail.  Or it might involve getting the IP address of your mail server changes or in the case of web site hosting having your mail moved to another server.

I guess then my Thunderbird has not been behaving normally for the past 15 or more years, as the trash folder only started expanding open like this very recently. I dont want to empty the trash, I prefer to keep it in there for a while. I would prefer the trash folder stayed minimised when i added to it, and not expand all the way down like it does not, every time I delete a folder. I cant think of any logical reason it does it and it just annoying.  If this is 'normal' and there is no fix, I guess its time to say goodbye to Thunderbird. </p>",vicki.savage.nz,false,0,1

I am adding a screenshot of what happens whenever I delete a folder in Thunderbird.  Usually, the Trash folder is 'closed' or minimised,  meaning I dont see what is in it unless I click on it to make it expand down, as seen in the photo on the left.    See how I have created sub folders under Bought?  When I delete one of those folders, it now makes the Trash folder expand down the screen. In the photo on the right, I had just deleted the sub folder named JeansWest, which caused the Trash to expand open down the screen. This did not used to happen. It only started happening after an update in the past month or so.  I used to be able to delete sub folders and the Trash did not expand the way it does now.  Its got nothing to do with how full the Trash is. Most of those deleted folders have maybe one or two old emails in them. Even when I have just emptied the Trash, it does it as soon as I add a sub folder to the Trash. I would like to find a way to stop the Trash expanding down the screen like that every time I delete a sub folder.  Is this possible please? </p>",vicki.savage.nz,false,0,0

Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there. It also means that you can uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall without losing your settings and data. The problem arises when anti-virus software is messing with Thunderbird mail files.

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

However, previously you were using a Thunderbird win32bit version. </p><p>In Windows 64bit OS, any program eg: Mozilla Thunderbird using win32bit would get auto installed in&nbsp;: C://Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird And any program eg: Mozilla Thunderbird using win64bit would get auto installed in&nbsp;: C://Program Files/Mozilla Thunderbird </p><p>Sometime back there really was a known issue if someone swapped over from TBwin32 bit to Tbwin64 bit, so for a period of time they deliberately installed win64 into the C://Program Files (x86) location. This happened to me and I thought something with the install location had gone wrong, but it turned out to be deliberate to get round a known issue. </p><p>So, try this: </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird. </li><li> Access C://Program Files/ </li><li> Delete the 'Mozilla Thunderbird' folder. (Basically uninstall the program) </li><li> Empty the computer Recycle Bin. </li><li> Access C://Program Files (x86) folder. </li><li> create a folder and call it 'Mozilla Thunderbird', so you now have&nbsp;: </li><li> C://Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird </li></ul> <ul><li> Download the thunderbird windows 62bit version, but when installing select 'custom' </li><li> Choose this 'Mozilla Thunderbird' location for the install&nbsp;:  </li><li> C://Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>So now you have a win64bit version of Thunderbird running in the old expected location for a win32bit version. Believe me, I'm using this setup and it works perfectly ok. </p><p>Then before you start Thunderbird - access the computer Firewall.  It might be the default installed Firewall or if you have an Anti-Virus installed eg: Norton then Norton could be controlling the Firewall. It is important to make sure that thunderbird.exe is set up as an allowed program to make sure the Firewall does not block anything. </p><p>Allow something to download before you try sending.

There for I assumed that there would be no @.  on my computer they do have an email address with an @.  Unfortunately the address is not a valid one and on many they use the same address. I.E.  'with text in front like ""Dear customer happy birthday to you, Dear customer happy birthday to you<em> then ""homedepotcanada@email.homedepot.ca"" </em> </p><p>When I checked the Blocked Contacts list on the Iphone I noticed that most of the recent email senders I blocked don't have an email address even though on Thunderbird I can see them.
