Way back the localhost was used by malware to send SPAM mail.  That was probably 15 years ago.  But nothing much in the security field is either new or innovative.  They still monitor and routinely block the localhost, either through scanning, or firewall rules. </p><p>Other causes of the localhost not working are software like a development environment that uses the localhost to display web pages, a web server like Apache or a whole host of applications and daemons that monitor ports of the local host adapter. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However, I did notice that I must have been mistaken in saying the OAuth process is completing. The application link does not get created; perhaps I was just looking at the old Oauth link before it stopped working, and when I removed it it did not get recreated. So basically OAuth is broken, not sure how to fix. </p><p>Edit: Found this post online by someone with what appears to be close to the exact same issue, no answer of course. </p><p><a href=""https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/237058395/thunderbird-oauth-fails-for-gmail?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/237058395/thunderbird-oauth-fails-for-gmail?hl=en</a> </p>",st.jfisher,true,0,0

When you only tool you own is a hammer,  everything looks like a nail. </p><p>For sending mail of the kind you are doing you need a dedicated mailing house,  they make deliverability better and will not see you blacklisted as a spammer which is highly likely if you are sending unsolicited or unwelcome mail to consumers.  That you have to limit your activities to less than 30 per hour says you are working very close to being outside the terms of use for your  mail provider. </p><p>The Thunderbird project team used to use <a href=""https://mailchimp.com/pricing/marketing/"" rel=""nofollow"">mailchimp </a>for their mass mailing list needs. Even though they make a mail client, because an email client is not the right tool for mailings involving thousands of recipients. </p><p>A google search for ""bulk email providers"" returns about 24 obviously larger or advertising providers in a grid or you could try one of the ""best"" web pages for reviews of providers. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
