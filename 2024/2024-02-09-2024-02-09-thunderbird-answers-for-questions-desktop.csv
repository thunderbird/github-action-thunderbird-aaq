In fact, just to confuse users even more, Thunderbird shows TWO of them, and one of them is irrelevant ... even though Thunderbird refuses to even show its users how to WRITE AN E-MAIL in the same display. </p><p>4)  The options shown in the latest reply's screencaps are not shown either. There is an occult-level 3-dot icon at the top which then shows a more limited option selection. </p><p>5)   It appears that the entire GUI design project for Thunderbird, which I used with great glee for many years in the past, and with the greatest of ease, has been turned over to the inmates of a hospital for the criminally insane.

If some antivirus product is messing about scanning the files i is trying to write then the save fails and the settings revert to default on the next startup.  Then we get people here complaining that their settings changes are not saved.  If you think it is frustrating,  image where we are sitting,  trying to tell people that the product they see failing is not where the problem is. </p><p>It is always possible that there might be a bug,  but there are so many problems with antivirus products, streaming backups, cloud storage attempts etc that if such a bug exists it is lost in all the noise from third party products. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
