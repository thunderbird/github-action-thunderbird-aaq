Through out that process, Thunderbird is acting as a web browser and sending and receiving messages using standard web ports.  YOur VPN will rouht the traffic as it does any other web page.  Or should. </p><p>Fundamentally a VPN is a recipe for failure with email generally.  Most providers know where you live,  you told them,  as do others like social media, you bank, your employer etc.  Then you deploy a VPN that tries to tell these systems that know where you live that the messages are coming from another place entirely in the world.  Like Vladivostok or Cairo.  So these systems raise a flaf that you might have been hacked.  How that response settles will be provider dependent.  With mail is usually means a refusal to connect.  Others email you to ask if it was you trying to log in.  Yet others simply suspend your account as you have obviously been hacked. </p><p>A VPN is not a good idea for many folks that only use social media, their bank and ISP mail or Gmail for instance. It offers nothing in the way of added security to you or yours. Just some obscurity as to where in the world you are connecting from. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

One possible reason might be sending emails with attachments where the receiving site prevents it. Another possibility is that security for email has been increasing during past years and some of the receiving servers may be rejecting your message.  My first suggestion would be to identify, where possible, which email providers are not letting your messages through. My second suggestion is to review your SMTP settings to see if you are using passwords or OAUTH2, and security such as SSL/TLS or STARTTLS . </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
