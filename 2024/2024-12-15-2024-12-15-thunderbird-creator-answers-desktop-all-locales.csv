I access the account using both IMAP(993 SSL/TLS) and POP3 (995 SSL/TLS) via two different account definitions within TB. </p><p>I use POP3 to basically download and create an archive from the emails.  That would work by POP3 pulling down emails to its own inbox and then a few Message filtering rules on that mailbox moving things into Local Folders (so the POP inbox would remain empty).  Email would also be left on google servers.  Email on the servers would be left in Unread state. </p><p>The IMAP account setup was maing for mobile access etc.  This was basically separate to the POP3 tasks. </p><p>This has been working since 2011. </p><p>I recently notice though that emails weren't downloading via POP3. I've always had logging turned on, and that shows it last processed new email for the POP3 download back in August 2024. </p><p>I can't figure out whats broken.  If I do a manual email-fetch, everything seems to run and it just seems to think there's no new email to pull down.  But thats not true. </p><p>I've looked at the gmail settings and nothing looks different. </p><p>Is there some way I can debug further within TB  to see whats happening&nbsp;? The existing log just shows nothing at all. </p><p>I can pull a wireshark log of the POP3 comms if I switched away from SSL, but I'm not sure gmail supports that </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",firefox2975

Unfortunately the export file cannot be read on my upgraded pc using the Import function - Thunderbird gives me error messages every time, that suggest the exported folder might be corrupted or invalid. </p><p>My IMAP emails are fine, as I have set those accounts up from scratch and the folders have now populated with all the emails - the problem is all my filed emails, dating back many years, which were all stored manually in a filing system under Local Folders.  </p><p>I tried manually copying across the individual files from the extracted back-up folder into my live Thunderbird profile and then reopened Thunderbird...which worked to some extent...as in, all the folders are there, but no emails are showing! It shows no messages under each folder, even though if you look under the Profile you can see that the email files exist. </p><p>I tried various ways to bring them in, including zipping one of the folders and trying to import from the zip file (which also brought in a folder but no emails) but even though the email files are clearly there under my profile, Thunderbird shows 0 messages in all my Local Folders. It's as though it is unaware the files exist, so I suspect it needs them to be formally imported somehow? </p><p>I would hate to lose the emails, as they document important information and purchases etc over many years, along with archived emails for my charity work, social events, etc. As I said, I can see the files are there but simply copying the files to my profile has only worked to the extent the filing 'structure' is visible, Thunderbird doesn't display any of the emails.  </p><p>I have included two images...one of my Thunderbird Local Folders as they currently look, and the other showing the backed up files existing in my Profile, which I hope are helpful. </p><p>Can anyone help please?

(bug1959858),"<p>Thunderbird 128.5.2esr (32-bit) Odd problem in that just one folder was being identified as not being able to be compacted because of Disk Space....not true, plenty of space as I keep it regularly cleaned. I can clear the issue by making another folder of a different name, copying all messages to that folder then running COMPACT on the new folder and nothing is amiss. Run it on the original problem folder and no issues. Delete the original folder and create another with the same old name and transfer the messages to the  now new originally named folder. Delete the TEMP folder. Then run a COMPACT on the problem folder and no issues. </p><p>Then run compact on the whole message tree and sure enough the COMPACT issue has now moved to a different folder. I suspect you could chase this thing till the cows come home but won't resolve, just moves it from folder to folder.  </p><p>Now I could just kill Thunderbird and reinstall but this is intriging.  Not sure if that would help. Ran TROUBLESHOOT MODE clean with out the only extension I use and no change.

Old messages are in Thunderbird2022, Thunderbird 2023 and Thunderbird2024 folders. They were each year's local folders saving place, regularly copied for backup.

Nothing I tried helps. I browsed some documents and found an unknown feature ""profile"", which I have never used.

If I uninstalled it weeks ago, why did a new install show that old one? That's weird.. This supposed ""new"" install still will not download new emails. I have checked the settings and they all seem to be correct.  Could someone please explain why this is happening. It's so frustrating after Thunderbird had worked so well for so long.
