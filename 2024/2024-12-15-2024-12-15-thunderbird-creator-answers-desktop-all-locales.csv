I access the account using both IMAP(993 SSL/TLS) and POP3 (995 SSL/TLS) via two different account definitions within TB. </p><p>I use POP3 to basically download and create an archive from the emails.  That would work by POP3 pulling down emails to its own inbox and then a few Message filtering rules on that mailbox moving things into Local Folders (so the POP inbox would remain empty).  Email would also be left on google servers.  Email on the servers would be left in Unread state. </p><p>The IMAP account setup was maing for mobile access etc.  This was basically separate to the POP3 tasks. </p><p>This has been working since 2011. </p><p>I recently notice though that emails weren't downloading via POP3. I've always had logging turned on, and that shows it last processed new email for the POP3 download back in August 2024. </p><p>I can't figure out whats broken.  If I do a manual email-fetch, everything seems to run and it just seems to think there's no new email to pull down.  But thats not true. </p><p>I've looked at the gmail settings and nothing looks different. </p><p>Is there some way I can debug further within TB  to see whats happening&nbsp;? The existing log just shows nothing at all. </p><p>I can pull a wireshark log of the POP3 comms if I switched away from SSL, but I'm not sure gmail supports that </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",firefox2975
