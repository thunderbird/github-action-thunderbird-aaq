It successfully copied all my messages, address book etc. but the appearance was nothing like it was on the windows 10 machine.  I've fixed most of the problems but the column headers are barely visible.  I can't find anything in the settings despite hours of trying.  Attached is a screen shot of the barely visible column headers, indicated by the red arrow. </p><p>Any help will be appreciated, </p><p>Herman </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",hveenendaal

Basically, I was advised that T-bird is a 3rd party app and by using T-bird to pop my email from gmail, that keeps my gmail account active.  I now must question that. </p><p>Back in December '23, I went to log into gmail in my browser to check the spam folder for an email I had been waiting on.  I could not log in.  I got caught in that ""inactive account"" loop from hell.  Took me about two months before I could finally get logged in in a browser.  At the time, I figured I had just been unlucky enough to have been caught up in the ""inactive account"" thing by accident. </p><p>Now, today, I went to log in to another gmail account in my browser to change my password after a spam email with an attachment was popped to T-bird.  <strong>And I could not get logged in</strong>.  I jumped thru all of Googles firey little hoops.  I played their ""I am not a Bot"" game, and entered the code I had them send to my recovery email account.  THIS particular email address is NOT used for anything but LEGITIMATE dealings - bank, credit cards, bills, credible merchants.  No jokes, no funny pix, no love letters, no nonsense.   I dunno where this spam email came from.  I apparently have not been pwned (yet).  But I want to be safe.  I want to change my password. </p><p>Anywhooooooooo....   it appears that simply popping my email to T-bird since T-bird is considered a 3rd party app that is allegedly one of the ways to keep my gmail account active...  is <strong>NOT</strong> working.  I'm not a real happy camper right now.  I really wouldn't care since this doesn't seem to stop T-bird from being to get me my email.   BUT...you HAVE to log in to webmail to change your password. </p><p>Perhaps using ""Sign in with Google"" literally means using those links you find scattered around, and popping email to T-bird is not included?? </p><p>Once again, I came here hoping for help/answers/advice rather than giving myself a stroke dealing with illogical, no-help, online nonsense at Google. </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",FitAintBrkDntFxIt
