Basically, I was advised that T-bird is a 3rd party app and by using T-bird to pop my email from gmail, that keeps my gmail account active.  I now must question that. </p><p>Back in December '23, I went to log into gmail in my browser to check the spam folder for an email I had been waiting on.  I could not log in.  I got caught in that ""inactive account"" loop from hell.  Took me about two months before I could finally get logged in in a browser.  At the time, I figured I had just been unlucky enough to have been caught up in the ""inactive account"" thing by accident. </p><p>Now, today, I went to log in to another gmail account in my browser to change my password after a spam email with an attachment was popped to T-bird.  <strong>And I could not get logged in</strong>.  I jumped thru all of Googles firey little hoops.  I played their ""I am not a Bot"" game, and entered the code I had them send to my recovery email account.  THIS particular email address is NOT used for anything but LEGITIMATE dealings - bank, credit cards, bills, credible merchants.  No jokes, no funny pix, no love letters, no nonsense.   I dunno where this spam email came from.  I apparently have not been pwned (yet).  But I want to be safe.  I want to change my password. </p><p>Anywhooooooooo....   it appears that simply popping my email to T-bird since T-bird is considered a 3rd party app that is allegedly one of the ways to keep my gmail account active...  is <strong>NOT</strong> working.  I'm not a real happy camper right now.  I really wouldn't care since this doesn't seem to stop T-bird from being to get me my email.   BUT...you HAVE to log in to webmail to change your password. </p><p>Perhaps using ""Sign in with Google"" literally means using those links you find scattered around, and popping email to T-bird is not included?? </p><p>Once again, I came here hoping for help/answers/advice rather than giving myself a stroke dealing with illogical, no-help, online nonsense at Google. </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1643845;1643960;,FitAintBrkDntFxIt

Yesterday i got this new customer who said he can't receive mails anymore.

When i first opened the updated Thunderbird the password prompt appears and the problems begin. </p><p><strong>What i tried to fix the problem</strong> I did some research. I searched for pkcs11.txt inside the profile, but there was none. After that i looked for key3.db and key4.db files, i found both and moved them both to a backup-folder and started Thunderbird again. key4.db is created new, but that does not fix the problem. I can't find any more related topics to my problem, so maybe some of you have any idea.
