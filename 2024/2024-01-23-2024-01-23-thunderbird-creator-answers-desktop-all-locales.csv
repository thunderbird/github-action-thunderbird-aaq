But as of a couple days ago I have been getting errors when I open Thunderbird. 1) It always ask me to login even after I save the password to always login. 2) I get this message: ""Login to server <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a> with username caulkerguy@comcast.net failed."" 3) Then I get this error message ""Alert from account caulkerguy@comcast.net 1014."" I have checked all my Server settings and all are correct as per your online settings. I have searched the web and have not found any fixes. Are there any fixes or work arounds? I would hate to stop using Thunderbird as I really like it! I have included 2 screenshots.Thanks for any and all help!
