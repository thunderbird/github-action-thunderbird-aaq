But as of a couple days ago I have been getting errors when I open Thunderbird. 1) It always ask me to login even after I save the password to always login. 2) I get this message: ""Login to server <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a> with username caulkerguy@comcast.net failed."" 3) Then I get this error message ""Alert from account caulkerguy@comcast.net 1014."" I have checked all my Server settings and all are correct as per your online settings. I have searched the web and have not found any fixes. Are there any fixes or work arounds? I would hate to stop using Thunderbird as I really like it! I have included 2 screenshots.Thanks for any and all help!

I have become quite used to using userchrome to highly personalise my TB, mainly to restore previous features. </p><p>However, somehow, in making the ""Write"" screen the way I like it, I have shrunk the section of the Contacts Sidebar which contains the actual addresses/contacts, down to the point where only one contact is visible. There is a scroll bar so I can see the other addresses are there. It is just that the bottom border of that box has elevated itself and there is a mass of blank space below. </p><p>I am sure I have caused it with some code, however everything I have tried to adjust only works on the heading part of the Contacts Sidebar, not the panel with the addresses. I have searched the net to find out what that panel is officially called, without success. </p><p>Could a helpful person tell me the ""official"" name (to use in the css) of that panel so that I can fix it? Or even write me a little code to make that box go back to default? </p><p>Just for context, the reason I was fiddling with it was because the panel is excessively spaced, and I was trying to compact the contacts together. </p><p>Thanks Fiona </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",pandf
