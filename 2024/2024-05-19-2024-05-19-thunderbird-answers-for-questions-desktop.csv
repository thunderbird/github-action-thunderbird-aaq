When i started using multiple platforms to read my emails (phone, PC, etc.) I had to change email accounts to IMAP from POP because I wanted the emails to remain on the server after being read by an email client so that another email client on another platform could subsequently read it.  POP, as you say, removes the email from the server when it is read by any client so was not suitable when I wanted to read from multiple clients.  It also meant that emails in my joint account with my wife could be read by both of us.  Since that change I have successfully been using Windows Live Mail with all emails being stored locally automatically.  The migration to Thunderbird was done because of some issues I was having with Live Mail.  My wife has been using Thunderbird for some years and her emails are not deleted from Thunderbird when they are deleted from the server using Mailwasher.  I guess my next step is to compare setup settings on our two computers. </p>",mike.smith3,false,0,0

So something happened in the migration process.  I'm now more confused than ever because how can a POP3 email be accessed by multiple clients without it being removed from the server?  Obviously there's more to this than meets the eye!  Many thanks for your help, David.  I'll persevere, hope it works and not try to understand it necessarily. </p>",mike.smith3,false,0,0
