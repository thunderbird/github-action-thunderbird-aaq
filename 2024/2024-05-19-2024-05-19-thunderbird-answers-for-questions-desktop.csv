You can always grab the latest release from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> and install it over the currently installed version. The installer will upgrade the outdated version. Consider a repair-install of Windows 10 to fix that system. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0
