I created an email to send to myself that also failed to come to the in box and generated the msg about I being sent but not going in the sent folder. I was trying to “kickstart” the system! It refers to network or file access errors which may give a clue about why emails are not coming into the in box? </p>,pilgrim99,false,0,0

When I click on BOOKMARKS I get a lengthy list of sites I have never opened and have no interest in.  I'm asking two questions:  (1) how can I delete more than one entry at a time and (2) how can I keep this list from repopulating.  Any ideas? </p><p>Thanks, </p>",smallnumber1,false,0,0
