I'll attach a screenshot. I asked this question in 2021 after updating to Thunderbird 91.1.2 and the answer I got was to use an add-on called MoreLayouts, which had been working great the last few years but after the latest update (115.7.0) it says it's no longer supported.

Since then however whenever I try to open Thun­derbird I always receive the following message: Thunderbird is already running, but is not responding. To use Thunderbird, you must first close the existing Thunderbird process, restart your device, or use a different profile. Furthermore, on the label of the desktop I use for Thunderbird label lists two windows open on it which are quoted in the box below. Password required Mozilla Thunderbird -  Close Thunderbird  In spite of the foregoing on the screen there is no window to enter a password nor Thunderbird to be closed. As for the one window that does appear, the first box above, I find its first assertion inordinately obfuscating under the circumstances.  Thunderbird not only had not been installed but was obviously but also was incapable of responding to anything.  I consequently doubt strongly that the text in the top box has anything to do the the problem I am having with the inability of Thunderbird to open. However, every time I try to open Thunderbird these three lock files are created: .parent lock cookies.sqlite-wal Telemetry.FailedProfileLocks.txt The first two I delete before every attempt to open Thunderbird.  The third I leave alone, not under­standing what it means or what purpose it serves.  It is updated every time I try.   I also tried without success to open Thunderbird in safe mode.   The location and name of thunderbird in my laptop is directory ~/mozilla/thunderbird/9vgk89rr.default.  The profiles.ini file is located in directory ~/.thunderbird and reads as follows: [InstallFDC34C9F024745EB]  Default=/home/ken/mozilla/thunderbird/9vgk89rr.default [Profile0] Name=ken IsRelative=0 Path=/home/ken/mozilla/thunderbird/9vgk89rr.default Default=1 [General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 This current arrangement dates from 2021, but 9vgk89rr.default directory for Thunderbird dates from about 2006.  It contains three of my most used email addresses, and all sorts of essential and valuable information.  I need badly to have access to my Thunderbird as soon as possible and would appreciate greatly receiving information as to how to do so.
