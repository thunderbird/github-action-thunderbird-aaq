Reverting back to Windows basic default graphics driver, all works as should but looks terrible  </p><p>Has anyone come across this behaviour before? </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",JustOne

I'll attach a screenshot. I asked this question in 2021 after updating to Thunderbird 91.1.2 and the answer I got was to use an add-on called MoreLayouts, which had been working great the last few years but after the latest update (115.7.0) it says it's no longer supported. The only other solution I've been able to find is to use BetterBird but I'd much rather stick with TB if there's a way to do it.
