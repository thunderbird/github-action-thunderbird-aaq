When we send an email to a non-existent email address, the NDR generated by Exchange is delivered to junk folder. I have already contacted Microsoft support, but since the problem does not occur when i use their products, they directed me to contact Thunderbird support instead.  </p><p>No filters or rules have been set within the Thunderbird client. In fact, if i send the message and close Thunderbird before the NDR is received and then open another email client (e.g. Outlook in desktop or online), the NDR is still delivered in my junk folder, so it seems that the filtering is done in the server. </p><p>To my best judgement, since the message that is marked as junk is not the one that was generated and sent through Thunderbird but the one that the server informs me that the recipient's address does not exist, it seems to me that it is a server-side problem. Moreover, it seems to me that in this case Microsoft marks its own system-generated messages as junk which sounds a bit strange. However, Microsoft's support directed me to Thunderbird support so here we are. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

(I'm 54).  I have one company that sends out a few emails, but lately they are very difficult to read after I ""Allow Remote Content"". My Sister has the same problem. I've asked the company if they they've changed anything, but they say it's more likely the Thunderbird Client. </p><p>When the email comes in, it has normal readable black text. But as soon as I ""Allow Remote Content"" to see pictures etc, the text goes to a very light grey thin font. Almost unreadable. See the attachment. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1642020;1642030;1642038;1642039;1642089;1642116;1642125;,rich106

Want to find the word ""copy"" and have the word ""copying"" not trigger a successful or failed find.","<p>I'm looking for the word ""copy"" in the body of my messages.  Almost all of my messages contain the word ""copying"".  The correct find would contain ""copy"" and the word ""copying"" should be ignored.  Another way to say that is the search should neither trigger a successful find nor exclude a successful find with the word ""copying"" in the body.  It should only be  a successful find if copy is in the body. </p><p>Another way to say it would be to find ""copy"" but not ""copy*"" </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1642017;,jkennedy2004
