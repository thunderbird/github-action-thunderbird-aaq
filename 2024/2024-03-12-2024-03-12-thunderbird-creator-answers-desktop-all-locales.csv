Have been trying to add some accounts from a domain and this is where it seems to got astray. Added one account (acc#1) some time ago. At that time there was some issues at the time with the changing of the mail servers and the old provider. Left it partially entered within Thunderbird. With that, waited for a week or two to re-add these addresses. The one left was still there, redid the server settings, and added several other addresses from that domain. All seemed to be working just fine at that point... So closed out Thunderbird and shutdown the computer. </p><p>Upon rebooting the computer and opening Thunderbird... The account that was partially entered was there, but with the old incorrect settings. The other addresses were no where to be found. </p><p>Each time I shutdown Thunderbird and either restart or turn on the computer, the old (acc#1) is still there but with the incorrect settings. Have tried to delete it but it keeps coming back. </p><p>Assistance with this would be appreciated... </p><p>Do occasionally run CCleaner on this computer... could that be causing any of these issues? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",jrazor

When we send an email to a non-existent email address, the NDR generated by Exchange is delivered to junk folder. I have already contacted Microsoft support, but since the problem does not occur when i use their products, they directed me to contact Thunderbird support instead.  </p><p>No filters or rules have been set within the Thunderbird client. In fact, if i send the message and close Thunderbird before the NDR is received and then open another email client (e.g. Outlook in desktop or online), the NDR is still delivered in my junk folder, so it seems that the filtering is done in the server. </p><p>To my best judgement, since the message that is marked as junk is not the one that was generated and sent through Thunderbird but the one that the server informs me that the recipient's address does not exist, it seems to me that it is a server-side problem. Moreover, it seems to me that in this case Microsoft marks its own system-generated messages as junk which sounds a bit strange. However, Microsoft's support directed me to Thunderbird support so here we are. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask me for any additional information that might be needed. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1641794;1641796;1641797;1641799;1641800;1641801;1641802;,vdrag

The newsletter writers send their product out with covered links.  For instance  https://xyz.link is hidden under ""XYZ information"", underlined so the reader knows it's a link. Thunderbird converts the links to raw links.  I cannot for the life of me why Thunderbird does this.  It makes the newsletters almost impossible to read. I'm attaching a screenshot.
