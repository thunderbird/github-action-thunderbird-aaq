Have been trying to add some accounts from a domain and this is where it seems to got astray. Added one account (acc#1) some time ago. At that time there was some issues at the time with the changing of the mail servers and the old provider. Left it partially entered within Thunderbird. With that, waited for a week or two to re-add these addresses. The one left was still there, redid the server settings, and added several other addresses from that domain. All seemed to be working just fine at that point... So closed out Thunderbird and shutdown the computer. </p><p>Upon rebooting the computer and opening Thunderbird... The account that was partially entered was there, but with the old incorrect settings. The other addresses were no where to be found. </p><p>Each time I shutdown Thunderbird and either restart or turn on the computer, the old (acc#1) is still there but with the incorrect settings. Have tried to delete it but it keeps coming back. </p><p>Assistance with this would be appreciated... </p><p>Do occasionally run CCleaner on this computer... could that be causing any of these issues? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",jrazor
