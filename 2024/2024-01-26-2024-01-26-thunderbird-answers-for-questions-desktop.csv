Why did you do something with POP? What is the error message you see when attempting to get mails? </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However, I added a ""new"" account, it acted like it took it, but it's not showing up.  Maybe it's because of years of using Outlook or something, but I'd expect it to show up as another inbox...? </p><p>So I guess the expanded question is:  How to make it see multiple accounts? </p>",jesme,false,0,0
