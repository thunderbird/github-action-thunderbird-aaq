Then, in thunderbird, read the messages and move to a more desirable profile for going forward. That also applies to POP account folders, such as inbox and sent folders.

I'm on a Mac and I understand what you stated BUT I'm confused b/c as you know, profiles do not store emails in EML format.  So are you saying - copy the sbd folders into local folders via finder and then TB will automatically convert them to EMLs?  As an aside, I was thinking of SYNCING multiple profiles together in a ""sandbox"" (back-up TEST profile on an external drive) by using one of several programs that syncronize data / files / folders - like GoodSync or ChronoSync.  Alternatively, since I was able to download ZILLIONS of EMLs, I can ALSO MERGE them MANUALLY and then run MacPaw Gemini2 Dupe finder.  OR I could manually merge / copy them all into my local folders and then run the ""Remove Duplicate Messages"" add-on to clean things up.  I'm GOOD ONCE I get the emails INTO EML formats - my problem is I'm UNABLE to open ALL profiles and EXTRACT them into EMLs.  Sadly the UncleMac Converter worked GREAT for this BUT the emails were corrupt and had errors.  So now I'm thinking I may find a WORKING Thunderbird app that EXTRACTS EMLs from Profiles.  And in doing so, I won't need to OPEN UP the emails in TB and keep fighting with it.  Please explain if you feel I can move / merge TB folders into Local Folders via the Mac Finder.  Otherwise, if you know of any apps that EXTRACT emails from Profiles, please drop some names.  As I type I'm searching for such an app.  THANKS again!

Managing files is simpler (to me) than extracting all the eml messages. If you still want them in eml, you could run the import/export addon after the file is moved to local folders to then extract the eml.  While I regret you have having this mess to fix, profiles have proved a reliable envelope in providing a stable environment. What you're experiencing happened over a large period of time, and I'm clueless on that. That was just my opinion; my hope is to assist you in getting your messages back where you want them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So tell me please, what folder level should I move?  And can I move folders into Local Folders or the NON Local Folders Top half of TB?  Have you actually done this?  As you know, the other option is to find a WORKING and LEGIT Profile to EML conversion program.  It appeared MacUncle worked BUT when I actually read dozens of emails I found ALL kinds of problems.  So now I'm hoping to pay $30 - $60 and to just open Profile A and convert, open B and convert, etc.  Then I can use Finder to organize and I can run dupe searches before or after I import to TB local folders.  I LOVE TB's account integration and the ease of the app BUT I HATE the Profile file structure and the MANY ambiguous ways Profiles are listed (Program Manager, in Cache, Profile manager profile names do NOT match ACTUAL profile names in finder, the ABOUT Profiles section of Troubleshooting lists DIFFERENT Root and Local Folders profiles then are ACTUALLY being used etc.).

For example, if two profiles each have Mail\accountxyz\inbox and inbox.msf and the size and date are the same, those are duplicates and only one should be marked for saving. The intent in this phase is to eliminate as many possible duplicates as possible. Make a list of the ones that are clear duplicates to avoid wasting time in extracting them. - now, in the mac file manager, locate desired message folders in the first old profile. These are normally in sets of two (e.g., inbox, inbox.msf). Copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder in the new profile.  - now, start Thunderbird and the folders should appear and be accessible. I suggest at this time to rename the folders as you probably want to merge their messages later with other message folders.  - repeat the above for each of the old profiles, copying to Mail\Local folders, checking in thunderbird and then renaming.  - once you finish this, you will have all the saved messages in local folders. If some are for the same account, you could here create a new local folder with the account name, and then copy appropriate messages from the several other folders into the one primary account. You can now delete those staging folders.  </p><p>I probably omitted a few minor steps here and there, but I think I've identified the basic process.

I JUST texted with MacSonik who has this product which I downloaded and tested AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY.  I converted over 1000 emails in NO TIME and ALL imported into TB as EMLs without ANY problem!  NO lost data.  <a href=""https://www.macsonik.com/thunderbird-backup/guide.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.macsonik.com/thunderbird-backup/guide.php</a>  I even got a discount and it's only $35.10 in total which is totally worth it.  ALL you need do (see link) is point to your TB profile and select what you want converted then it does the magic VERY quickly.  The PROBLEM is you cannot point to profile on EXTERNAL HDDs, you MUST IMPORT the Profiles to the Main TB Profile folder before it works but that's OK.  So, I'm going to 1.  Organize ALL of my profile in One location on my Mac.  Then ONE by ONE convert Profile A, then B, then C ALL into EMLs.  THEN I'm going to merged, run for dupes, organize EVERYTHING OUTSIDE of TB.  Then when everything is organized, import it all into my Local Folders and marry to existing data OR I may export ALL existing data to my desktop and merge and clean with the new EMLs THEN move it all back to TB, six of one, half dozen of another.  This is a MUCH cleaner solution than FIGHTING with the Profile structures and ALL of the confusion it causes.

I have about 20 or more back-ups of TB profiles.  I also have many exported EMLs from the *same* add-on you suggested.  My goal is to and merge ALL data, get rid of dupes and organize them into folders by year or topic OR perhaps just a huge master folder for all emails.  No small task.  I currently have a large (80gb) Locals Folder from Profile A and an active IMAP TB profile B running at the same time.  The problem is, when I open Profile C (D, E, F) and TRY to move files from the top section of TB to the bottom local folders (Profile A) section it's difficult because of the horrible way TB presents the location of your data (the server options contradict the profiles tools options which differ from the ACTUAL location on your HDD).  So when you have 20 profiles - EVEN if you can make this work - you must keep switching the local folders to the SAME master local folders location / folder / Profile A - while changing the data / IMAP emails / Profile (C,D,E) in the top section.  Again, easier said than done.  So I have used the import / export add-on and it's OK for part of this but I have so many profiles I'm now a deer in a headlight.  FYI, as you know the Import / Export add-on also has an IMPORT option OUTSIDE it's OWN menu which in theory allows PROFILES to be added but there is poor documentation on this and when I try it, I usually create more of a mess.  I'm not sure why your above text is sarcastic (""I really don't understand that. But it you are happy, go for it."") when my problem is the SAME problem virtually ALL long term TB customers have....MULTIPLE Profiles and NO EASY way to MERGE data.  FYI, I bought and tested MacSonik and it worked with NO errors.  It's STUPID easy to use and here is the advantage of it.  I can EASILY open Profile A, then B, then C....M - then export ONLY EMLs with NO ERRORS in the SAME file structure.  THEN I can merge ALL of these EMLs / Folders in finder -- OUTSIDE TB -- and can EASILY organize / run MacPaw Gemini2 to remove dupes.  When done, EVERY TB Profile will be converted to EMLs, ALL EMLs will be merged / cleaned / organized and THEN I can EASILY import the FINAL data set into a NEW Profile A (call it Profile A2) which ONLY has the FINAL set of clean data WHILE KEEPING my existing Profile B data in the top section for Imap accounts.  Yes, this sounds complicated BUT it's a much better option than fighting with confusing TB profiles IN TB.  In short, **ironically** - I feel (MY opinion ONLY) - it's better to organize TB profiles OUTSIDE of TB then import them with the import / export tool BACK into a fresh profile.  What's needed is an app or add-on that merges multiple profiles at the same time.  What is ALSO needed is for TB to fix the horrible way it presents Profiles as it's horribly confusing.  Thanks for your comments.  I hope mine make sense. </p>",joseph.obx,false,0,0
