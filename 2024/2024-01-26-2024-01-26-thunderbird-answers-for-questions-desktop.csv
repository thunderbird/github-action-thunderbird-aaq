Why did you do something with POP? What is the error message you see when attempting to get mails? </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Notifies of new mail and shows unread counts in the folder pane.  But beyond that I really don't think I understand your question. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However, I added a ""new"" account, it acted like it took it, but it's not showing up.  Maybe it's because of years of using Outlook or something, but I'd expect it to show up as another inbox...? </p><p>So I guess the expanded question is:  How to make it see multiple accounts? </p>",jesme,false,0,0

Only IMAP accounts get their own entry and that is because each folder is syncronised to the server, not for any other specific reason. </p><p>You can force the issue to have a fully formed account with it's own folders by changing the settings in the advanced button in account settings &gt; server setting to use it's own inbox.  Personally I like only having one inbox to look at and one sent folder. </p><p>Personally I dropped using Outlook about 2004.  As soon as Microsoft introduced their ribbon toolbar, Office went with it.  I have not looked back except to do occasional projects in Excel building templates and macros, so I struggle when folks compare with outlook. I have no frame of common reference in that product to refer to. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Email uses what are called <a href=""https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#application"" rel=""nofollow"">media types</a> to identify the content of attachments at the time they are composed and this information goes with the email. </p><p>Then there are ancillary data types that Excel ""claims"" that are actually text data.  So with that knowledge, the first thing to do it have a look at the message source (ctrl+U) looking for where the attachment is defined. </p><p>You will see a block that looks like the following, somewhere in the body of the email source.  The following is for a PDF file attachment, but it illustrates what you are looking for. </p><pre>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""INV-AUS-2388174.pdf"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-Type: application/pdf; name=""INV-AUS-2388174.pdf""  </pre> <p>I have a feeling when you find this block the content type will not be one of the registered Excel media types; application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel.addin.macroEnabled.12 application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel.sheet.binary.macroEnabled.12 application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel.sheet.macroEnabled.12 </p><p>But instead something like text/csv or csv-schema which would explain the predilection for text based applications to handle the data. </p><p>But please have a look and report back what you find. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

There is a global index/database that the full test search uses. </p><p>There is a folder index that is mostly used to populate the lists in the user interface  Then there are the actual email storage files. </p><p>The first of the things you mention is the data is in the full text database for searching. The second conversation uses the second data source, the folder index, and the display of the mail is when the last item in the set, the mail storage file, is interrogated to retrieve the email from the location stored in the folder index.  It is coming up blank. </p><p>This would indicate that in all probability the first two items are ""out of date"" and the emails are no longer held in the folder.

Most custom domains are not correctly setup for this as they are often DIY efforts working through checklists that are discarded when it appears to be working. This week Google has stopped delivering mail that is failing these validations.  I would guess that that did not get the email are probably using Gmail as they are the big provider (lie 40%) that has changed something major about delivering mail. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
