Why did you do something with POP? What is the error message you see when attempting to get mails? </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Notifies of new mail and shows unread counts in the folder pane.  But beyond that I really don't think I understand your question. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

However, I added a ""new"" account, it acted like it took it, but it's not showing up.  Maybe it's because of years of using Outlook or something, but I'd expect it to show up as another inbox...? </p><p>So I guess the expanded question is:  How to make it see multiple accounts? </p>",jesme,false,0,0

Only IMAP accounts get their own entry and that is because each folder is syncronised to the server, not for any other specific reason. </p><p>You can force the issue to have a fully formed account with it's own folders by changing the settings in the advanced button in account settings &gt; server setting to use it's own inbox.  Personally I like only having one inbox to look at and one sent folder. </p><p>Personally I dropped using Outlook about 2004.  As soon as Microsoft introduced their ribbon toolbar, Office went with it.  I have not looked back except to do occasional projects in Excel building templates and macros, so I struggle when folks compare with outlook. I have no frame of common reference in that product to refer to. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Email uses what are called <a href=""https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#application"" rel=""nofollow"">media types</a> to identify the content of attachments at the time they are composed and this information goes with the email. </p><p>Then there are ancillary data types that Excel ""claims"" that are actually text data.  So with that knowledge, the first thing to do it have a look at the message source (ctrl+U) looking for where the attachment is defined. </p><p>You will see a block that looks like the following, somewhere in the body of the email source.  The following is for a PDF file attachment, but it illustrates what you are looking for. </p><pre>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""INV-AUS-2388174.pdf"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-Type: application/pdf; name=""INV-AUS-2388174.pdf""  </pre> <p>I have a feeling when you find this block the content type will not be one of the registered Excel media types; application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel.addin.macroEnabled.12 application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel.sheet.binary.macroEnabled.12 application/<a href=""http://vnd.ms"" rel=""nofollow"">vnd.ms</a>-excel.sheet.macroEnabled.12 </p><p>But instead something like text/csv or csv-schema which would explain the predilection for text based applications to handle the data. </p><p>But please have a look and report back what you find. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
