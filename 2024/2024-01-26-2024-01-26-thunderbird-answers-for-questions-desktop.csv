My approach is two-fold: Locate the message files/folders and copy them to Local Folders in the designated profile. Then, in thunderbird, read the messages and move to a more desirable profile for going forward. That also applies to POP account folders, such as inbox and sent folders. Attempting to merge actual profiles has been, for me, a downward spiral.

I'm on a Mac and I understand what you stated BUT I'm confused b/c as you know, profiles do not store emails in EML format.  So are you saying - copy the sbd folders into local folders via finder and then TB will automatically convert them to EMLs?  As an aside, I was thinking of SYNCING multiple profiles together in a ""sandbox"" (back-up TEST profile on an external drive) by using one of several programs that syncronize data / files / folders - like GoodSync or ChronoSync.  Alternatively, since I was able to download ZILLIONS of EMLs, I can ALSO MERGE them MANUALLY and then run MacPaw Gemini2 Dupe finder.  OR I could manually merge / copy them all into my local folders and then run the ""Remove Duplicate Messages"" add-on to clean things up.  I'm GOOD ONCE I get the emails INTO EML formats - my problem is I'm UNABLE to open ALL profiles and EXTRACT them into EMLs.  Sadly the UncleMac Converter worked GREAT for this BUT the emails were corrupt and had errors.  So now I'm thinking I may find a WORKING Thunderbird app that EXTRACTS EMLs from Profiles.  And in doing so, I won't need to OPEN UP the emails in TB and keep fighting with it.  Please explain if you feel I can move / merge TB folders into Local Folders via the Mac Finder.  Otherwise, if you know of any apps that EXTRACT emails from Profiles, please drop some names.  As I type I'm searching for such an app.  THANKS again!

Managing files is simpler (to me) than extracting all the eml messages. If you still want them in eml, you could run the import/export addon after the file is moved to local folders to then extract the eml.  While I regret you have having this mess to fix, profiles have proved a reliable envelope in providing a stable environment. What you're experiencing happened over a large period of time, and I'm clueless on that. That was just my opinion; my hope is to assist you in getting your messages back where you want them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So tell me please, what folder level should I move?  And can I move folders into Local Folders or the NON Local Folders Top half of TB?  Have you actually done this?  As you know, the other option is to find a WORKING and LEGIT Profile to EML conversion program.  It appeared MacUncle worked BUT when I actually read dozens of emails I found ALL kinds of problems.  So now I'm hoping to pay $30 - $60 and to just open Profile A and convert, open B and convert, etc.  Then I can use Finder to organize and I can run dupe searches before or after I import to TB local folders.  I LOVE TB's account integration and the ease of the app BUT I HATE the Profile file structure and the MANY ambiguous ways Profiles are listed (Program Manager, in Cache, Profile manager profile names do NOT match ACTUAL profile names in finder, the ABOUT Profiles section of Troubleshooting lists DIFFERENT Root and Local Folders profiles then are ACTUALLY being used etc.).

For example, if two profiles each have Mail\accountxyz\inbox and inbox.msf and the size and date are the same, those are duplicates and only one should be marked for saving. The intent in this phase is to eliminate as many possible duplicates as possible. Make a list of the ones that are clear duplicates to avoid wasting time in extracting them. - now, in the mac file manager, locate desired message folders in the first old profile. These are normally in sets of two (e.g., inbox, inbox.msf). Copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder in the new profile.  - now, start Thunderbird and the folders should appear and be accessible. I suggest at this time to rename the folders as you probably want to merge their messages later with other message folders.  - repeat the above for each of the old profiles, copying to Mail\Local folders, checking in thunderbird and then renaming.  - once you finish this, you will have all the saved messages in local folders. If some are for the same account, you could here create a new local folder with the account name, and then copy appropriate messages from the several other folders into the one primary account. You can now delete those staging folders.  </p><p>I probably omitted a few minor steps here and there, but I think I've identified the basic process. When done, be sure to do a full backup with Thunderbird NOT running. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I JUST texted with MacSonik who has this product which I downloaded and tested AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY.  I converted over 1000 emails in NO TIME and ALL imported into TB as EMLs without ANY problem!  NO lost data.  <a href=""https://www.macsonik.com/thunderbird-backup/guide.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.macsonik.com/thunderbird-backup/guide.php</a>  I even got a discount and it's only $35.10 in total which is totally worth it.  ALL you need do (see link) is point to your TB profile and select what you want converted then it does the magic VERY quickly.  The PROBLEM is you cannot point to profile on EXTERNAL HDDs, you MUST IMPORT the Profiles to the Main TB Profile folder before it works but that's OK.  So, I'm going to 1.  Organize ALL of my profile in One location on my Mac.  Then ONE by ONE convert Profile A, then B, then C ALL into EMLs.  THEN I'm going to merged, run for dupes, organize EVERYTHING OUTSIDE of TB.  Then when everything is organized, import it all into my Local Folders and marry to existing data OR I may export ALL existing data to my desktop and merge and clean with the new EMLs THEN move it all back to TB, six of one, half dozen of another.  This is a MUCH cleaner solution than FIGHTING with the Profile structures and ALL of the confusion it causes.
