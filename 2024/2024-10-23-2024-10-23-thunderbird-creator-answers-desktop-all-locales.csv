I don't know but suspect that running the last version (115) that supports win 7 and it somehow has quit working.  It works fine on the laptop but I'm worried that either the ""upgrade sync"" has somehow not recognized that it was running on the windows 7 and it bumped / prepped the windows&nbsp;???  I noticed that it just started saying on the latest version that it requires windows 10.  I don't want to give in and update windows.
