So, when the final ""match anything"" filter is encountered, ALL of those previously processed, marked read messages are actually moved (copy/delete, I suppose) to the final designated folder. </p><p>So, if this is not a bug, how can I achieve the original behavior? </p><p>Some additional, should be irrelevant info: I have one main account which mostly gets things addressed to my @spamcop.net address.

Anything else ( that is, left over from the previous filtering ) is supposed to go to the inbox folder of my Spamcop account for possible spam reporting, Marked ""unread"". As it is, every incoming message goes into that account, marked read. Useless. </p><p>A final note is that messages ~moved~ to the main inbox are ignored in normal use, but if I select filters and manually apply them, they work as expected. </p><p>Thanks for any help with this.

Also the number of messages were only about a quarter of what should be in the Inbox.  So I clicked on Properties of the Inbox  - the number of messages that were shown in the Repair Window was about right so I clicked on ""Repair folder"".  The repair process seems to have deleted all of the other messages and left my Inbox with just a quarter of what should be there. None of the missing messages are in the Deleted box or the Archives.  </p><p>So does anyone have a way of getting these deleted messages back? </p><p>If not, I do a regular back-up of my Thunderbird profile. How can I go about getting just my Inbox back from the backup. I have years of Archives in my set-up (20GB+). And I am afraid that given what has happened today, I might lose those as well if I restore my whole profile. Ideally, I would like to restore just my back-up Inbox to a second Inbox (Inbox-1) and then just migrate across the missing messages. What files should I copy across from my backup? </p><p>The reason I have put urgent in the subject line is that I am in hte middle of some complex issues that require the exchange of a lot of emails and I need to look back at emails that are now missing. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1683612;,moojanmomen

Your not allowed to complain because all these people work for free to make it great. But, they just have to change a good thing up so they have something to do. I use to get the rare spam mixed into my mail, and no spam in the junk mailbox. Now since a recent change in the last week,  I have spam every where. Duplicate spam too! In my in box, in junk mail. It's like Yahoo mail now. Two pieces of mail, and a spam mailbox with 50 pieces of junk mail. This is just like the weird change a couple of years ago when after you deleted your mail, it just showed up again. That's when I was told how ungrateful I was for complaining. All the poor Mozilla patriots, slaving away to make the World a better place. Changing stuff just to be changing stuff! I guess they want to work at Microsoft. Here comes Windows the Dozen. Greatest yet! Why did I push that upgrade Thunderbird button. </p><p>P.S. Watch me get called dumb because Mozilla doesn't have anything to do with Thunderbird. Oh, wait, Mozilla took Thunderbird back. I'm safe! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",c.capers1
