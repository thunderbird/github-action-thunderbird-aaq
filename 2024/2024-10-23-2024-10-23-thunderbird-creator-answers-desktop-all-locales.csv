So, when the final ""match anything"" filter is encountered, ALL of those previously processed, marked read messages are actually moved (copy/delete, I suppose) to the final designated folder. </p><p>So, if this is not a bug, how can I achieve the original behavior? </p><p>Some additional, should be irrelevant info: I have one main account which mostly gets things addressed to my @spamcop.net address.

Anything else ( that is, left over from the previous filtering ) is supposed to go to the inbox folder of my Spamcop account for possible spam reporting, Marked ""unread"". As it is, every incoming message goes into that account, marked read. Useless. </p><p>A final note is that messages ~moved~ to the main inbox are ignored in normal use, but if I select filters and manually apply them, they work as expected. </p><p>Thanks for any help with this.

Also the number of messages were only about a quarter of what should be in the Inbox.  So I clicked on Properties of the Inbox  - the number of messages that were shown in the Repair Window was about right so I clicked on ""Repair folder"".  The repair process seems to have deleted all of the other messages and left my Inbox with just a quarter of what should be there. None of the missing messages are in the Deleted box or the Archives.  </p><p>So does anyone have a way of getting these deleted messages back? </p><p>If not, I do a regular back-up of my Thunderbird profile. How can I go about getting just my Inbox back from the backup. I have years of Archives in my set-up (20GB+). And I am afraid that given what has happened today, I might lose those as well if I restore my whole profile. Ideally, I would like to restore just my back-up Inbox to a second Inbox (Inbox-1) and then just migrate across the missing messages. What files should I copy across from my backup? </p><p>The reason I have put urgent in the subject line is that I am in hte middle of some complex issues that require the exchange of a lot of emails and I need to look back at emails that are now missing. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1683612;1683695;1683712;1683722;1683773;1683796;,moojanmomen

It's like Yahoo mail now. Two pieces of mail, and a spam mailbox with 50 pieces of junk mail. This is just like the weird change a couple of years ago when after you deleted your mail, it just showed up again. That's when I was told how ungrateful I was for complaining. All the poor Mozilla patriots, slaving away to make the World a better place. Changing stuff just to be changing stuff! I guess they want to work at Microsoft. Here comes Windows the Dozen.

I have four accounts, same mail server, DNS is all correct, etc.  I noticed that I was not getting mail, so I sent some mail from gmail to my business accounts (accesses by TBird only) and response was ""no mail"".  Looked later, still no mail.  Then, ""new mail"" but only on one account.  Arrival time was about 8 minutes after sending but I was clicking ""check messages"" frequently for the first two or three minutes.  My setting is every ten minutes - check for new mail.   </p><p>TBird is completely skipping two other accounts.  And this is quite odd because tbird has always functioned perfectly for me, for years, maybe decades.  This is a new, seemingly random development that seems to coincide with the last update 128.3.3esr (32-bit).   </p><p>I also find it odd that I have server locations pop3.*****.com and smtp.*****.com, instead of either pop3 or smtp on all mail accounts.   </p><p>Can I roll back an update or two and see if that helps?
