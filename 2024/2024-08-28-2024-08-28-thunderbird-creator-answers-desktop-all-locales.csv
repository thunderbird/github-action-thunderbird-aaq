Here an English translation: </p><p>This bug affects Thunderbird 115.13.0 (64-bit) under Xubuntu 22.04: </p><p>In the dialog that allows you to view, enter or change the password for accessing a mailbox according to the instructions at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/passworter-thunderbird-speichern-andern-loschen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/passworter-thunderbird-speichern-and...</a>, there is a small bug: <strong>the dialog window cannot be enlarged or reduced in size</strong>. A lot of screen space remains unused around this window, both horizontally and vertically. <strong>It is not even possible to display all the columns in the overview. It is also not possible to influence the column widths</strong>, so that you cannot even see the passwords in full length! For passwords with more than 8 characters, only the first 8 are shown and then ... This contradicts common rules that passwords should be at least 12 to 15 characters long!  </p><p>It should also be possible to enlarge the window vertically. Since dialogs for entering data in tables are standard functions, the correction should be simple: you would only have to program  </p><pre>  - that the entire dialog window should also have resize handles and be enlargeable and, if necessary, also have a horizontal scroll bar if not all columns can be displayed,   - that the column widths can be changed by the user and in which of them changes are permitted. </pre> <p>A second error in connection with these settings: In my case, the password for accessing my mailbox at t-online was already set correctly. When I reset it, I was able to check the box in the other dialog that asked for the provider's password in order to save it in the password manager. Of course I had set it. Nevertheless, after later starts of Thunderbird the question for this password came up again and in the dialog for this question the correct password was also displayed (as far as I could check it because of the column width). <strong>How can I work around this error?</strong> Until it is finally fixed!) </p> <h3 id=""w_german-version"">German version...</h3> <p>Dieser Fehler betrifft Thunderbird 115.13.0 (64-bit) unter Xubuntu 22.04: </p><p>Im Dialog, mit dem man nach der Anleitung von <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/passworter-thunderbird-speichern-andern-loschen</a> das Pa√üwort f√ºr den Zugriff auf ein Postfach ansehen, eingeben oder √§ndern kann, ist ein kleiner Fehler: <strong>Das Dialogfenster kann man nicht vergr√∂√üern oder verkleinern</strong>.

Als ich es neu gesetzt hatte, konnte ich dabei in dem anderen Dialog, der nach dem Pa√üwort des Providers fragte, einen Haken setzen kann, um es im Pa√üwortmanager zu speichern. Den hatte ich nat√ºrlich gesetzt. Trotzdem kam nach sp√§teren Starts von Thunderbird wieder die Frage nach diesem Pa√üwort und im Dialog zu dieser Frage war auch das richtige Pa√üwort angezeigt (so weit ich es wegen der Spaltenbreite pr√ºfen konnte). <strong>Wie kann man denn diesen Fehler umgehen? </strong>Bis er endlich behoben ist!) </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1671220;1671261;1671267;,perpetuum-mobile
