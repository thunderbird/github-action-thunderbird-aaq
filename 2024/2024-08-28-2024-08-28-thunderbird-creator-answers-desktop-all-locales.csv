Here an English translation: </p><p>This bug affects Thunderbird 115.13.0 (64-bit) under Xubuntu 22.04: </p><p>In the dialog that allows you to view, enter or change the password for accessing a mailbox according to the instructions at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/passworter-thunderbird-speichern-andern-loschen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/passworter-thunderbird-speichern-and...</a>, there is a small bug: <strong>the dialog window cannot be enlarged or reduced in size</strong>. A lot of screen space remains unused around this window, both horizontally and vertically. <strong>It is not even possible to display all the columns in the overview. It is also not possible to influence the column widths</strong>, so that you cannot even see the passwords in full length! For passwords with more than 8 characters, only the first 8 are shown and then ... This contradicts common rules that passwords should be at least 12 to 15 characters long!  </p><p>It should also be possible to enlarge the window vertically. Since dialogs for entering data in tables are standard functions, the correction should be simple: you would only have to program  </p><pre>  - that the entire dialog window should also have resize handles and be enlargeable and, if necessary, also have a horizontal scroll bar if not all columns can be displayed,   - that the column widths can be changed by the user and in which of them changes are permitted. </pre> <p>A second error in connection with these settings: In my case, the password for accessing my mailbox at t-online was already set correctly. When I reset it, I was able to check the box in the other dialog that asked for the provider's password in order to save it in the password manager. Of course I had set it. Nevertheless, after later starts of Thunderbird the question for this password came up again and in the dialog for this question the correct password was also displayed (as far as I could check it because of the column width). <strong>How can I work around this error?</strong> Until it is finally fixed!) </p> <h3 id=""w_german-version"">German version...</h3> <p>Dieser Fehler betrifft Thunderbird 115.13.0 (64-bit) unter Xubuntu 22.04: </p><p>Im Dialog, mit dem man nach der Anleitung von <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/passworter-thunderbird-speichern-andern-loschen</a> das Paßwort für den Zugriff auf ein Postfach ansehen, eingeben oder ändern kann, ist ein kleiner Fehler: <strong>Das Dialogfenster kann man nicht vergrößern oder verkleinern</strong>. Um dieses Fenster bleibt unsinnig viel Bildschirmfläche ungenutzt, sowohl in horizontaler, als auch in vertikaler Richtung. Man kann <strong>noch nicht einmal alle Spalten</strong> der Übersicht <strong>anzeigen</strong>. Man kann auch <strong>die Spaltenbreiten nicht beeinflussen</strong>, so daß man die Paßwörter da <strong>noch nicht einmal in voller Länge sehen</strong> kann! Es werden bei Paßwörtern mit über 8 Zeichen nur die ersten 8 davon gezeigt und danach ... Das widerspricht gängigen Regeln, daß Paßwörter z.B. mindestens 12 bis 15 Zeichen lang sein sollen! </p><p>Auch in vertikaler Richtung sollte man das Fenster vergrößern können. Da Dialoge zur Eingabe von Daten in Tabellen Standardfunktionen sind, dürfte die Korrektur einfach sein: man müßte nur programmieren </p> <ul><li> daß das ganze Dialogfenster auch Größenänderungs-Handles bekommen soll und vergrößerbarbar wird und dabei erforderlichenfalls auch einen horizontalen Scrollbalken bekommt, wenn nicht alle Spalten dargestellt werden können, </li></ul> <ul><li> daß die Spaltenbreiten vom Benutzer änderbar werden und in welchen davon Änderungen zulässig sind. </li></ul> <p>Ein zweiter Fehler im Zusammenhang mit diesen Einstellungen: Bei mir war das Paßwort für den Zugang auf mein Postfach bei t-online schon richtig gesetzt. Als ich es neu gesetzt hatte, konnte ich dabei in dem anderen Dialog, der nach dem Paßwort des Providers fragte, einen Haken setzen kann, um es im Paßwortmanager zu speichern. Den hatte ich natürlich gesetzt. Trotzdem kam nach späteren Starts von Thunderbird wieder die Frage nach diesem Paßwort und im Dialog zu dieser Frage war auch das richtige Paßwort angezeigt (so weit ich es wegen der Spaltenbreite prüfen konnte). <strong>Wie kann man denn diesen Fehler umgehen? </strong>Bis er endlich behoben ist!) </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1671220;1671261;1671267;,perpetuum-mobile

Using about:config and adding a couple of lines of codes to userchrome css and usercontent css I managed to remove the calendarbutton, the tasks button aswell as the chat button from the spaces toolbar on the left. I really want to to the same with the hide toolbar for tabs menu button furthest down on the page, how do I do that? Another thing I really also would like to do is stop the contacts button from opening a new page, instead I think it should just switch from the email page to the contact one, not open a new. Is there any way of doing this?  </p><p>Really gratefull if I can get some help with this!  Thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",erik.g.arnesson

I have been trying to recover using saved profiles, but none of them are helping.  A few show new profiles created after my reload that do not contain the old data.  A few are profiles from 2019 that only contain data up to that year and have out of date folder construction.  I need a profile that covers my emails and folders just prior to my reload but I don't know how to find it. </p><p>I notice that Firefox lists a slew of profiles up to the current date, but I don't think these are usable for recovering Thunderbird.

I tested all of these with the usual fixes.  The app has full access to the folder containing the file. The app is set as administrator and is inside the firewall. I have set default mail app to TB.  TB is set to check as default on startup. Yet windows keeps saying we need to define a default email client. One customer solved the problem by buying a new PC.  I have another customer who has this problem on a new PC. There may be a common denominator in Microsoft Office which on loaded onto the PC's.  If that is the problem then that is Microsoft denying access to TB? Has anyone had this problem and can suggest a fix I would be grateful. </p><p>Steve Hall </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",steve199
