I found this info:  'Starting from June 2024, Gmail automatically enables IMAP access, so there's no need for you to activate it manually'.  I was away just before the end of June and all was working fine with my Thunderbird accounts (accessing my emails using my iPad). Came back at the start of July and then I was getting the download errors on my desktop.  I have most of my Gmail accounts set up for POP for all mail with IMAP disabled. However, I have one account with IMAP enabled and it works. So, clutching straws, I changed one of the accounts that is not working with IMAP enabled. But, unfortunately that still did not work.

One of those <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furphy"" rel=""nofollow"">Furphys</a>. </p><p>If you go into the server settings for your account you can see the local folder that forms the base of the account at the bottom of the pane. (On some displays you may have to scroll to see it).  So there is never a reason to guess where Thunderbird is storing email for an account.  BTW I do not recommend changing this even though it can be changed.  Bad things have been known to happen when you get a new device and forget part of the profile is somewhere odd when you move it. </p><p>When email is downloaded using POP mail left on the server is added to the popstate.dat file so there is a local record of where things are upto.  As you set your account to remove mail on download there would be no harm in simply deleting this file (with Thunderbird closed) as the file is not preventing the download of thousands of emails left on the server (got to love modern email packrats).  Removing the file would eliminate the possibility that the file may be corrupt and causing some sort of abort on the download. </p><p>I suggest that but recommend you actually check what google are doing with your mail in their account settings first.  You may be surprised there.   Check here <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop</a> </p><p>Next is perhaps the messiest part of this.  David has mentioned antivirus and potentially disabling email checking,  but in some instances it is more insidious and the AV continues to ""scan"" what it calls ""encrypted connections""  including mail even though the specific mail scanning is disabled.  This is in my opinion hacking, a legitimized man-in-the-middle hack.  It is also why the antivirus companies undertake their scanning using self signed certificates that are not recognized by Thunderbird as they do not form a part of the chain of trust that underlies the connection encryption process. This can result in a complete failure of connectivity if the certificates are not added manually to Thunderbird certificate store.  Unfortunately there appears to be difficulties at times getting certificate errors to actually bubble up far enough to raise a user error, so at times the only place you will see an error is in the well hidden error console (Ctrl+Shift+J)  Perhaps open the console,  press the trash icon on it's toolbar and then try and get your mail and we can see what pops up there. Note a right click in the console offers a copy menu where you can copy the contents of the console and paste it somewhere.  I do not however recommend this forum, as it will mangle the unformatted text.  Try the Mozilla pastebin and set the expiry to 21 days so folk might get a chance to view it before it disappears. <a href=""https://pastebin.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.mozilla.org/</a>.  I am not a developer and neither is David,  but between us we might get something useful out of it. </p><p>If that fails,  we are basically left with logging.  It also uses the error console,  but I really don't like how verbose it is.  A lot ofreading for little information so I will leave that until this part fails. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The reason being is to do with my backup strategy. All the folder &amp; files that I wish to backup are in a specific location. Makes it easer to backup as I just select the top level folder to copy from. But, to make sure, I did check all the accounts to make sure that they were pointing to the correct location. </p><p>Again I checked the popstate.dat for all the gmail accounts, including the ones giving the problem, and they are all empty apart from a couple of comments and a reference to the pop server and email address to which they are associated with.  </p><p>However, before deleting any of them I had a brainwave. I noticed the email messages that were being downloaded each time I opened Thunderbird, or when Thunderbird automatically performed a download every 10 minutes, had a similar date. That being between the last few days of June and the start of July. This was the case in the 3 accounts that had a problem but not the others. </p><p>So I stopped the downloads by changing the POP setting in Gmail. All my POP accounts had a setting of 'Enable POP for all mail (even mail that's already been downloaded)' to 'Enable POP for mail that arrives from now on'. Although I had always used the first option when using Thunderbird with these accounts and, previously, when I used Eudora (which is going back years). </p><p>Success, all my accounts now work. I suspect there was a corruption of some sort associated with those specific emails. Not only do they not download I no longer get the message 'Connection to server <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> was reset'. I am still a bit sceptical about Google saying there was to be a change in June.  </p><p>Google states:  In June 2024, the option to choose 'Enable IMAP' or 'Disable IMAP' won't be available. IMAP access is always turned on in Gmail and your current connections to other email clients aren't affected. You don't need to take any action. </p><p>But, there again, if I am the only one with this issue it probably was something else that caused the problem. </p><p>Anyway have successfully sent emails to all my accounts. Need to do a few more tests but will have to keep an eye on it. Hopefully that's it until the next problem. </p><p>Thank you and David for all your help.  </p><p>Trevor </p>",TheArtist,false,0,0

A couple of points.  I do have my Thunderbird account folder in a different place. The reason being is to do with my backup strategy. All the folder &amp; files that I wish to backup are in a specific location.  </blockquote> <p>As long as that location is not one of those windows suggests for picture or documents this is not usually an issue,  but anything in the documents folder get a pounding from antivirus and other tools that generally compromise data integrity. </p> <blockquote> Again I checked the popstate.dat for all the gmail accounts, including the ones giving the problem, and they are all empty apart from a couple of comments and a reference to the pop server and email address to which they are associated with.   However, before deleting any of them I had a brainwave. I noticed the email messages that were being downloaded each time I opened Thunderbird, or when Thunderbird automatically performed a download every 10 minutes, had a similar date. That being between the last few days of June and the start of July. This was the case in the 3 accounts that had a problem but not the others.  So I stopped the downloads by changing the POP setting in Gmail. All my POP accounts had a setting of 'Enable POP for all mail (even mail that's already been downloaded)' to 'Enable POP for mail that arrives from now on'. Although I had always used the first option when using Thunderbird with these accounts and, previously, when I used Eudora (which is going back years).  </blockquote> <p>If it is a POP account and involves all mail arriving after a certain date that is being duplicated this is almost always a failure with the antivirus email scanner.  It sees a malformed email in the queue and crashes in the background.  The downloads do not complete, they time out and the cycle repeats ad nauseam until you set the fetch of mail for the period not including the malformed mail, which I think is what you have done.  You delete the problem mail on the server (it is usually shown in the spam folder there) or disable email scanning until the malformed mail is downloaded.  My observation is this almost always involves Norton antivirus products.  But it might just be the luck of the draw that I have only seen those. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Network is not as fast as a local save. Especially with the latest crop of antivirus products helping things to a snail pace. </p><p>Yes, I am cynical about imap and antivirus.  But after 10 or 15 year of listening to folk complain about things not working,  being slow, or as in your case, incomplete and finding after a time that the antivirus was the issue does tend o breed that attitude without real investigation. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
