You may also have multiple copies of prefs.js in the profile. check that also. I have no guaranteed fix, but these steps usually work:  - exit thunderbird,  - to avoid loss of data due to any missteps, I suggest copying your profile, presumably at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to somewhere else  - in profile, locate the prefs.js with highest number and rename it to be prefs.js (after deleting the original prefs.js and all other copies)  - in the POP accounts, review sizes and dates of the message files in <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>-1 and others to verify that the highest numbered one has the current data. Then, delete all but the highest numbered one and rename it to <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> - open prefs.js and scan to ensure that references to <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> are correct.  - now restart thunderbird.  - check your antivirus to see if there is a setting to bypass email checking. That may not be the cause, but something interrupts thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The pattern you showed is not uncommon for one account with problems, but does NOT apply to you. My regrets on that.  So, you have eight accounts and all eight are downloading twice? check your popstate.dat files for each account. That is the file that keeps track of the most recently downloaded messages. Do the downloads happen concurrently? And if you delete one, the duplicate remains? Puzzling. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My revised understanding is that a given unread email on the server will go to whichever email client next goes to that server. So the protections are (1) do not open secondary email POP3 clients being tested without this awareness, and/or (2) have settings declining any automatic downloading on secondary email clients.
