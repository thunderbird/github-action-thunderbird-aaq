I found this info:  'Starting from June 2024, Gmail automatically enables IMAP access, so there's no need for you to activate it manually'.  I was away just before the end of June and all was working fine with my Thunderbird accounts (accessing my emails using my iPad). Came back at the start of July and then I was getting the download errors on my desktop.  I have most of my Gmail accounts set up for POP for all mail with IMAP disabled. However, I have one account with IMAP enabled and it works. So, clutching straws, I changed one of the accounts that is not working with IMAP enabled. But, unfortunately that still did not work.  I'll plough on to see if I can find solution. </p>",gilbertmyemails,false,0,0

One of those <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furphy"" rel=""nofollow"">Furphys</a>. </p><p>If you go into the server settings for your account you can see the local folder that forms the base of the account at the bottom of the pane. (On some displays you may have to scroll to see it).  So there is never a reason to guess where Thunderbird is storing email for an account.  BTW I do not recommend changing this even though it can be changed.  Bad things have been known to happen when you get a new device and forget part of the profile is somewhere odd when you move it. </p><p>When email is downloaded using POP mail left on the server is added to the popstate.dat file so there is a local record of where things are upto.  As you set your account to remove mail on download there would be no harm in simply deleting this file (with Thunderbird closed) as the file is not preventing the download of thousands of emails left on the server (got to love modern email packrats).  Removing the file would eliminate the possibility that the file may be corrupt and causing some sort of abort on the download. </p><p>I suggest that but recommend you actually check what google are doing with your mail in their account settings first.  You may be surprised there.   Check here <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop</a> </p><p>Next is perhaps the messiest part of this.  David has mentioned antivirus and potentially disabling email checking,  but in some instances it is more insidious and the AV continues to ""scan"" what it calls ""encrypted connections""  including mail even though the specific mail scanning is disabled.  This is in my opinion hacking, a legitimized man-in-the-middle hack.  It is also why the antivirus companies undertake their scanning using self signed certificates that are not recognized by Thunderbird as they do not form a part of the chain of trust that underlies the connection encryption process. This can result in a complete failure of connectivity if the certificates are not added manually to Thunderbird certificate store.  Unfortunately there appears to be difficulties at times getting certificate errors to actually bubble up far enough to raise a user error, so at times the only place you will see an error is in the well hidden error console (Ctrl+Shift+J)  Perhaps open the console,  press the trash icon on it's toolbar and then try and get your mail and we can see what pops up there. Note a right click in the console offers a copy menu where you can copy the contents of the console and paste it somewhere.  I do not however recommend this forum, as it will mangle the unformatted text.  Try the Mozilla pastebin and set the expiry to 21 days so folk might get a chance to view it before it disappears. <a href=""https://pastebin.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.mozilla.org/</a>.  I am not a developer and neither is David,  but between us we might get something useful out of it. </p><p>If that fails,  we are basically left with logging.  It also uses the error console,  but I really don't like how verbose it is.  A lot ofreading for little information so I will leave that until this part fails. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If it's the former, and you don't need to access drafts from other devices, saving them in Drafts on Local Folders is probably a more reliable option.
