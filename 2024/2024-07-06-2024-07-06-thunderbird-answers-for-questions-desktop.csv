I was away just before the end of June and all was working fine with my Thunderbird accounts (accessing my emails using my iPad). Came back at the start of July and then I was getting the download errors on my desktop.  I have most of my Gmail accounts set up for POP for all mail with IMAP disabled. However, I have one account with IMAP enabled and it works. So, clutching straws, I changed one of the accounts that is not working with IMAP enabled. But, unfortunately that still did not work.
