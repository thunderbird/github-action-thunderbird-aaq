No. </p><p>You can set the defaults for new folders, which leaves me wondering if you delete the MSF file which stores that information in each folder. If when the program automatically replaces the file if the changed default will be used.

You may also have multiple copies of prefs.js in the profile. check that also. I have no guaranteed fix, but these steps usually work:  - exit thunderbird,  - to avoid loss of data due to any missteps, I suggest copying your profile, presumably at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to somewhere else  - in profile, locate the prefs.js with highest number and rename it to be prefs.js (after deleting the original prefs.js and all other copies)  - in the POP accounts, review sizes and dates of the message files in <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>-1 and others to verify that the highest numbered one has the current data. Then, delete all but the highest numbered one and rename it to <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> - open prefs.js and scan to ensure that references to <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> are correct.  - now restart thunderbird.  - check your antivirus to see if there is a setting to bypass email checking. That may not be the cause, but something interrupts thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
