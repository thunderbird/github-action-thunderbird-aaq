No. </p><p>You can set the defaults for new folders, which leaves me wondering if you delete the MSF file which stores that information in each folder.

By changing server name, you lost access to the messages. Again, if this is an IMAP account, and if the old servers are still accessible, you could change back to the old server names. If that doesn't work, I suggest contacting Godaddy for assistance in recovery, since they are the ones who initiated this. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You may also have multiple copies of prefs.js in the profile. check that also. I have no guaranteed fix, but these steps usually work:  - exit thunderbird,  - to avoid loss of data due to any missteps, I suggest copying your profile, presumably at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to somewhere else  - in profile, locate the prefs.js with highest number and rename it to be prefs.js (after deleting the original prefs.js and all other copies)  - in the POP accounts, review sizes and dates of the message files in <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>-1 and others to verify that the highest numbered one has the current data. Then, delete all but the highest numbered one and rename it to <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> - open prefs.js and scan to ensure that references to <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> are correct.  - now restart thunderbird.  - check your antivirus to see if there is a setting to bypass email checking. That may not be the cause, but something interrupts thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The pattern you showed is not uncommon for one account with problems, but does NOT apply to you. My regrets on that.  So, you have eight accounts and all eight are downloading twice? check your popstate.dat files for each account. That is the file that keeps track of the most recently downloaded messages. Do the downloads happen concurrently? And if you delete one, the duplicate remains? Puzzling. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It is puzzling. </p><p>Currently it only appears to be a problem with 3 of the accounts (all gmail). I also receive the msg 'Connection to server <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> was reset' 3 times so I assume those messages are for those 3 accounts. </p><p>I checked the popstate.dat for all the gmail accounts, including the ones giving the problem, and they are all empty apart from a couple of comments and a reference to the pop server and email address to which they are associated with. </p><p>The two emails that you have sent go to a gmail account to which I have no problems, i.e. your emails are only received once and not received again each time I start Thunderbird. </p><p>I checked my iPad and there is not a similar problem with emails. However, that uses the mail app so not really much of a test. </p><p>Also accessing a problem gmail account via a Window's browser shows the Inbox as empty so the emails are being downloaded (and deleted) OK. </p>",gilbertmyemails,false,0,0
