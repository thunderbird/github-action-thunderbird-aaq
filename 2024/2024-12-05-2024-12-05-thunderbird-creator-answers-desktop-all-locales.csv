At some point, I began to get pop-ups asking for my logon credentials. Although they were annoying, I put up with them for a time. I thought a password problem might be causing it, so I changed the password and made sure it was the same both on the server and in Thunderbird. Eventually, this situation became more than a nuisance and (after saving the messages off-line) I deleted the email account from both Thunderbird and the server. This did not work and I still gat the pop-up messages! I have consulted with the web hosting support staff and they assure me that the account is no longer on the server. Obviously, there is some vestige of the deleted account in Thunderbird someplace and it is causing the program to attempt to sign in to the server to access the no longer existing account. This, in turn, causes the server to request the credentials for the deleted account, resulting in the pop-up messages. How do I get rid of this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rswenson

Cox moved our servers to Yahoo.  Since then filter rules are set in Thunderbird, but they don't work on her computer.  I have tried setting filter rules to work before or after determining as junk and deleting those listed in filter rules.  I would prefer to see all junk deleted at the server level before reaching her computer, but that's not an option like it was with Cox Email.  This works OK in my POP account, but on her IMAP account it creates a second JUNK subfolder under TRASH and lists all the spam that agrees with my filter rules.  Nothing gets deleted.  The filter rules have been changed to filter the JUNK folder instead of the INBOX and delete those files, but that doesn't happen!  I have to move all the spam in the JUNK subfolder to the regular JUNK folder, then run each set of filter rules individually to move into trash.  I can then delete the JUNK subfolder but it is automatically recreated. </p><p>I know we must use EITHER Filter Rules or Spam Assassin, but not both.  I want to get rid of Spam Assassin because it looks like it's creating the problem, but I see no way to do that.  Unchecking Spam Assassin in filter rules does nothing.
