Lovely product. 3 days ago I had to reinstall a station but when Thunderbird does its updating after reconnecting to gmail address for the 10GB of emails, it behaves damn irregular:  - periodic freezes of mouse and keyboard, for about 0.3 seconds every 3 to 5 seconds.  - Thunderbird message says downloading email number out of total number of emails (very slowly advancing) but every 3 seconds it starts downloading email 1 of those emails  - station has cumulated some 20 hours working, most of these left to finish syncronizing. Usually in 2 - 3 hours there is time enough. </p><p>This happens only when Thunderbird runs, when I close it the station runs fine. Same hardware on the station as before.. </p><p>Did you encounter this? Thanks. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",bordmail4
