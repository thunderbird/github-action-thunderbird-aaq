I encourage trying again and post back with any difficulties.  </p><p>This is the official (to my knowledge) documentation. Well worth the read <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird</a>   </p><p>Here is my own documentation on threading, duplicating the above, but it may help: You need to highlight each folder and click View&gt;sort by&gt;unthreaded. If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p> <pre>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0 =unthreaded    Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.    ------------ 	 To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: This must be done on an account by account basis. - select table view  - the icon just to right of 'quick filter' button above message list pane - select a message folder and apply all desired attributes - View&gt;sort by from menu bar (if not shown, click alt key) - click the icon at right side of column display in message list pane - select the entry near bottom 'Apply current view to...' - highlight 'folder and children' - move mouse left to see account name and move left again to display all account folders. Now CLICK. - a small menu will appear to confirm setting all folders within that account.  I did a simple (okay, crude) video at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts	  - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,2,0

Changing the sort order is a fairly simple thing using that menu.  <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-07-21-21-18-32-08800c.png""> </p><p>Bulk changing of sort order is not supported.   but as that information is stored in the MSF files for each folder you can delete those files and when the folder is accessed they will be recreated.  Columns are also stored in the same folder so custom column settings and widths will also be lost.  Essentially a reset to the default which you have not changed. </p><p>So if you go the delete MSF files route,  make a backup first.  You might not like the result any better than what you have. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Thunderbird does not delete it because all pop accounts are designed to stored emails locally and those emails maybe the only copy. It also means if the account data is still available, it's easy to recreate a new pop account and point to it in the 'Local directory:' settings to use the old account thus meaning all data can be recovered. </p><p>The 'Trash' file is an mbox file which is a form of text file. The 'Trash.msf' file is an index file used by thunderbird to display the actual list in Message List. When you select to read an email, info in index file is used to locate the email stored in the mbox file. The 'Trash.sbd' folder means you had subfolders in the Trash. This can occur if delete a folder. </p><p>You can delete all three of these providing you do not want to recover anything. Please remember, Thunderbird must not be running if you want to delete those files and folder. Upon a restart of Thunderbird, if that pop account is being used, the Trash mbox file and index file should get auto recreated.  </p><p>However.... if you do not want to delete the file then you could open and edit it - basically delete all it's contents then save the file. If you do this you just need to delete the Trash.sbd folder and the Trash.msf file. Any mbox file can  be opened using a simple text editor such as Notepad. If the mbox file has got large then you may need Notepad++ Please note very large mbox files may need to use a program which handle it such as UltraEdit </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Whatever is in server Inbox will be displayed in imap account Inbox. Your copy in that location on your computer should never be considered as a truelly independent copy. That's why if you have only imap accounts, you don't need to copy anything, you can simply recreate a new imap account.

I reckon it is the AppData/Roaming location that I need to find to put the msgFilters in.  </p><p>I have a network drive (L: drive) online via a company called LiveDrive. My Thunderbird profile with local folders sit on that L: drive. To copy to the new computer, I simply install LiveDrive on the new computer. All the files come up relatively quickly with .ld extensions. I then tell the LiveDrive App to store them from the cloud onto the new computer. I then wait the 5 days or so for for the .ld extensions to be removed leaving the .sbd, .msf and .mozmsgs extensions. </p><p>The AppData/Roaming location makes perfect sense to me. I have not checked there yet on either machine. If I remove the msgFilters.dat files from my L: drive, the message filters remained in Thunderbird Supernova on the old computer - so that must be the ""working directory"" that it uses! Also, I created a couple of imap filters on the new machine but I could not see where Thunderbird Nebula put them. I guess I will find them there too&nbsp;:) </p><p>I will look in the AppData/Roaming area and, hopefully, sort things out in Nebula to clear my inbox and let you know how I get on.

I rebuild mine often, usually because it can find the item ,  but can not open the email because it has lost the location relative to the indexed data. </p><p>But let me make this clear.  I have exactly zero knowledge about Apple anything.  I played with this little back and white thing in my kids kindergarten some 35years ago it had an 8 inch screen I think.  It was however very good at reformatting any DOS disk I gave it instead of offering a suggestion that it could not read the data on it.  I decided then and there it was an expensive toy and have yet to find anything from Apple that contained software that was compelling enough to pay the Apple tax on the expensive but no more reliable hardware.  So I am exclusively a Linux/Unix/Dos/ Windows guy who uses Google to try and answer the questions apple users pose.  Usually rather successfully for some reason.

If I recall correctly the tokenizer ignores words of less than three letters,  and most numbers.  A search of my mail using the same search engine you are using gave me this link <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=523183#c5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=523183#c5</a>  So yes,  searching for collections of two letter words will fail as there has to be three letters for it to be indexed. </p><p>My understanding,  which is not complete, is that the Ctrl+F search uses a full text search in the folder content at the time of searching.  Global search Ctrl+K) uses the gloda index and has different rules in that not everything is indexed,  burt it searches all folders that are indexed. </p><p>Quoted text is not indexed.  So if there is three emails in the conversion and all three quote the fist email will be indexed,  subsequent emails quoting the original will only have new content indexed. </p><p>Perhaps have a look at some of the open bugs mentioned here <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=541349"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=541349</a>  it is a fairly complete index of known rubbish results for various reasons. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

CTRL-K, vb to xf returns nothing, so I took some other words from that same email ""We only provide import services for Cloud plans"". I pasted that into search, both with and without double quotes, and it found it every time. HOORAY!  </p><p>So from now on, after ensuring every folder is 'included in global searches' as per your earlier comments, and now knowing the search string can be longer rather than shorter (i assumed, wrongly, that would make it 'harder' for TB to find), I think I may just have a working solution to find emails when necessary. MAYBE, anyway. I am not sure yet, as I still think it doesn't search all fields (from, to, subject, and body), but I could be wrong there (if you can confirm if you know the answer, please say). </p><p>I am therefore much better equipped than I was at the start, so I thank you for that. </p>",mozilla516,false,1,0
