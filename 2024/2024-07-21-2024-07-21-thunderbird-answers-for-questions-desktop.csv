I encourage trying again and post back with any difficulties.  </p><p>This is the official (to my knowledge) documentation. Well worth the read <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird</a>   </p><p>Here is my own documentation on threading, duplicating the above, but it may help: You need to highlight each folder and click View&gt;sort by&gt;unthreaded. If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p> <pre>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0 =unthreaded    Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.    ------------ 	 To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: This must be done on an account by account basis. - select table view  - the icon just to right of 'quick filter' button above message list pane - select a message folder and apply all desired attributes - View&gt;sort by from menu bar (if not shown, click alt key) - click the icon at right side of column display in message list pane - select the entry near bottom 'Apply current view to...' - highlight 'folder and children' - move mouse left to see account name and move left again to display all account folders. Now CLICK. - a small menu will appear to confirm setting all folders within that account.  I did a simple (okay, crude) video at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts	  - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thunderbird does not delete it because all pop accounts are designed to stored emails locally and those emails maybe the only copy. It also means if the account data is still available, it's easy to recreate a new pop account and point to it in the 'Local directory:' settings to use the old account thus meaning all data can be recovered. </p><p>The 'Trash' file is an mbox file which is a form of text file. The 'Trash.msf' file is an index file used by thunderbird to display the actual list in Message List. When you select to read an email, info in index file is used to locate the email stored in the mbox file. The 'Trash.sbd' folder means you had subfolders in the Trash. This can occur if delete a folder. </p><p>You can delete all three of these providing you do not want to recover anything. Please remember, Thunderbird must not be running if you want to delete those files and folder. Upon a restart of Thunderbird, if that pop account is being used, the Trash mbox file and index file should get auto recreated.  </p><p>However.... if you do not want to delete the file then you could open and edit it - basically delete all it's contents then save the file. If you do this you just need to delete the Trash.sbd folder and the Trash.msf file. Any mbox file can  be opened using a simple text editor such as Notepad. If the mbox file has got large then you may need Notepad++ Please note very large mbox files may need to use a program which handle it such as UltraEdit </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Strangely, if I switch the old system off, then <em>remove </em> all the msgFilterRules.dat files from the old system (I have backed them up), then switch it back on, I still see the imap filters on the old system! The Local Folder filters have gone, but imap filters remain - so the imap filters must be stored somewhere else. </p><p>The folder properties of my inbox say that my inbox is located at: <strong>imap://gmail*/INBOX</strong> whereas my ImapMail area talks about <a href=""http://imap.googlemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.googlemail.com</a>. </p><p>Thanks </p>",dave.dews,false,0,0

You're saying the filters don't appear when you copy to the new profile? Puzzling to me, but I've never seen filters not copied. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
