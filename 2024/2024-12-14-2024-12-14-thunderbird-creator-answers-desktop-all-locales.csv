It is true that of the 20 or so subfolders of ""Local Folders"", there is one subfolder named ""Misc"".  Messages in ""Misc"" and its subfolders that meet the 1/1/2024 test criterion are found and listed, but other subfolders of ""Local Folders"" are ignored.  Instead, the search engine remains hung in a ""....Searching"" state until I manually close the search. </p><p>But also ... if I choose to explicitly name any one of the subfolders of  ""Local Folders"" as the root folder of a search (and ""include all subfolders"" contained in that root, the test case above finds all messages in the named subfolder and it's subordinate subfolders. </p><p>Bottom line ...
