This makes it easier to see what I am typing.  When I have sent a new email with the slightly larger font, replies from the recipient maintain that slightly larger font in my portion of the thread, which is helpful as well, but usually not in the reply.  I assume that the recipient also sees the slightly larger font size.  All this seems acceptable to me and I assume to the recipient.  You asked if incoming messages are too small.  They usually come in at the slightly smaller font size (Medium) that I started with.  It would also be nice to view these incoming messages in the slightly larger font size.  Given the size that my (older) eyes need, I would like incoming messages to also appear slightly larger (Large).  I hope this all makes sense!  Thanks again.  Look forward to your response!

The other settings ensure that you see your desired font whether sending or receiving, whether HTML messages or plain text. Follow the steps in detail about the Latin and Other writing systems and this has always been a 100% success. If you have difficulties. please let me know.

Your complaint is posted daily here, multiple times, and has been happening since 102 was rolled out in 2022. There is a 'fix' for the dreaded threading feature. Let me know if interested. It's messy, but it works. Want to avoid all future updates? Let me know, as it's doable. Another possibility is to download ver 91. It works smoothly and the profile is compatible, once you delete the compatibility.ini file. It is possible to set up 91 with updates disabled. I have a copy working now and most addons for it are still available. HOWEVER, you are dissatisfied, adding your voice at <a href=""http://connect.microsoft.org"" rel=""nofollow"">connect.microsoft.org</a> may help. Click to IDEAS and voice your displeasure there. Let me know. But please, we're just workerbees here.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I am an octogenarian tech dinosaur who has used and appreciated Thunderbird for years because a) I was already using Firefox for privacy reasons, b)Thunderbird enabled me to handle web-based e-mail accounts in one place on my desktop, and c) I found it so easy to use.  I'm not about to start pretending I'm tech-savvy and poking into the innards of the application.  I tried the changes I could find under ""View"", but they didn't help (I don't know what ""Card View"" is or where to find it).  I thought that I could revert to a previous version which might not have this problem (I have done this with other apps), and I did find a listing of previous versions, but apparently you have to be tech-savvy to figure out how to install them.  I don't know why, if I put the cursor on the line between the message list and the current message itself, it shows the symbol that says you can move the line, but the line doesn't move.  I applaud a comment I saw somewhere else on a Thunderbird community page, that new releases shouldn't go out for general use by the non-technical user community until the bugs have been found and worked out (if this were specified as a beta I probably wouldn't have downloaded it).   I realize this is a minor problem, but it irritates me again every time I open Thunderbird.  I have always felt I should update major applications regularly for security reasons, but after this I'm not updating Thunderbird any more. </p>",msegall,false,0,0
