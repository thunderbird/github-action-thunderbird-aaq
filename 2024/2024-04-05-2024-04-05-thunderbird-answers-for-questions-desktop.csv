On your questions, Thunderbird did not prompt you for a password on prior PC because it stores the password for you. You (or someone for you) set that password back in 2019. Spectrum uses <a href=""http://mobile.charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mobile.charter.net</a> as one of its email servers, so your use of it is not unexpected. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The moment you clearly no longer receive emails in your inbox due to this, you are guilty of the term ""Bounce"", which means that you have used email software where spam-like activities have been found.

I mention this because sometimes users report a large size when, in fact, it is multiple temporary files from failed compactions. Normally, compacting the file works.  If you exit TB and delete the inbox &amp; inbox.msf, thunderbird will repopulate it on restart. No need to recreate the account. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Jistým řešením je vytvoření .bat souboru, který manuálně spustí službu zařazování tisku. Tzn. v poznámkovém bloku napsat následující: </p><p>net stop spooler net start spooler net stop spooler del C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS\*.shd del C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS\*.spl net start spooler </p><p>Toto uložit např. na plochu s názvem souboru *.bat   a po té, co Thundrbird vypne službu zařazování, spustit tento .bat soubor jako správce, čímž dojde k obnově služby zařazování tisku a je možno normálně tisknout ze všech aplikací. Hrozné řešení, ale zatím to nejlepší, které jsem našel. A funguje. </p>",j.wyderka,false,0,0
