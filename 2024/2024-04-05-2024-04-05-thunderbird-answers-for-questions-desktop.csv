I mention this because sometimes users report a large size when, in fact, it is multiple temporary files from failed compactions. Normally, compacting the file works.  If you exit TB and delete the inbox &amp; inbox.msf, thunderbird will repopulate it on restart. No need to recreate the account. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Your replies are also in large font when replying in HTML. You may need to change settings to always send HTML, regardless of style changes. When you receive messages, are they of acceptable size? That is, my real question is whether you want recipients to see messages in a large font, or is it just for yourself to see messages in large font?

Your complaint is posted daily here, multiple times, and has been happening since 102 was rolled out in 2022. There is a 'fix' for the dreaded threading feature. Let me know if interested. It's messy, but it works. Want to avoid all future updates? Let me know, as it's doable. Another possibility is to download ver 91. It works smoothly and the profile is compatible, once you delete the compatibility.ini file. It is possible to set up 91 with updates disabled. I have a copy working now and most addons for it are still available.
