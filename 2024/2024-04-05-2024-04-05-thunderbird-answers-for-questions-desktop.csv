I mention this because sometimes users report a large size when, in fact, it is multiple temporary files from failed compactions. Normally, compacting the file works.  If you exit TB and delete the inbox &amp; inbox.msf, thunderbird will repopulate it on restart. No need to recreate the account. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Jistým řešením je vytvoření .bat souboru, který manuálně spustí službu zařazování tisku.
