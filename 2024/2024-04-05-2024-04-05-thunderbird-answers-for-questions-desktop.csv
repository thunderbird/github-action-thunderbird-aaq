There are 6 sizes to choose from when I look at the HTML settings - Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, and Huge .  I only want to go from Medium, which I believe is default, up one to large.  This makes it easier to see what I am typing.  When I have sent a new email with the slightly larger font, replies from the recipient maintain that slightly larger font in my portion of the thread, which is helpful as well, but usually not in the reply.  I assume that the recipient also sees the slightly larger font size.  All this seems acceptable to me and I assume to the recipient.  You asked if incoming messages are too small.  They usually come in at the slightly smaller font size (Medium) that I started with.  It would also be nice to view these incoming messages in the slightly larger font size.  Given the size that my (older) eyes need, I would like incoming messages to also appear slightly larger (Large).  I hope this all makes sense!  Thanks again.  Look forward to your response!

I thought that I could revert to a previous version which might not have this problem (I have done this with other apps), and I did find a listing of previous versions, but apparently you have to be tech-savvy to figure out how to install them.  I don't know why, if I put the cursor on the line between the message list and the current message itself, it shows the symbol that says you can move the line, but the line doesn't move.  I applaud a comment I saw somewhere else on a Thunderbird community page, that new releases shouldn't go out for general use by the non-technical user community until the bugs have been found and worked out (if this were specified as a beta I probably wouldn't have downloaded it).   I realize this is a minor problem, but it irritates me again every time I open Thunderbird.  I have always felt I should update major applications regularly for security reasons, but after this I'm not updating Thunderbird any more.
