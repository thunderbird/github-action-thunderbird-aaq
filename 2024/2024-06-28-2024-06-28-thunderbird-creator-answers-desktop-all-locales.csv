I have kept this old version, as an add-on that I like / need (Theme Font &amp; Size Changer) said it would not be upgraded for later versions of Thunderbird at the time (that I did not like the font size options available at the time). </p><p>I have just received an email claiming to be from Microsoft about changes to the way you will now need to get access to Hotmail and Outlook email accounts (Modern Authentication Methods now needed to continue syncing Outlook Email in non-Microsoft email apps). <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/modern-authentication-methods-now-needed-to-continue-syncing-outlook-email-in-non-microsoft-email-apps-c5d65390-9676-4763-b41f-d7986499a90d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/modern-authentication-methods-now-needed-to-continue-syncing-outlook-email-in-non-microsoft-email-apps-c5d65390-9676-4763-b41f-d7986499a90d</a> </p><p>To your knowledge, is this message legit and true? </p><p>Are the instructions correct for my older version of Thunderbird? If not can you provide correct instructions? </p><p>Alternatively, does the latest version of Thunderbird now support the font size changes that the add-on provided and Thunderbird did not provide at the time. If so, I can update to the latest version of Thunderbird. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Brian. </p><p>ps Do you do a Thunderbird version for Android? </p><p>pps this is what I need on the Theme &amp; Font Size Changer: (see file attached) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1659466;1659503;1659507;,dogdogonholiday

However, Thunderbird's email service is currently unavailable. Received emails are not displayed in the inbox. All previous history has also been erased. First of all, I would like your cooperation in fixing the current problem and restoring the system to its previous state. I will make a donation as soon as the system is restored. If the system cannot be restored without a donation, you can make a donation first. I look forward to your reply. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",mamefamily2
