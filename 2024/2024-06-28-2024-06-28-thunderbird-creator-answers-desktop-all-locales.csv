When I enter them, a second window appears, asking for the two factor autentication. However, this window seems to be corrupt, as it does not contain any information, and and it's impossible to type in verification code, as there's no input area at all (see the first picture - note that I'm using a localized version of Thunderbird). </p><p>When I click on Privacy and cookies in the right bottom corner, then two lines appear (although without any labels), where I can type in my verification code (I guess that it is the second line, because it shows dots in place of the typed characters, as for passwords). A screenshot of this window can be seen in the second picture.  </p><p>However, after typing the correct code and clicking on the grey button, the first window reappears, this time with my email address that keeps flashing forever and nothing happens. It does not even matter if I type in the right verification number or just anything, it produces the same behaviour. As a result, I can't log in to my mailbox, which is operational, because I can log in there through the web interface of outlook, and also from my laptop using Thunderbird 78.14.0.

It seems to happen only with older events rather than current ones. Clicking the X closes the reminder but it pops up later. I tried changing the event to turn off reminders but that didn't work. It doesn't accept the change. The only permanent solution is to delete the event from the calendar. I see this problem goes back many versions.

I stopped using the account, but kept it configured as it always had been with the old email saved in it. The emails are in several folders in Thunderbird, and I can see them listed when I select a folder, but the content of most of them is now invisible. For many years I upgraded Thunderbird and they remained visible, and I naively assumed that would always be the case. I think the visibility problem happened after a Thunderbird upgrade sometime within the last few years. Strangely, a few emails are readable. I think they're the last ones I viewed before I became unable to see additional ones I select to view. I believe all the data is still there, but I don't know how to read it. In the file system, here's what my Thunderbird profile Mail directory looks like: </p><p>/Users/myMacUser/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/my-random.default/Mail <a href=""http://account.server.name"" rel=""nofollow"">account.server.name</a> - TB Email Folder 1.sbd (empty directory) - TB Email Folder 1 (no file extension, apparently the file containing the email data. File sizes suggest they contain data) - TB Email Folder 1.msf (the index file, apparently readable) etc. </p><p>I'm using Thunderbird 115.12.2 on MacOS Sonoma 14.5. I tried several types of exports with the ImportExportTools NG extension, but it just exported zero byte or blank files for the invisible emails. </p><p>How do I read these folder data files? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1659627;,keith.petersen.12
