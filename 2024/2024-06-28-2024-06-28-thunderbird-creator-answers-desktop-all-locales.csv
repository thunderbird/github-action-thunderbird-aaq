However, Thunderbird's email service is currently unavailable. Received emails are not displayed in the inbox. All previous history has also been erased. First of all, I would like your cooperation in fixing the current problem and restoring the system to its previous state. I will make a donation as soon as the system is restored. If the system cannot be restored without a donation, you can make a donation first. I look forward to your reply. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",mamefamily2
