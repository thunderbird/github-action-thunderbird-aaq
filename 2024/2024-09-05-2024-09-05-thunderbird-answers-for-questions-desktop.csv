When accessing gmail online, that one folder does it all. What you 'see' as folders in Thunderbird, such as inbox, sent, trash, etc. are just subsets. To make it work logically, Thunderbird (and all other email clients) have to artificially make real folders to imitate what Gmail is doing. As such the overhead is doubled, cpu time, elapsed time, and storage space. Allmail has a copy of all mail, so it serves you in no way when using Thunderbird. The recommendation from Thunderbird is to unsubscribe and then to delete . </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Once I knew to click on the three dots, with a little trial and error, I figured out that turning on ""Total Message Count"", it would show the total messages.

That is they show the total # of UNREAD messages.   Only with the Spam folder, you must click on it to get the total # of unread messages to appear.
