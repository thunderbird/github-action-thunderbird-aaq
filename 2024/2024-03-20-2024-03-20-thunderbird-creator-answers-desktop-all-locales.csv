Your webpage is very complicated and I do not understand it.  I can't get to the last thing I did very easily.  Currently I have remember my device turned on so no passcode is sent when I log on.  I don't know how to turn it off.  I have been working about a week on this problem.  I think one message said you needed to input passcode when you are asked for password.  I also do not understand how to change the password when asked for new password. Also, I have not been giving donations to Thunderbird because they only appear to accept credit cards. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",jeraldasmith
