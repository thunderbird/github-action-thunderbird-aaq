Your webpage is very complicated and I do not understand it.  I can't get to the last thing I did very easily.  Currently I have remember my device turned on so no passcode is sent when I log on.  I don't know how to turn it off.  I have been working about a week on this problem.  I think one message said you needed to input passcode when you are asked for password.  I also do not understand how to change the password when asked for new password. Also, I have not been giving donations to Thunderbird because they only appear to accept credit cards. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1643204;,jeraldasmith

Az lenne jó, ha (válaszhatóan) egy mappában lennének a levelek, és rá lehetne szűrni a partner címére, és időrendbe lehetne szedni a leveleket.

Just in 2024 the log shows over 100 submitted crash reports. The  ""good news"" is that Thunderbird goes to the ""restart and/or quit""  option icon for a a fast restart.
