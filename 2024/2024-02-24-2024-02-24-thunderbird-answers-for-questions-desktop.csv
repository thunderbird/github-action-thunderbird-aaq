When I clicked on 'run now' all the read messages were deleted, including the email notification with your post. I'd forgotten that I'd originally intended to remove only the messages from before this year. Can you tell me how I can refine the filter for messages only before 2024?

That is, there is a folder named Thunderbird that contains a profiles.ini file and a profiles folder. You can verify that from your OS's file manager. If true,  these steps will work: - exit TB on old machine - copy the Thunderbird folder to external media - install TB on new machine and exit  - copy the saved Thunderbird folder over the top of installed default Thunderbird folder  - restart TB </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Is it really necessary to com to your support site to reply to mails receveived? Normally one can chose between several signatures, with the signatures switch: Thi switch has desappeard fom my thunderbird mail; it used to be on the right up corner (close to the ""attach""). On other thing is that the language correction which I could chose once a mail terminated by right clicking the mouse and chosing ""language"" The next thing is that the printing does not work correctly: parts of mail being left out. I guess, there should be a way to restore Thunderbird, reloading ist, without having to remanage everything aterwards. I don't know how this ever managed to happen at all!

On questions, I think you may have used an addon called 'signature switch', which is still available. You mention doing a right-click and selecting 'language', which causes me to also think that may have been an addon, and there are many addons for languages, so you may wish to review the available ones to see if one of them is what you used. For printing, it would help to post a screenshot of an example and provide any additional detail that you think may prove useful. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

For your Cox account, I suggest copying the message folders to local storage folder prior to cancelling the account. That ensures your messages are saved. If this is an IMAP account, I suggest first clicking file&gt;work offline&gt;download to be sure that all messages are local. Then, after verifying that the messages are there locally, you can remove your Cox account from TB. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If using windows, you can set up encryption, but that prevents Thunderbird from accessing until you unencrypt. You can set up encryption with Thunderbird for sending messages, but that requires participation at the recipient end.
