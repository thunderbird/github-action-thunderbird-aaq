That is, there is a folder named Thunderbird that contains a profiles.ini file and a profiles folder. You can verify that from your OS's file manager. If true,  these steps will work: - exit TB on old machine - copy the Thunderbird folder to external media - install TB on new machine and exit  - copy the saved Thunderbird folder over the top of installed default Thunderbird folder  - restart TB </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Is it really necessary to com to your support site to reply to mails receveived? Normally one can chose between several signatures, with the signatures switch: Thi switch has desappeard fom my thunderbird mail; it used to be on the right up corner (close to the ""attach""). On other thing is that the language correction which I could chose once a mail terminated by right clicking the mouse and chosing ""language"" The next thing is that the printing does not work correctly: parts of mail being left out. I guess, there should be a way to restore Thunderbird, reloading ist, without having to remanage everything aterwards. I don't know how this ever managed to happen at all! Thanks and kind regards ... and please, send mail I can reply to Jean-Pierre </p>",jpbiber,false,0,0

For your Cox account, I suggest copying the message folders to local storage folder prior to cancelling the account. That ensures your messages are saved. If this is an IMAP account, I suggest first clicking file&gt;work offline&gt;download to be sure that all messages are local. Then, after verifying that the messages are there locally, you can remove your Cox account from TB. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
