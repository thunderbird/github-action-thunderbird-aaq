That is, there is a folder named Thunderbird that contains a profiles.ini file and a profiles folder. You can verify that from your OS's file manager. If true,  these steps will work: - exit TB on old machine - copy the Thunderbird folder to external media - install TB on new machine and exit  - copy the saved Thunderbird folder over the top of installed default Thunderbird folder  - restart TB </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
