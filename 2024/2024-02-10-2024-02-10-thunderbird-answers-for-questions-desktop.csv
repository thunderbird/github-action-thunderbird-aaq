(?) ... whatever it was, I hope this means the rest of the issue is solved and I will be able to reinstall thunderbird and get my mail running, but I am nervous to try in case it screws it up again ... so if someone from Mozilla and Apple are able to check what is happening with the software or on the server and why thunderbird and tbsync were not syncing, that would be greatly appreciated, because I would like to understand how and why this problem occurred in order to hopefully avoid it in the future ... I am still hoping I can fix this on the desktop applications, but I am giving more time to the server in case it is having to check all its files ... but does tbsync somehow install anything on the server? </p>",galacticpresident,false,0,0

And, depending on the account, it might be the opposite: that the receiving account online is retrieving from Outlook. It can be done either way, depending on features of the email provider.
