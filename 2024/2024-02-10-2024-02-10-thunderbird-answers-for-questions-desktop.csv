An optional approach would be to - exit thunderbird, - in Windows file manager (or whatever OS you use's file manager), locate the profile and in Mail\&lt;POPaccount&gt; folder, copy the message files (e.g., inbox,inbox.msf,sent, sent.msf) to Mail\Local Folders, rename to something meaningful, delete the msf versions (TB will recreate the indexes).  - restart TB and verify that your messages are okay, and then you can delete the old account. </p><p>If IMAP,  click file&gt;offline&gt;download to get all messages local. Then, review to ensure you're satisfied.  - Now, you can create new folders in Local Folders as above and COPY (not move) selected messages to the new folders, or use the other option of exiting TB and repeat what I posted for POP, going to the Imapmail\&lt;imapaccount&gt; folder and copy the files as mentioned above.  - restart tb and verify that all is okay. Now you can close the imap account. </p><p>- When doing such as the above, I always recommend doing a backup BEFORE and also AFTER. And the only backup I trust goes like this: - exit thunderbird  - copy the profile, usually at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to a USB drive (assuming you use Windows) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Since you will have already created new Local Folders, I suggest highlight, rightclick and select the menu option of 'copy to' and the select the folder. If there are many messages, I suggest the other approach of exiting TB and copying the mail files themselves as that ensures everything is copied. I suggest not focusing on the new email address, as your first priority is in saving the messages. If you want to later integrate those messges in a new account, that is its own little project. If that is your preference, you can create the new IMAP account alongside the current one, but copying IMAP to IMAP is dicey. It just wasn't made for that and my fear is you would lose messages.

I have discovered two things that may matter. 1) the cantankerous hotmail address is domiciled in the Dublin servers and the other three are domiciled elsewhere and 2) the problem does not seem to happen with non-hotmail addresses - I have a gmail address - but that does not mean much since 3 of my 4 hotmail addresses work fine as well.
