The 'from' and  'subject' in the message headers are also blank. The mail index list does list the subject, sender and time. </p><p>This only appears to have started since I updated to the above version.  What is this error code and how can I rectify it. Thanks.

Almost as if the sender did something to tag them before I receive them. Is that even possible? </p><p>I am assuming/hoping that this is not related to messages being 'marked' ""As Not Junk"", is that correct? </p><p>What, in Thunderbird, would auto-tag some (but not all) messages as NonJunk? Can I turn it off? </p><p>Thanks for your help </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1677608;,oliwally1

It would be nice if this showed up in the area above the column headers but AFAICT, this isn't a thing - natively or via an extension?  and can only be estimated by putting things into folders and seeing the ""Properties"" and size on disk&nbsp;?  which may or may not be the same?
