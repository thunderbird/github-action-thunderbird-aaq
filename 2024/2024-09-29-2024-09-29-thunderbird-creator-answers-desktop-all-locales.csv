Investigating the situation on the ground in Seattle Civilian community under community arrest by law enforcement and none pros security guards armed with none constitutional store policies . Policies nation wide . The 100 year campaign on the population of so called low income citizens. The campaign go's like this. The narrative Jim crow must stay alive for best interests of or nation. What's the best interests well you didn't know. Wow I thought all new this story.  But I'll keep it short  . The campaign is to hide the truth about how united state declared there independence from British rule on independence day . The truth is on that day we lost are independence. As well we lost much more then just independence we lost are self worth. Hold up don't think I'm being harsh . Let me explain. Self worth not what you think it is . It's actually when a person is left without property are free speech you can feel like your in a slave state of mind  . Hanse the word self worth. Know the truth is slavery and welfare systems is almost the same thing. Actually the prison system treats you better then section 8 does and dhs . 3 meals. And a coat for free . As well as all other types of free stuff you get from the prison stay. Well get to the states of mind a human goes through when lose his freedom. Let's just say prison is as close to slavery as you can get if not worst because of the chimcal imbalance that impact all citizens once in and released. Know you see this security officer  . We it look like a ordinary possibly miss understanding . But it's why more then just a possible theft search and seize. This security man stopped me coming into the store at the door and requested that i take my backpack off and leave it at the front door with a pill of other citizens backpack was . I told him I would not because one that's not the store policies  . Two because I wanted to witness how he would respond. It didn't take long for him to react. This officer is one of the angry one . The type that will drag you out of the store if you didn't listen. Mind you this is not a police officer. Know how do this man believe he could harass me  . Well because he called Backup to help him kick me out of the store. If I shows weakness him and the store manager and 2 other store that was behind me would of attacked. Trust me this is not a isolated incident. All stores nation wide violate citizens that look low income  . Or homeless regardless of color or creed . The policies is no matter you have money or not if you look like a homeless person with the criteria. , come into the store with backpack on. Or bike, a bunch of bags. Or children coming to buy lunch they will use that policies keep bags at front of store . Or they follow you around the store until you leave  . Or harass you until you get upset and demand to be treated with respect. They don't like when you tell them what your  constitutional rights are . When you to reson with them are try to mind act like there not there they will increase the Jim crow campaign . Level 3 approach is coming up . We already called the police the manager would say . Unusually the threat of calling the police come for the smallest reason. Without evidence of a crime . All what I just said has been going on in community and store properties for more then 100 or more. And retail store got rich off citizens doing business with there institutions. The issues really become a civil rights crime of a century is when a citizen not a criminal didn't leave the store before the police is called  . Most of the time you are apprehended when walking out and told that you couldn't leave until the police officer finish his investigation. And of course the citizens as what investigation. Know this is where citizens lose all since of being in the land of the free when and if the citizens didn't do anything wrong to be under investigation and be held under arrest think to himself I got right. He or she believes that they have rights because the  constitution say you have rights. So he decides to quote the  constitution to officer .

I sent a broadcast message to myself, but included four friends under Bcc:.  When I got my own copy of the email, from the address on the To: line, I see that the Bcc: list is visible, as shown in the attached image.  Is this JUST on my received copy of the message, or is everyone's name 'in the clear?' </p><p>Thinking that my outgoing message might have been cached-and-used or something, I went into my Gmail Web account and looked at the message as received by Google's servers.  Sure enough, the 'blind' (ostensibly hidden!) names show up there as well, so I'm assuming that the Bcc: function may not be doing its job.  Either that, or the primary (To:) recipient sees the Bcc: list in the clear, and listed Bcc: recipients won't, although I don't recall Thunderbird working this way in the past.  But if it does, that's okay, just that Windows Live Mail, my previous client, didn't. </p>",thunderbird;privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1677816;,Electrojim
