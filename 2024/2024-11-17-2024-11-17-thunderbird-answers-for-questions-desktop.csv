What is does is intercepting the secure TLS connection of Thunderbird to your email provider's server, in other words, a man in the middle attack. Norton is then generating a cert on the fly to terminate the TSL connection, and connecting to your email provider's server on your behalf. That also means Norton is able to spy all your seemingly TLS connected traffic, including your account passwords. So you do have two options. </p> <ol><li> Install the root cert from Norton, so that Thunderbird will stop complaining about the Norton cert. </li><li> Disable SSL/TLS scanning in Norton Antivirus, so that Norton won't be able to spy on you anymore. Better yet, get rid of Norton altogether, and stick with Microsoft Defender. </li></ol> <p>More information in this Firefox support article, it applies to Thunderbird as well. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/error-codes-secure-websites"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/error-codes-secure-websites</a> </p>",christ1,false,1,0

The problem is with the desk top, whenever I try to use TB I receive a pop-up that wants a  pass word for a server. This started just after a update on Nov 13th. Since TB works fine on the LT and also on K9 mail app on my android tablet, it appears to be only a problem on the Desk top. This has also stopped allowing e-mail to be received on the desk top.  I also get a notice that Micro soft ""To Do"" can not be opened.  This all happened after the update. Should I go in and uninstall the update? any help would be appreciated as I am new to W11. </p>",jtheimer,false,0,0

As you type your e-mail, you may see a clickable label ""configure manually"" appear. Click on it so you can force ""POP3"" instead of IMAP. Thunderbird allows the creation of an account even if the datas are not valid. So do not type all the credential and keep the account even if it is not valid - all you need is that the folder structure is created. Then you have a final screen, the server settings, with the path to the storage folder. Head to it and quit Thunderbird. In the folder, paste a copy of your SBD files with their index (keep the originals safe!). Maybe you should rename them as the default files created to lure Thunderbird. Then restart Thunderbird and see if the fake account lists your e-mails.  </p><p>For long term storage, I would advise to use the archive function on them in a local folder which IMO is the best storage for old e-mails. And get rid of the fake account. </p>",frederic12,false,0,0

I was thinking something like that might be the answer but it seemed pretty technical to attempt so was waiting for a reply here.  What I've found that seems to be working is to copy over the pop .msf files and contents of the pop .sbd folders to new .sbd folders that I create under ""Local folders"" which are just that - local.   It's a little tricky but is mostly working.  I do the copying in the C:/User directories and then close and open Thunderbird to see what sticks.  So far it's working pretty good. </p>",BDinger3,false,1,0
