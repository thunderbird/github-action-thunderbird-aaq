When I would open an email invitation, there was always a line/bar that would appear below the subject line that would say ""this message contains an invitation to an event"" on the left side and then buttons with ""accept"" ""tentative"" ""decline"" on the right side of that line. This line/bar no long appears in email event/meeting invitations. On my windows 11 Laptop with Thunderbird version 128.2.1esr (64) bit, that line/bar no longer appears and I can no longer accept event/meeting requests sent to me by email.  I could do this before, and I have an example from my old windows 10 laptop using Thunderbird version 115.15.0 (32 bit). Did something change with a new Thunderbird update? Or do I need to change some setting in my Thunderbird version 128.2.1esr (64 bit) app?  See attached example of meeting requests received by email on both versions of Thunderbird.  The email from the 115 version shows that event line/bar the email from the 128 version doesn't.    Any advice?  Thanks in advance. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;needsinfo;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jaywhyvanier

The content of the email is random letters and symbols, maybe it shows only the encrypted email for some reason. This problem can not be a device problem because my college ran into the same problem. If I go on my phone (Gmail app) the email in question appears as normal there but not on my Thunderbird app on my laptop.

This also transferred my Thunderbird profile folder. It has the extension .default and an 8-digit combination of letters and numbers in front of it. Since the old version of Thunderbird no longer ran on Sonoma, I installed Thunderbird 115.15.0 and then opened Thunderbird on the new MacBook Air. Since then, Thunderbird has been taking an extremely long time to open (much longer than on the old MacBook Air with Mojave. Yesterday I updated to 128.2.0esr, which didn't help either. I deleted a deactivated extension in the add-ons, so that there are now no extensions, only a few dictionaries that I deleted as a test, which also did not bring any improvement. Switching off the hardware acceleration, clearing the cache and changing the themes did not improve the situation either. With the themes, I can only switch between dark, light and system theme - automatically. I checked and made sure that Thunderbird actually loads the .default profile folder from my old computer as the active profile. However, Thunderbird has also automatically set up a second profile with the extension .default-release. Could this be causing the problem? My active profile folder has a size of 15.21 GB and the new .deault-release profile folder has 18.6 MB. Both profile folders are located in Library/Thunderbird/Profiles I am quite desperate and hope that someone can help me.

Recently (about 1-2 months ago approx) some of my emails have started having an attachment that does not belong with it. For example, I just received an email that I know for a fact was not sent with an attachment, however in my inbox it shows that the email has an attachment. It is always the same attachment and is always the same file name, and is a file I received about two years ago. (The fie that gets attached is a legitimate one from a trusted source. It is a pdf file, and is always the same one when it gets attached to incoming emails). I can open the attachment everytime when it shows up, so it is acting like it belongs with the specific email, even though I know it is not supposed to be there. I also noticed that when this happens there is no text in the email message, just the attachment. This happens at random times and does not seem to have any specific pattern. I use a gmail account &amp; am connected by imap. If I go directly to my google inbox the specific email shows as normal, meaning the attachment is not with it, and the text of the email shows up. How can I fix this? I have tried compacting my folders however that has not helped. I have scanned for any malware and the scans show no issues. I do  not know what else to do. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you. Rich </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",AppraiserVT
