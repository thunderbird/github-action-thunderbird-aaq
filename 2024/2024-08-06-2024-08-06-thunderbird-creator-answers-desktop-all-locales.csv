One day in August 2023, Outlook started not connecting to my Bigpond email account both on my laptop and my phone.  Telstra (Bigpond) told me last year that it was a Microsoft issue.  Microsoft has denied this. </p><p>The fact that the same problem is happening when I want to add my Bigpond account to Thunderbird suggests it is not a problem with the email client (Outlook or Thunderbird) but either a Telstra or a local programme issue.
