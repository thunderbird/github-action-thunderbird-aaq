I have looked through lots of web messages without finding one on topic. </p><p>Via web browser I can connect to my Bigpond (Telstra) email without issue. </p><p>My Bigpond email will also not connect to Outlook, which was provided by my work which I left 3 weeks ago and this was happening on both my laptop and my mobile phone.  Before August 2023, there was no problem and I could access my private Bigpond email account on both laptop and phone as added account in Outlook.  One day in August 2023, Outlook started not connecting to my Bigpond email account both on my laptop and my phone.  Telstra (Bigpond) told me last year that it was a Microsoft issue.  Microsoft has denied this. </p><p>The fact that the same problem is happening when I want to add my Bigpond account to Thunderbird suggests it is not a problem with the email client (Outlook or Thunderbird) but either a Telstra or a local programme issue.  I have Norton Antivirus, but I cannot see anything in that interfering with the email server connection. </p><p>I have tried re-setting my Bigpond webmail password and re-starting multiple times - no joy! </p>",install-and-update;,thunderbird,install-and-update,en-US,"",cgprice
