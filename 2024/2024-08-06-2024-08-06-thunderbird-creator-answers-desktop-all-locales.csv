This also happens for the Outlook accounts, which show new mail having come in yesterday and the other day, although as of now, unlike Hotmail, the other 2 have not subsequently logged in yet. I can log in via Firefox into those accounts, but Thunderbird will not, at least at the start of Thunderbird, but at a time later I have no control of?

Reiterating this question/bug report since it is a constant irritation and for which there was no response previously... </p><p>With all the various iterations of the TB Calendar including the latest (currently 115.10.1 - 64bit),  it has always been a mystery as to how the organizer email address is selected when creating a new calendar item with invitees.   It seems to be somewhat random and it changes for no apparent reason.   </p><p>In my context I show three calendars, all remote (fruux, CALDAV).   All three are configured with usernames and email addresses appropriate for the calendar.  </p><p>There are two fields in an external calendar properties settings that might apply:    Username - the email used to access the external calendar....Not appropriate to use for the 'organizer'. Email - according to the documentation ""This is the email address Thunderbird uses to send invitations for events."" This would be appropriate as the default organizer but it isn't what is used. Instead the Username email is used.   <strong>THIS IS A BUG</strong>. </p><p>One would expect that for a calendar item created, when inviting attendees, the organizer would be the email address configured for the calendar but this is <strong>*NOT*</strong> the case.   Instead, it seems an address is plucked somewhat randomly and applied to the field.  </p><p>Is this something that can be configured or is it just a BUG?  It is painful to have to constantly correct the organizer email and results in confusion with my meeting participants, especially when the invitation arrives from a strange email address. </p><p>Note that with upgrades to TB 115 and beyond I completely replaced my TB profile from scratch and the problem has persisted across the profile rebuild.  So that does not seem to be a solution to the issue. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",mozilla-kgi

Last week Thursday, you could look at an email in your Inbox that was received the same day, 3 months ago or 3 years ago and you could see the email, the text, pictures, attachments, etc.  Come in to work on Monday and when you click on an email in the Inbox, they are blank.  You cannot see any text, pictures or attachments.  Note, this is only the Inbox.  If you go to the Trash folder, every email will load just fine.  I assumed some Microsoft update came through that was causing the problem so I did a restore point on the computer to a date prior to last Thursday.  This did not fix the problem.  I made a backup copy of the email file by going to ""Help, Trouble Shooting Information, clicking on Open Folder next to Profile Folder, backing up ""3"" directories to the Roaming folder and copying the ""Thunderbird"" folder to a removable drive.  I then installed Thunderbird on a laptop that has never had Thunderbird on it before and properly installed the ""Backed up copy"" of the profile folder.  This resulted in the same issue, some Inbox emails will not open with any text/info, they show up on the list but are empty when you go into the email. Whats confusing is why only some emails wont show any data while others within the Inbox are just fine.  Another thought was maybe the file size was too large, but the Inbox file size is 1.9GB, well below the 4.0GB.  I did try to run a ""folder rebuild"" and it deleted a bunch of emails out of the folder, I cannot say for certain if it was only the emails that won't show info or if it encompassed more of them.  Good thing I had a backup, so I could restore all the emails it lost.  The photo shows an email thread and how it displays the email, no text/images - it has data but will not show anything when you go into the email.  This email happens to be from 2022, but I could select an email from yesterday and it would do the same.  Note - it is not isolated to an email that has a thread, it can sometimes be a single message.  And again, only in the Inbox.  All other folders function properly.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",jay-signstudio
