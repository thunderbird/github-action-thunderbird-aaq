The trash folder for POP is, indeed, local but it is part of the POP account. There is a Trash folder in Local Folders in case you delete any messages from message folders there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I am also testing em_Client right now, which has an easy way to hide unwanted Local folders. If I may paraphrase: Even with a POP setup, there are two sections of the nav pane, the email Account folder area higher up, and the Local folder area lower down.  An email deleted in the Account area will appear in the Trash folder of the Account area, and an email deleted in the Local area will appear in the Trash folder in the local area. Makes sense.  I had thought an email deleted in the account area would go to the local folder Trash because this is POP, not IMAP. I should have just tested that, but did not think of it. I will mark as solved. </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0
