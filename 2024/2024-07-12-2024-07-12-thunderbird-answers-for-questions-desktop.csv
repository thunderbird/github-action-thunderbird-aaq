I am also testing em_Client right now, which has an easy way to hide unwanted Local folders. If I may paraphrase: Even with a POP setup, there are two sections of the nav pane, the email Account folder area higher up, and the Local folder area lower down.  An email deleted in the Account area will appear in the Trash folder of the Account area, and an email deleted in the Local area will appear in the Trash folder in the local area. Makes sense.  I had thought an email deleted in the account area would go to the local folder Trash because this is POP, not IMAP. I should have just tested that, but did not think of it. I will mark as solved. </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0

I then sent a third email, and the badge app icon number is now three. So what the badge app icon is reporting in multiple circumstances is the total number of emails in the inbox list, not the number of unread emails.  I wonder if this due to being on POP, which I did specify above. Maybe the badge app icon works right only on IMAP. Just speculating on that.

Maybe updates are rolled out geographically? On Outlook 2016 client, I see a yellow envelope badge to show that a message (or plural) is unread, but no number of messages is provided. A badge accurately showing whether there are any unread messages is highly useful to me, and for me a must-have really on Thunderbird.  I want to walk by my computer and see at a glance from maybe three feet away whether I need to sit down and open an unread email. For my needs anyway, the actual number, which is very hard to read really, is not even needed, but the badge indicating unread emails is needed. I hope someone can respond to the questions about the App icon options which I mentioned in an earlier post in this thread. What more specifically does the ""Count of new messages"" option do? ""New"" in what sense? Is there a timer for being ""new"". Or what? It seems intuitive to me that New=Unread and Old=Read, but that can't be the currently intended definition, since the other option is ""Count of unread"", so the two options would be identical, if ""new"" = ""unread"". The main practical problem in my view is that in Thunderbird POP the badge does not go away after all unread emails are read. This may be because the number count of unread does not go down when each email is read. So the number count cannot terminate at zero unread, which presumably is the trigger for making badge icon go away. So if the number decrementing is too much for POP, that would explain why the badge itself will not go away on POP, even though all emails have been read. This for me and likely some others is a big problem, even keeping me from choosing Thunderbird in a comparison with em-Client. I just want to see from the taskbar whether or not all my emails have been read, a binary type report. </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0

The setting is Count of Unread Messages. Despite reading all the messages, the badge number went down to one, but it did not go to zero with no unread messages remaining, and the red circle with a 1 did not disappear either.  I sent myself from another device and account a second new email, and the badge number went from one to two. I then opened that email, but the badge number stayed at two. I sent a third email, see the gold star on the new one, and the badge number increases to three. But per above, two of those three have been read.  So no change with 128 that I can detect. The badge number in a given session goes up with incoming emails, but not down as they are read. Right now I see one unread and two read, with a three on the badge. I read the unread one, and still see three on the badge. So the badge number seems to be stating the total number of received emails in the current session, i. e. since the app has been launched. Maybe the settings name needs correcting, either that or the software operation. My question also stands: What is the other setting, Count of New Messages? For my money, I am getting a count of new messages, with ""New"" defined as ""arriving in the current session and not remove from the Inbox."" There is no Count of Unread Messages option in reality. That would be my take. Whether there are bugs or just misnomers in setting names is beyond me. </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0

Please post the following information: In Thunderbird Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information Scroll down to 'Mail and News Accounts' section Copy all the data and post the info into this forum question. </p><p>I've seen this 'Check mail server capabilities' occur in the past when people were using a server which was not using up to date tls security. I've also seen issues when people were using STARTTLS instead of SSL/TLS. So post the info stated above so we have a starting point. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,1,0
