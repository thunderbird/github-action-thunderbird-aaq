I am also testing em_Client right now, which has an easy way to hide unwanted Local folders. If I may paraphrase: Even with a POP setup, there are two sections of the nav pane, the email Account folder area higher up, and the Local folder area lower down.  An email deleted in the Account area will appear in the Trash folder of the Account area, and an email deleted in the Local area will appear in the Trash folder in the local area. Makes sense.  I had thought an email deleted in the account area would go to the local folder Trash because this is POP, not IMAP. I should have just tested that, but did not think of it. I will mark as solved. </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0

After 25 years using Eudora/Thunderbird on a Mac I have been forced to join the forum.  Using High Sierra 10.13 TB wnet from fully functional to the message as reported by Garth.  Can only assume that my system has been automatically updated to obsolescent.  As Garth wonderted - why didnt the TB upgrade process check first?  Anyway back to the main issue - TB is completely blocked from launching with a no go symbol across the icon in the dock.

I agree having done many such routines. </p><p>Can Matt the Moderator point us stranded Mac 10.13 users to the preferred recovery process that he hinted at?  Much appreciated. </p><p>This is my suggested/intended approach until informed otherwise. </p><p>Roll back TB to the previous version - since Im locked out of the app and I dont know what version was running Im going back to TB 102 - but perhaps it should be 115?  Looking around in the TB package content I can see that it thinks it is version 128 and that the updater says it doesnt work on 10.13 and requires 10.15.  Since automatic updates were allowed ( I trusted Mozilla with my connection to life the universe and everything!) this update may need to learn to check before getting into this logical cul de sac. </p><p>Rollback procedure: Backup TB folder plus Time Machine backup as well Remove compatibility.ini file from Library to a safe place Place TB 128 into the trash but dont empty Run .dmg installer for the selected old version of TB It should open with all emails, contacts etc in place? </p><p>What do you think?

Correctly, the badge on the app icon then was two, for two unread emails.  I then read one of those emails, but the badge number is still two. I then sent a third email, and the badge app icon number is now three. So what the badge app icon is reporting in multiple circumstances is the total number of emails in the inbox list, not the number of unread emails.  I wonder if this due to being on POP, which I did specify above. Maybe the badge app icon works right only on IMAP. Just speculating on that. [Also, I am puzzled by the option Count of new messages, how ""new"" is defined. But what is useful to me is a badge count of unread, which I cannot so far make work.] </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0

Maybe updates are rolled out geographically? On Outlook 2016 client, I see a yellow envelope badge to show that a message (or plural) is unread, but no number of messages is provided. A badge accurately showing whether there are any unread messages is highly useful to me, and for me a must-have really on Thunderbird.  I want to walk by my computer and see at a glance from maybe three feet away whether I need to sit down and open an unread email. For my needs anyway, the actual number, which is very hard to read really, is not even needed, but the badge indicating unread emails is needed. I hope someone can respond to the questions about the App icon options which I mentioned in an earlier post in this thread. What more specifically does the ""Count of new messages"" option do? ""New"" in what sense? Is there a timer for being ""new"". Or what? It seems intuitive to me that New=Unread and Old=Read, but that can't be the currently intended definition, since the other option is ""Count of unread"", so the two options would be identical, if ""new"" = ""unread"". The main practical problem in my view is that in Thunderbird POP the badge does not go away after all unread emails are read. This may be because the number count of unread does not go down when each email is read. So the number count cannot terminate at zero unread, which presumably is the trigger for making badge icon go away. So if the number decrementing is too much for POP, that would explain why the badge itself will not go away on POP, even though all emails have been read. This for me and likely some others is a big problem, even keeping me from choosing Thunderbird in a comparison with em-Client. I just want to see from the taskbar whether or not all my emails have been read, a binary type report. </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0

The setting is Count of Unread Messages. Despite reading all the messages, the badge number went down to one, but it did not go to zero with no unread messages remaining, and the red circle with a 1 did not disappear either.  I sent myself from another device and account a second new email, and the badge number went from one to two. I then opened that email, but the badge number stayed at two. I sent a third email, see the gold star on the new one, and the badge number increases to three. But per above, two of those three have been read.  So no change with 128 that I can detect. The badge number in a given session goes up with incoming emails, but not down as they are read. Right now I see one unread and two read, with a three on the badge. I read the unread one, and still see three on the badge. So the badge number seems to be stating the total number of received emails in the current session, i. e. since the app has been launched. Maybe the settings name needs correcting, either that or the software operation. My question also stands: What is the other setting, Count of New Messages? For my money, I am getting a count of new messages, with ""New"" defined as ""arriving in the current session and not remove from the Inbox."" There is no Count of Unread Messages option in reality. That would be my take. Whether there are bugs or just misnomers in setting names is beyond me. </p>",Quenchoo,false,0,0

So an imap account will have it saved by default. In your case this may not be something that occurs. As you have an imap mail account can you perform some checks. </p><p><strong>In Folder Pane:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Right click on the name of the account folder and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> Click on 'Refresh' button </li><li> Select the 'Sent' folder and click on 'Subscribe' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <ul><li> Now right click on 'Sent' folder and select 'Properties' </li><li> click on 'General Information' tab </li><li> select checkbox - Include messages in this folder in Global Search results </li><li> select checkbox - When getting new messages for this account, always check this folder </li><li> Select 'REtention Policy' tab </li><li> Select 'Use my account settings </li><li> Select 'Don't delete any messages' </li></ul> <ul><li> click on 'Synchronisation' tab </li><li> select checkbox 'Select this folder for offline use' </li></ul> <p><br> <strong>In Account Settings:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Select 'Copies &amp; Folders' for the account </li></ul> <p>When sending messages, automatically: </p> <ul><li> Select checkbox&nbsp;: 'Place a copy in' </li><li> Select&nbsp;: 'Other' </li><li> Choose 'Sent on mail account name' </li></ul> <ul><li> Select 'Synchronisation &amp; Storage' for the account </li><li> Click on 'Advanced' button </li><li> Expand the drop down for the mail account to see list of folders </li><li> Check the 'Sent' folder has a tick in the box in 'Download' column. </li><li> Whilst in that location - if you want a full copy download then make sure each folder has a tick to show it has been selected for download. Otherwise only headers get downloaded. </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Exit Thunderbird to ensure all settings are properly updated to all various files. </p><p>Whilst Thunderbird is closed.  Please check your Anti-Virus. Ant-Virus products are well known for causing some issues because they can scan any file that gets opened or scan files that get received and sent. If the Anti-Virus has got control over a file then Thunderbird cannot use it. I would advise you set up an exception for your Thunderbird profile folder to not scan this folder or it's contents. Also check to see if you have a setting which is auto scanning outgoing mail and switch it off. </p><p>If you have other similar products eg: malware, CCleaner, Wisecleaner etc Please make sure they have no access to Thunderbird profile folder or it's contents. Set up an exception if required. </p><p>Start up Thunderbird and wait for all auto connections with server to be performed - if possible wait until you have received some emails before attempting to send. Select the 'Sent' folder to make sure it has sycnhronised with server. Then attempt to send. </p><p>If you had been able to use 'Safe Mode with Networking' using ethernet cable then this would have temporarilly disabled the Anti-Virus and other non required programs properly - it's a useful tool for checking to see if there is any interference from programs.   </p><p>I understand your predicament with router in one location but computer (not laptop) set up elsewhere.  I have internet to front of house which is where the socket is located. But then I put an extension into socket and run cable under floorboards to the back of house and connect to a splitter socket which has the cable that connects to router. Then I have ethernet cable from router across room to computer.  I normally operate via ethernet, but I can swap to wireless if necessary. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
