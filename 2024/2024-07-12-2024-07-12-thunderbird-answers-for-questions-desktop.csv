The trash folder for POP is, indeed, local but it is part of the POP account. There is a Trash folder in Local Folders in case you delete any messages from message folders there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Install instructions are on that page.  - I documented full font setting instructions at  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1437527"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1437527</a>   it is very detailed but I assure you it will do exactly what you want for message text. My example was calibri font and 14 pt. This adjusts message text font, not other fonts.  - for line length, click settings&gt;general, scroll down to bottom to 'config editor' and click that. then search for mailnews.wraplength and change number from 72 to 100. - some of what you want may require custom CSS statements, and that is not a skill of mine. Others may also post with other ways to achieve what you need. You may wish to review the hamburger menu in upper right (three horizontal stacked lines icon) for Density and Fontsize adjustments. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
