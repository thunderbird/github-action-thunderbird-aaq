The Top Level Domain called  .space (among other in my list) use spam email addresses such a example.space This gives them an INFINITE number of email addresses to use. There is NO way to block them other that at the TOP LEVEL. </p><p>2.) Blocking just the Domain (example@example.de) is also useless... read reason #1 </p><p>3.) ICAAN has made it much easer for spammers to create unique top level domains. .... read reason #1 </p><p>4.) My email provider does not and will not provide me options to block any Top Level Domain I choose. Its beneath them to provide such an essential tool. </p><p>So, How can I set up Thunderbird so that it will totally block and Never download from my mail server ANY top level domain that I choose??? </p><p>I dont want to know about using other email programs.
