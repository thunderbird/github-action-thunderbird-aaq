And sending emails fails as well with the following message: ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://send.one.com"" rel=""nofollow"">send.one.com</a> timed out. Try again."" </p><p>I can still access my emails through the web but since my entire office procedure is designed around Thunderbird, I'm keen to get this sorted. </p><p><a href=""http://One.com"" rel=""nofollow"">One.com</a> - my hosting service - say that there is nothing at their end causing the problem. So I guess its some setting in thunderbird somehow stopping communications with both the incoming server and the outgoing one. I have gone through the obvious steps - checked numerous times the server settings (including changing these to alternatives suggested by <a href=""http://One.com"" rel=""nofollow"">One.com</a> tech support) - they are all as they should be. Also I stopped my antivirus for a few minutes, just in case it was that. </p><p>All of this happened without any obvious update or change to the Thunderbird version, or any action of mine that could possibly have changed any of the settings.   </p><p>Any ideas? And if no positive suggestions, does Thunderbird have logs which might give me more information as to why the contact be me and the servers are failing? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Tim-eyebright
