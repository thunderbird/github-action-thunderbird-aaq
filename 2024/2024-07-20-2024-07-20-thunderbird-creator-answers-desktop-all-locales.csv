And sending emails fails as well with the following message: ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://send.one.com"" rel=""nofollow"">send.one.com</a> timed out.

I have gone through the obvious steps - checked numerous times the server settings (including changing these to alternatives suggested by <a href=""http://One.com"" rel=""nofollow"">One.com</a> tech support) - they are all as they should be.
