I want to save the emails to where I can access them if needed later. After I have that I want to delete the older emails in Gmail to make the inbox and folders smaller. Thunderbird will then sync the inbox which will be considerably smaller. It appears that archiving will do this but I don't know how to copy the emails to Local Folders. It appears that Thunderbird will still be able to search &amp; find the old emails if I need them. After deleting them, Thunderbird will be syncing the smaller inbox instead of all of them. I copied the Profiles directory from the appdata string to an external drive which it appears I have backed the profile up. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1662766;,bertnuc
