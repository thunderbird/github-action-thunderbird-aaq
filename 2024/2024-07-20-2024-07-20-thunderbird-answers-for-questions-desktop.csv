Because that would be a POP/IMAP issue. </p><p>So here's my experience: </p><p>After updating my authentication method to OAuth2 and IMAP Server Name to <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>, TB forced a restart on the app and I was prompted by a <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a> website login and then requested permission and it successfully retrieved my mail. Left the SMTP Server Name alone as that is what was stated on the MS website, TB wouldn't let me change to OAuth2 tho so left that as mozilla article found in this tread said to basic authentication. After having responded to this thread I tried to test sending an email, failed authentication. Changed SMTP Server Name to <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> closed window re-opened and OAuth2 was now available and switched to that. Tried to test sending again, failed again. Since TB did not force restart after the SMTP server change I decided to do that myself before trying anything else. Attempted to send again and this time succeeded. </p><p>Microsoft really needs to update their info on the proper SMTP server to use and the mozilla article needs to make mention of the server names needing to be changed and not just the authentication method... </p>",C45P3R,false,0,0
