They contain links to PHP scripts that serve the images, and also record when and where you opened the mail etc.  A little like the old fashioned web bugs or web beacons they are about reporting your actions silently and without any direct consent. </p><p>Thunderbird does not run scripts,  nor load images from scripts as fundamentally there is nothing to say the script will not dump some nicely tailored malware instead of an image.  So in their endeavors to know exactly what you read and what you click on in the newsletter they send,  they actually just about make sure their newsletter is unreadable in a mail client that respects privacy and looks for security over ease of use. </p><p>The relevant tracking is in the last image. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-02-14-15-31-34-6a042a.png""> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
