I did that but 115.16.0 still remained. I uninstalled 128.3.3 successfully. 115.16 still wouldn't uninstall, so I used a program to cleanup all of this version.

I tried the ""new"" outlook and it works OK but this is cloud based and I travel a lot including to China (where connectivity is a big problem, especially to anything google) and I need access to my downloaded email. I also don't like the ""new"" outlook format which is inflexible but the main problem for me is that it is cloud based, else I would put up with it. </p><p>THUNDERBIRD: I then I searched for a better mail system and found Thunderbird - hurrah!  I it seemed exactly what I need (congratulations to you guys on such a great and straight-forward prod uct which was breeze to set up and get working). After connecting using POP3 it started to download all my ancient emails from 2007 (I had not realized they were still stored in gmail from so long ago). It downloaded really fast and I kept archiving them to get them out of the inbox.  Unfortunately it downloaded by oldest emails first with, it seems, no option to download most recent first, so it starting at 2007.  By day 2, I was up to 2011, by day 3, I was up to 2013 but it was slow going. Then I noticed the download went slower and slower until it was downloading only one or two emails at a time not hundreds, then it stopped completely just into 2016 with messages saying ""no new emails"" after F5.  </p><p>I don't know if I have overloaded Thunderbird (maybe 25GB so far and thousands of emails) or that gmail is getting a little upset with me downloading so much and consuming their bandwidth, so has cut me off (directly connection to gmail is still fine).  My 500GB SSD still has plenty of space so it is not a HD limitation. </p><p>HELP! I really like the format of Thunderbird and would like to use it if I can overcome this basic problem.  Do you have any ideas?  I will happily go into gmai to delete my ancient emails if will help, but I fear now that Thunderbird and gmail are not wanting to talk to each other. </p><p>Any ideas or suggestions? Any feedback will be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks a lot.
