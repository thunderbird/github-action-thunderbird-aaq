Thunderbird must have been running okay up to v115.16.0 as I had to do manual installs from then to now. Initially there seemingly was no indication of any problem. I'm not sure how many manual installs I did as it was only 15th Oct that this issue started.  I was on holidays for 6 weeks Thunderbird was unused between about 28th Aug to 15th October. So, my Thunderbird was running at 115.16.0. I tried to uninstall 115.15.0 but it said I had another version that needed to have the uninstall completed by rebooting the PC. I did that but 115.16.0 still remained. I uninstalled 128.3.3 successfully. 115.16 still wouldn't uninstall, so I used a program to cleanup all of this version. I reinstalled 128.3.3 and still get the same problem I started with.  ""Unable to use profile when you launch an older version of Thunde...."" </p><p>How can I get Thunderbird running?

I tried the ""new"" outlook and it works OK but this is cloud based and I travel a lot including to China (where connectivity is a big problem, especially to anything google) and I need access to my downloaded email. I also don't like the ""new"" outlook format which is inflexible but the main problem for me is that it is cloud based, else I would put up with it. </p><p>THUNDERBIRD: I then I searched for a better mail system and found Thunderbird - hurrah!  I it seemed exactly what I need (congratulations to you guys on such a great and straight-forward prod uct which was breeze to set up and get working). After connecting using POP3 it started to download all my ancient emails from 2007 (I had not realized they were still stored in gmail from so long ago). It downloaded really fast and I kept archiving them to get them out of the inbox.  Unfortunately it downloaded by oldest emails first with, it seems, no option to download most recent first, so it starting at 2007.  By day 2, I was up to 2011, by day 3, I was up to 2013 but it was slow going. Then I noticed the download went slower and slower until it was downloading only one or two emails at a time not hundreds, then it stopped completely just into 2016 with messages saying ""no new emails"" after F5.  </p><p>I don't know if I have overloaded Thunderbird (maybe 25GB so far and thousands of emails) or that gmail is getting a little upset with me downloading so much and consuming their bandwidth, so has cut me off (directly connection to gmail is still fine).  My 500GB SSD still has plenty of space so it is not a HD limitation. </p><p>HELP! I really like the format of Thunderbird and would like to use it if I can overcome this basic problem.  Do you have any ideas?  I will happily go into gmai to delete my ancient emails if will help, but I fear now that Thunderbird and gmail are not wanting to talk to each other. </p><p>Any ideas or suggestions? Any feedback will be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks a lot.

Doing this for a non-computer-literate friend. Old laptop (bought in 2016) is now running W10 but I assume it was originally W7 and upgraded at some point (by me). </p><p>I followed <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">Moving Thunderbird data to a new computer</a>  which seemed straightforward. However when I copied the Profile across and restarted Thunderbird there was no data to be seen. I tried again just to be sure, including uninstalling and reinstalling Thunderbird. Still no joy. [There are support threads about this but they seem to be archived so I can't update them.] </p><p>Onwards and upwards. I tried the ""export to zip file"" option. This had a mild warning that if the Profile was more than 3GB it might (!) be better to back up instead. [Noting that I had already tried this and failed - see above.] </p><p>It produced the ZIP file eventually, at an impressive 15.8GB. I then tried to restore from it, but the Restore option refused to find it, showing a comment that the file must be not larger than 2GB. I refer the reader back to the note on the Export option. </p><p>I then noted that you could Import from another Profile. I had one of those saved from my first attempts to copy Profile -&gt; Profile. So I tried this option and it worked. </p><p>I think my issue was that the old version of Thunderbird was 32 bit and the new version was 64 bit. In which case the document linked to above could do with an update to warn about moving from 32 bit to 64 bit and include the method that worked. [Subject to more testing by others to confirm the solution works reliably.] </p><p>The Export dialogue could also do with a much more specific warning, to align with the Import dialogue. </p><p>This is a brief summary of a very long day because shifting 15.8GB of data around between computers and in and out as well is incredibly tedious!&nbsp;:-( Noting that the ZIP file and the Thunderbird directory tree with the Profile in are both the same size. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1687160;1687261;1687283;,hugh.gives
