Thunderbird must have been running okay up to v115.16.0 as I had to do manual installs from then to now. Initially there seemingly was no indication of any problem. I'm not sure how many manual installs I did as it was only 15th Oct that this issue started.  I was on holidays for 6 weeks Thunderbird was unused between about 28th Aug to 15th October. So, my Thunderbird was running at 115.16.0. I tried to uninstall 115.15.0 but it said I had another version that needed to have the uninstall completed by rebooting the PC. I did that but 115.16.0 still remained. I uninstalled 128.3.3 successfully. 115.16 still wouldn't uninstall, so I used a program to cleanup all of this version. I reinstalled 128.3.3 and still get the same problem I started with.  ""Unable to use profile when you launch an older version of Thunde...."" </p><p>How can I get Thunderbird running?
