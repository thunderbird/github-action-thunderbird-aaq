And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

It is important to set the  'minimum size' to less than or same as proportional - never greater otherwise it will overrule all your settings. </p><p>In my case, I set  'Proportional' and 'Monospaced' as 16, but set 'Minimum size' as 12. So if someone send me an email with stupidly small font size of 9 then it will get auto displayed as a 12. </p><p>It also means when I compose an email, I can choose to make a font size which is a bit smaller, but it will not allow a font size less than 12.  </p><p>As david mentions, anything in html css set as medium or not specified will use whatever is set up as 'Proportional' size.

'Mail'</strong> folder - I was very surprised to see that the 'Profiles' folder contains a 'Mail' folder.  I did ask you to move that folder out of the Profiles folder. quote ""'move' that Profiles/'Mail' folder out of the 'Profiles' folder and dump it temporarilly on the desktop."" But your image shows you have not moved it.  You are no longer using that Mail folder.  Part of this exercise is to clean up everything.  I really need you to follow instructions. <strong>You must Exit Thunderbird first</strong> in order to move that 'Mail' folder onto the desktop. </p><p><strong>2. 'sqhv71mf.default'</strong>  - this is currently the 'profile name' folder you are set up to use.  It seems something is not correct in this profile because you deleted a load of 'prefs-x.js' etc files and it looks like it's recreating them every few minutes - albeit they are empty - but at the time you posted those images you had not removed that 'Mail' folderout of the 'Profiles' folder  - I'm not sure if Thunderbird is still trying to access it.   The future of this profile will be determined by what we find in the other profile called 'jq2eu30.default-release'. </p><p><strong>3. 'jq2eu30.default-release'</strong> - this profile was created more recently. This folder needs to be checked as it may contain newer mail/lost emails/lost folders etc. The following info may prove to be very important. </p> <ul><li> Access the 'jq2eu30.default-release' profile name folder. </li><li> Click on 'Mail' folder </li><li> Post image showing contents of that  'Mail' folder. </li><li> Click on 'Local Folders' mail account folder to see contents and post an image. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Sorry about the delay in my reply but I have been reviewing the situation and doing some experiments. I need to make the following comments: </p><p>1. I have been using this copy of Thunderbird for more than a decade naturally with many updates. It has handled thousands of emails and it could be said that it has performed very well indeed. What caused the current problem I don't know. 2. In spite of much effort from both you and I (I've posted 20+ images) the more recent emails seem to remain elusive and only the old ones have appeared. I have to accept that they are gone. <a href=""http://3.In"" rel=""nofollow"">3.In</a> the last few days one of my email recipients received a batch of old emails from me! I only know of one case but there might be others. Somehow Thunderbird has selected these and decided that they have to be sent. 4. I don't think I can spend much more time on this and I'm sure you have plenty to do in helping others. </p><p>I've loaded a new copy of Thunderbird on a different WIN10 machine. I tried to do an export from the old and an import to the new but of course it didn't work. The new copy doesn't like the profile. However I've found that I can make a direct copy of the emails I still want and just paste them into the new copy without using the export/import facility. I can also copy and load the address book. So if this works I'm no worse off than now and hopefully have a properly working system. </p><p>SO - I think I just have to pull stumps on the old Thunderbird and set up a new version on my main machine as I've explained.  </p><p>I'm sorry to have decided on this route as I'm happy with a challenge (!) but I do think we've both given it our best shot over some months. SO - thank you again for all the time you've spent on this, I've learned a lot so it has not been a fuitless exercise from my point of view. Thank you very much, Regards, Terry </p>",registration33,false,0,0

I think you are being rejected because Charter cannot confirm that the message is coming from an authorized user of the server. Many email providers have been tightening security, where messages went through one day, and not the next. Also, port should be 465 or 587. Not knowing specifics of Charter, you may want to try various combinations of SSL/TLS and STARTTLS with the two ports. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
