And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It is important to set the  'minimum size' to less than or same as proportional - never greater otherwise it will overrule all your settings. </p><p>In my case, I set  'Proportional' and 'Monospaced' as 16, but set 'Minimum size' as 12. So if someone send me an email with stupidly small font size of 9 then it will get auto displayed as a 12. </p><p>It also means when I compose an email, I can choose to make a font size which is a bit smaller, but it will not allow a font size less than 12.  </p><p>As david mentions, anything in html css set as medium or not specified will use whatever is set up as 'Proportional' size.  Anything smaller than that then falls under the 'minimised size' setting, but anything larger - well if sender actually set a large header then nothing you can do about it. </p><p>Always make sure that whatever is set up for 'Latin' which is 'western encoding' is also set up identically for 'Other Writing Systems' which is 'unicode encoding'.

But because of the contents of my profile file I'm hoping this might be a useful alternative way of going about it. Looking at the file the 'rubbish' elements appear to be called: </p><p>AlternateServices.xxtxt all but one only 0KB    and 89 of them folderCache-xx.json three with 8KB and the rest 0KB     there are 1138 of them prefs-xx.js the vast majority 0KB    and there are 9682 of them!!! SiteSecurityState-xx.txt all but the first 0KB   there are 47 of them virtual folders-xx.dat  a few with 1KB    and there are 72 of them. </p><p>I'm tempted to just delete all of the 0KB files - would that be a sensible first thing to do? Your comments much appreciated, regards, Terry </p>",registration33,false,0,0

I've now looked in more detail at what files are left as the total size is still shown as more than 2 GBY (Still far too big??) The file MAIL has subfolders containing a lot of files. The subfolders are called <a href=""http://mail.btinternet.-xx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.btinternet.-xx.com</a>. There are 9 of them and the first three contain more than 4000 files (each) called popstate.dat.    (The titles make sense because of my ISP and I use POP3) The other subfolders with similar names also contain 3000+ files (each) called msgFilterRules - xx.dat This is very surprising as I don't use any rules. </p><p>Clearly this is a complete mess!! </p><p>Shall I just go in and delete all but the latest file in these cases??? I do appreciate the help you are giving me on this. If I do manage to get the profile more tidy how do I stop it building up again??? Thank you, Terry </p>",registration33,false,0,0

However, if in doubt, you might rename the ones to be deleted to something that TB will ignore. That ensures that, if you missed something, the data could be recovered. Then, if all looks well, delete those unwanted files. On your question, I think that happens when there are update problems (but I am not sure of that at all.) My protection strategy is to periodically do backups and to review the profile contents. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I think you are being rejected because Charter cannot confirm that the message is coming from an authorized user of the server. Many email providers have been tightening security, where messages went through one day, and not the next. Also, port should be 465 or 587. Not knowing specifics of Charter, you may want to try various combinations of SSL/TLS and STARTTLS with the two ports. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
