And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It is important to set the  'minimum size' to less than or same as proportional - never greater otherwise it will overrule all your settings. </p><p>In my case, I set  'Proportional' and 'Monospaced' as 16, but set 'Minimum size' as 12. So if someone send me an email with stupidly small font size of 9 then it will get auto displayed as a 12. </p><p>It also means when I compose an email, I can choose to make a font size which is a bit smaller, but it will not allow a font size less than 12.  </p><p>As david mentions, anything in html css set as medium or not specified will use whatever is set up as 'Proportional' size.  Anything smaller than that then falls under the 'minimised size' setting, but anything larger - well if sender actually set a large header then nothing you can do about it. </p><p>Always make sure that whatever is set up for 'Latin' which is 'western encoding' is also set up identically for 'Other Writing Systems' which is 'unicode encoding'.

This is shown in 'filedetail01', The interesting folders here are the <a href=""http://mail.btinternet-x.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.btinternet-x.com</a> ones.

So yes, you may end up with duplicates if you keep copies on server. <strong>Note: </strong>One way to prevent that duplicate download would be to access the webmail account for that btinternet email address via a browser and move all previously downloaded emails out of the 'Inbox' and into another folder for storage and do this <strong>before</strong> you start Thunderbird. </p><p><strong>Why are you getting so many corruptions?</strong> Do you have any product like 'CCleaner' or 'Wisecleaner' or even an 'Anti-Virus' which has access to scan your Thunderbird profile folder or clean up files&nbsp;?

I think you are being rejected because Charter cannot confirm that the message is coming from an authorized user of the server. Many email providers have been tightening security, where messages went through one day, and not the next. Also, port should be 465 or 587. Not knowing specifics of Charter, you may want to try various combinations of SSL/TLS and STARTTLS with the two ports. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
