Perhaps, if you share more information, we can assist. It 'sounds like' you copied her account information into your profile? Thunderbird is not involved in quota issues, so I will presume that is a concern with your email provider. Details on how you transferred her account may prove useful. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Taken directly from the directory users/.../appdata/roaming/thunderbird. I'm afraid that's the only copy I've got. I tried by just copying the profile into my new corresponding directory und alternatively by importing that profile via the TB function. The result ist the same: TB asks for the password, the password is correct, but all there is to be seen is the adress-book. </p>",michaelschrader,false,0,0

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
