This is much preferred to reverting to an earlier version. For example, the sorting of incoming messages can be adjusted to function as it always has. Could you post a screenshot of your setup? That will be useful. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The only 'pure' import for me has been this:  - close thunderbird on both pcs  - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media from old pc - copy the backed-up thunderbird folder to c;\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming  on new pc, overwriting the existing files  - restart thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
