This is much preferred to reverting to an earlier version. For example, the sorting of incoming messages can be adjusted to function as it always has. Could you post a screenshot of your setup? That will be useful. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The only 'pure' import for me has been this:  - close thunderbird on both pcs  - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media from old pc - copy the backed-up thunderbird folder to c;\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming  on new pc, overwriting the existing files  - restart thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If this is an IMAP account, it's dicey, as network interaction is needed. I suggest either doing this a small number at a time, or setting up a filter to do this and manually run it. You need to do this carefully to avoid having the messages appear to have been copied when, in fact, the content is found later to be missing. A simpler approach to keep the messages would be to create a local folder and copy them there. They wouldn't be within an account, but you would at least have them. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
