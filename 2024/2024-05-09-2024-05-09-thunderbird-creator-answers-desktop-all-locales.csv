Stored them in the Personal Address Book (PAB).  I'm sorry, but Thunderbird doesn't seem to work like any other email client. How do I address an email using one of those mailing lists in the PAB. Tried typing the whole name of the mailing list in the To: field.  Didn't work. I'm not entirely stupid but it doesn't make sense to me. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1652029;,dalewebb1

It was a short duration issue (a few seconds to a minute).  I reinstalled Thunderbird several times without success.  I read almost every comment available online about this problem and I tried many ideas and recommendations I found without success.  Most recently the problem became so serious that it was not a nuisance any longer.  It was nearly impossble to work waiting for minutes to open an email or to continue typing while preparing a message and being interrupted by the problem I am describing.  I ran Thunderbird in safe mode and determined that none of the add-ons is causing the problem.  I turned the firewall OFF and determined that firewall was not causing the problem.  I then decided to run Thunderbird in Offline mode and found that the program works normally.  Then while in Offline mode I decided to download more messages and the program asked me if I wanted to switch to the Online mode.  I said yes.  New emails were downloaded and without going back to the Offline mode I was able to work normally without any occurrence of the ""Thunderbird not responding"" problem.  I have been using this workaround for several days now.  I download a number of eamails.  I try working in Online mode and I cannot do it.  I switch to Offline and work fine.  I switch back to Online mode and I don't see the problem any longer for the whole day.  Do you have any idea as to the origin of my proble? I am running Thunderbird 115.10.2 64 bit on Windows 11. I had the problem originally using Lenovo T490s and more recenlt Lenovo X1 Yoga </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1652024;,savvides48

There is no chance for me to put in a new password.  </p><p>I know that I need to use an app password when not using Outlook which I have generated in my Microsoft account settings.  </p><p>I have tried to go to ""Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Saved Passwords"" and have deleted all Microsoft related saved passwords. When I access my Email account again, I get prompted via the web login of Microsoft (i.e. different from the attached error message) and the app password I generated doesn't work, only the general password for my account works.  </p><p>I have restarted Thunderbird and updated to the latest version, but it made no difference. I have gotten it to work on another computer, but on my mac mini, it doesn't seem to work.  </p><p>Before I remove the account completely and add it again, is there any way I can fix this as I don't want to download all the messages again? </p><p>Is this a known bug in Thunderbird?  </p><p>If any developer is reading this, In order to reproduce, you would have to follow these steps: </p><p>- Setup a Office365 account using the regular password used to login to the O365 website. - When sending the first email, enter the same regular password -&gt; the first time, the dialog to enter the will show up, but it will fail, because the app password wasn't used - Then try to send again, click on ""Enter new password"" -&gt; no dialog to enter new password is coming up. </p><p>I am using Thunderbird 115.10.1 on MacOSX Sonoma 14.1.1 </p><p>The settings I have used are:  server name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> port: 587 username: my full email address Auth Method: OAuth2 Security: STARTTLS </p><p>Thank you for reading this.
