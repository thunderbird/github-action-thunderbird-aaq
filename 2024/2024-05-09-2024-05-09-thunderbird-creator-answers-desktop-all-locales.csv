Stored them in the Personal Address Book (PAB).  I'm sorry, but Thunderbird doesn't seem to work like any other email client. How do I address an email using one of those mailing lists in the PAB. Tried typing the whole name of the mailing list in the To: field.  Didn't work. I'm not entirely stupid but it doesn't make sense to me. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1652029;,dalewebb1

1446914,2024-05-08 21:00:52 -0700,2024-05-09 05:53:01 -0700,Persistent problem with Thunderbird not responding,"<p>For months I was experiencing the problem of ""Thunderbird not responding"" occasionally.  It was a short duration issue (a few seconds to a minute).  I reinstalled Thunderbird several times without success.  I read almost every comment available online about this problem and I tried many ideas and recommendations I found without success.  Most recently the problem became so serious that it was not a nuisance any longer.  It was nearly impossble to work waiting for minutes to open an email or to continue typing while preparing a message and being interrupted by the problem I am describing.  I ran Thunderbird in safe mode and determined that none of the add-ons is causing the problem.  I turned the firewall OFF and determined that firewall was not causing the problem.  I then decided to run Thunderbird in Offline mode and found that the program works normally.  Then while in Offline mode I decided to download more messages and the program asked me if I wanted to switch to the Online mode.  I said yes.  New emails were downloaded and without going back to the Offline mode I was able to work normally without any occurrence of the ""Thunderbird not responding"" problem.  I have been using this workaround for several days now.  I download a number of eamails.  I try working in Online mode and I cannot do it.  I switch to Offline and work fine.  I switch back to Online mode and I don't see the problem any longer for the whole day.  Do you have any idea as to the origin of my proble? I am running Thunderbird 115.10.2 64 bit on Windows 11. I had the problem originally using Lenovo T490s and more recenlt Lenovo X1 Yoga </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1652024;1652058;,savvides48
