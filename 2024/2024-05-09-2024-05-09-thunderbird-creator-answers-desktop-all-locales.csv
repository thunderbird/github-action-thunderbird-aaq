It was a short duration issue (a few seconds to a minute).  I reinstalled Thunderbird several times without success.  I read almost every comment available online about this problem and I tried many ideas and recommendations I found without success.  Most recently the problem became so serious that it was not a nuisance any longer.  It was nearly impossble to work waiting for minutes to open an email or to continue typing while preparing a message and being interrupted by the problem I am describing.  I ran Thunderbird in safe mode and determined that none of the add-ons is causing the problem.  I turned the firewall OFF and determined that firewall was not causing the problem.  I then decided to run Thunderbird in Offline mode and found that the program works normally.  Then while in Offline mode I decided to download more messages and the program asked me if I wanted to switch to the Online mode.  I said yes.  New emails were downloaded and without going back to the Offline mode I was able to work normally without any occurrence of the ""Thunderbird not responding"" problem.  I have been using this workaround for several days now.  I download a number of eamails.  I try working in Online mode and I cannot do it.  I switch to Offline and work fine.  I switch back to Online mode and I don't see the problem any longer for the whole day.  Do you have any idea as to the origin of my proble? I am running Thunderbird 115.10.2 64 bit on Windows 11. I had the problem originally using Lenovo T490s and more recenlt Lenovo X1 Yoga </p>",fix-problems;needsinfo;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1652024;1652058;1652074;1652092;1652094;1652097;1652098;1656392;1656395;1681618;,savvides48

Today I added a new email account, but then Thunderbird kept losing connection. I thought I'd try uninstalling and re-installing it, but now I get the message that it can't be installed on my laptop. Anyone know how I can get round this? </p>",download-and-install_1;needsinfo;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1652131;1653490;1653492;,mf6tmgxhr8

The new server name is <a href=""http://mail.mail.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mail.coop</a> the old one is <a href=""http://smtp.iomartcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iomartcloud.com</a>. Everything seems to be working ok, ie. there's the new account listed in the left-hand window with all the folders and subfolders and all the emails in the correct places, all working fine inc. send and receive. The old iomartcloud account is still there just above it with all the folders etc. but no send and receive because the service has now been closed by the server company (all my emails have been transferred to the new server. If I go to my webmail page also all is ok inc. send and receive.  I have set the new <a href=""http://mail.mail.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mail.coop</a> as the default and I've been trying to find out how to delete the iomartcloud one. </p><p>The problems I have are two: 1. I can't seem to find any way to delete the iomartcloud account from thunderbird. 2. Whenever I close and restart thunderbird it's forgotten the <a href=""http://mail.mail.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mail.coop</a> account/identity. I have to go to new account &gt; existing email (my email address hasn't changed) and put in name, password etc. It all works fine again but next time I close thunderbird...... </p><p>I know the server is ok and I know the passwords, port numbers, server addresses, etc. are ok because it all works fine each time I create the new account (for the 50th time!), so there's some other problem I haven't yet identified. I've searched on this forum and elsewhere, and hunted all around the settings menus but to no avail. </p><p>I wonder could the two things be connected? If I could delete the old account maybe it would solve the other problem. Note that both the email address, name and password are the same for both accounts, only the server address is different (and the port nubers maybe as well). And could the second problem be to do with the security settings of my browser or os? (brave browser, linux zorin os). </p><p>Sorry rather a long post! Hope someone can help me!
