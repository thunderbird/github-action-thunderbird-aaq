Though when I do it and right click received mail, select Forward as &gt; attachment (or just Forward), then the Thunderbird wrongly sets different account of mine as a sender instead of the one which received the message. </p><p>I need to always bother checking this and switching (sometimes i forget and send from a wrong accoung, which is also a privacy issue), which is annoying and I am unsure if I have misconfigured the TB or how to fix this? Thank you </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,cs,"",postcd
