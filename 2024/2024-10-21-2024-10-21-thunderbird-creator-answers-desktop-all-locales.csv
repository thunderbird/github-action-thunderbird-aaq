But these problems have become overwhelming recently.  I have latest version of Thunderbird 128.3.2esr (64 bit).  An unusual aspect of my setup is that I do not keep my Thunderbird profile on my C Drive but on another drive.  I need to keep many of my emails so I have a large Archives with the emails kept by each year. I also have a large number of emails in Local folders from a previous email software I was using. Over the last few days I deleted a large number of emails from these Archive files to try to reduce the size of them. I also deleted a lot of emails from my current Inbox (as well as moving emails from there to Archives).   But my Thunderbird has started to play up in ways I cannot understand: 1. Thunderbird has created about 10 new folders with names like Inbox-1, Inbox-2, Inbox.msf-1.compact-backup, etc. There is even a folder called Trash-1 2. Inbox-3 has one message in it which is one line of garbage - but the size of the folder is reported as 3.8GB! Inbox.msf-1.compact-backup has 1 message in it which is full of garbage and is reported as 6.1MB 3. My Deleted box got large in the process of doing the above. So I have emptied it several times. But the size of the Deleted box keep growing and has now reached 102 GB! I have compacted the Deleted Box and it does nothing.  4. Multiple copies of some of my emails are turning up in my Inbox - some as many as 6 or 7 copies. As a result the size of my Inbox keeps growing.  I tried using a Thunderbird Extension that removes duplicates but, although it correctly identified all the duplicates, it stopped functioning when I clicked OK to remove the duplicates.  5. Needless to say that Thunderbird also at times  excruciatingly slow and frequently freezes (with ""(Not responding) showing on the Thunderbird window.  6. At one stage there were 1000s of message which were dated 1/1/1970 and were blank. I think I have deleted most of those. Using Windows Task Manager, I can see that CPU and Memory usage are always blow 50%. The Disk that the Thunderbird profile is on is sometimes at 100% and sometimes at a low %. But this does not seem to correlate with what I am actually doing. For example right now as I am typing this message, it is showing 100% active time and disk transfer rate of 450kb/sec but I am not doing anything with Thunderbird and the Thunderbird Activity Manager is showing no activity. But another time I could be trying to delete or move emails and it shows a low % of active time on that disk.  I have looked through this support site and tried the following suggestion: I have put the Thunderbird profile in the exceptions section of my Antivirus software I have deleted global-messages-db.sqlite and allowed Thunderbird to rebuild indexes I have disabled all extensions as well as the extension I mention above for removing duplicates. I tried opening Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode and Windows in Safe Mode. Thunderbird operated more quickly but the problems did not resolve. Bewildering? I have been using Thunderbird for 10 years but after 6 weeks or so of problems and many frustrating hours, I am looking around for alternative email software but I don't want to go to Outlook. Does anyone have any suggestions for email software that can deal with large Archives? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1683008;1683010;1683025;1683469;1683589;1683799;1683823;1683941;1683997;1684186;,moojanmomen

I have had a strange login/security issue twice in the past two weeks. </p><p>First activity in the morning about 10 days ago I noticed Thunderbird displaying many ""Unable to get email, password incorrect messages"" stacked on top of each other.  Other native email clients on my other Apple devices were also unable to retrieve email.  I contacted the email provider and they said the account was sending spam and they had blocked the account.  They could offer no other information, such as whether the account had been hacked or password changed.  After going through their security protocols they were able to restore the account and I changed the account password, from a reasonably strong 6 random characters to very strong 16 random characters with multifactor authentication enabled.  After restarting Thunderbird, it was not possible to set the client password and get the client to function.  I restored the profile from an older backup, copied the current mail folders into it, started Thunderbird, set the email password, and it started functioning again. </p><p>Today, about ten days later, first activity in the morning again found Thunderbird in the above state with numerous stacked password incorrect messages.  However, this time email is functioning on my other devices, and I was able to login normally to my email provider's administration system.  Perhaps the timing was such that the provider had not yet detected an issue and frozen the account. </p><p>This would lead me to believe that something on my Mac or associated with Thunderbird was responsible for the issues I am having.  Multiple scans of the computer with Malewarebytes finds no viruses on the system.

But i decided to switch my mail over to proton mail using my domain. I just cannot justify the server cost for only email. So anyway in Thunderbird i had google smtp and my servers smtp so i could send mail from different accounts. when switching over to proton i went to delete my old server smtp  server info leaving only the google smtp server. Then i tried to add a new smtp server with the data protonmail provided and clicked save and it refuses to add a second smtp server. I am stumped as i tried to readd my old smtp server and it will not allow me to add that either. any ideas&nbsp;? </p>,thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1683321;1683324;1683333;1683337;1683613;1683616;,wulfman11
