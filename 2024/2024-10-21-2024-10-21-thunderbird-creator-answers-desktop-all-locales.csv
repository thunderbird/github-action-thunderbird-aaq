But these problems have become overwhelming recently.  I have latest version of Thunderbird 128.3.2esr (64 bit).  An unusual aspect of my setup is that I do not keep my Thunderbird profile on my C Drive but on another drive.  I need to keep many of my emails so I have a large Archives with the emails kept by each year. I also have a large number of emails in Local folders from a previous email software I was using. Over the last few days I deleted a large number of emails from these Archive files to try to reduce the size of them. I also deleted a lot of emails from my current Inbox (as well as moving emails from there to Archives).   But my Thunderbird has started to play up in ways I cannot understand: 1. Thunderbird has created about 10 new folders with names like Inbox-1, Inbox-2, Inbox.msf-1.compact-backup, etc. There is even a folder called Trash-1 2. Inbox-3 has one message in it which is one line of garbage - but the size of the folder is reported as 3.8GB! Inbox.msf-1.compact-backup has 1 message in it which is full of garbage and is reported as 6.1MB 3. My Deleted box got large in the process of doing the above. So I have emptied it several times. But the size of the Deleted box keep growing and has now reached 102 GB! I have compacted the Deleted Box and it does nothing.  4. Multiple copies of some of my emails are turning up in my Inbox - some as many as 6 or 7 copies. As a result the size of my Inbox keeps growing.  I tried using a Thunderbird Extension that removes duplicates but, although it correctly identified all the duplicates, it stopped functioning when I clicked OK to remove the duplicates.  5. Needless to say that Thunderbird also at times  excruciatingly slow and frequently freezes (with ""(Not responding) showing on the Thunderbird window.  6. At one stage there were 1000s of message which were dated 1/1/1970 and were blank. I think I have deleted most of those. Using Windows Task Manager, I can see that CPU and Memory usage are always blow 50%. The Disk that the Thunderbird profile is on is sometimes at 100% and sometimes at a low %. But this does not seem to correlate with what I am actually doing. For example right now as I am typing this message, it is showing 100% active time and disk transfer rate of 450kb/sec but I am not doing anything with Thunderbird and the Thunderbird Activity Manager is showing no activity. But another time I could be trying to delete or move emails and it shows a low % of active time on that disk.  I have looked through this support site and tried the following suggestion: I have put the Thunderbird profile in the exceptions section of my Antivirus software I have deleted global-messages-db.sqlite and allowed Thunderbird to rebuild indexes I have disabled all extensions as well as the extension I mention above for removing duplicates. I tried opening Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode and Windows in Safe Mode. Thunderbird operated more quickly but the problems did not resolve. Bewildering? I have been using Thunderbird for 10 years but after 6 weeks or so of problems and many frustrating hours, I am looking around for alternative email software but I don't want to go to Outlook. Does anyone have any suggestions for email software that can deal with large Archives? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",moojanmomen
