I HATE threaded messages. I'm sure there are plenty of use cases for it but I truly despise all things threaded when it comes to e-mail. Yet somehow mozilla seems to believe that it must be that absolute best thing in all the world for everyone to use. As there appears to be no way to GLOBALLY disable the use of threaded messages. By disable I mean, I don't even want to see a threaded column. I never want to see messages from any folder or new mail account even have an option for threaded. I want the entire feature to be completely removed.  While I'm sure that removal of said feature is pretty much something that isn't going to happen. It would be nice to have a way to simply not have it be used at all. I shouldn't need to go and highlight a bunch of folders or turn it off EVERY time I add a new folder.  I HATE sort by threaded because I HATE threaded messages. So why isn't there a way to just turn it off.  </p><p>So.. I'm using a DESKTOP version not a mobile version.  And NO I don't want to highlight folders.. there MUST be a way to just turn off threaded completely. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",Myth024

Ho due fonti di arrivo di posta il primo Gmail e sul web mail i messaggi sono rimasti corretti, il secondo Tiscali essendo in pop3 non contiene più i messaggi sul web mail. I problemi che ho sul mio pc riguardano le mail ricevute da entrambe le fonti. Ultimo dettagli al momento in cui abbiamo constatato il problema la versione in essere era l’ultima 128 mi pare, ma in 32 bit. Abbiamo riscaricato l’aggiornamento e questa volta nelle info appare sempre la 128 ma a 64 bit. Cosa posso fare&nbsp;?

I have used Thunderbird for over 14 years and never had this problem. I can't read my emails because the message does not display except as a full page of random letters and numbers or it opens as a blank white page. Also since August 5th, when I use the search bar to look for a particular email, the screen bogs down. If I type in Don the only letter that displays in the search bar is d. Then a wheel turns and finally the remaining letter appear in the search bar after 60-90 seconds displaying don. Then the blue wheel turns again for 60-120 seconds and finally the emails that match the search parameters appears on the screen. This has happened also since August 5th 2024. It takes way TOO long to accomplish any task with these issues.  </p><p>I scanned my computer for viruses. I cleaned my cache. I deleted all mail in trash. I call my ISP and asked for help. I ran the repair folder option 3 times.  Not all emails fail to open but a significant number will not open. I work. I need to read my emails. </p><p>Please help. My email is [edited] @swcp.com.
