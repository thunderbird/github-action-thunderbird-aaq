The error message is: </p><p>Unable to open the folder Inbox on xxx@example.com because it is in use by some other operation. Please wait for that operation to finish and then select the folder again. </p><p>There is no other process using the Inbox folder.  I have rebooted and the error message persists.  It looks to me like the more correct message would be that the Inbox or the profile is corrupted. </p><p>I see other threads asking how to restore a corrupted profile, but none of the answers are very useful.  They all see to be tips on how to restore a backup of the profile at %APPDATA%\Thunderbird\Profiles. </p><p>If I had a backup of that folder, I wouldn't need to ask how to recover a Profile after a crash. </p><p>If it helps at all, when I opened the Error Console in Thunderbird, I see the following messages: </p><p>``` Uncaught Error: Component returned failure code: 0x8055000a [nsIMsgFolder.updateFolder] </p><pre>   updateFolderAndNotifyOnLoad resource:///modules/DBViewWrapper.jsm:88    open resource:///modules/DBViewWrapper.jsm:812    _onSelect chrome://messenger/content/about3Pane.js:2578    handleEvent chrome://messenger/content/about3Pane.js:1597    &lt;anonymous&gt; chrome://messenger/content/about3Pane.js:128    read resource:///modules/LineReader.jsm:60    _actionListResponse resource:///modules/Pop3Client.jsm:1033    _onData resource:///modules/Pop3Client.jsm:356 </pre> <p>DBViewWrapper.jsm:88 </p> <dl><dd> Component returned failure code: 0x80550005 [nsIMsgFolder.msgDatabase] ext-mail.js:2555 </dd></dl> <pre>   findNewMessages chrome://messenger/content/parent/ext-mail.js:2555    onFolderIntPropertyChanged chrome://messenger/content/parent/ext-mail.js:2522    _actionHandleMessage resource:///modules/Pop3Client.jsm:1245    _actionRetrResponse resource:///modules/Pop3Client.jsm:1405    read resource:///modules/LineReader.jsm:65    _actionRetrResponse resource:///modules/Pop3Client.jsm:1371    _onData resource:///modules/Pop3Client.jsm:356    AsyncFunctionNext self-hosted:852 </pre> <dl><dd> Component returned failure code: 0x80550005 [nsIMsgFolder.msgDatabase] 4 ext-mail.js:2555 </dd></dl> <p>``` </p><p>There must be some tool that validates the Profile independently of Thunderbird. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1656909;1686869;1686871;,mark.moore2
