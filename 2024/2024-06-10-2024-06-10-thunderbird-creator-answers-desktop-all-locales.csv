Unfortunately this did not happen. Even after restarting (latest version)Thunderbird the spam mail is still in my inbox. It's a bit disappointing and unexpected.

Those emails usually call for responses to some question or issue involving all of us. </p><p>And here's my problem -- sometimes when I hit REPLY ALL, my reply goes out showing someone else in the group as the sender, not me.  That can lead to confusion, of course, as the others in the group will think my reply came from that someone else.  Anyway, I include a couple of screen shots.  And I deleted from the images any info showing my address or anyone else's.  I did leave the usernames, so that I can explain. </p><p>They are ""Fletcher Lokey"" / flokey  and ""Susan Dyment"" / sdyment.   </p><p>First one (1.jpg) shows what I see when I click REPLY ALL.  You would expect my username and address to be showing at the top, but it's Susan Dyment's name and address.  AND, at the far right end,  you see ""flokey"", which should not be associated with Susan Dyment, I would think. </p><p>Second one (2.jpg) shows what I see when I click that small ""down arrow"" at the far right end of the box.  My username and address are then seen at the top of the dropdown, circled in red.  But the entry for Susan Dyment is the one selected at the start.  When I select my info, things get straightened out.  I also have a gmail account, which is showing as the third option in the dropdown.  That's only there because it was part of the experiment I did so I could get the screenshots </p><p>So I have to be paying attention, so I can correct it if it happens. </p><p>I've hunted through my address book for any clue to why Susan's info is the one selected when REPLY ALL is called.  In fact, I'm left wondering why anyone EXCEPT me would be in that dropdown box.  And why in the world does Susan Dyment have ""flokey"" associated with it there? </p><p>I hope that's not too confusing.  And any help appreciated </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1656658;,SonOfEru

Vervolgens klik ik op <em>Opties</em> en <em>Externe inhoud in bericht tonen</em>. Dat werkt prima. Maar wanneer ik de e-mail heb opgeslagen als eml-bestand en deze dan open komt weer de gele balk met de melding. Maar wanneer ik nu klik op <em>Opties</em> en <em>Externe inhoud in bericht tonen</em>, reageert Thunderbird niet en krijg ik geen externe inhoud meer te zien. Hoe kan ik dit oplossen?
