Outlook has a secondary recycle bin that allows emails to be recovered for a specific period of times even if deleted.  (Mine is set for 30 days)  That repository is not visible in the Outlook folder view nor in TB.  But, once emails are recovered from this repository, they are then returned to their originating folder (Inbox, Sent Mail, etc...). At this point Outlook can see the messages in the correct folder. TB cannot see those messages.  And, if TB accesses the server, those emails are then deleted and they go back into the repository where they must be recovered again. </p><p>I have used a piece of software, Stellar OST viewer, that can read the local Outlook OST file.  The recovered emails are in fact found in that file.  I would expect that TB should be able to read them as well.
