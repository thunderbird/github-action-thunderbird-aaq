She has recently experienced a problem: the number of new emails downloaded (as shown in the lower left corner of the screen) doesn’t match with the number of new and unread emails listed in the Inbox (the emails shown in boldface). Something else, though I think related: In the upper left corner of the screen, on the same line as the word Inbox, is a small circle with a number inside. I think that number gives the number of unread emails in the Inbox. Her number shows 20 but the actual number (boldface) is 15. Is this a serious problem? Is it a problem at all? If so, how to fix it? Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",I_Rufus
