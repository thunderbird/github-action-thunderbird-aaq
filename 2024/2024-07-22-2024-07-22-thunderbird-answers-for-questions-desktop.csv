That has nothing to do with Thunderbird. </p><p>As for your second item,  all that is changing is the authentication methods is changing from Normal password to OAuth and the resultant OAuth key is stored in Thunderbird's password manager instead of a password.  As Thunderbird already has that capability there is no impact from the Thunderbird development side.  You just need to make the change to your outgoing settings. (note the server name has to be the appropriate office365 server name before the OAUTH option becomes available in settings.   </p><p>A restart of Thunderbird is required between changing the server name and changing the authentication method to OAuth. </p><p>As an aside,  current spam checkers and most provider submission rules man that you generally can not submit an email from say @Outlook.com from a mail transfer agent that is not described in the domains DNS.  So sending that mail from <a href=""http://MySever.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MySever.com</a> say, will see it treated as spam by most systems in the world.  Some will reject the submission,  others will refuse to accept the mail and yet others will place the mail in the SPAM folder. So what you are doing on sending is basically required and has nothing to do with your desire to hide your email address. </p><p>You double passing of mail address to address is as far as I can see basically a long winded approach to trying to defeat spam.

It is discouraged.  why would you want to do something like that anyway as there are no user updateable or really readable files in a Thunderbird profile.  Certainly nothing that could be considered a document. Any backup tool that can not be configured as to what is to be backed up is of questionable value.  It is decades since I saw anything that basic.  Cloud sync type tools like Google Drive and OneDrive are not suitable for making Thunderbird backup at all. </p><p>What backup product are you using?  It in itself can be a serious risk to dataloss in Thunderbird,  so be very careful here.  Thunderbird tends to corruption issues if files it is accessing are also being backed up at the time. If Thunderbird is running it is using it's files.   Certainly a corrupt backup will occur at the very least.  Perhaps use the back-up tool in the importExportTools addon to make a backup daily that your backup tool can read in Documents if you genuinely can not come up with a better location to backup from. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>Storage in appdata is treated differently by many intrusive things like antivirus programs and moving what is essentially a database into a documents folder will often see these applications treating the huge files like a word documents. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

With the IMAP filter, you have deleted from inbox and stored in the other folder and the filtered folder meets your objective of keeping it within the account. Moving to a local folder removes it from the online account. Those are your choices and that is not unique to Thunderbird.
