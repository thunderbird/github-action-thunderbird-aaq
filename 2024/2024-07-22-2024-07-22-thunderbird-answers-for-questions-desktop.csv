That has nothing to do with Thunderbird. </p><p>As for your second item,  all that is changing is the authentication methods is changing from Normal password to OAuth and the resultant OAuth key is stored in Thunderbird's password manager instead of a password.  As Thunderbird already has that capability there is no impact from the Thunderbird development side.  You just need to make the change to your outgoing settings.

Can Thunderbird somehow migrate these old emails? </p><p>In regard to having different email address configurations in the inbound and outbound settings it is possible and I've had this configuration setup for years not only on my PC but also on my Android email clients.  The original rationale is that you have a public email address and a private email address.  In this setup you receive emails sent to your public address and then automatically forward all email to your private email address.  What happens is that <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> actually scans all messages before they are forwarded then upon receipt the private email provider scans them a second time for spam with the end result being a very clean inbox of messages.  Most people that do this simply use the SMTP server of the private email provider when they send messages but you have to configure that private email to say the message is actually coming from the private email address.  The only problem with that technique is that if the person receiving the message examines the full message and looks at the email headers, the actual address of the private email address will be exposed.  So, if you configure the outbound SMTP server settings to use your public address then the message will only display the public address sender information.  I know it's a weird setup and probably overkill but it works.  Currently, I'm using Outlook 365 as my email client but that client does not have the capability to use OAuth2 and and I'm trying to determine if that client doesn't need it since Outlook 365 is a par of my Microsoft 365 subscription.  In the mean time I've found that Thunderbird can be setup with different inbound and outbound configurations and use OAuth2.  Hope this explains my weird setup. </p>",wchull51,false,0,0

That file keeps track of most recently downloaded mail to prevent what you are experiencing. You can check this by doing this:  - click hep&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and clicking 'open folder' - click the Mail folder and the POP account should appear - click the POP account folder and check the last modified date of popstate.dat. If it is from before your recent download, then some software is preventing it from being updated. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I'm guessing it's because a folder with that name already exists, even though I can't see it. I tried to add a new subfolder with name Test and it does let me add it and view normally. This leads me to believe the folders are somehow hidden. I've also tried Properties -&gt; Repair Folder with no luck. </p>",jkloninger,false,0,0
