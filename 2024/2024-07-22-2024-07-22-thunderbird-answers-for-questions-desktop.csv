That has nothing to do with Thunderbird. </p><p>As for your second item,  all that is changing is the authentication methods is changing from Normal password to OAuth and the resultant OAuth key is stored in Thunderbird's password manager instead of a password.  As Thunderbird already has that capability there is no impact from the Thunderbird development side.  You just need to make the change to your outgoing settings. (note the server name has to be the appropriate office365 server name before the OAUTH option becomes available in settings.   </p><p>A restart of Thunderbird is required between changing the server name and changing the authentication method to OAuth. </p><p>As an aside,  current spam checkers and most provider submission rules man that you generally can not submit an email from say @Outlook.com from a mail transfer agent that is not described in the domains DNS.  So sending that mail from <a href=""http://MySever.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MySever.com</a> say, will see it treated as spam by most systems in the world.  Some will reject the submission,  others will refuse to accept the mail and yet others will place the mail in the SPAM folder. So what you are doing on sending is basically required and has nothing to do with your desire to hide your email address. </p><p>You double passing of mail address to address is as far as I can see basically a long winded approach to trying to defeat spam.

It is discouraged.  why would you want to do something like that anyway as there are no user updateable or really readable files in a Thunderbird profile.  Certainly nothing that could be considered a document. Any backup tool that can not be configured as to what is to be backed up is of questionable value.  It is decades since I saw anything that basic.  Cloud sync type tools like Google Drive and OneDrive are not suitable for making Thunderbird backup at all. </p><p>What backup product are you using?  It in itself can be a serious risk to dataloss in Thunderbird,  so be very careful here.  Thunderbird tends to corruption issues if files it is accessing are also being backed up at the time. If Thunderbird is running it is using it's files.   Certainly a corrupt backup will occur at the very least.  Perhaps use the back-up tool in the importExportTools addon to make a backup daily that your backup tool can read in Documents if you genuinely can not come up with a better location to backup from. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>Storage in appdata is treated differently by many intrusive things like antivirus programs and moving what is essentially a database into a documents folder will often see these applications treating the huge files like a word documents. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Can Thunderbird somehow migrate these old emails? </p><p>In regard to having different email address configurations in the inbound and outbound settings it is possible and I've had this configuration setup for years not only on my PC but also on my Android email clients.  The original rationale is that you have a public email address and a private email address.  In this setup you receive emails sent to your public address and then automatically forward all email to your private email address.  What happens is that <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> actually scans all messages before they are forwarded then upon receipt the private email provider scans them a second time for spam with the end result being a very clean inbox of messages.  Most people that do this simply use the SMTP server of the private email provider when they send messages but you have to configure that private email to say the message is actually coming from the private email address.  The only problem with that technique is that if the person receiving the message examines the full message and looks at the email headers, the actual address of the private email address will be exposed.  So, if you configure the outbound SMTP server settings to use your public address then the message will only display the public address sender information.  I know it's a weird setup and probably overkill but it works.  Currently, I'm using Outlook 365 as my email client but that client does not have the capability to use OAuth2 and and I'm trying to determine if that client doesn't need it since Outlook 365 is a par of my Microsoft 365 subscription.  In the mean time I've found that Thunderbird can be setup with different inbound and outbound configurations and use OAuth2.  Hope this explains my weird setup. </p>",wchull51,false,0,0
