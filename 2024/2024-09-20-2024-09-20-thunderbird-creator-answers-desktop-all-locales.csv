Microsoft announced that to make it work with outlook all users have to make changes in settings for more security. I did all that they wrote and can receive emails on my .......@outlook.com email address, but I can't send emails due to absence of authentication setting for outgoing server. I attached screenshots FYI. Is it possible to fix this issue?  It's required to add authentication setting for outgoing server. </p><p>Regards, Leonid. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1675685;1675693;,samlost1001

I have NO IDEA how to fix this and I'm not technically very good either so need answers I can understand and do with out technical jargon I dont understand, I did ask a computer guy who does our systems but he didnt know what the problem was and had no solution for that. I am hoping you can help with it as I'm super frustrated with it, as it came on the back of another Thinderbird issue I have with security exceptions which defies being fixed.
