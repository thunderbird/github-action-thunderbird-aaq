Microsoft announced that to make it work with outlook all users have to make changes in settings for more security. I did all that they wrote and can receive emails on my .......@outlook.com email address, but I can't send emails due to absence of authentication setting for outgoing server. I attached screenshots FYI. Is it possible to fix this issue?  It's required to add authentication setting for outgoing server. </p><p>Regards, Leonid. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1675685;1675693;1675700;1675704;,samlost1001

I was using Thunderbird 115.15.0, but was instructed to run an update that would give me vers128.2.2.  After updating I was unable to view my email normally.  I was able to open any given email, but when I went to close it my entire queue of messages in my in/out boxes disappeared.                        </p><pre>Closing my client and reopening brought up my folder and all my emails again, but I kept going  through the same cycle each time I opened an email.   </pre> <p>I went through account setup and am on the screen that states ""Set Up Your Existing Email Address.""  I'm not 100% sure of my password as I don't have to enter it when accessing Thunderbird, but I tried several.  Any rate Thunderbird was able to find my server and I verified the manual configuration setting with my ISP.  When I press ""Done"" at the bottom of the page I receive an error stating ""Unable to log in at server.  Probably wrong configuration, username or password"".  I'm attaching pics of the account setup screen.  As of now I don't have the option to send/receive or even create a new email.  I could really use some help with restoring my emails, regardless of what version Of Thunderbird I need to install.  Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",trusty73

En waar zijn die nieuwe berichten dan gebleven kunnen deze nog terug gehaald worden. En hoe kan je dit voorkomen dat dit niet gebeurt met opstarten.
