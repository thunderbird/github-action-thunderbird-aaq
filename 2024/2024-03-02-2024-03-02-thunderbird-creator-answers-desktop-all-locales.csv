I am sure that previous versions (to 102/115) did this naturally but the new versions are different. </p><p>For example, in one Address Book I have created a mailing list called Regulars. Previously, all mailing lists show at the top whenever viewing the Address Book, so Regulars would be at the top followed by the first ""A"" email address. Now, the mailing lists are integrated alphabetically, so that Regulars appears down the list, amongst the ""R"" emails. </p><p>With the contact list now so excessively spread out (yes, I have tried and failed at that unfixable problem), it requires lots of scrolling and searching to find mailing lists. This is illogical, considering the purpose of mailing lists is to make it easy to select a whole group of addresses quickly. </p><p>At the moment, I have found a workaround by numbering the list (eg 1. Regulars) but I would prefer to find a way to make the lists behave as they used to. Is that possible? </p><p>(I am familiar with userchrome, at a basic level, so I would be able to insert code if necessary). </p><p>Fiona </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1640117;1640120;1640155;1640423;1640470;,pandf

DO NOT TELL ME TO REMOVE ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAM TO FIX THIS BUG IN THUNDERBIRD 2. DO NOT TELL ME WHY THE PROGRAM IS DISPLAYING THIS IDIOTIC ERROR MESSAGE, I DO NOT CARE, THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM, THAT IS NOT WHY I AM POSTING THIS QUESTION/REQUEST/BUG REPORT 3. I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER WHO CAN DOWNLOAD THE THUNDERBIRD CODE AND FIX THIS ISSUE MYSELF 4. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WHO IS NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS QUESTION/COMMENT/BUG REPORT, AND RESPOND UNDERSTANDING THE POINT THAT I AM MAKING, IS A TRUE IDIOT, A MORON </p><p>Here is the text from the same question last year, but after that people posted thousands of words telling me to uninstall anti-virus or making all sorts of other silly suggestions, NONE OF THAT MATTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING!!! </p><p>EVEN IF ALL OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING IS TRUE, AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT IS, THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM, THE PROBLEM IS THE IDIOTIC ERROR MESSAGE!! IT DISPLAYS AN IDIOTIC ERROR MESSAGE THAT THE USER IS FORCED TO CLEAR BY PRESSING ESCAPE OR OK BUTTON, BUT THERE IS NOTHING THE USER CAN DO ABOUT THE ISSUE, OTHER THAN UNINSTALLING ANTI-VIRUS APPARENTLY, BUT THE ERROR MESSAGE DOES NOT SAY THAT!!!!!!  </p><p>The idiotic error message should be silent, posted in a log perhaps, to let someone know of the matter, IF THEY ARE PROGRAMMING OR WHATEVER. BUT THE AVERAGE USER CANNOT CHANGE WHATEVER IS CAUSING THE ERROR, SO THEY SHOULD NOT BE REPEATEDLY ANNOYED WITH THIS STUPID MESSAGE.  </p><p>ORIGINAL QUESTION (EDITED) BELOW: </p><p>I have e-mail messages in 20 or more different folders, and there are five or more accounts. When using the Offline/Download Sync command, where it checks each folder and downloads all the messages, it often generates a useless popup message. If the message should say ""Thunderbird is not compatible with virus scanning programs, please remove your virus scanning program!"" then have it say that! But that is idiotic! So just MOVE ON, don't repeatedly display the idiotic message, maybe just put some notice in a log or whatever. But it is simply insane to keep displaying this idiotic message when all the end-user can do is clear it and ignore it! I say useless because there is literally zero that I can do to change anything that is apparently generating the problem that causes it to proclaim the error, except apparently uninstall anti-virus which isn't going to happen, not when Thunderbird is THE ONLY PROGRAM WHO CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO JUST MOVE ON WHEN A FILE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO IT BECAUSE SOME STUPID ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAM IS SCANNING IT, IF THAT IS EVEN THE PROBLEM.  </p><p>Apparently some other process is using a folder when the download routine attempts to use the folder, so it 'beeps' and displays the message attached below. But again, there is nothing the end user can do except be annoyed and click the OK button to close the message. </p><p>If this is needed for debug purposes or other coding programmer reasons, just put the error in a log, don't annoy the end user with a message about something over which they have zero control. </p><p>If I am still not explaining this correctly, discuss that, the display of the error IS THE PROBLEM, not whatever is going on the background, about which I have no information or concern, that is someone else's problem, maybe they need the error message, the end-user does not, it is just a useless annoying bug in the program.  </p><p>I looked into how to engage in the programming website and post the bug there, but I would appreciate very much if someone else who is familiar with that can put this bug on the programming website, it just seems bit more than I am ready to involve myself in.  </p><p>At least it would be helpful also, for someone to replay that you understand the point I am making here, the popup message IS THE PROBLEM, the bug repair is to STOP THUNDERBIRD from repeatedly displaying the useless popup message. This should be a very simple programming fix. Thank you. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1639962;,tk21

Global search string ""Re: New Project 25-301-623 needed into Swahili - word count 321"" (which does exists in Local Folders) does not produce any results but (Deleted first character of the string) ""e: New Project 25-301-623 needed into Swahili - word count 321"" produced results for ""New Project 25-301-623 needed into Swahili - word count 321"" without the results for ""Re:..."". Additionally, no filters are displayed such as Location, People, etc.  (Running the same search within the folder where it resides works fine.) Cutting down the string to only ""Re: New Project 25-301-623"" still does not find any results. Global search for string ""Payable Summary for: August 2022"", which resides in the same folder tested is found but no filter data available for Location, People, etc. However a search for ""Project delivery for Job: 25-258-813"" again residing in the same folder is found with Location, Account and People. I've tested same approach and tests on different folders to rule out Folder specific problems and behavior is the same problem. </p><p>Another example that might help in figuring things out. I tested a string of an email subject from an amazon order, which are long in nature do to # dashes, long numbers, etc. Performed a global search and the email was found but no Filters shown. Did the same search removing the end of the string ""has shipped"" and the email was found once again but with all Filters showing.  </p><p>I hope I have been thorough enough.
