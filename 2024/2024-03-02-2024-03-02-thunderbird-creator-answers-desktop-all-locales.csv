I am sure that previous versions (to 102/115) did this naturally but the new versions are different. </p><p>For example, in one Address Book I have created a mailing list called Regulars. Previously, all mailing lists show at the top whenever viewing the Address Book, so Regulars would be at the top followed by the first ""A"" email address. Now, the mailing lists are integrated alphabetically, so that Regulars appears down the list, amongst the ""R"" emails. </p><p>With the contact list now so excessively spread out (yes, I have tried and failed at that unfixable problem), it requires lots of scrolling and searching to find mailing lists. This is illogical, considering the purpose of mailing lists is to make it easy to select a whole group of addresses quickly. </p><p>At the moment, I have found a workaround by numbering the list (eg 1. Regulars) but I would prefer to find a way to make the lists behave as they used to. Is that possible? </p><p>(I am familiar with userchrome, at a basic level, so I would be able to insert code if necessary). </p><p>Fiona </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",pandf

It's at 1. Still get message. Now I can't see my Inbox mail. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and the situation just gets worse. I am so flummoxed I don't know what to do. I'm a user not a programmer. How do I just start over or should I just realize that Thunderbird is not an email program I can use and go back to my ISP's Zimbra webmail? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",w7wll

So have installed a replacement drive. The W10 install went well and installed a couple of apps such as SoftMaker Office. Then TB. Installed fine, but does not seem to work. I do have Web access to the Internet and so far all I can find that is not working is my TB. I have cut and pasted ALL login details to the account. Identical details to this PC (W11) which is working. Help, please? </p><p>It's probably going to be something stupid I've mixed.
