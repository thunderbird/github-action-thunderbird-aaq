But what can I say,  that is the standard of advice you will get from an organization that assume everything is in the cloud and we like it that way. </p><p>So open your profile folder.  That is a button in the first block of information in the troubleshooting information on the help menu.  Using this link  you will be sure to be in the folder Thunderbird thinks is oyur profile,  not one you think is it. Close Thunderbird. Now I have to guess that you used to use POP mail as otherwise your folder should have appeared when you added your new account. </p><p>navigate in the windows file manager to the mail folder.  In there you ""should"" see a single live/hotmail/msn/outlook folder.  But it is also possible you have many as one is created every time you run the new account wizard.  So it is now a matter of opening each folder and poking around looking for your folders. </p><p>If you see say inbox and inbox.msf files you have found an inbox folder.  If there is an inbox.msf folder in the file manager,  it will contain the files for any sub folders of the inbox you found.  It is a fairly simple structure,  but you have to look at the file sizes and dates to get an idea if you are in the ""right"" account folder. </p><p>Once you have determined the ""correct"" account folder you have to import the mail into Thunderbird.  I suggest you using the import export tools <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>In the import tools menu,  use the import mbox menu entry and then the option to import everything from a folder including the sdb structure.
