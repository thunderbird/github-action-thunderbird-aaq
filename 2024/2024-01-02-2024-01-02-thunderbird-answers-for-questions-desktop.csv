Some email clients promote their ability to change font and background color (and this can be done with Thunderbird with radical customization). My suggestion, before investigating any possible bug in Thunderbird, is to browse the html as it arrives. Also, if you are using an addon theme, try reverting to one of the themes that were provided in the release and disable any addons that change fonts or colors.

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

But the Trash folder doesn't work the same way.  'Empty Trash' appears to do nothing, the messages continue to show in the folder although you can no longer open one; that is, they really are gone, yet the statistics remain.  No, you have to navigate away (to any other folder) then back to Trash to see an empty folder and make the Unread Message bubble disappear.  Oh, well, maybe an update will fix this in time. </p>",Electrojim,false,0,0

On the other question, removing duplicates has not been a major user issue. However, maybe the issue just needs more visibility.

I am on linux mint victoria 21.2---i think that is ubuntu.  No idea what kde stands for, or gnome. Despite it all, i now have my two screens running correctly.  The mouse moves b/w them, nicely.  My logitech G910 keyboard does not always allow me to use the number keyboard to the right.  the keys at the top always work, but # keyboard to the right works on and off.  Num lock seems to mean nothing. And again, thank you for such a spirited answer!!!!! </p>",bullishbob,false,0,0
