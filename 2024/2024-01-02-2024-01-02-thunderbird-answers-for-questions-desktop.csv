Is the washington post even sending it? </p><p>You appear to think someone that is not you can effect change in your installation.  That is not true.  Thunderbird is software on your computer, installed and manged by you. </p><p>I have no idea what this means.

Normal people like me are not experts. You have only told me I have to pay$ again to an expert for something I did not cause. The new news comes in from old one, that's what I mean.
