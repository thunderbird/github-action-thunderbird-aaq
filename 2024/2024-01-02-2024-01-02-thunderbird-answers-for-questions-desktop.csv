Also, if you are using an addon theme, try reverting to one of the themes that were provided in the release and disable any addons that change fonts or colors.

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

You can set it up at <a href=""https://calendar.google.com/calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://calendar.google.com/calendar</a>.  - while there, you can authorize others to edit and administer the calendar - in android phone, you have easy access to the calendar - in thunderbird, click the spaces button in top left and then the calendar button and from that pane, you can add the google calendar so you can access from within Thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

However when I select export from either of two places, the only places it appears, it either only allows a zip file or an ical file.  Following the instruction link you referenced I cannot see on my version where it allow me to select a csv format.  To that I'm clueless?    </p><p>Also when I select the full export to a zip file it appears that the exported files are a database format only not readily processable. </p><p>Any other ideas? </p>",bobmct,false,0,0
