Is the washington post even sending it? </p><p>You appear to think someone that is not you can effect change in your installation.  That is not true.  Thunderbird is software on your computer, installed and manged by you. </p><p>I have no idea what this means. ""only way is to scroll way down to last known one""  what happens when you find the earlier version of the post that makes it appear?  Do you do something,  or is the new one nested under the old one. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

Normal people like me are not experts. You have only told me I have to pay$ again to an expert for something I did not cause. The new news comes in from old one, that's what I mean. Otherwise  it doesn't each day, as used to be. Any ideas on what I must do to resolve this by myself? It would be appreciated. </p>",margykr,false,0,0

No one in this forum can change anything on your computer for you.  There was a default change to threading about 6 months ago which is why I am guessing you might be talking about that,  but I am no wiser now as to what your are trying to describe when I first read your initial question. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

For example, a client sent me a message at 10 a.m. and I didn't have it until after 1 p.m., where other messages from that 10 a.m. and later normally showed me a message. And it's not a matter of one message, once it showed me a message after 3 days. </p>",klaudiademko7,false,0,0

I perfect example of this is the local folders account has no get messages on the context menu,  but in my case it receives mail for probably half a dozen mail accounts. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
