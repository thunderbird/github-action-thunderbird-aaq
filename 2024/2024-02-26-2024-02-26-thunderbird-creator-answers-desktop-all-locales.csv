The original account was weav13@roadrunner.com and then I added Weaver12@roadrunner.com.  Recently we were unable to send emails from my Weaver12@roadrunner.com.  I went into settings and changed the Default to my Weaver12@roadrunner.com and was able to send emails.  Then his email did not work.  How do I fix the settings to work for both of us.  Also, at the same time I quit getting emails sent to my iphone.  I have contacted Spectrum who administers our account and my server is <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>.  I have tried many setting changes to fix this, as well as, searching on this site.  The incoming email settings are POP.  I have seen the Port should be 993 or 995.  Not certain which is correct, but have tried both. The outgoing email settings are attached.  How do I fix this?  Also, how do I get emails on my iphone?  Hope someone can help!  Thank you. </p><p>Brenda Weaver </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1638729;,brendaweaver1620

My Thunderbird has a Menu button in the top right that's just there for it does nothing when I click or right click so I guess no add-ons, calendar, etc.  If I hover over it I see ""Display the Thunderbird Menu"" and that's it.  When I open the program it doesn't go to my inbox, it goes to a page that I have to click on ""Read Messages"" to get to my inbox and in prior versions and I had Windows 10 this never happened.  When I go to buttons on the left and click on ""Help"" and then ""About Thunderbird"" to check on updates I always get ""Unable to check for updates due to internal error"" and oh yeah now in Thunderbird I can't copy and paste, I can highlight but when I right click....nothing. </p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and even tried removing hidden folders, but as of now nothing has worked.  I don't know what to think and I'm truly at a loss and it sure looks like I have to find another email program because right now Thunderbird just ain't working.  I've been using this program I believe for over 20 years with really zero problems but my luck has apparently run out.
