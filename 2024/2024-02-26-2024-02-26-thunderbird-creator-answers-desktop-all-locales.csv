I have contacted Spectrum who administers our account and my server is <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>.

Some further observations... </p><p>I access the affected mailbox via IMAP from a mobile device, before treating TB (using POP3) as the master storage. TB then has a rolling 90day delete as part of the POP3 config, so it should only download anything new since the last synch, but maintain a 90day history. All synch attempts now, are downloading mails from mid-November and thus creating duplicates - I have manually logged into the domain mailbox and intentionally deleted the oldest 50 mails, as a test. All that happens is that the problem is shifted 50 mails up the list.. TB seems to have forgotten what is actually a new mail. </p><p>If I was able to revert TB to the previous version, I would - and am still tempted to research the mechanics of doing this. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1640303;1641061;,windows10.laptop

When I start to compose an email in thunderbird app, it will create a draft after few minutes automatically (this happens when i am drafting a long email like work email that takes 10 15 mins with breaks in between). The draft gets saved in the 'draft' section in thunderbird app and also on gmail web as well (gmail android app or gmail from <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>). When I finally send the email from thunderbird app, the draft from the thunderbird app gets removed however the draft in my gmail web REMAINS. I do see the sent mail in the 'sent' folder in both thunderbird app as well as my gmail web or android gmail app however a copy still remains in drafts in gmail app/web. This creates an issue where i have multiple drafts in my gmail which only show when i access gmail from gmail app or on web. Please help me fix this issue. For reference some info is below regarding my setting of thunderbird app on my windows 11.  The settings of the android app for drafts is set by default by the app to Kepp drafts in: other&nbsp;:Drafts in  xyz@gmail.com.
