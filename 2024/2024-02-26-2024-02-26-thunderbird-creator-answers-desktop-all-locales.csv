1440795,2024-02-25 16:16:15 -0800,2024-02-25 16:16:15 -0800,Shared emails downloaded to Thunderbird from mail.twc.com,"<p>My husband and I share an email account from TWC.  The original account was weav13@roadrunner.com and then I added Weaver12@roadrunner.com.  Recently we were unable to send emails from my Weaver12@roadrunner.com.  I went into settings and changed the Default to my Weaver12@roadrunner.com and was able to send emails.  Then his email did not work.  How do I fix the settings to work for both of us.  Also, at the same time I quit getting emails sent to my iphone.  I have contacted Spectrum who administers our account and my server is <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>.  I have tried many setting changes to fix this, as well as, searching on this site.  The incoming email settings are POP.  I have seen the Port should be 993 or 995.  Not certain which is correct, but have tried both. The outgoing email settings are attached.  How do I fix this?  Also, how do I get emails on my iphone?  Hope someone can help!  Thank you. </p><p>Brenda Weaver </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",brendaweaver1620
