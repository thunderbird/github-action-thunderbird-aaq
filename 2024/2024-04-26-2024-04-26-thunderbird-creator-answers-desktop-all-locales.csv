Now we have a problem with href links containing file URIs in our messages. We often receive file links pointing to files in our local intranet, which look like this: &lt;a href=""file://///intranet.local/dfs/output/movie.mp4"" class=""moz-txt-link-freetext"" moz-do-not-send=""true""&gt;movie.mp4&lt;/a&gt; Up to Thunterbird version 98.0b3 it was possible to open these files by simply clicking the link. But since version 99.0b1 file links don't open any more. Instead, the error console displays the following message: Security Error: Content at mailbox:///C:/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/profilename/Mail/Local%20Folders/Inbox?number=12345 may not load or link to file://///intranet.local/dfs/output/movie.mp4. Fortunately, it is possible to open the link with ""Open Link In Browser"" from the context menu. But we would like to get rid of this extra click. I already followed the steps in this document: <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work#Firefox_1.5.2C_Mozilla_1.8.2C_and_newer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work#Firefox_1.5.2C_Mozilla_1.8.2C_and_newer</a> Interestingly, this document is older than the time, when our problem was introduced into Thunderbird. Consequently, when I follow these steps, file links still don't open in an external application. Instead, they open inside of Thunderbird which is not the desired effect. To put my question in a nutshell: How can I open file links by left-clicking on them, just the way they open, when I right-click on them and select ""Open Link In Browser""? </p><p>Steps to reproduce: On a Windows computer create a new mail. Press Ctrl-K to insert a link. Enter the following path with username replaced by your windows logon name: file:///C:/Users/username/Documents Save and close the mail. Watch the mail in the drafts folder. Click the link. Nothing happens, but you can see a message in the error console. Right click the link and select ""Open Link In Browser"". This opens your windows explorer. </p><p>Any solution is welcome, even if it's potentially insecure, since our computers don't have any internet access and we can receive internal mail only. </p>",Clemens;Toad-Hall;,true,false,false,;category:privacy-and-security;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:124.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0;product:thunderbird,3,0,2,,,
