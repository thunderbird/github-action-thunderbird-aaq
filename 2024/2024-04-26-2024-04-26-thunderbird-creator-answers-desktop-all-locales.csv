Uploaded TB data as per instructions. Opened TB and put in email password etc. All my current emails show up no problems and email account appears to work but none of the uploaded data appears even though it took 15 min to upload. It feels like it was uploaded to the 'wrong' place but I uploaded the data it to the TB folder as instructed.
