By the way, the new version of the mobile email client is simply SPACE, WOW!! But the problem is precisely in the desktop version. </p><p>I really like your product. Many of my colleagues at work use it with pleasure. But there is a huge problem that brings a lot of problems. This is restoring the email client on a new PC or transferring it from one PC to another. Why, when installing your product, there is no option to choose WHERE I WANT TO STORE THE MAIL DATABASE and USER PROFILE. Usually everyone puts the D drive so that when reinstalling the system, the mail database and profile are preserved. There is no mechanism for creating a single backup file for transfer to a new PC. It would be very convenient to create one file that contains all the email files (letters, attachments, user profile), transfer it to a flash drive/disk and restore it on a new PC. </p><p>2. And the second problem. This is the lack of a mechanism for synchronizing the address book between several PCs on the same local network. This is very necessary when one department has one client base and is in correspondence with them. I installed third-party extensions, but they all work very poorly and require a single storage for this file, and often one email client simply replaces it, overwriting the data of another version of this file. </p>",IxI_JOKER_IXI;frisée;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:134.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/134.0,1,0,1,,,

Thunderbird auto-updated to V 128.5.2 from V115.18.0 on 12/17/24 (I didn’t realize auto-update was set) and since then gets hung every time a reminder comes up and I either dismiss it or snooze it.

I use Linux Mint Cinnamon 21.3 ver 6.0.4.  Just about a month ago,  I found I was not able to send emails.  I can receive emails easy, but not send on either of the 2 email accounts on my desktop computer.  When I tried to send a message I received an error telling me I didn't have permission, so I took pictures of the error messages to the local Comcast office.  They told me I needed to change my password. </p><pre>    After changing my passwords, I tried to send an email to my alternate account and received a ""sending message"" notice.  I left it in sending message for over an hour.  I closed the sending message.  Then checked all of the account settings and preferences, and changed one setting to ""normal password"", and repeated the test, I receive the same results.  Using ""Software Manager"" I uninstalled ""ThunderBird"" then re-installed ""ThunderBird"" via  the gui.  I tried the same test, and again received the same results. </pre> <pre>    I again went back to the Comcast office and reported my results, I was told that there were 2 other complaints about the same situation, I asked what their solution was and was told to just log into my Comcast Account online to send emails.  I asked them what did Comcast do that caused this problem, I was informed that they are just a sales office, I asked for a phone number for tech support and was told that they don't have a phone number to tech support. </pre> <pre>    So, it seems I am on my own to fins a solution to the situation they caused, can you help? </pre> <pre>    If there is any further information you need feel free to ask. </pre> <p>Thank you, Evan James </p>",ultrasparc;davidsk;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:133.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/133.0;solver_id:6362039,1,0,0,,,
