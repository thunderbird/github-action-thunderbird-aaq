By the way, the new version of the mobile email client is simply SPACE, WOW!! But the problem is precisely in the desktop version. </p><p>I really like your product. Many of my colleagues at work use it with pleasure. But there is a huge problem that brings a lot of problems. This is restoring the email client on a new PC or transferring it from one PC to another. Why, when installing your product, there is no option to choose WHERE I WANT TO STORE THE MAIL DATABASE and USER PROFILE. Usually everyone puts the D drive so that when reinstalling the system, the mail database and profile are preserved. There is no mechanism for creating a single backup file for transfer to a new PC. It would be very convenient to create one file that contains all the email files (letters, attachments, user profile), transfer it to a flash drive/disk and restore it on a new PC. </p><p>2. And the second problem. This is the lack of a mechanism for synchronizing the address book between several PCs on the same local network. This is very necessary when one department has one client base and is in correspondence with them. I installed third-party extensions, but they all work very poorly and require a single storage for this file, and often one email client simply replaces it, overwriting the data of another version of this file. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1697240;,IxI_JOKER_IXI

I’m using it primarily as a calendar and task management system because I like the reminder options in Thunderbird. I use local calendars. Thunderbird auto-updated to V 128.5.2 from V115.18.0 on 12/17/24 (I didn’t realize auto-update was set) and since then gets hung every time a reminder comes up and I either dismiss it or snooze it. I have to Force Quit Thunderbird to get the spinning beach ball to go away. I backup my computer weekly using Time Machine and tried restoring to 115.8.0, but was unable to restore my profile with my current calendar items on it. I got an error message saying that the new version of my profile (with my local calendars) is incompatible with Thunderbird V 115.8.0. Is there any way to get my current calendar info into an older version of Thunderbird, or better yet, create a fix so that it doesn’t get hung? If it's time for me to move to a different application for this use, just be honest.
