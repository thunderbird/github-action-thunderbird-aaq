When a calendar item pops up a notification, Thunderbird stops retrieving email until I acknowledge it.  This is a nuisance when I'm away from my machine for any length of time and I rely on Thunderbird to process incoming emails. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",anothergoodman

I was told it was incompatible with version 133.0, so I uninstalled version 133.0 and installed version 130. </p><p>Since then, Lightning Calendar has been missing, even when I reinstalled version 133.0.  The Events and Tasks tab is missing.  Calendar does not appear in Add-ons and Themes.  There is no trace of it anywhere.  I uninstalled Tbird, deleted all of the folders for it and reinstalled Tbird, again. No luck. </p>",thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,1697210;1697215;,g_bechter

Before, it was at least 5 displayed. Now it is 3 with an enlarged area for the email info. I find this very inconvenient to be able to see only 3 emails. I don't need the larger area for the email text. I can open the email and see it. Is there a way I can adjust this? Thank you, Sally </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1697203;,sbedit
