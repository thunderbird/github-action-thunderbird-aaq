There is also a short description about this feature: A Primary Password protects all your passwords, but you must enter it once per session.  </p><p>I am wondering why it protect only in that way? Why this password do not protect from reading all messages for email accounts. After all, informations included in emails are the most important value I would like to protect.  </p><p>As a user, I would really like to and wish to have a built-in feature which will protect all my emails in Mozilla Thunderbird, not only user settings and passwords.  </p><p>regards, </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",txgrgaaud

The field ""Outgoing Server (SMTP)"" shows (Default), and ordinarily it works fine, but occasionally it will use one of the other email addresses.  In reading your responses to other questions I've seen that the default address is only used when TB can't figure out which address to use.

When opening another tab or window to view another folder (Right click, ""Open in New Tab"" or ""Open in New Window""), the new tab or window opens in the new folder as it should. But so does the original tab/window! Opening further tabs and windows and switching between tabs/ windows and clicking on a new folder in any of the open tabs or windows results in all tabs and windows always being synchronized.  In other words, I cannot view two or more separate e-mail folders. They always all synchronize back to one folder. I can never have two different Thunderbird e-mail folders open at the same time! </p><p>Never had an issue like this before on other computers or earlier versions of Win/TB, including the same version of TB set up exactly the same way in Win 10 on another computer. As this is my only Win 11 machine, I cannot test it elsewhere. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a problem with Win 11? Is there a solution, TB config setting perhaps? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",YogaBookMark

The idea is that the recipient must always confirm receipt of the e-mail message and that this confirmation of receipt and reading goes to the sender of the message. If the recipient presses the button, nothing happens, i.e. receipt of the message is not confirmed. Will this functionality also work for recipients who have another email client, e.g. Microsoft Outlook or others? </p><p>Witam Jak wymusić potwierdzenie dostarczenia i przeczytania wiadomości w Mozilla Thunderbird? Chodzi o to żeby odbiorca zawsze musiał potwierdzić otrzymanie wiadomości e-mail i żeby to powierdzenie otrzymania i przeczytania trafiało do nadawcy wiadomości. Jeśli odbiorca naciks przycisk nie nic się nie dzieje tzn otrzymanie wiadomości nie jest potwierdzane. Czy ta funkcjonalność będzie działała takze dla odbiorców, którzy mają innego klienta pocztowego np Microsoft Outlook i inne? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1636947;1636948;,webmaster151
