I am wondering about the sense of this feature and why it works in so narrow range.  </p><p>Everyone who's using Mozilla Thunderbird can easily set a Primary Password in Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Passowrds &gt; check Use a Primary Password tab. There is also a short description about this feature: A Primary Password protects all your passwords, but you must enter it once per session.  </p><p>I am wondering why it protect only in that way? Why this password do not protect from reading all messages for email accounts. After all, informations included in emails are the most important value I would like to protect.  </p><p>As a user, I would really like to and wish to have a built-in feature which will protect all my emails in Mozilla Thunderbird, not only user settings and passwords.  </p><p>regards, </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",txgrgaaud
