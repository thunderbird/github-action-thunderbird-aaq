When opening another tab or window to view another folder (Right click, ""Open in New Tab"" or ""Open in New Window""), the new tab or window opens in the new folder as it should. But so does the original tab/window! Opening further tabs and windows and switching between tabs/ windows and clicking on a new folder in any of the open tabs or windows results in all tabs and windows always being synchronized.  In other words, I cannot view two or more separate e-mail folders. They always all synchronize back to one folder. I can never have two different Thunderbird e-mail folders open at the same time! </p><p>Never had an issue like this before on other computers or earlier versions of Win/TB, including the same version of TB set up exactly the same way in Win 10 on another computer.
