But so does the original tab/window! Opening further tabs and windows and switching between tabs/ windows and clicking on a new folder in any of the open tabs or windows results in all tabs and windows always being synchronized.  In other words, I cannot view two or more separate e-mail folders. They always all synchronize back to one folder.
