That is, I don't know how your accounts are not separate already. I am assuming that the restore of PC also restored Thunderbird and that it is now working. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It has put them all under my primary email.  Example: stephen.b.kent@myemail.co.uk inbox drafts saved deleted stephen.kent00@yahoo.com inbox drafts saved deleted </p><p>and so on </p><p>The issue is, for some reason I can not access each individual account settings to add a separate signature to each email account. </p><p>I would prefer to have each email account separate so that each has its own individual signature and not connected to the primary. If I click on any of the email accounts in setting and change the signature it changes the primary. </p><p>If I can not get the above issue sorted I will sadly have to remove Thunderbird and use a client that allows me to customize in the above way, which I would rather not do as I do like it. </p>",stephen_d_kent,false,0,0

And also post a screenshot from windows file explorer of the Mail and Imapmail folders in profile? You can get there by clicking Help&gt;Troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder.'  Thunderbird does as you describe. That is, allow separate accounts and separate signatures. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Try this: - click 'new message' - click the F9 key to display contact list - highlight desired addressses for BCC - click 'add to BCC'   </p><p>You should be able to also this even without pressing F9. If adding from addressbook, the address will appear highlighted . If keying addresses directly, you can place a comma after each one. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
