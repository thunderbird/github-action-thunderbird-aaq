That is, I don't know how your accounts are not separate already. I am assuming that the restore of PC also restored Thunderbird and that it is now working. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If I click on any of the email accounts in setting and change the signature it changes the primary. </p><p>If I can not get the above issue sorted I will sadly have to remove Thunderbird and use a client that allows me to customize in the above way, which I would rather not do as I do like it. </p>",stephen_d_kent,false,0,0
