My main email is at the top and is my primary - Screenshot 1 Screen shot 2 shows the Account name, name and email address, screen show three shows the second accounts name, name and email address. This is the same for all subsequent email addresses. Each setting is showing the 'Primary email' information instead of the individual accounts information.

As there is no such thing as a Thunderbird account, especially for email can you please clarify.

Messages about wrong password in the new account wizards are rarely correct and most usually relate to the actual connection being blocked,  usually by an antivirus product or it's software firewall.

Despite trying to follow along. </p><p>I think you still have you original cox account in Thunderbird and really I have no idea if you have failed new oner or not.  So perhaps we can try and get back to the original known state. </p><p>So goto Account settings.  You can get there from the right click menu in the folder pane on any acocunt.  Or the three bar application menu among far to many others. </p><p>Identify your original COX account.  Check in server settings that it shows as POP at the top and not IMAP. </p><p>Now go looking for any new failed account setups.  If you locate it,  select it in the list as I have done below with ""devilsgatedrive"" and use the account actions button at the bottom to delete it. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-04-27-21-40-13-c2137b.png""> </p><p>Now return to the original cox account and ensure the settings match these published by Yahoo,  substituting your @cox email address as appropriate. <a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN4724.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN4724.html</a> </p><p>Note that the authentication method for all Yahoo accounts is oAuth.  There are no application passwords necessary. </p><p>Note before you become cavaleir about removing all traces of an account.  Removing a pop account that showed up in the folder pane with it's own name removes that folder from the folder pane and obviously everything in the sub folders becomes inaccessible.  So removing a POP account is a fairly serious decision that requires significant data preparation so you loose nothing.  Modifying the server details however should not cause those sorts of issues as you are removing nothing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
