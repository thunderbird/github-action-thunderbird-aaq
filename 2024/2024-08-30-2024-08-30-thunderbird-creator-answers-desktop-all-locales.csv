I was impressed enough with the new UI and enhanced capabilities to make a donation to Thunderbird and I hope to continue doing so annually as a way of encouraging development of this venerable email client.   </p><p>I have two comments/questions though. First, what is (or was) the rationale for placing the Search Messages tool within the Edit menu? I think it's been located here since time immemorial and while long-time Thunderbird users know this, it still strikes me as misplaced and non intuitive. If one wants to search messages or create message filters, seems to me a better place would be under the Message menu, at least that's where a novice would intuitively go to search for it IMO. Does anyone else feel this way? </p><p>Second, in Thunderbird Supernova v. 115.14.0 (just updated to Nebula v. 128.1.1) I have been frustrated by not being able to find the location of new unread email threads when message threads are collapsed. The message thread toggle is on, but it doesn't change color or provide any visual indicator when a new message appears in that thread. This makes it hard to figure out the location of new messages when there are many  threaded messages. Am I overlooking something in the UI or is this not a current feature?   </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1671836;1671894;,waltersrobt
