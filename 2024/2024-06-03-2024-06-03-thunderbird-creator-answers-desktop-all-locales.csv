When I installed this latest upgrade my email was totally screwed up. I lost my address book and everything else. Support finally gave up I guess because they quit replying to my posts. I have been just using GMail as my email host. I think I would like to try to be able to use Thunderbird again but, I assume it would require a totally new install and I have no idea where to start.
