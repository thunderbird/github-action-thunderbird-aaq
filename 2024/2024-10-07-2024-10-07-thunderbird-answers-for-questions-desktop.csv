What may not be understood is that TB is increasingly used professionally. It is time to hire professional software integration and publication staff, pay them from revenue, and to create a professional users guide.  Not Wiki, it is helpful, mostly outdated, and not the solution. I am not a software expert rather a long time software user. I was born before WW II, I am among the first Osborne computer users. TB has so much potential!  </p><p>I have used TB since its origin and now use TB V 128.3.3 64 bit.

However, after recently completing a printed paper manual for use by our students by printing all the instructions contained within V128, Wiki, and other reliable sources including TB user contributions we find our heads exploding. As only one example: ""Reset Your Mozilla Account Password With Recovery Keys."" The latest instructions are dated Nov 11, 2024 and useless.
