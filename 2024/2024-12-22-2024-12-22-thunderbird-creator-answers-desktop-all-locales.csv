My only experience using an email client was with Outlook.   Question 1:  When I click on ""+ New Mail"" the ""Write: (no subject) - Thunderbird"" email form pops up as it should.  However, the content area of the form is filled with question marks, symbols and letters.  I've never seen anything like that and would like to know what it is and what change to make so it doesn't appear each time I want to send an email. Question 2:  I set up an email signature in Account Settings.  I chose the ""Attach the signature from a file"" and it seems to have completed successfully.  However, I don't understand how to actually have the signature appear in my email.  I don't see any option in the email to have the signature appear.  How do I do that? Thanks. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1696601;,sharic1029

Gmail is set up to delete after forward as I rarely monitor the Gmail address. </p><p>However, because Gmail has deleted that email after forward  it appears in the Gmail bin. I do not want to regularly have to check the Gmail bin to delete. It may be a setting in my client, which is Thunderbird.  </p><p>Is there a Thunderbird setting that will resolve this? </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Steve </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",OzSteveC
