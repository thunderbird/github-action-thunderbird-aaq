Az egyik mail címemnél van egy mappa, amelybe egy bizonyos mail címről írt és onnan kapott levelek kerülnek immár sok éve. Egyik nap a mappa üressé vált, egyetlen levél sincs benne. Ellenőriztem az intézőben (fájlkezelő) is és a tmp és cur mappák is üresek. Futtattam undelete programot, de nem talált semmit. Ha a Thunderbird keresőjébe megadom az email címet akkor kijelez 292 levelet, de ha rájuk kattintok, akkor azt írja ""Nem található üzenet"".  Kétségbe vagyok esve, mert egyrészt nem érzem biztonságban a több ezer levelemet (hisz akkor ez bármelyik mappámmal megeshet), másrészt szükségem van az eltűnt levelekben található információkra. Kérem segítségüket. Tisztelettel: Honti György </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,hu,"",honti

All accounts and messages moved over with no problem.  New laptop is Dell Precision i9 ultra with 2tb ssd + 1 tb ssd secondary, 64gb ram running under Win 11 Pro.  I have 5 accounts mostly gmail and hotmail with about 18gb of emails (including attachments).  Ran fine with older laptop running Win 10 even with cad, tbird and streaming video at the same time. </p><p>Tbird is slow running by itself but if I open Rhinoceros 3D cad program, then open Tbird to read an email it becomes really slow, lag, stutter and affects performance of entire system.  Tried numerous fixes and rebuilding index helped quite a bit, but when I use my main program (Rhino 3D) then use tbird it still slows dramatically. </p><p>Any ideas appreciated&nbsp;:-) </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;tb128slow;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1688523;,spcoachlou
