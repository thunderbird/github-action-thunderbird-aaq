It is a complete waste of time as true spammers do not use their own email addresses so any filtering relying on the sending address is doomed from the start. </p><p>You might use a filter to block mail from an ex partner.  But beyond blocking mail from individuals anything address based is a non starter as far as I am concerned. </p><p>Most internet sites set out to make money,  so if they offer you something ""for free"" the currency is your data and often your privacy.  Google harvest your data and sell advertising against it.  Same sort of thing for most free mail providers.  Facebook pushes advertising into your feed  but unlike the mail providers is not so coy about handing your data to third party ""affiliates"" (read marketers).  Other sites simply sell your email address as someone interested in whatever topics you are subscribed to in their site.  SO you join some site somewhere to talk about woodworking.  Suddenly your email is full of offers to sell you woodworking machines because your name has been added to a commercial list. </p><p>Others around me sign up for lotteries,  or""draws"" where one customer gets a free been bag or such.  Those folk have a terrible time, generally the entry legal page covers using your email address to send marketing information,  sometime sent by the company running the promotion,  and sometime for anyone they choose to sell your address to. </p><p>My observation is marked increases in spam are generally associated with entering ""free"" competitions.  Not necessarily online.  Something at the mall is often more likely to get you a passel of unwanted garbage mail that something you do online.  It used to be those things clogged your mailbox with paper,  not they clog your email inbox instead. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
