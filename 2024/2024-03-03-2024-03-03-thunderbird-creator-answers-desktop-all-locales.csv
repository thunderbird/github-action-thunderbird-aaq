A tratti viene scaricata parte dei messaggi più vecchi, a partire dalla data del blocco dei nuovi messaggi, a gruppi di 20/30 per volta. Facendo un refresh dello scarico appare il messaggio precedente. Nelle scorse settimane era successo lo stesso problema che si era poi risolto spontaneamente dopo un riavvio.

So I set up filters to separate the ""definitely spam"" from ""possibly spam"". I've been doing this for many years now. But recently, maybe for the past few months, I'm finding that these blacklist filters aren't working anymore. The filtering failure seems to be getting worse as time goes on. And, yes, I do a match on ""any"", but that still doesn't work. As I said above, my filtering rules used to work just fine, but possibly a new Thunderbird update several months ago broke filtering? </p><p>Also, is there a way for filtering on the message content URL?

I resubscribed all of the folders, but they keep unsubscribing - that is, the subscribe process isn't holding and the folders it retains seem random. All the mail and folders on <a href=""http://iCloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">iCloud.com</a> are intact, but TB will show them (some or most of them) briefly, then unsubscribe all but a few. I've tried deleting the account entirely (including data in Thunderbird folder) and re-adding - the problem persists. I've been bale to solve this one.
