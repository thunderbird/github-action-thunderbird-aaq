So I set up filters to separate the ""definitely spam"" from ""possibly spam"". I've been doing this for many years now.

And, yes, I do a match on ""any"", but that still doesn't work. As I said above, my filtering rules used to work just fine, but possibly a new Thunderbird update several months ago broke filtering? </p><p>Also, is there a way for filtering on the message content URL?
