However, I obviously have exactly the same OS and other settings between 115 and rolling back to 102, which instantly and completely fixed the problem, so on a differential diagnosis basis, I'd say it was highly unlikely to be anything outside TB. Mine is not a case of TB being generally slow, it's a highly specific use of TB in terms of displaying the selected message content. Such a major update as 115 has probably changed the way in which a mail folder is indexed or parsed resulting in a clear folder-size-related delay whilst it's working hard to do something, and raising the CPU.   </p><p>Obviously, TB 115 may interact with the OS etc differently causing this, so I will look at those troubleshooting items in due course. </p><p>I did see somewhere that over time TB has used two different folder/file/mail structures and wondered what these were, how to recognise them, and I can see if the problem exists on both types of structure.

(You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match.

I have 3 POP email accounts, two are Yahoo and one GMX.  The Yahoo accounts work OK.   The GMX account will send email but when I hit Get Messages, it only checks and receives messages from the Yahoo accounts.    If I wait for the default automatic checking of GMX that occurs every ten minutes, it will download the messages OK.  It is a real pain when you need to get a message right away. </p>",opusnz,false,1,0

My guess is that is what everyone having a party on this thread has suffered from. </p><p>That goes especially for you @Ken as sudden resumption when the antivirus get a call from home advising the new version is Ok is normal.  Unfortunately  it is sometimes weeks after the actual release that these sorts of issues can occur on continuing updates,  so I don't know how these folk at the antivirus companies work it.  But I am thinking your copy of their product has to send a query about a new version and get an Ok back.  But I am guessing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
