If you delete the file, Thunderbird will recreate it, but will do one more full download in doing so.

That is one of its key strenghts, not available from other email clients.

The 'good news' is that sending plain text where there were no intended style changes still reach the recipient, allowing the recipient to display text in their preferred font and size, not that of the sender. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
