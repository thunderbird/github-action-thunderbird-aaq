I did have #abContactsPanel in some of my css, but it always seemed to be acting on the headings and not the place where the contacts are. </p><p>Anyway, after a very looong session removing and replacing, with no success, I did a Safe Mode open and that worked! So I tested my addons (only have a few) and they didn't affect it, so I was back to the css code again. I removed everything related to the composition window (as you suggested) which was essentially everything below the basic first few commands. That worked. I gradually add them back one at a time, testing each, until I reached this: </p><p>/* 6. Contacts - Side panel */ </p><pre> #abContactsPanel,  #contactsSidebar .sidebar-header {   color:            black&nbsp;!important;   height:		12px&nbsp;!important;   padding-block:	1px&nbsp;!important;  </pre> <p>} </p><p>This was part of a package of commands to change the appearance of the composition window, published in Elevenforum: Thunderbird 115: CSS Customization. I am being specific for the benefit of anyone with the same problem. I went back to that forum and realised that these commands were designed to change the colours, and that I had used it and altered it, thinking I could get the right effect (condensing the Contacts list) by fiddling with it. No luck with that, and I tested it again today by changing the values, but no difference. </p><p>The final result is: that code is faulty (because of my alterations) and causes the contacts panel to shrink to one contact only, and does nothing to fix the spacing of the Contacts list, which I now know is unfixable. </p><p>Thank you for your guidance. At least I have the whole panel back now, even if it is too spaced with silly little faces wasting space. </p>",pandf,false,0,0

I have already been using that combined with the Layout number in the Config editor, but that is a global setting. The dislike I have is specifically for the Contacts sidebar when composing an email. The names are excessively spaced, and have little head icons beside that I suspect prevent condensing the list at all, and serve no purpose at all. I prefer an unadorned list. </p><p>To be honest, I find the composing window and Address Books the most frustrating features of Thunderbird since updating from v102.

However, I obviously have exactly the same OS and other settings between 115 and rolling back to 102, which instantly and completely fixed the problem, so on a differential diagnosis basis, I'd say it was highly unlikely to be anything outside TB. Mine is not a case of TB being generally slow, it's a highly specific use of TB in terms of displaying the selected message content. Such a major update as 115 has probably changed the way in which a mail folder is indexed or parsed resulting in a clear folder-size-related delay whilst it's working hard to do something, and raising the CPU.   </p><p>Obviously, TB 115 may interact with the OS etc differently causing this, so I will look at those troubleshooting items in due course. </p><p>I did see somewhere that over time TB has used two different folder/file/mail structures and wondered what these were, how to recognise them, and I can see if the problem exists on both types of structure.
