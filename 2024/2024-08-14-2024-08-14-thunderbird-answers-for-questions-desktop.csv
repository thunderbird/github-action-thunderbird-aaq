I found it in 2 places: </p><p>1) As a calendar account, though this account was NOT shown in the list of calendars on the left side of the ""Calendars"" tab. I think I did a decent job of deleting the various entries relating to the zombie, including the metaentries consisting of GUIDs and such of entries. </p><p>2) As an SMTP server, though this account was NOT shown in the list of SMTP servers in the ""Account Settings"" tab. Again, more tedious deletion of entries and searching for and deleting metadata in metaentries. </p><p>The fact that a deleted account was still being used, as evidenced by the regular popup of the OAuth prompt, yet was NOT shown in the main interfaces which purport to shows accounts, is ... an unexpected feature. Not a highly-rated one. </p><p>The zombie account is overdue for popping up another OAuth prompt, so there is hope that grunging about in ""Config Editor"", plus the holy water I sprinkled in the offering slot at the top of my server case, seems to have finally laid it to rest. </p>",retardude,false,0,0

A similar issue is with MS accounts prompting for a password as if the authentication is 'normal password', when all accounts have been switched to OAuth2. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,1
