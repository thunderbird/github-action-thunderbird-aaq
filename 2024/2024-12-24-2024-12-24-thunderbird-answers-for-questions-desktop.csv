So I think the shutdown is not occurring so you get a crash when you attempt to revive it. </p><p>Perhaps check the task manager to see if Thunderbird is already running ( as a process, not necessarily as an application) before you attempt to start it and confirm. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is certainly not a supported build. </p><p>I have both the release and the daily builds installed and Alt+3 opens a calendar tab in both the versions I have installed.
