And I still don't have a solution.  That's why would be grateful if someone could make me smarter, i beliewe there are solutions that i don't know of </p><p><a href=""http://1.st"" rel=""nofollow"">1.st</a> problem: You send email that is important, then wait for reply. It never comes. You forget about this. Matter stays unresolved. Receiving/Reading confirmations are like opposite of this and they don't help.  There should be something like add checkbox ""Expecting a reply in a 1 or 3 days"" And if reply does not come, email client would show this email discussion in a list and notification also so you could call or send again. Automatically take off checkbox if receiver will reply no there is not just massive amount of extra work. Is there a solution for this? </p><p><a href=""http://2.st"" rel=""nofollow"">2.st</a> problem: 2 or 3 persons will read the same inbox. There should be labels ""a doing"" ""done"" ""waiting"" that goes into IMAP so that other people using that IMAP inbox would also get updated tags of who is caring of the matter and what's it's situation is. Available tags  and their colours should also be synched between each client. Yes I'm using labels, but are they imap or just local?  </p><p><a href=""http://3.st"" rel=""nofollow"">3.st</a> problem: sometimes need to add a note to email, for myself. This is really nicely already solved in tb with Xnote.
