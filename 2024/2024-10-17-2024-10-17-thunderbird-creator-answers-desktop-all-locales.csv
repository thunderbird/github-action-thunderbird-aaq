Once I received that message, I could no longer open Thunderbird.  I uninstalled it and then went to download the newest version again - and each time I tried to download it, the download failed.  I downloaded it on another computer and reinstalled it on my main computer, with all working fine.  Then in the last few days I have been asked to download an update each time I opened my account.  Knowing what was going to happen, I said 'no'.  But after a few days, I received another error message about there being a problem with my account - so I agreed to the update and received the same error message again.  I have NEVER had problems with Thunderbird before.  I don't know if the problem is with Thunderbird or some other conflict on my computer as I have recently changed my security software because I have been using Kaspersky. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1682219;1682229;1682241;,ambednarczyk

I have set the column headers differently. But fixing them does not work. There is no button for that either. When I move an email to another folder, it takes the column header setting with it, often the default. Also when you create a new folder it gets the default ""Toggel Message Thread"", which is exactly what I don't want. There must be a setting somewhere that allows you to set and fix a different order of the column headers by default. In this forum ""extensions.set-default-columns@clear-code.com.order"" was recommended somewhere. But it is no longer available. After a lot of searching I still haven't found the solution.

With both WLM and now TB, I like having my Inbox arranged in reverse date order with a Message Pane on the bottom half of the screen that displays the contents of a selected message.  The difference is that with WLM, the system would automatically default to my Inbox and select the top (most recent message) whenever I started the program or switched from newsgroup display to emails, showing the contents of the top message in the Preview Pane.  With TB, I can get it to default to the Inbox, but it doesn't automatically select the first message.
