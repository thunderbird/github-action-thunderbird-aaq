I have set the column headers differently. But fixing them does not work. There is no button for that either. When I move an email to another folder, it takes the column header setting with it, often the default. Also when you create a new folder it gets the default ""Toggel Message Thread"", which is exactly what I don't want. There must be a setting somewhere that allows you to set and fix a different order of the column headers by default. In this forum ""extensions.set-default-columns@clear-code.com.order"" was recommended somewhere. But it is no longer available. After a lot of searching I still haven't found the solution.

With both WLM and now TB, I like having my Inbox arranged in reverse date order with a Message Pane on the bottom half of the screen that displays the contents of a selected message.  The difference is that with WLM, the system would automatically default to my Inbox and select the top (most recent message) whenever I started the program or switched from newsgroup display to emails, showing the contents of the top message in the Preview Pane.  With TB, I can get it to default to the Inbox, but it doesn't automatically select the first message.  Instead, it shows me the list of messages on the top half of the display but the message pane contents are empty until I manually select the top message. </p><p>I did a quick search and found an Add-on to Auto-Select Latest Message, which sounds like exactly what I need, but it says it's only good for versions through 104, and I am at 115 something. </p><p>Is there a current way of achieving what I am trying to do?
