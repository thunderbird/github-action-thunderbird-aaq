I created an Supernova IMAP account connected with my Gmail account.  It was orders of magnitude easier than using Outlook. </p><p>I need to copy a folder hierarchy of Thunderbird emails form 2 decades ago into my Gmail account.  They take the form of associated *.msf files and, for each, either an extensionless MBOX file or a *.sbd subfolder with the same filename stem as the *.msf file.  Copying these into Supernova's Windows folder for its ""Local Folders email folder did the trick.  I can see the old folder hierarchy and the messages therein.  See Note [1] below. </p><p>I tried to Ctrl+Drag the folder tree into the Gmail account, which causes some of the folder tree to be created, but none of the messages.  I tried copying the swath of messages for each folder at a time, but nothing happens.  I even tried copying an individual message, but no luck </p><p>I assumed that this is because the Gmail tagging system is not compatible with idea of *nested* folders.  So instead, I created *one* folder with the same name as *one* of the old Thunderbird message folders.  I then tried Ctrl+Drag'ing the swath of messages in that old Thunderbird folder into the corresponding Gmail folder -- nothing happened. </p><p>I even tried dragging *one* message from the old Thunderbird folder into the Gmail folder.  Again, nothing happened. </p><p>How can I copy folders in Supernova's ""Local Folders"" into my Gmail account?  Alternatively, if I set up a corresponding folder in the Gmail account, only 1 level deep to be compatible with its tagging system, how can I copy swaths of messages from a Supernova ""Local Folders"" folder into the Gmail folder?  Failing that, is it possible to copy one message at a time? </p><p><strong>Notes</strong> <strong>[1]</strong> This is posted at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1440091"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1440091</a>.

I copied messages from that inbox to a local folder and then deleted the account.  Then I deleted a calendar connection for that account, and finally the outgoing server for that account.  I can't think of anything else, but it continues to prompt to enter credentials for that e-mail address.  When I deleted the account there were two options.  One was something like ""delete everything"" and the other was akin to ""leave some stuff"".  I don't remember the details but I chose the latter figuring it might goof up the local folder copy otherwise. </p><p>The school must have used google, since the prompt is coming from <a href=""http://googleapis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">googleapis.com</a>. </p><p>Any ideas on how it still knows about that old account? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",don.woods24
