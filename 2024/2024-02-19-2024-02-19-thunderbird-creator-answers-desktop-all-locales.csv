I created an Supernova IMAP account connected with my Gmail account.  It was orders of magnitude easier than using Outlook. </p><p>I need to copy a folder hierarchy of Thunderbird emails form 2 decades ago into my Gmail account.  They take the form of associated *.msf files and, for each, either an extensionless MBOX file or a *.sbd subfolder with the same filename stem as the *.msf file.  Copying these into Supernova's Windows folder for its ""Local Folders email folder did the trick.  I can see the old folder hierarchy and the messages therein.  See Note [1] below. </p><p>I tried to Ctrl+Drag the folder tree into the Gmail account, which causes some of the folder tree to be created, but none of the messages.  I tried copying the swath of messages for each folder at a time, but nothing happens.  I even tried copying an individual message, but no luck </p><p>I assumed that this is because the Gmail tagging system is not compatible with idea of *nested* folders.  So instead, I created *one* folder with the same name as *one* of the old Thunderbird message folders.  I then tried Ctrl+Drag'ing the swath of messages in that old Thunderbird folder into the corresponding Gmail folder -- nothing happened. </p><p>I even tried dragging *one* message from the old Thunderbird folder into the Gmail folder.  Again, nothing happened. </p><p>How can I copy folders in Supernova's ""Local Folders"" into my Gmail account?  Alternatively, if I set up a corresponding folder in the Gmail account, only 1 level deep to be compatible with its tagging system, how can I copy swaths of messages from a Supernova ""Local Folders"" folder into the Gmail folder?  Failing that, is it possible to copy one message at a time? </p><p><strong>Notes</strong> <strong>[1]</strong> This is posted at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1440091"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1440091</a>.

Surely we can all have a say if we want a feature to remain? Last year I noticed sometime that I could no longer click a dropdown and check for messages on just 1 of the accounts I hold. I am not forced to check all of them which is time consuming and can be off putting when I am just looking for one email. Especially when so many companies now ask us to check an email for 2FA. That single change has impacted the way I use Thunderbird and how effective it is for me. If developers are not prepared to give back features we want, then at least offer us the ability to revert back to older versions.  I've turned off updating now and won't update Thunderbird again as I am too worried I will lose more features that I use daily. I am happy to accept a 'security risk', and not get 'feature updates' that I neither asked for nor even know what they are.  If 'kindness is at the heart of this community', then show some kindness and someone explain how to revert back to a previous version without losing all of my messages, filters etc?
