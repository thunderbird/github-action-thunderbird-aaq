I have 2 email accounts, both of which are IMAP Mail Servers. This has been the case for many years now. It's only in the last few months that deleting emails from my phone hasn't deleted them from the laptop. Nothing has changed as far as I know. Maybe there's been a recent Mozilla update (which I probably will have applied). ðŸ¤” </p>",hallbrian5745,false,0,0

I've tried single and multiple deletions on the phone and they all delete from the main pc/laptop.  It's a bit of a mystery but, on the principle of - if it ain't broke don't fix it - I'm going to post it as solved. Thanks again for your prompt.  Regards  Brian </p>",hallbrian5745,false,0,0

Sometimes, compacting fails and leaves detritus that can be readily removed. I make that request because my inference is that the large disk usage is due to the accounts, </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
