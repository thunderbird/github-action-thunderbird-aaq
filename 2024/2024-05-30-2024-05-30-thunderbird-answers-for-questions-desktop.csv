I have 2 email accounts, both of which are IMAP Mail Servers. This has been the case for many years now. It's only in the last few months that deleting emails from my phone hasn't deleted them from the laptop. Nothing has changed as far as I know. Maybe there's been a recent Mozilla update (which I probably will have applied). ü§î </p>",hallbrian5745,false,0,0
