I have never used an app with this many convoluted (Profile) issues!  In brief, I have MULTIPLE legacy TB Profiles (let's just say 10 and let's call them Profile A, B, C...) representing about 700gb of old emails with MANY dupes LOCKED in various weirdly named profiles.  I'm TRYING to MERGE ALL Profiles / data / EML's / emails into my LOCAL Folder (which is Profile A) WHILE keeping ALL ACTIVE Imap email accounts (gmail) open (alone) which is in Profile B.  Problems - 1.  When I start profile manager the oddly named profiles do NOT match the ACTUAL file name in finder (I'm on a mac).  2.  Somehow I ALSO have differently named Profiles in CACHE which adds a level of NEW confusion.  3.  I can SEE data in my profiles yet some do NOT show when I open some profiles and others profiles seem to show all data.  4.  When I TRY to use the IMPORT function of the Import / export Add-on - I get ALL kinds of weird results NOT worth explaining.  5.  I TRIED MacUncle TB Converter app BUT I found MANY bugs (dates didn't convert, weird characters, embedded images didn't convert and were blank boxes).  I've spent countless hours TRYING to MERGE Multiple profiles / run dupes and FINALLY have many (but not all) legacy emails in Local Folders (Profile A) with many ACTIVE emails in my Imap accounts (Profile B).  The Imap side = OK.  I cannot finish the data / profile merger project b/c every time I TRY to open Profile A, B, C, D - I'm UNABLE to merge the emails for a HOST of tech issues.  My GUESS is it's best to entirely STOP playing with the convoluted and broken TB profile MESS and to instead MANUALLY EXTRACT emails from Profile C, D, E...(as A and B are OK) and import / drag and drop / copy them into my Local Folders and organize manually.  Obviously this is easier said than done.  Questions - 1.  OTHER than MacUncle TB Converter and it's affiliates (there are several apps which are really the same program) *** what is the BEST third party TB app to ACCURATELY extract EMLs WITHOUT ERRORS from TB PROFILES? **** Please do NOT suggest an app you've not actually used.  2.  Are there ANY EASY alternatives to accomplish my goal of merging profiles (OTHER than the Import profiles options in Import / Export tools as this just gives me crap results?) 3.  Is there any TB Profile merger app or program?  </p><pre>(I'm sensing not)?  Boy does Mozilla need to fix the ENTIRE PROFILE MESS they've created.  I've never been more confused in my life on ANY project and I'm very techie and an Ivy grad who has half a brain.  Any help would be greatly appreciated as I believe my frustration is shared my many others who are in the same mess with many old legacy profiles and who are also confused on how best to merge and clean up their data.

Some months ago I installed Thunderbird and imported the outlook and live addresses, a G-mail account and my TV supplier's propitiatory email address. All worked fine for several months. Yesterday Thunderbird would not allow the 2 Microsoft to open asking for passwords. I put in the passwords but was still blocked. All of the email accounts work fine on their own but will not work in Thunderbird. </p><p>Any suggestions, Garry </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1633296;1633470;,suegarry100

I believe Microsoft has recently changed something in their security, when I went to hotmail website to make sure it wasn't the hotmail account causing this, it made me update some security stuff. I am connecting using IMAP and have double checked all ports and server names.
