After doing a general search, I found the e-mails in the search results. Then, I clicked ""open in conversation"" and they were all there and labeled with ""Inbox"" or ""Sent"" folder, respectively.  So I right-clicked and selected, ""open in containing folder"", but it didn't work! The ""containing folder"" opened [i.e., the Inbox], but didn't show the e-mail!  So then I searched manually by scrolling in the Inbox to the date of the ""hidden"" e-mail -- yet it wasn't there!  </p><p>(In other words, when I did ""open in conversation"" from the search results, it showed the conversation, but I can't actually see the e-mails in their containing folder!)
