I suggest this:  - if there are six accounts, verify that there are six SMTP server settings.  - for each one, place the email address in Description field for identification only. - for each one, go to account pane and verify the Outgoing server (bottom line) shows the email address of the account. Since each SMTP server has unique identification, this should confirm the proper connection, </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I don't know what I'm missing!? </p><p>I'm using Abc@cox.net as an example since I get enough spam mail as it is - don't want my e-mail out there even more, obv. </p><p>This last attempt, I tried naming each account a different name, so I chose ""SMTP 1"" ""SMTP 2"" etc. </p><p>These 4 screenshots should show what I'm doing wrong, if anything. </p>",ceeveekay,false,0,0

It shows several POP accounts as SMTP servers. Do you have each SMTP server edited with the appropriate SMTP settings for Yahoo with the proper email address? Your response indicated that you can set each separately. My suggestion: - update all the SMTP servers, such as SMTP-1, SMTP-2, etc.  - do a screenprint of the pane that lists the SMTP servers  - do a screenshot of two SMTP server setups - let them show full email ids  - do screenshot of two account panes that each identify with one of those panes, showing full email id  - send to me at davidthunderbird at gmx dot com  and I will attempt to help figure this out. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
