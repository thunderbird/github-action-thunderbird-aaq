I suggest this:  - if there are six accounts, verify that there are six SMTP server settings.  - for each one, place the email address in Description field for identification only. - for each one, go to account pane and verify the Outgoing server (bottom line) shows the email address of the account. Since each SMTP server has unique identification, this should confirm the proper connection, </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It shows several POP accounts as SMTP servers. Do you have each SMTP server edited with the appropriate SMTP settings for Yahoo with the proper email address? Your response indicated that you can set each separately. My suggestion: - update all the SMTP servers, such as SMTP-1, SMTP-2, etc.  - do a screenprint of the pane that lists the SMTP servers  - do a screenshot of two SMTP server setups - let them show full email ids  - do screenshot of two account panes that each identify with one of those panes, showing full email id  - send to me at davidthunderbird at gmx dot com  and I will attempt to help figure this out. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It's like sitting in the back seat of a car that is stopped for speeding. It's the person driving that's ticketed, not the passenger in the back seat. So, you need to delve deeper into this. It may be that you are blacklisted for content you send, or blacklisted for your account sharing an IP address with someone else who is. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

And I figured Thunderbird would not work if the IP Address is blocked.  So been checking with my VPN service as well as Comcast.  Waiting for a reply from Comcast but I have a hunch I will need a dedicated IP Address which I hope will solve the problem </p>,mbouman2,false,0,0

What you are requesting is a mailing list. Having worked with mailing lists and email clients, what you need is a real mailing list. One where I had good success is Mailchimp - and it's even free if mailing list isn't big. Short of that, you could set up a basic web host and domain for a small annual fee, as many web hosting companies offer a free mailing list product as one of their services. I seriously doubt that the decision makers for Thunderbird would even consider development of mailing list functions for a free product. But that's just my thoughts...&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
