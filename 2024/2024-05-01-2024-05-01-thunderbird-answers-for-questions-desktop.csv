I suggest this:  - if there are six accounts, verify that there are six SMTP server settings.  - for each one, place the email address in Description field for identification only. - for each one, go to account pane and verify the Outgoing server (bottom line) shows the email address of the account. Since each SMTP server has unique identification, this should confirm the proper connection, </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
