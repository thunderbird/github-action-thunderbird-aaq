(apparently one wasn't downloaded with the application). How do I set it up?, now it opens when I send an email but all buttons are empty.

So I am confused. Thank you and David for your support. The last few weeks have been challenging for me on many fronts.

At this point the saved draft should get deleted from the Drafts folder and the copy of sent email is then put in the 'Sent' folder. </p><p>The image of email you are posting does not look like a draft. It looks like a normal received email from 'Cleverbridge' and therefore should be in the 'Inbox' or another folder you created for the purpose of storing the email. That folder you created should not be a subfolder to Drafts. 'Drafts' is only and specifically for new emails or replies to received email located in Inbox which you are in the process of creating. </p><p>The 'From' address of that email which you received and you have put into the 'Drafts' folder will be the email address of whomever sent you the email in the first place eg: Cleverbridge email address.

You've seen this problem on and off since 2019.  </p><p>It rather depends upon how you opened those emails stored in Drafts. Selecting to read an email in Message Pane would not display the issue. So if you were doing this most of the time, you would not be aware of any issue. Selecting to 'reply' or forward may not display the error because the From is auto placed in the TO field. Selecting to 'Edit' if it was from one of your mail account addresses to another mail account address will not show the problem. </p><p>Selecting to Edit will display the yellow banner if From was not you nor any mail account or identity email address in Thunderbird. This is not new and has been the standard in Thunderbird for years - why - because you cannot 'Edit' and send using the same identical From data when that email address is not one of yours. </p><p>Hence this why you sometimes see the error and not on other occasions. That error is letting you know the FROM was not one of your mail accounts - it's not an email you were composing - it's not a draft - so Thunderbird has replaced it with one of your mail account email addresses. </p><p>Bottom line is use&nbsp;: the Drafts folder for Drafts of emails you are creating but yet to send. The Templates folder for reusable emails that you want to send which tend to have same/similar composition. Use the Trash for unwanted emails. Create folders with suitable names to store wanted emails in an organised storage format. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

What you are requesting is a mailing list. Having worked with mailing lists and email clients, what you need is a real mailing list. One where I had good success is Mailchimp - and it's even free if mailing list isn't big. Short of that, you could set up a basic web host and domain for a small annual fee, as many web hosting companies offer a free mailing list product as one of their services.

I no longer feel qualified to contribute to a development forum, but would like to express what, from experience with several associations and a micro-enterprise, is a frequently-occurring set of requirements that are not currently being met. </p><p>Not so long ago, the length of mailing lists was determined by the price of stationary and postage stamps. Nowadays, many more people can participate, but free and commercial IT offerings haven’t fully caught up. </p><p>Numerous voluntary (unpaid) associations participate in various ways in public life and governance. In return, we must be very careful about the rules of personal data protection, though the office work is usually done by older people like me who have the time but are not always IT-savvy. This isn’t a field for powerful business applications and services like Mailchimp. </p><p>I think the only IT dataset needed by associations like ours which don't handle much money is the address book. To maintain data integrity, there should be only one copy, and since this is used for managing mailing lists it should go into the mailing application. Thunderbird has, in fact, all the required functionality including standardised import and export formats. It’s the way this is applied at the front end for everyday use and maintenance that makes it more difficult than it needs to be for long mailing lists, and above all difficult to respect the data protection rules. </p><p>For more than a decade, I have run several personal and association accounts on the Ionos platform, each with its domain. Ionos is reputed to be an inexpensive hosting service, but it’s certainly reliable.  Most often I have been using Thunderbird as client. Since the present account with the long address lists will be run by 2 or 3 people, we will use the Ionos online application Webmail Basic (we don’t want to synchronise client software). </p><p>Apart from the appearance on the screen, Webmail seems to be identical to Thunderbird, and it demonstrates exactly the same features that I think could be improved. Therefore, since I don’t know of any Ionos user forums, we may as well discuss the subject and try to define requirements somewhere on the Mozilla platform. </p>",crl207,false,0,0

You will never get Thunderbird to be a meaningful mailing list. There are inexpensive tools already available that focus on your issue. Trying to twist  a free email client to do that is not likely to happen. And products such as Mailchimp are free for up to a 1,000 messages a month. If you had an audience of 200 recipients and sent one message a week, you would never pay. You will also face the issue of being blacklisted for excessive mailings, and a mailing list vendor helps prevent that. I will leave you to your pursuits. I encourage you to focus your energy elsewhere for a real, workable solution that is available immediately. Best wishes. I administered mailing lists for years and learned that using the right tool always pays off. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) is a useful feature in email that allows the sender to include recipients without revealing their addresses to the primary and CC (Carbon Copy) recipients. To check if BCC is functioning correctly, send a test email to multiple addresses using the BCC field  (<a href=""https://buyozempiconlineuk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://buyozempiconlineuk.org/</a>). Ensure that recipients receive the email without seeing the addresses of others in the BCC list. If issues arise, verify that the email client or service supports BCC and is properly configured. Understanding and utilizing BCC effectively can enhance privacy and prevent the unintended disclosure of email addresses in group communications. </p>",kerolenalena,true,0,0
