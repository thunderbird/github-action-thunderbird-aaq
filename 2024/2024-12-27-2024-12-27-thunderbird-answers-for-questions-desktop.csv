Before going away I had been tidying up my AB - I don't remember exactly what I did, but I do recall being annoyed that there was some connection with the Mac address book. Wish I could remember what I did, but making it so TB cannot access the Mac contacts seems to have solved the problem! </p><p>Thank you! </p>",caroline144,false,0,0

I am guessing there is but on a whole lot of words you failed to mention what it was. </p><p>If the SMTP server named XXXXX is associated with the Identity being used to send mail,  Thunderbird will attempt to authenticate using that identity and the relevant token.  Is Microsoft ""Modern Authentication"" incorporating oAuth2.0 broken?  It might well be. </p><p>What I see far more of is folk with a single Outgoing server (SMTP) being used across multiple identities complaining that it only works on one of them. </p><p>I personally see no merit in removing an account and adding it again.  If that fixes something your account settings were wrong and the issue could have been resolved much more quickly be correcting the settings. Without the risk of not being about to add it again.  Common.   Not being able to get the new account to work because the issue was not in the settings.  Also very common. </p><p>Why delete the passwords? Oauth does not use passwords except when the initial authorization flow occurs and that is Microsoft asking you for your password,  via a web page they serve from their web server, to authenticate the request for Thunderbird to access you mail.  Thunderbird never actually sees you password in that process,  let alone save it.  Oauth uses tokens issued by, in this case by Microsoft, following the initial flow and updated by them periodically until they decide they need a new authentication flow to extend the authority of Thunderbird to connect.  Depending on how you access their mail server that can be anything from almost daily (where VPN's are used) to like once a year.  Last time I was asked was when Transferred my profile to a new computer a couple of years ago. </p><p>So did you delete the authentication tokens or you password?  Whi9le both can be found in the password manager,  they are not the same thing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

But here they are as attached. </p><p>Firstly, I do not understand what do you mean by, ""Is Microsoft ""Modern Authentication"" incorporating oAuth2.0 broken?"" Where or how to find whether Microsoft ""Modern Authentication"" , is incorporating oAuth2.0? And I think this is the issue. </p><p>I am using, the following Thunderbird and it says its uptodate. </p><p>128.5.2esr (64-bit) Release notes Thunderbird is up to date </p><p>Yes, I can see deleting and adding as a new account did not do any change, since this was not a settings problem, which I can also see now. This is something to do with the connection between Thunderbird and the Microsoft server. Which to my understanding Thunderbird is not able to. </p><p>On the question of deleting the token or a password, I did delete the password and just checked now in the ""saved passwords"" the password for hotmail is not there. </p><p>So what is the solution? What do you think? </p>",gtauseef,false,0,0

Do you have an antivirus program?  They can be a serious cause of new account wizard failures. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0
