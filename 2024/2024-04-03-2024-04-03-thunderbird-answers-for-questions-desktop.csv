Thanks for your answer, unfortunately these are exactly the notifications I mentioned which I tend to miss because they neither require any interaction before vanishing nor play an alarm sound. So TB distinguishes between those soft alerts called ""Notifications"" and the hard alerts called ""Reminders"", and I'd like to have reminders. </p><p>However, I spent some time today to write a python script using the icalendar package. It adds an alarm to any event in my calendar which doesn't have one activated and is called once per hour by the windows task scheduler. This was the easiest way for me since I have direct access to the calendar file. Only some trouble getting the scheduler to work with a silent python script, but it worked out in the end.&nbsp;:) </p><p>Still would be great if the TB calendar in the future would be extended by a global option for ""hard alerts"" - Reminders. I also couldn't find any add-ons aiming in that direction. I guess this has not been done yet as the alerts are part of the ical file format (VALARM) and the TB notifications are just some internal functionality. So maybe just extend this notification function by options for a window demanding dismission and/or playing a sound. </p><p>Thank you nevertheless! </p>",trashmaster,false,1,0
