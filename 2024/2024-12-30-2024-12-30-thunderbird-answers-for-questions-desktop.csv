I have been in contact with my provider (dodo - unfortunate name but have been reliable for the past 20 years) and they are unable to help me. I can access all my emails by logging into the web browser. However, on my desktop computer which is running Mozilla Thunderbird, the emails are not coming through and I am still getting the message I posted previously. Just wondering why you think it is the email providers certificate and not Thunderbird's when the error message  has the Mozilla icon. </p>",djmhall,false,0,0

Certificate failures don't appear to be uncommon and there are pages out there suggesting reasons and the actions to resolve them. For example: <a href=""https://windowsreport.com/email-certificate-error/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://windowsreport.com/email-certificate-error/</a> However, one possibility is that the pop server name has been changed and the old server's security has expired. I checked the Dodo Pop3 settings and they seem to be different to the one you're using (use the Pop3) tab: <a href=""https://www.getmailbird.com/setup/access-dodo-com-au-via-imap-smtp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.getmailbird.com/setup/access-dodo-com-au-via-imap-smtp</a> </p>",arlev,false,0,0

If you see my original post, you'll note that I ensured Thunderbird was closed on both machines before the move. Also, my source Thunderbird was in a custom directory as noted above.

If you moved the profile and retained the addressbook, but lost the message data, that indicates thunderbird was possibly still running. if the old PC is still available, I suggest locating the profile itself in the old thunderbird\profiles folder, and copy and place that in the appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles folder on new PC . Then, start thunderbird - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'Profiles' and click 'about:profiles'  - click the 'create profile' button - click next - enter shortname for profile, such as, MYPROFILE - click the 'choose' button to locate and select the profile you just placed, then click finish an launch </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
