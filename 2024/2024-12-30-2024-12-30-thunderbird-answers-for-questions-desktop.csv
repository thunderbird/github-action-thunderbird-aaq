I have been in contact with my provider (dodo - unfortunate name but have been reliable for the past 20 years) and they are unable to help me. I can access all my emails by logging into the web browser. However, on my desktop computer which is running Mozilla Thunderbird, the emails are not coming through and I am still getting the message I posted previously. Just wondering why you think it is the email providers certificate and not Thunderbird's when the error message  has the Mozilla icon. </p>",djmhall,false,0,0
