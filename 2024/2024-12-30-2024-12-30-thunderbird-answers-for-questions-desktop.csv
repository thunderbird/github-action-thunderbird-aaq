I have been in contact with my provider (dodo - unfortunate name but have been reliable for the past 20 years) and they are unable to help me. I can access all my emails by logging into the web browser. However, on my desktop computer which is running Mozilla Thunderbird, the emails are not coming through and I am still getting the message I posted previously. Just wondering why you think it is the email providers certificate and not Thunderbird's when the error message  has the Mozilla icon. </p>",djmhall,false,0,0

Certificate failures don't appear to be uncommon and there are pages out there suggesting reasons and the actions to resolve them. For example: <a href=""https://windowsreport.com/email-certificate-error/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://windowsreport.com/email-certificate-error/</a> However, one possibility is that the pop server name has been changed and the old server's security has expired. I checked the Dodo Pop3 settings and they seem to be different to the one you're using (use the Pop3) tab: <a href=""https://www.getmailbird.com/setup/access-dodo-com-au-via-imap-smtp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.getmailbird.com/setup/access-dodo-com-au-via-imap-smtp</a> </p>",arlev,false,0,0

A little research suggests that the server name has changed and this may be causing the error. </p>",arlev,false,0,0
