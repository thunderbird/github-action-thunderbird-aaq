If you moved the profile and retained the addressbook, but lost the message data, that indicates thunderbird was possibly still running. if the old PC is still available, I suggest locating the profile itself in the old thunderbird\profiles folder, and copy and place that in the appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles folder on new PC . Then, start thunderbird - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'Profiles' and click 'about:profiles'  - click the 'create profile' button - click next - enter shortname for profile, such as, MYPROFILE - click the 'choose' button to locate and select the profile you just placed, then click finish an launch </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Unfortunately, the problem simply wasn't there when we first tried yesterday; a classic case of the problem disappearing the moment you take your car to the shop. I won't blame anyone if they write me off as crazy or incompetent, but I'm not. There was a problem. Let me say what I know. </p><p>I had tried and failed to enable unified folders with the current esr (128.5.2), the current beta (133.0), and an old beta (119.0b6). In most cases I created entirely new profiles. Once things started working yesterday, they worked with the beta that was running (I forget which one this was), then with the current esr with a different profile. In both cases, this was with the same profile folder with which they had failed before. So the problem doesn't appear to be lurking in the profile folders. Does Windows save some relevant data elsewhere? For instance, I'm referring to the profiles in C:\Users\[myname]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles, but there is also something in C:\Users\[myname]\AppData\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles (""local"" vs ""roaming""). </p><p>There are at least 3 ways to enable unified folders:  1. The View menu (then Folders) from clicking the hamburger button at top right. 2. The View menu (then Folders) in the top row of buttons (file, edit, view, ...). 3. The Folders menu in the message pane header.  I was mostly using (1) but a few times used (2). As described, these had no effect. Mapenzi used (3) and unified folders appeared within a second or so. I've since turned unified off and on again, and now all three methods work fine. Is there any chance that using (3) got things ""unstuck""? (I understand that all three ought to lead to the same code, but maybe something different gets done along the way, or there is inadvertent duplication of code.) </p><p>My original issue was Thunderbird opening and not showing messages nor a filled calendar. That problem disappeared once unified folders were disabled. With unified folders enabled again, there is sometimes a 10-second delay on startup, before anything whatsoever appears in the folders pane and the calendar. (This on a high-spec 2024 laptop.) The delay is much less without unified folders. </p><p>Especially as things are working again I doubt this will receive full attention from any developers, but maybe they could make a mental note of it, looking into it if possibly related problems are reported or if the relevant code gets revisited. </p><p>Many thanks to the team, Mapenzi in particular! </p>",gbsorkin,false,0,0
