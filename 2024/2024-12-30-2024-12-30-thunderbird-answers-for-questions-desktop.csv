I have been in contact with my provider (dodo - unfortunate name but have been reliable for the past 20 years) and they are unable to help me. I can access all my emails by logging into the web browser. However, on my desktop computer which is running Mozilla Thunderbird, the emails are not coming through and I am still getting the message I posted previously. Just wondering why you think it is the email providers certificate and not Thunderbird's when the error message  has the Mozilla icon. </p>",djmhall,false,0,0

Certificate failures don't appear to be uncommon and there are pages out there suggesting reasons and the actions to resolve them. For example: <a href=""https://windowsreport.com/email-certificate-error/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://windowsreport.com/email-certificate-error/</a> However, one possibility is that the pop server name has been changed and the old server's security has expired. I checked the Dodo Pop3 settings and they seem to be different to the one you're using (use the Pop3) tab: <a href=""https://www.getmailbird.com/setup/access-dodo-com-au-via-imap-smtp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.getmailbird.com/setup/access-dodo-com-au-via-imap-smtp</a> </p>",arlev,false,0,0

If you see my original post, you'll note that I ensured Thunderbird was closed on both machines before the move. Also, my source Thunderbird was in a custom directory as noted above. It doesn't work if I move this custom directory to the roaming folder of the new PC nor if I create a new profile with custom directory on the new PC and move it there. </p>",farjo,false,0,0

If you moved the profile and retained the addressbook, but lost the message data, that indicates thunderbird was possibly still running. if the old PC is still available, I suggest locating the profile itself in the old thunderbird\profiles folder, and copy and place that in the appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles folder on new PC . Then, start thunderbird - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'Profiles' and click 'about:profiles'  - click the 'create profile' button - click next - enter shortname for profile, such as, MYPROFILE - click the 'choose' button to locate and select the profile you just placed, then click finish an launch </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
