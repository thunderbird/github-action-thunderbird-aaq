I cannot sign in as the administrator to change the setting so my messages will start getting deleted incrementally, because I cannot sign in as I forgot/lost my password.....any help on how to reset my password and change my email settings would be greatly appreciated, thanks. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",ashmmackinnon

Where is it?","<p>Thunderbird V115.5.0 (on Debian Linux) - Can't Find the ""Font Toolbar"" in email ""Write"" window ... Where is it?  </p><p>I've been using Thunderbird as my email client for decades. After a recent upgrade to software on my Debian Linux PC, I cannot find nor enable the ""Font Toolbar"" that was once available within the Write Window. I'd like to continue to employ Thunderbird as my email client, but this feature/capability is a necessity.  </p><p>The ""Font Toolbar"" enables one to modify the size, color, and spacing(s) of characters, letters, words, and/or paragraphs, and one may also adjust the super- or sub-script, underlining, over-lining, etc., of the same.  </p><p>I've just spent several hours attempting to enable this, searching and trying lots of bad ideas on the local Thunderbird GUI's settings. Still.... NO TOOLBAR! This is very disturbing for me. Given the plethora of search results returned during searches, this has been recurring for a good long time. There are lots of folks with this or very similar problems.  </p><p>I'd like to continue using and enjoying what I have thought was a very good contribution to the globe for use on all sorts of operating systems. For decades, I've solely used Linux. I've liked Mozilla software from the get-go, and this has happened just once before several years ago. Luckily, there was a way to enable it in the ""about:config"" settings. Today, I couldn't even find a way to enter those settings in this newest version of Thunderbird - V115.5.0.  </p><p>If the toolbar is still a feature, how do I enable it? </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",cpkern
