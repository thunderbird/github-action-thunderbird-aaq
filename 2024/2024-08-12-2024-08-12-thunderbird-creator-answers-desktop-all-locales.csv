I cannot sign in as the administrator to change the setting so my messages will start getting deleted incrementally, because I cannot sign in as I forgot/lost my password.....any help on how to reset my password and change my email settings would be greatly appreciated, thanks. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",ashmmackinnon

I cannot now send any emails through Thunderbird.  I have requested technical support twice, however, the only response has been an automated message saying someone will get back to me.  That has not happened.

That way I would know at a glance which message belongs to which email account.  Many mobile phone email clients have this feature but I have not yet found it in Thunderbird. </p><p>Thanks for your help, </p><p>Oli </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",oliwally1
