As Thunderbird, like all quality mail clients, maintains it's own certificate store the Avast hack does not work. There are instructions on the Avast site explaining how to make them a trusted certificate authority. If you want to go that route, I'd hope you do have a lot of faith in Avast. <a href=""https://support.avast.com/en-ww/article/91/#artTitle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.avast.com/en-ww/article/91/#artTitle</a> </p><p>Alternatively I'd disable Mail Shield in Avast, or get rid of Avast altogether and stick with Windows Defender. It can't be a good thing to allow them to spy on all your encrypted communication with the mail server. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
