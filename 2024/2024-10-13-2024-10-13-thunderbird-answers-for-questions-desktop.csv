As Thunderbird, like all quality mail clients, maintains it's own certificate store the Avast hack does not work. There are instructions on the Avast site explaining how to make them a trusted certificate authority. If you want to go that route, I'd hope you do have a lot of faith in Avast. <a href=""https://support.avast.com/en-ww/article/91/#artTitle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.avast.com/en-ww/article/91/#artTitle</a> </p><p>Alternatively I'd disable Mail Shield in Avast, or get rid of Avast altogether and stick with Windows Defender. It can't be a good thing to allow them to spy on all your encrypted communication with the mail server. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

Sorry, can't help but feel a bit negative about Thunderbird as it all seems too complicated and unpredictable. Thanks though, John Extract from my Query - I had intended it to serve 6 email addresses. I then scrapped my intentions to use three of those, and they no longer show up in my available emails. However, the program keeps asking for the access passwords for all three and it's a continual nuisance being interrupted all day long - BUT I can't find ay trace of them in Thunderbird to be able to block them???
