As Thunderbird, like all quality mail clients, maintains it's own certificate store the Avast hack does not work. There are instructions on the Avast site explaining how to make them a trusted certificate authority. If you want to go that route, I'd hope you do have a lot of faith in Avast. <a href=""https://support.avast.com/en-ww/article/91/#artTitle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.avast.com/en-ww/article/91/#artTitle</a> </p><p>Alternatively I'd disable Mail Shield in Avast, or get rid of Avast altogether and stick with Windows Defender.

Historically road runner and TWC did not allow you to send mail unless you connected to the internet using their service. Was a royal pain for those popping to Florida for a break, they ended up here complaining their mail was broken, they could not send.  It is possible that limitation extends to Spectrum.  It is one of the things with legacy items.  Nothing is really understood by the provider as they inherited the setup,  let alone those trying to interpret their procedures. </p><p>Note this part well.  A VPN is also going to cause sending where this sort of checking is active as it hides who you are connected to the internet with.  That is it's whole purpose.  VPN's have their place,  but email with US based ISP's is not one of them. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Much appreciated! </p><pre>    Interesting you should mention failing hard drives.  The computer malfunction I referred to involved a msg. that I occasionally received during boot up that one of the drives was being scanned and repaired.  Eventually the boot process would not complete.  After several failed attempts to get the computer to boot  I was able to get the boot process to complete by disconnecting the identified drive.  When I reconnected the drive and rebooted, the computer started normally, however, I lost access to my email and some of my programs would no longer launch the worst of which was my password manager.  I  ran two separate drive test utilities on all drives and no problems were reported.   </pre> <pre>   At this point I think there is a problem with the motherboard misidentifying a disk problem and of course I have no idea what, if anything, it did to ""repair"" the ""problem"" it found.  I contacted the motherboard support but they had no idea what caused the ""scanning-repair"" msg.  I have no idea why simply disconnecting - reconnecting the drive solved, at least temporarily, the boot problem.   </pre> <pre> Bye the way, the hard drive that had the supposed problem is used for data storage only.  There are no system files, programs,  or any files related to Thunderbird on it.  Even if that drive failed I don't see how it should affect Thunderbird.

Sort of like trying to fit a fourth car in a three car garage. </p><p>I did see a bug report where this is being turned into a viewport type arrangement where you can have more column width defined than the space allows with a scroll bar across the bottom,  but that obviously has not landed just yet as you are having difficulty with the column widths. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I'm very computer literate, and have had a long career in IT so I fully understand what you say.  </p><p>Before Nebula, I could take the subject description column right side and pull it to the right and it'd get bigger and the cell to its right would get smaller. Nebula doesn't do that. It makes the column to its left smaller a bit but stops. so I'm stuck with the current column width unless I manually minimize columns to the right. </p><p>When I do the same with the date column - to the right of subject - it does the same - makes the subject col smaller a bit but stops.  </p><p>The only workaround is to manually minimize columns to the right.
