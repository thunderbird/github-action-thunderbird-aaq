Then download the email viewer at  <a href=""https://www.systoolsgroup.com/eml-viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.systoolsgroup.com/eml-viewer.html</a>   - free.  The addon importexporttools can export messages to eml by highlighting the folder, rightclicking and selecting the importexport option to export as eml files .  The product I show is an example; I'm sure there are other eml viewers out there. Another option is to read the mail folder directly with an mbox viewer, one of which is  <a href=""https://www.nucleustechnologies.com/mbox-viewer-free.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nucleustechnologies.com/mbox-viewer-free.html</a> </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Possibly an anti-virus? Or maybe the prefs.js file is set to read-only. I would check via windows file explorer to see status there. click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open folder', exit thunderbird, and see if there are multiple copies of prefs.js. if so, I suggest deleting all but the newest, and rename that one to prefs.js, and restart and see if that helps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
