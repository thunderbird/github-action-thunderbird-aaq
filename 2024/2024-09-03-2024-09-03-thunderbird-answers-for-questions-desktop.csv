Then download the email viewer at  <a href=""https://www.systoolsgroup.com/eml-viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.systoolsgroup.com/eml-viewer.html</a>   - free.  The addon importexporttools can export messages to eml by highlighting the folder, rightclicking and selecting the importexport option to export as eml files .  The product I show is an example; I'm sure there are other eml viewers out there.

I would check via windows file explorer to see status there. click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open folder', exit thunderbird, and see if there are multiple copies of prefs.js. if so, I suggest deleting all but the newest, and rename that one to prefs.js, and restart and see if that helps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It is unique to each user, so I use brackets to indicate that it will be unique to you. You can find it by clicking to Windows File Explorer, locate the Users directory and view all folders. One of them will be a subset of your name or organization. A way that may work is this:  - at desktop, in search box, enter   %appdata% and press enter key.  - that should take you to the appdata folder and there should be a folder there named Thunderbird - in that folder will be another folder named Profiles  - in that folder will be one or more profile folders. looking in each should show you the one with recent dates and would be your profile.  - if thunderbird has NOT been reinstalled, in the Thunderbird folder is a file named profiles.ini. It will have the name of the profile you were using.  - if what I described is not there, then the messages are lost. if there, then you may be able to recover.  OPTION 1: - start thunderbird, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folders' and click 'about:profiles'  - are multiple profiles shown? Is one of them the one identified by the above-mentioned profiles.ini file? If so, you may be able to 'launch it' . if not, click 'create profile' button in upper left, click next, enter a short name for profile, click 'choose' and locate and select that old profile to see if you can activate it. If so, your messages are there.  - if that doesn't work, then you're off to do  OPTION 2:  - exit thunderbird if running - at this point you have found the profile, but it is corrupted. In windows file explorer, locate the Mail folder in corrupted profile and then select the account folder there. That will show message folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, etc.  Also, see the Mail\Local Folders for any other message folders. COPY all desired folders (but not the msf ones) and store in the Mail\Local Folders folder of the newer profile.  - restart thunderbird and messages should be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Getting results also took quite some time with 115 with 'Body' enabled, but it didn't freeze while typing in the filter box and backspace worked without extreme delay. My desktop is dual boot Windows 11 / Linux Mint 21.3 (Ubuntu 22.04 based) and there TB is still 115.12.0. The Mint software updater isn't offering 128.x. Almost instant results in Quick filter! Also searching past events in Calendar works fine there. Unfortunately I still need a Windows-only application most of the day. 2. No, adding ""Order received"" sorting on that and subsequently Date makes no notable difference. 3. I sort on 'Date' descending and I don't use threading. I have the following columns enabled: Attachment status, Read status; Spam status, Subject, Correspondents, Date, Star, 'Select columns to display'. The latter cannot be disabled unfortunately. It's only wasting precious horizontal space since R-click on any of the other column headers offers the same options. </p><p>Again: the 'Ctrl+K' search works much better and faster, but it should IMHO: </p> <ul><li> only search the current folder by default.

Try importing individual eml message to see if that works. did you create the export from the importexport menu or from the thunderbird menu?
