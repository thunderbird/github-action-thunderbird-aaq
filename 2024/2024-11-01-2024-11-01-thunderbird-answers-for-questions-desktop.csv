This can happen in case security software was keeping a handle of some of the files in the Thunderbird program folder preventing Thunderbird from replacing all the files. </p><p>You need to reinstall Thunderbird and possibly remove the Thunderbird program folder to ensure that all files are replaced. You may have to disable security software temporarily in case the problem persists. </p><p>This can occur with desktop Firefox also. </p>,James,false,0,0

I am not sure there is any equivalent in Linux to the Windows Safe Mode - is there? And do I need to boot into both the ""safe"" O/S and Troubleshoot mode in TB more or less permanently to determine whether the problem goes away?

However, before doing that I closed Thunderbird and re-opened it to confirm that the fault still existed. </li><li> Much to my surprise the fault was fixed!
