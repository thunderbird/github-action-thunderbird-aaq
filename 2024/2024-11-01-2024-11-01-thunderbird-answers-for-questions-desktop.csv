I had done this a long time ago, and it seemed to work (I just got annoying notifications about updates being available all the time). But then all of a sudden it updated anyway. I think that I know now, why. I updated my System to win 11 and came back to win 10. Maybe, that by doing this, some things didn't go back 100% to what they were before. So the updates came back. Changing the registry didn't help. I hope this will help now. Thanks. </p>",tscharli101,false,0,0
