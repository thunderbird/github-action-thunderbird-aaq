It also needs access in order to update the addon when Thunderbird gets updated - assuming the addon has been updated in order to keep working with that version of Thunderbird. Logical if you think about it and no need to worry. It's basically just informing you what is required in order to get it installed. It might sound 'terrifying' but you have to allow anything you download and install permission to access computer. It does not mean the addon is some kind of access point for someone to access your computer. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
