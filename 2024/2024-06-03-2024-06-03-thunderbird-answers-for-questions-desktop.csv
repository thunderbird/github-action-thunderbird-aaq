At some point, I would have imagined that you would have reviewed the available settings to locate the one to not upgrade automatically, since you are impacted with all upgrades. Have you considered there may be the possibility that some program, such as an antivirus, might be interrupting the upgrades? If you're comfortable with Gmail, you may be more comfortable remaining with it. If you install Thunderbird, it will possibly locate your prior profile and attempt to use it. If you do want a totally new install, then I suggest you use Windows File Explorer to locate c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird and delete the folder. That would give you a completely fresh install with all prior content deleted. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It also needs access in order to update the addon when Thunderbird gets updated - assuming the addon has been updated in order to keep working with that version of Thunderbird. Logical if you think about it and no need to worry. It's basically just informing you what is required in order to get it installed. It might sound 'terrifying' but you have to allow anything you download and install permission to access computer. It does not mean the addon is some kind of access point for someone to access your computer. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
