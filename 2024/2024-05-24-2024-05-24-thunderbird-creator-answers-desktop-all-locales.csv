Not that it matters much, because I have had this problem continually for years with various editions of Thunderbird on Win7 as well.   Often when I open Thunderbird, I discover it has created hundreds and even thousands (today 65,000) duplicates of emails in various mailboxes. This has nothing to do with downloading.  The emails in question were downloaded weeks or even months ago, and I havev't accessed them.  Another problem is that Thunderbird creates emails dated in 1970, even before anyone thought of the internet, let alone PCs or emails. Why is this happening?  How can I prevent it? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",Richard8409

The reason is when Thunderbird passes the link to Firefox there is an extra https// added to the beginning:  https//https//cnet... . Not all email links from cnet start with https//, but when they do I must manually delete the first one (in Firefox). Not sure which program, Thunderbird or Firefox, is causing the problem, but it is annoying. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jjmartin

My issue is that my Gmail and Thunderbird is linked to send messages to my clients for estimate purposes. Incoming mail to Gmail as well as outgoing from Gmail gets copied into Thunderbird. Assuming that Thunderbird had so many emails on the screen I asked the internet on how to do a mass email delete. Now I assume ""that"" is the reason why all my labels/folders are now empty I can both Gmail and Thunderbird? These folders held important invoices, contact information and just important information for me to go back into should a situation require it. How do I recover all of my deleted messages in Thunderbird? Will this repopulate the folders with my missing information?? The individual who set it up for me is an expert in the field however I am unable to make any contact with him. He's not responding to any of my messages or calls. Please help. Now please remember I am very ignorant when it comes to this type of experience. Please provide me with the most elementary explanations for this recovery process. Super lament terms and instructions are extremely appreciated. Thanks. Les </p>",desktop;other;,thunderbird,set-up-email-thunderbird,en-US,"",ldmpautocentre
