Not that it matters much, because I have had this problem continually for years with various editions of Thunderbird on Win7 as well.   Often when I open Thunderbird, I discover it has created hundreds and even thousands (today 65,000) duplicates of emails in various mailboxes. This has nothing to do with downloading.  The emails in question were downloaded weeks or even months ago, and I havev't accessed them.  Another problem is that Thunderbird creates emails dated in 1970, even before anyone thought of the internet, let alone PCs or emails. Why is this happening?  How can I prevent it? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",Richard8409
