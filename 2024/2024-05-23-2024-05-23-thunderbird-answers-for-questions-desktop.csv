When does the update (profile munging) occur, exiting from the old version or starting up the new one? So to play it safe, I backed up the entire profile (55 GB!) onto a USB stick, then installed 102 over 102 while 102 was still running. Maybe not a great idea? When I restarted, 115 came up anyway and the profile was munged.  </p><p>So I installed 102 (I found an image of 102.13 on hand) again and copied the old profile back onto the system, renaming the 115-munged profile for safety. Turns out, I think, that the update-causing compatibility file was already in the old profile when I backed it up, so this time I got rid of that before starting 102 again. And indeed it came up in 102.13 and asked to update to 102.15.1, which went okay.
