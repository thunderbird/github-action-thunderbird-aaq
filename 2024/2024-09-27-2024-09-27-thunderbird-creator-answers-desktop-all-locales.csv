I often get an error message and the only solution is shutting down Thunderbird and turning off my Norton VPN, then restarting Norton, and then restarting Thunderbird. This usually works. Starting about an hour ago, I can't connect to comcast with Thunderbird no matter what I do. I can access my email on comcast with their software, but I much prefer Thunderbird. Is this a Thunderbird problem or a comcast problem? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",brookswalker

Obviously the whole system is moving really slow and the normal ""select and delete"" method will take forever. Is there some kind of back-door way to do this, possibly from within Windows File Explorer? Or am I stuck doing it the regular way? I only need to keep the current year.
