That would be the first place I would look for trouble in a situation like this.  Create an exclusion in the antivirus for the Thunderbird profile folder. </p><p>Clear the system temp folder. Clear the Thunderbird cache.  There is a button in the troubleshooting information on the help menu for that. Restart The computer.  If you have an antivirus that is bogged down scanning the moved mails it will not back off without a restart. </p><p>Then consider using archive instead of trying to move mail.

They use a old hacking technique called man-in-the-middle to do their scanning of encrypted connections.  As this style of hacking requires the hacker to impersonate ""you"" the antivirus folk generate self signed encryption certificates to do so.  Thunderbird however only trusts certificates issues by legitimate members of the chain of trust.  Not something Norton or Kaspersky generates on the fly. </p><p>Personally I do not recommend email scanning as it really does very very little to improve security over simply allowing the antivirus to scan the attachments when you try and open them.  Just have a look at Microsoft Defender,  no email scanner at all and it is what I use these days. </p><p>Just remember is you are in the USA you need to remove the Kaspersky. They are subject to some import ban or whatever.  I am not from the USA,  but  the news has made it to me. </p><p>Also be aware that the use of a VPN can mess things up to no end and Norton are flogging theirs heavily. </p><p>The only bug I am aware of in the 128 release related to this sort of thing is <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1903135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1903135</a> and it is fixed in 128.1 </p><p>As for your image issue,  images in emails must be decoded into files and saved somewhere to display.  This somewhere is the system temp folder.  On windows this is a disaster waiting to happen, especially as Windows makes no attempts to manage the mess of abandoned temp files. Older systems can have a hundred thousand files in this folder and access becomes slow leading to some odd outcomes.  It is one of the causes or that old wives tale of windows systems slowing down over time.  </p><p>Open the Windows file manager,  type %temp% into the location bar.  This will open the system temp folder.  With as many applications closed as possible select everything in the temp folder (CtrL+A) and press the delete key.  Any files in use will  not delete, but generate a prompt, hence the less you have open the less of those you should see.  Then see if things improve post this cleanup. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
