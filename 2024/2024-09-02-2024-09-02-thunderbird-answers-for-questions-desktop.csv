They use a old hacking technique called man-in-the-middle to do their scanning of encrypted connections.  As this style of hacking requires the hacker to impersonate ""you"" the antivirus folk generate self signed encryption certificates to do so.  Thunderbird however only trusts certificates issues by legitimate members of the chain of trust.  Not something Norton or Kaspersky generates on the fly. </p><p>Personally I do not recommend email scanning as it really does very very little to improve security over simply allowing the antivirus to scan the attachments when you try and open them.  Just have a look at Microsoft Defender,  no email scanner at all and it is what I use these days. </p><p>Just remember is you are in the USA you need to remove the Kaspersky. They are subject to some import ban or whatever.  I am not from the USA,  but  the news has made it to me. </p><p>Also be aware that the use of a VPN can mess things up to no end and Norton are flogging theirs heavily. </p><p>The only bug I am aware of in the 128 release related to this sort of thing is <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1903135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1903135</a> and it is fixed in 128.1 </p><p>As for your image issue,  images in emails must be decoded into files and saved somewhere to display.  This somewhere is the system temp folder.  On windows this is a disaster waiting to happen, especially as Windows makes no attempts to manage the mess of abandoned temp files. Older systems can have a hundred thousand files in this folder and access becomes slow leading to some odd outcomes.  It is one of the causes or that old wives tale of windows systems slowing down over time.  </p><p>Open the Windows file manager,  type %temp% into the location bar.  This will open the system temp folder.  With as many applications closed as possible select everything in the temp folder (CtrL+A) and press the delete key.  Any files in use will  not delete, but generate a prompt, hence the less you have open the less of those you should see.  Then see if things improve post this cleanup. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I've been trying to find out what's been going on and why. </p><p>You have to bare in mind that everything is sized by pixel size and needs to work on different OS and also computers/ monitors do not all have the same size set for a pixel. If you changed the screen resolution on computer (I'm not suggesting this is required) you would find the space would increase or decrease depending upon resolution settings because they alter the size of a pixel. </p><p>The Folder Pane and the Message List both are effected by the same font size and density settings. So size etc has to work in both locations. You also have to make sure the UI is inclusive in design meaning suitable for a variety of needs and user abilities. The icons etc use 16x16 </p><p>Bug reports took this sort of form: There were quite a few complaints that the compact was too compact in 115* compared to a previous version - not enough space between items, so difficult to read. In some reports the Compact setting was having issues with Message List - not scrolling correctly so items at the bottom could not be accessed. Another real problem was the Bottom of gpqj letters (descenders) is cut off when compact density is used. - Conclusion was the row height/density to be font size dependant. </p><p>In 115* as an example font size 16px with compact starts to cut of letters. You must use 15px or less. I can easily reproduce that issue. It's not just about the Density, you have to consider what people may choose for Font Size and also take into consideration the space required for the various icons and extra display when something is selected or not. </p><p>So it seems the 115* compact worked perfectly for some people (like you and me) under specific conditions but equally caused readibility issues for others, so a compromise in design was made to find an optimum that satisfied all the important issues. </p><p>Basically the height of spacing needed to be modified in order to fix a variety of bugs which caused various usability issues. </p><p>Also the new design in Supernova 115* now has a thin blue line around outer edge of a selected folder which uses a couple of pixels. </p><p>This explains what has occured and why. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I have looked at the bug list you mentioned but unfortunaely nothing in those solves the problem. It mainly seems to list conversations between Moderators. </p><p>To reiterate my original complaint:  </p><p>In Thunderbird 115, the (folder tree/pane) Compact View Density was to my liking, i.e. it was actually compact. Then in Thunderbird 128.1.1, the Compact View was changed so that it is effectively no longer a Compact View, because the spaces have been increased between the Folders in the sidebar folder pane. </p><p>When I enquired of one of the previous Moderators who tried to help, why this had been done, he explained that the space size between the folders were changed in 128.1.1 because other users complained that part of the folder names had disappeared in Compact Density View.  </p><p>I didn't experience this problem, and for me the spaces are now too large.  I also asked the question: Why couldn't those who complained of losing part of the folder name just use 'Default' Density and leave the Compact Density as it was in TB 115 for those of us who like it. I didn't receive a reply. </p><p>Since then I've been trying to find the correct coding to enter in to the CSS file that will reduce the spaces between the folders, but i haven't been able to find it, and none of the suggested code snippets have worked. </p><p>I have been using code in the css for my Firefox folder pane and that has worked for years but I suppose the code is different for TB. </p><p>Do you have any further suggestions? </p><p>Kind regards </p><p>Brian </p>",firefox170,false,0,0

To fix this, you can try the following. This error has plagued Thunderbird for a long time and is a bug in the software section. Your folders may be in gray and appear printed or emerge.they may also be gone.this is also called ghostfolder. You can click on your account with the right mouse button and choose subscribe ( or subscribe).the folders / folders that will then be added to Voorschoten can be filled and so you will most likely get your folders back if you press ok next. </p><p>Greetings Firefox volunteer </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,2,3
