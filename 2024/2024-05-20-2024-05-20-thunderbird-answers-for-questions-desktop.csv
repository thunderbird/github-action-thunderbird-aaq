You can find them in the outgoing server (SMTP) account in account settings. </p><p>Each ""account"" has an outgoing server associated with it in the identity (the entry above the server settings in the account settings.)  You say you have four accounts,  so the outgoing server SMTP should have four SMTP entries in it.  One for each account. </p><p>BTW,  what I want you to specifically check in each outgoing server entry is that it is set to use a password.  That +Ok  is the generic response from an SMTP server when it completes a command. </p><p>SMTP is a fully text based communication between Thunderbird and the server and below is an example of what such a transaction would look like if it were shown on your screen when it was happening.  You will note the Ok is a response the command has completed,  regardless of what the command is.

That is, such a move can be probematic, and some data loss can happen. I suggest a four-step process: first, create a filter to COPY messages by date range to local folders. Once content with that process, then redo filter to delete those messages from server. Third, create a filter to upload local folder to new account (the filter's purpose here is to slow down the copying process. Finally, after verifying that the copy was successful, delete the local folder.  TIP: If either account has AllMail folder or Important folder or any others that contain redundant messages, be sure to UNSUBSCRIBE from both accounts.  </p><p>Before proceeding, I suggest waiting a bit to see if other suggestions are posted.
