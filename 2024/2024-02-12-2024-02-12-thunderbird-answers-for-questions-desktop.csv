And thanks for all the tips on things to look at if I still encounter problems.  I, too, use defender so no e-mail filtering other than what T-bird does.  Which works very well for me.  And I've had that issue with one of the T-bird updates a year or two ago where I had to rebuild everything - didn't lose any data but had to rebuild the local folder structure and create new accounts.  And again - great response - I'll mark this solved after a day or two when I can prove the problem is gone - but thanks to what you presented I can see a clear path to success! </p>",axel43,false,0,0

As they do not offer an opt-out option for their bit of helpfulness  and as Thunderbird defaults to making a copy,  just about everyone gets two copies in the send folder. </p><p>It is a simple thing to turn of the making of sent mail copies in the copies and folders part of account settings by deselecting the place a copy in check mark.  </p><p>What actually surprises me is how few people ask this question.  There are other settings that get more questions asked that I see as easier to find.  So I am left wondering of a significant percentage of folk are just putting up with two copies of everything. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

One webpage I found said ""Right click on the account name and click on 'Settings'. An additional tab entitled 'Account Settings' will appear, select the 'Outgoing Server (SMTP)' left-hand menu option.""  This is what I call a ""lie"".  What actually happens is that a new tab opens on the RHS and if you scroll down RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM you will find the SMTP details hidden away where nobody would look for them. </p><p>Frankly, I think the idea of a default SMTP server is ridiculous, since the security settings for the incoming servers might all be different, but what do I know? </p><p>Matthew Fisher </p>",maf128,false,0,0
