And thanks for all the tips on things to look at if I still encounter problems.  I, too, use defender so no e-mail filtering other than what T-bird does.  Which works very well for me.  And I've had that issue with one of the T-bird updates a year or two ago where I had to rebuild everything - didn't lose any data but had to rebuild the local folder structure and create new accounts.  And again - great response - I'll mark this solved after a day or two when I can prove the problem is gone - but thanks to what you presented I can see a clear path to success! </p>",axel43,false,0,0
