Is Thunderbird still installed, or is it that Acrobat still has connections to it? Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Firstly I am asking the question because I have started to get messages from Thunderbird that it is unable to connect to the account but no reason stated.  Later I seem to be getting the email updates. </p><p>Under ""Settings"", Privacy &amp; Security"" there is a place to see ""Saved Passwords"".  There you could see for each Provider what the Username and saved Passwords were by clicking on ""Show Passwords"".  I have 4 email accounts on Thunderbird.  For 3 of them there are 2 entries one looks like my password but also another entry that starts with ""M.C107_SN1.-C......"". These entries are the most recent ""Last Changed"".  How can I be sure what the actual password is? </p>",KuchleiT,false,0,0

It is a special encoding the email provider does to uniquely identify that PC. My guess, and that's all it is, is that any password errors you receive may be temporary errors on the network, since you otherwise do receive the messages. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Posting the same topic twice causes confusion and causes those wanting assist to try replying to one request while others may be attempting to assist on the other.  On your issue, I encourage you to exit libreoffice prior to sending the spreadsheet. when you receive it back to yourself, I suggest renaming it. That is, my fear is that sending to yourself may cause the libreoffice software to be preventing YOU from editing it as a duplicate, an issue that may not affect your recipient. My concern may be incorrect, but there is the chance that you are doing all of this while keeping the spreadsheet open in libreoffice. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
