Aqui estão algumas sugestões que podem ajudá-lo a resolver esse problema: </p><p>Verifique suas credenciais: Certifique-se de estar inserindo o endereço de e-mail e senha corretos para a conta do Gmail. Às vezes, erros de digitação podem causar problemas de autenticação. </p><p>Habilite a autenticação de dois fatores: Se você ativou a autenticação de dois fatores para sua conta do Gmail, pode ser necessário criar uma senha de aplicativo específica para o Thunderbird. Isso garante que o Thunderbird possa acessar sua conta com segurança. Você pode gerar uma senha de aplicativo nas configurações de segurança da sua conta do Google. </p><p>Verifique as configurações de segurança da conta: Certifique-se de que sua conta do Gmail não está bloqueada devido a atividades suspeitas ou tentativas de acesso não autorizadas. Verifique as configurações de segurança da sua conta para ver se há algum aviso ou bloqueio. </p><p>Atualize o Thunderbird: Certifique-se de estar usando a versão mais recente do Thunderbird. Às vezes, problemas de autenticação podem ser corrigidos com atualizações de software. </p><p>Verifique as configurações de segurança do Google: Verifique se você concedeu todas as permissões necessárias ao Thunderbird para acessar sua conta do Gmail. Isso pode ser feito nas configurações de segurança da sua conta do Google. </p><p>Se nenhuma dessas soluções resolver o problema, pode ser útil entrar em contato com o suporte técnico do Thunderbird ou do Google para obter assistência adicional. </p><p>Espero que isso ajude a resolver o problema! Se precisar de mais alguma coisa, estou à disposição para ajudar. </p><p>Atenciosamente, ROCKET-NET-PRÓ </p>",ROCKETNET,false,0,0

If you do run an antivirus (other than the free Windows Defender), it may help for the future to see if it has settings to bypass email.  BUT, to focus on your issue:  - when you see the pane to create an email account, that is an indication that the profile has problems and Thunderbird set up a new profile. - if menu bar isn't visible, click the alt key to see it. then, click help&gt;troubleshooting information, scroll down left side to 'profile folder' and click 'open profile'  - exit thunderbird  - note the name of folder, as that is the current thunderbird profile - back up one folder in File Explorer. That should place you at the ...thunderbird/profiles folder.  - look in the folder to see if there are other profiles. If so, click inside to see if your account is there. It will be in the Mail folder of POP or the Imapmail folder for IMAP.  Any local folders would be in the Mail\Local Folders folder.  - post screenshots if you find your accounts and we can go from there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

A nagyobbra méretezés egyik hátránya, hogy amikor a levél képet is tartalmaz, és a blokkokra bontott részekben van benne hirdetés, a nagyobbra állított betűk kilógnak a blokkokból, akkor egymásba lógnak zavarva az olvashatóságot, vagy a képre telepednek rá.
