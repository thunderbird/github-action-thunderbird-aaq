(I am assuming it is POP now)  Do not remove of delete anything. </p><p>Allow the server messages to synchronize to Thunderbird.  Then drag your selected messages from the IMAP folder to the appropriate location in Thunderbird.  That will ""move"" them as in delete them from the server.  You can also right click messages and select copy or move to achieve the same thing or just copy. </p><p>Once you have done that you can remove the IMAP mail account from Thunderbird. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

There is also a standard Thunderbird page that loads when the application starts.  It to contains a reference to donation,  but also contains information about Thunderbird and support. </p><p>Get messages should automatically initiate when Thunderbird starts.  Then there is a cloud icon in the top of the folder pane that gets all messages for all accounts.  Then there is a get messages icon in the toolbar which only gets messages for the currently selected account. It only ever did,  but few people appear to have been aware of that.  Generally assuming it got everything and complaining it was broken when it did not. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Now it is a multi threaded thing where all five may attempt to connect at once. </p><p>I have no idea if this will help,  but it might. </p><p>Stretch out the frequency of connection as far as you feel you can.  Stagger the frequency 15 minutes for one account 17 for another so they all do not click over at the same time.  Keep in mind that hotmail used to refuse connections that arrived at less than 15 minute frequency.  so do not set account to a lesser time. </p><p>If you are using IMAP accounts try changing the connections in server settings &gt; advance to 1 or 2.  It will slow the download,  but it might reduce the errors as well. </p><p>If you are not using oauth authentication,  consider using it.  Microsoft are in the process of enforcing it, (slowly), and if they have not got to you yet,  you will only be ahead of the game. </p><p>Consider dropping email scanning if your antivirus product offers it.  Some A/V product struggle to multitask on multiple mail connections at the same time. I think anyway.  I know I do not have the issue and use Microsoft Defender which has no mail scanner. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is a popular method of really making a mess that I do not understand,  but must accept is occurring and warn against it. </p><p>If you access your hotmail account on this link <a href=""https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/options/mail/accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/options/mail/accounts</a>  ytou will see a link at the bottom of the settings for POP etc to the page I link to below.  I think it is a generic page these days,  but it might be better to access it that way, just in case it is not generic. </p><p>Microsoft publish the following setting that you should use. <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040</a> </p><p>I still have a venerable hotmail account, but using the <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> for incoming and <a href=""http://smtp-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp-mail.outlook.com</a> for outgoing server names.  I think I updated them when I changed the authentication method to oauth as that is only avaiable with certain server names. </p><p>If oauth is not available.  change the server name,  close the account settings and open them again and retry. The authentication method list only refreshes when the panel opens.  Not when the server name changes. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

As they do not offer an opt-out option for their bit of helpfulness  and as Thunderbird defaults to making a copy,  just about everyone gets two copies in the send folder. </p><p>It is a simple thing to turn of the making of sent mail copies in the copies and folders part of account settings by deselecting the place a copy in check mark.  </p><p>What actually surprises me is how few people ask this question.  There are other settings that get more questions asked that I see as easier to find.  So I am left wondering of a significant percentage of folk are just putting up with two copies of everything. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
