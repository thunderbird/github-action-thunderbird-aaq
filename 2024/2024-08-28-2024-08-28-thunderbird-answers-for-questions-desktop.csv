However, we have tens of thousands of users who have updated to 128 and the problems seen here do not indicate a failure of the upgrade. And there have been compliments, so it's difficult to give a simple pronouncement on 128. Personally, I have had no problems, and I try to use all the features. I even keep a POP account and usenet account so I can be aware of reported issues. I am proud to help users with Thunderbird because I like the open source concept and the sense of community that Mozilla offers.
