I have never understood how doing the same thing over again is expected to fix anything,  but reinstall folk do.  As you have observed it failed rather spectacularly and is frequently the cause of far more trouble than existed before the decision to blow it away and start again. </p><p>I have never seen any mention of the actual error you received.  So I am left guessing, as I expect David was. but I am also guessing you thought to install and older version.  My guess is it was a complaint about the versions of Thunderbird being used in the profile as described in this support article. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation</a> </p><p>I also think you fail to actually understand what a profile is.  It is not some time based thing.  I have one profile with my last 20 years worth of emails in.  If you regularly have new profiles,  even in Firefox as you suggest,  you have other problem outside of Thunderbird.  Quite probably related to antivirus products and system optimization software.  Both do a pretty good job of messing up Thunderbird from time to time including causing the creation of a new profile folder.  This process in Thunderbird is generally signaled by it asking for you to set up your accounts over again when it starts. </p><p>So you have created another version of Thunderbird and set up your accounts all over again now is my guess.  So what you are asking to do is abandon all of that and go back to the profile you were using when this all started.  I can not tell you which to use because you have not itemized the profiles you have in your profile folder.  So all I can do is point you to the relevant documentation. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_start-the-profile-manager-when-thunderbird-is-closed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles#w_start-the-profile-manager-when-thunderbird-is-closed</a> </p><p>Very old profiles tend to be named default with the ones created post version 68 having names like default-release </p><p>If I was looking for an old profile in the profiles list, I would be looking for one that contained a prefs.js file that was a the most recent before the reinstall.  that files is not written everyday,  but every account setting change is stored there. </p><p>When you uninstall,  you are asked if you want to delete the program or everything.  Choosing everything will delete the profile as you have requested that.  Are you sure you are not looking for something you actually chose to delete? </p><p>It is easy to blame the software,  but I find almost all true data loss situations are caused by user decisions, choices to remove mail from a server or delete the program and supporting data,  not software itself. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

However, we have tens of thousands of users who have updated to 128 and the problems seen here do not indicate a failure of the upgrade. And there have been compliments, so it's difficult to give a simple pronouncement on 128. Personally, I have had no problems, and I try to use all the features. I even keep a POP account and usenet account so I can be aware of reported issues. I am proud to help users with Thunderbird because I like the open source concept and the sense of community that Mozilla offers. Where I do get touchy is when people post here to shoot us, the volunteers. We're a sitting target, yet have no involvement in development or design.
