If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p> <pre>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0 =unthreaded    Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.    ------------ 	 To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: This must be done on an account by account basis. - select table view  - the icon just to right of 'quick filter' button above message list pane - select a message folder and apply all desired attributes - View&gt;sort by from menu bar (if not shown, click alt key) - click the icon at right side of column display in message list pane - select the entry near bottom 'Apply current view to...' - highlight 'folder and children' - move mouse left to see account name and move left again to display all account folders. Now CLICK. - a small menu will appear to confirm setting all folders within that account.  I did a simple (okay, crude) video at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts	  - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

A complete failure of Thunderbird to link the read status of mails over a period of years to your providers web site.  As I like many millions of others use Thunderbird with Gmail in an IMAP situation,  I can confirm that while it can happen due to timeouts in connections it is rare, and only occurs for a short period. Like you mark a folder read and only half of them are marked before the connection ends for some reason like the power it off. </p><p>The second is you have something on your system that is causing issues (Not Thunderbird) although it could be an addon).

I am also running Outlook (which I want to dump for other reasons and that's why I am trying Tbird) but the problems I am reporting here are not duplicated at Outlook or Gmail so clearly reside with Tbird.   And if support at Mozilla can not understand and resolve email issues that reside only with the use of it's product then this 'free' resource it's way too expensive to use because I do not have time or interest in speculative guesses offering no solution. So I'll look for a different product with better support.

The contact list is abook.sqlite, so check in each folder for what looks biggest or most current. As a guess, the one beginning with 3144 might be the more current profile. You can either 1) create a new profile and start from scratch, or 2) try to reactivate one of these profiles, or 3)create a new profile and copy components from one of these profiles, such as addressbook and any local folders or POP message folders. This can get messy, so I hope whenever you get this back together, that you do a full backup to protect you from future problems. Let me know and I'll try to assist. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I am trying to use my Thunderbird as I have for a long long time without this annoyance.   I uncheck the drafts checkbox on the inbox Properties Flags tab, click on okay, and all is well until a bit of time goes by or I restart T-Bird.  Then the Drafts box is checked again. </p><p>Thanks Matt for your assistance.  Robert </p>",rafisher3,false,0,0
