It will be a significant and serious loss if I can't find a way of transferring this data as I have to phase out the PC since Win10 will no longer be supported from about this time next year.  </p><p>Is this possibly a consequence of transferring from 32bit Win10 TB, to 64 bit Win11 TB?  </p><p>Thanks again for your help so far.
