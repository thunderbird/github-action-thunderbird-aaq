I have tried the following actions  (all on a 'fresh' installation of TB having removed the previous installation per the method I mentioned above):  </p><p>1) Installed TB on the laptop, set it up for my existing main account, and then logged off.

In all cases, the report is identical in volume and number of files contained in the folder.  I can't think of anything else to do.  Any ideas?  It will be a significant and serious loss if I can't find a way of transferring this data as I have to phase out the PC since Win10 will no longer be supported from about this time next year.  </p><p>Is this possibly a consequence of transferring from 32bit Win10 TB, to 64 bit Win11 TB?  </p><p>Thanks again for your help so far.

However, on exploring the profile folder structure, I do find various 'mail' folders that seem to have my subfolders within them.
