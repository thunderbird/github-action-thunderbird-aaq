I had to open and close the program several times and could then see my inbox,  I discovered that all the messages in my Inbox over about a month old were blank when I opened them up--just a white page with nothing on it.   A few days later, it corrected itself.  Now it has happened again.  I have made no changes to my account, software, computer, etc. that I am aware of.   Suggestions?  Thank you!  I am an elder and not particularly tech savvy. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",deni66
