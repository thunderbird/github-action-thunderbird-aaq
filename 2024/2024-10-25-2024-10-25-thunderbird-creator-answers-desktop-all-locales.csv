I have 9 email accounts (3x yahoo, 3 x Microsoft, 2 x GMX and a Gmail).  I used to train adults how to use a computer or laptop (basic training) so had addresses for different providers, so I was familiar with anything they could throw at me!  Some don't get a lot of use now, but I like to keep them, for the odd occasion.  All the accounts loaded sweetly at the time, some requiring 2FA, but none needing any App Passwords.  A week ago My laptop had a catastrophic problem requiring me to restore to factory defaults.  Since then, I have been reinstalling all the programs/apps to get it something like it was before the disaster occurred.  Obviously, as part of the process, I had to reinstall Thunderbird.  However, I have not been able to get any of the accounts to get set up on Thunderbird.  The settings are found in the database and passed as okay, but I've been getting messages like: ""Unable to login at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password."" I know the settings are correct because I have double-checked them very carefully, and I also use Bitwarden to ensure the Username and Password are correct.  Initially I had wondered whether it was just one account that was a problem, and had tried other (alternative and approved) port and security settings but got a ""Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account"" message. I am puzzled, because about 3 weeks ago everything went in so easily, and I completed all nine accounts one after the other in probably less than half an hour, and now I can't complete any.  I'm obviously playing with the idea of trying another email program, but also liked the calendar in Thunderbird.  I'll attach some screen prints below. I also use Nord VPN, but for a fortnight it didn't matter whether Nord VPN was on or off, Thunderbird was brilliant.  Today I was wondering whether that was having an effect, so I switched on Split Tunnelling, and applied Thunderbird, but it made no difference.  So my next thought was whether as part of the Factory reset of the Laptop, not all the registry entries for Thunderbird had been cleared, or that there was some files somewhere that had escaped the purge and Thunderbird was still pointing to them.  However, that didn't make sense, because I had Uninstalled Thunderbird with BC Uninstaller and deleted entries found after uninstallation, before I reinstalled it.  So what can I do other than find some other email product, which seems unlikely at present!  Kind regards. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1684047;1684054;1684056;1684113;1684249;1684269;1684297;1684619;1684662;,p_johnson

I'm sorry if this is a silly question, but just can't figure this out. First - is there a way to create a filter based on the domain? For example I have emails coming from Amazon. Instead of adding one by one - returns@amazon.co.uk, shipment@amazonco.uk, info@amazon.co.uk and so on, can I make one filter for all @amazon.co.uk so everything with that extension goes to one place? If so - how do I do that? </p><p>Second - I have created a filter for example info@school.co.uk so that all school emails are in one folder SCHOOL, but I want the emails with subject ""School payment receipts"" from the same address ""info@school.co.uk"" to go separately in a subfolder /Payments/ under the folder SCHOOL.

There is a small chance it happened on a previous update, I'm not sure. This function is something I use regularly so this bothers me greatly. I tried rebuilding the global database according to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database</a> with no luck - the problem persists. The file now has 1,18 MB, I'm quite certain it was significantly larger before. The problem occurs in all accounts I have and it worked on all of them before. Threading itself works properly if I go to View&gt;Sort by&gt;Threaded so the messages are recognized as threads properly. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1684172;1684390;,tomol012

She is running the latest Thunderbird for Windows [I checked] on Windows 11.  All emails show up correctly when she sees the Emails in her inbox. But when she opens up some messages [no commonality between them], she gets the gibberish as in the attachment. Odd that every message with the issue has the same file name mentioned [IMG_5409.JPG]. If she gets an Email she is fine. She gets another Email and she gets the attached message. Later she could get another Email from the individual and she's fine again. Thoughts?
