In my gmail imap 'Sent Mail' folder, the option if offered Open Message in Conversation' does display in a new tab, but sadly does not include the received email in Inbox.

Try to see if the outdated browsers are involved in this situation . The freezing situation can be caused by corrupt msf files try to delete and use the automatic restore option. See if the aV software has scan option on to scan with Thunderbird software and disconnect them for a while or delete or switch of this aV.
