If you click through messages by clicking the link in message list pane, you are in the preview screen. But I am assuming your question is on privacy. Some tips are here: </p> <ol><li> to avoid sending return receipts, click settings&gt;general and scroll down to the 'return receipts' button and set to not return them  </li><li> in settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, untick to allow remote content in messages (you can add exceptions for senders you trust)  </li></ol> <p>Doing those two things helps prevent senders from being informed when you read a message. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Ma <strong>Thunderbird non funziona così</strong>. Il programma opera completamente sotto il tuo controllo e tutti i suoi dati restano sul tuo PC. In altre parole se vuoi che qualcuno provi a darti una mano su questo forum devi riportare il maggior numero di dettagli possibili a cominciare dai <strong>messaggi di errore che ricevi</strong> quando provi a scaricare la posta con Thunderbird. Dire semplicemente che ""non scarica la posta"" è del tutto inutile proprio perché Thunderbird non è un servizio centralizzato ed il problema non è generale. </p>",@next,false,0,0
