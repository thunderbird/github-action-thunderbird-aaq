Someone in my family (inexperienced with computers), pasted daily PNG screengrabs into a draft for a month, hoping to email it to somebody. They didn’t understand it would create a massive 300mb draft that could not be sent. The screengrabs can’t be taken again, so this is the only place they’re saved. </p><p>So I thought I would simply save out the draft as an HTML file, which has the images embedded. However, the HTML file only shows the images up to a point (only shows 10 out of 30), after which it’s just blank white space. That’s because there’s a little yellow banner at the bottom of the draft with an Options button saying the images have been locked, and I need to unlock them in order to include them in the draft. When I do that for all 20 images, however, they don’t appear in the email body, so even if I save out an HTML file after that, it still only shows a blank space. I thought maybe hitting F5 to refresh the screen would do it, but it doesn’t. Nor does trying to forward the draft as a new draft (still blank space). Maybe you now of a way to refresh the draft view? </p><p>When I unlocked all the images, I could see some of the path, which looked like they were saved inside the Draft mailbox file (I could even see the PNG extension for each image). So I was thinking, maybe there’s a way to access the files inside the mailbox in order to extract the PNGs but unfortunately I couldn’t find one. </p><p>So if you have any suggestions for my predicament, I would be grateful. - Alan </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",fireos5

But could be read properly via webmail. After some Tech Help that but was OK (but font appeared different to usual) however the other emails from businesses (advertising basically)  etc appeared either blank, or just not in usual 'attractive' format with pictures and text. There was minimal text interspersed with lots of info in blue starting with htpps// The same Tech Help people were unable to sort it and said to contact service provider. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Keryn

Windows 12 TB 128.3 I push send, screens gets less contrasted and nothing happens. I bypass the problem by leaving the message, saving it to drafts and with my smartphone I srnd the draft! Something else happens since some time, do not know if it is related: when I open TB and go to inbox, it shows an inbox that's not up to date. After a minute it refreshes to the present inbox.
