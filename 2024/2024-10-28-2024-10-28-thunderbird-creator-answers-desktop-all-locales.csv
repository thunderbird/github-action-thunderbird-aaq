This is going to be a strange question for you. Someone in my family (inexperienced with computers), pasted daily PNG screengrabs into a draft for a month, hoping to email it to somebody. They didn’t understand it would create a massive 300mb draft that could not be sent. The screengrabs can’t be taken again, so this is the only place they’re saved. </p><p>So I thought I would simply save out the draft as an HTML file, which has the images embedded. However, the HTML file only shows the images up to a point (only shows 10 out of 30), after which it’s just blank white space. That’s because there’s a little yellow banner at the bottom of the draft with an Options button saying the images have been locked, and I need to unlock them in order to include them in the draft. When I do that for all 20 images, however, they don’t appear in the email body, so even if I save out an HTML file after that, it still only shows a blank space. I thought maybe hitting F5 to refresh the screen would do it, but it doesn’t. Nor does trying to forward the draft as a new draft (still blank space). Maybe you now of a way to refresh the draft view? </p><p>When I unlocked all the images, I could see some of the path, which looked like they were saved inside the Draft mailbox file (I could even see the PNG extension for each image). So I was thinking, maybe there’s a way to access the files inside the mailbox in order to extract the PNGs but unfortunately I couldn’t find one. </p><p>So if you have any suggestions for my predicament, I would be grateful. - Alan </p>",fireos5;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:131.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/131.0,0,0,0,,,

The below is my actual concern but summarized much more nicely than I could ever write it. </p><p>I am writing to seek assistance with an ongoing issue I have been experiencing while using Thunderbird as my email client. </p><p>I have a self-signed certificate for my email server, and I frequently encounter problems with Thunderbird not being able to retrieve my emails. It seems that every once in a while, Thunderbird refuses to accept the certificate, prompting me to remove and re-add my email account entirely. I have tried manually removing the certificate and re-adding it; however, Thunderbird consistently reports that it is a valid certificate. </p><p>When I remove and re-add my account, I am prompted again to accept a security exception, which I do, and then my email retrieval works correctly. My concern is: why do I have to constantly add exceptions, and why does email not work if Thunderbird reports the certificate is valid? </p><p>Additionally, I am having issues with notifications. Specifically, I would like to know how to prevent Thunderbird from showing notifications through my OS notification bar. Recently, I received a notification about being unable to connect, but it was cut off, leaving me unaware of the full message and details. It is quite frustrating, as it shouldn’t be this complicated to manage an email client in 2024. </p><p>For your reference, I am using Pop!_OS 22.04, which is based on Ubuntu. My current version of Thunderbird is 128.3.3esr(64-bit). </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance.

Na installatie hernoem ik de bij de installatie van Mint nieuw aangemaakte, lege, map .thunderbird naar .thunderbird-a. Het programma open ik NIET. Hierna plak ik  de “oude”, gekopieerde, map .thunderbird naar de nieuwe Mint installatie en plaats de kopie in de map bij de inmiddels hernoemde .thunderbird-a map. Ik zie dan dus staan .thunderbird en .thunderbird-a. Als ik nu Thunderbird start zie ik (tot mijn blijdschap) direct en zonder nadere inspanningen alle e-mail Accounts en e-mail verschijnen.

Met deze transitie worden de wachtwoorden van de accounts NIET meegenomen en die moet ik achteraf weer invoeren, bij MS zelfs na een beveiligingscode te hebben opgehaald. Mijn vraag is derhalve: waar, in welk bestand en in welke map, worden de wachtwoorden van de Thunderbird accounts opgeslagen, want die staan kennelijk niet in de .thunderbird-map. Ik zou die data en map(pen) dan kopiëren en in de nieuwe installatie op de juist plaats kunnen plakken; zou moeten werken lijkt mij. </p><p>2. Veiligheidscontrole berichten. Als je een bericht ontvangt van een nieuwe afzender moet je toestemming verlenen om dat bericht te openen/lezen. Dat is op zich een prima voorziening, maar als je - nadat je de transitie hebt gedaan als hiervoor beschreven - weer letterlijk bij elk bericht wat je “voor het eerst” ziet moet aangeven dat je het toestaat om gelezen te worden, wordt je wel een beetje erg melig; gelukkig is het wel zo, net als bij “nieuw”, dat je dat alleen bij het eerste bericht moet aangeven. Mijn vraag is ook nu: in welk bestand en in welke map zijn deze data opgeslagen zodat ik die data ook kan kopiëren en in de nieuwe installatie kan plakken. </p><p>Ik ben mij ervan bewust dat dit niet kan werken, dan moet ik die bijwerking van wachtwoorden etc. maar handmatig blijven doen, maar liever niet. </p><p>Alvast dank voor een reactie </p>",jan.kol40;markh2;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:131.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/131.0,1,0,0,,,
