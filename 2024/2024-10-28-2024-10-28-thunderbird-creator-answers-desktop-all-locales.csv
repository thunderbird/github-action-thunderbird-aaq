Someone in my family (inexperienced with computers), pasted daily PNG screengrabs into a draft for a month, hoping to email it to somebody. They didn’t understand it would create a massive 300mb draft that could not be sent. The screengrabs can’t be taken again, so this is the only place they’re saved. </p><p>So I thought I would simply save out the draft as an HTML file, which has the images embedded. However, the HTML file only shows the images up to a point (only shows 10 out of 30), after which it’s just blank white space. That’s because there’s a little yellow banner at the bottom of the draft with an Options button saying the images have been locked, and I need to unlock them in order to include them in the draft. When I do that for all 20 images, however, they don’t appear in the email body, so even if I save out an HTML file after that, it still only shows a blank space. I thought maybe hitting F5 to refresh the screen would do it, but it doesn’t. Nor does trying to forward the draft as a new draft (still blank space). Maybe you now of a way to refresh the draft view? </p><p>When I unlocked all the images, I could see some of the path, which looked like they were saved inside the Draft mailbox file (I could even see the PNG extension for each image). So I was thinking, maybe there’s a way to access the files inside the mailbox in order to extract the PNGs but unfortunately I couldn’t find one. </p><p>So if you have any suggestions for my predicament, I would be grateful. - Alan </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",fireos5
