I am getting a Spectrum error AUP#Out-1130 meaning the cmsmpt is blocked.  When I am able to clear that error I get an error that it was unable to send because it timed out.  It is not asking for my outgoing email password which it always has in the past.  I am using Express VPN and Windows Security.  I am using Thunderbird version 115.8.0.  I am using Windows 10.
