I am able to receive emails.,<p>I am unable to send an email from my Thunderbird email account.  I am able to receive emails. Spectrum is my ISP. They say it is a Thunderbird issue.  I am getting a Spectrum error AUP#Out-1130 meaning the cmsmpt is blocked.  When I am able to clear that error I get an error that it was unable to send because it timed out.  It is not asking for my outgoing email password which it always has in the past.  I am using Express VPN and Windows Security.  I am using Thunderbird version 115.8.0.  I am using Windows 10.  I can send emails from the Spectum website (same email account).  </p><p>I have tried disabling the Firewall and the VPN.  It makes no difference with the problem of sending emails. </p><p>I am using Port 465 on my outgoing SMTP which the ISP recommends.   Also SSL/TLS with normal password. </p><p>I need help be able to Send email from my Thunderbird account.
