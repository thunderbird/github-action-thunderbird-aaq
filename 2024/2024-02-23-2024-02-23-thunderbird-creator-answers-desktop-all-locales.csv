I've been advised to refer to Mozilla Thunderbird and Apple are insistent they can do no more than mail me links to all the instructions I've already read in detail several times. However, I believe the problem lies with Apple but they don't yet know it. I've used separate ASP generated passwords and tried to install an iCloud email on several different email clients:   Thunderbird, Mailbird, Outlook and Postbox. All these confirm that the settings seem to be valid but nonetheless the email account fails to load with error messages suggesting the configuration or password (i.e. the ASP) is wrong. The common factor is Apple not Thunderbird. I suggest anyone flummoxed by this awaits the acceptance of this problem by Apple. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1638217;1638258;,Lozzerdude

The other is an email address hosted by our website company. (ARI/Dealerspike) - When using Thunderbird to view received emails for my ARI/Dealerspike email address, photo's are not displaying / getting replaced with random gibberish text and the whole email appears to be converted to plain text. The photo / plain text issue doesn't happen for my gmail email address when I view them in Thunderbird. Only the ARI/Dealerspike email addresses have the issue. Can't figure out why?  </p><p>Other observations: - The email displays correctly if I open it in our email service providers web-based email portal.  - The email displays correctly if I open it in Outlook 365.  - When I send emails to myself in Thunderbird (to the ARI/Dealerspike email) with photos and custom font, it all looks normal when I open the email. </p><p>I've tried all the basic settings like View-Original HTML, View-Display Attachments Inline, Settings-Privacy-Allow Remote Content.

Today's influx consisted of 78 messages (it was about 150 messages the first time it happened) ranging in age from last week to June of 2022.  I do not believe I have changed any account settings in the last 9 months, either within Thunderbird or at Gmail, where the account is hosted.  In each case all the messages were confined to one specific folder--the first time it was the Inbox folder.  This time it was a sub-folder named ""Receipts"".
