I am able to receive emails.,<p>I am unable to send an email from my Thunderbird email account.  I am able to receive emails. Spectrum is my ISP. They say it is a Thunderbird issue.  I am getting a Spectrum error AUP#Out-1130 meaning the cmsmpt is blocked.  When I am able to clear that error I get an error that it was unable to send because it timed out.  It is not asking for my outgoing email password which it always has in the past.  I am using Express VPN and Windows Security.  I am using Thunderbird version 115.8.0.  I am using Windows 10.  I can send emails from the Spectum website (same email account).  </p><p>I have tried disabling the Firewall and the VPN.  It makes no difference with the problem of sending emails. </p><p>I am using Port 465 on my outgoing SMTP which the ISP recommends.

The issue started about one week ago.  </p><p>Thunderbird has always asked for my password to send email.  It is bypassing this step.

This calendar switching feature is part of MacOS Calendar, even if, as in Thunderbird, other properties of an accepted invite are not editable (except for comments). </p><p>Since this lack of control over invite edition is mainly what is holding me to adopt Thunderbird, is such a feature likely to be deployed eventually? </p><p>Regards, </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",philippe.rousseau

Just now I've sent an email, copied it over to folder concerned, but it is not there. I see bendy arrows and &lt; instead of simply a straight line of emails. I don't want to link any emails with another. I want my emails to simply show in date order. I can't figure out if it is me, or Mozilla.  A Search tells me my Sent Email is filed correctly, but when I go to the folder, it is not there. Q: is there a way in View to reorganise this?
