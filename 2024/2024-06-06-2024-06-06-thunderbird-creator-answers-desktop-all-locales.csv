Years ago I successfully set up email for both accounts in Thunderbird. Recently (probably after an upgrade) one of the accounts stopped working and I get a timed out message when fetching email messages.  After checking the server settings and password were correct the problem was not fixed, so I deleted the account and tried to re-add it in Thunderbird. The incoming and outgoing server settings are correct as is the password. I know the password is correct because I can successfully login to the account using webmail. I received the following error message on the ""Setup your Existing Email Address"" page. The message appears above the ""Checking Password"" button. </p><p>""Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsiMsgAccountManager.createIncomingServer] </p><p>The password on the account is 16 characters long and contains the following special characters: ""!#"" </p><p>I am using Thunderbird version 115.11.1 (64-bit) - on the esr channel </p><p>Can anyone help? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",kkaffy

In caso di mail singola, invece, viene visualizzata in grassetto, ed è molto più visibile. Sarebbe possibile modificare la visualizzazione della conversazione con all'interno mail da leggere, magari evidenziando la conversazione ridotta in maniera diversa?

If the emails are large (as some are) TB stops everything to deal with it.

Yet, every once in a while, it still collects. Do I need to remove the account from TB altogether? I would like to be able to have this account checked every 15 minutes like my other five email accounts, which don't cause me any heartache, but it's driving me mad, especially when a throng of those emails come in, like 50 at a time, and I am effectively prevented from doing anything in TB for up to five minutes. I suppose I could craft the emails to be smaller (it's my own code that is sending the debug reports) but the info in there is there on purpose. </p><p>Is there a setting I can change somewhere to break off the processing for the main window and the compose windows? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1656047;1656051;,michaelmuller
