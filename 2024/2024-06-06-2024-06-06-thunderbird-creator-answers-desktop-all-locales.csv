Years ago I successfully set up email for both accounts in Thunderbird. Recently (probably after an upgrade) one of the accounts stopped working and I get a timed out message when fetching email messages.  After checking the server settings and password were correct the problem was not fixed, so I deleted the account and tried to re-add it in Thunderbird. The incoming and outgoing server settings are correct as is the password. I know the password is correct because I can successfully login to the account using webmail. I received the following error message on the ""Setup your Existing Email Address"" page. The message appears above the ""Checking Password"" button. </p><p>""Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsiMsgAccountManager.createIncomingServer] </p><p>The password on the account is 16 characters long and contains the following special characters: ""!#"" </p><p>I am using Thunderbird version 115.11.1 (64-bit) - on the esr channel </p><p>Can anyone help? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",kkaffy
