Once upon a time, there was an add-on that allowed Thunderbird users to export a simple list containing account info including login names and passwords. I think it quit working around version 57 of TB. Since then, it would appear that several users have inquired about how to do that export, and the general answers are either ""use the import/export function"" or ""you can't do that anymore, 'cause we don't want you to,"" or something equally off putting. As many users note, the Import/Export function is a shotgun approach, and doesn't really address the matter of getting username and password - let alone a simple list thereof. And it's not recommended for profiles over 2GB, which could be the majority of users, these days. And so, on to the questions: Is there now, in 2024, or will there be, a feature or add-on of Mozilla's Thunderbird that will allow a user to export a simple list of usernames and passwords to a readable file, like CSV or TXT or XLSX or ODT? If so, when? If not, why not? Thanks, again (again). </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1656064;1656119;1656126;1656155;1656187;,tutorpb
