Right click the message folder, select properties and then use the repair button. That should fix the indexing issue underlying most of those types of issues.   2.

Scanning in the profile folder while the program is running is a primary cause of issues.  It may well also have been at the root of your issues with outlook.  Whilst none of your issues with outlook are all that unusual and antivirus products generally respect outlook better than Thunderbird it would not surprise me at all if it was the problem all along. </p><p>While the presenter in this youtube video is new to me, he is saying what many others are about antivirus and VPN software.
