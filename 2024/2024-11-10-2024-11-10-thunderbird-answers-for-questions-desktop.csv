So if you want to send using eg: hotmail email address or domain address - then make sure it is set up as the primary email address. But then if you have an <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account as well, it will only be able to send using the primary email address. So choose the email address which you want to set up as 'primary'. </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>3.</strong> In Thunderbird, Cookies must be enabled in order to set up Oauth. </p> <ul><li>     Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li>     Check under Web Content - </li><li>     Select: 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Accept third party cookies' 'Always' </li><li>     Click on 'Exceptions' button next to Accept cookies from sites to make sure you are not blocking cookies from Microsoft sites, such as&nbsp;:<a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">office365.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.live.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.msn.com</a>  </li></ul> <p><strong>4. </strong>In Thunderbird....When creating account or if account is created but you need to check server settings: Account Settings must use the following: Server Type:  <strong>POP</strong> Mail Server </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port 995 </li><li>     User Name: your domain email address </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/LTS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2  </li></ul> <p>Server Type: <strong> IMAP</strong> Mail Server </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port 993 </li><li>     User Name: your domain email address </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/LTS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2  </li></ul> <p><strong>SMTP:</strong> </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port: 587 </li><li>     Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li>     Authentication method: OAuth2 </li><li>     User Name: your domain email address (Please note this must be whatever email address is set up as the 'primary' email address, so if you have eg: <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email address as 'primary' then you have to use the outlook email address for smtp)  </li></ul> <p>Once you have all these settings and got the password sorted. </p><p>Restart Thunderbird When you get the Microsoft pop up window asking for password, type it in and click on 'Sign in'.

I could barely read them and if this is what I need to do to make Thunderbird work for my situation then I'm afraid I'll need to pass on Thunderbird. In case you've misunderstood I'll try again to describe my situation: As an artist/author I've been advised to use my domain which is <a href=""http://www.arbrador.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.arbrador.com</a> to create an email address that is different from my gmail account. So I worked with Go Daddy to set up an address at Office365. They said it would be on Outlook. The problem is I'm finding it awkward to have to check two different places to check both my gmail and outlook accounts. I've been missing many important Outlook messages because I fail to check it. So I've defaulted to using my gmail address for almost everything which is not recommended. Jane Friedman of the Electric Speed newsletter recommended Thunderbird because she has multiple email addresses. So I thought Thunderbird might solve this problem. OK does my explanation help? Perhaps it is not possible to have two disparate email accounts in one system like Thunderbird? Thanks again for all you put into your explanation and perhaps there is a relatively simple way of achieving this. </p>",arbrador,false,0,0

I currently have four one is my ISP, another is gmail, I also have a website, my own domain email address and my other half also has their email address.  </p><p>So you have your own domain email address and it's on the microsoft office365 server. </p><p>Let's do this in stages. <strong>Stage one:</strong> Start by getting that account ready to be accessed by a third party client client. It means sorting out 3 things </p> <ol><li> Passwords </li><li> Primary account </li><li> allowing Pop/Imap access to account. </li></ol> <p>You should have a microsoft account which you logon to see your various email addresses held on office365 server.  You would be using a browser to logon. </p><p>Logon to that microsoft account via a browser. </p><p><em>Email addresses associated with your Microsoft account are called <strong>aliases </strong> - such as your email for your own domain - and they use the same contacts, online storage, subscriptions, and account settings. </em> </p><p><em>You can use any of your aliases to sign in to Microsoft services or your Windows devices, and you can select any of them for sending and receiving email. <strong>Your aliases share a single password</strong>.</em> </p><p>The 'microsoft account' will have a password and it needs to be the same password you use for your domain email address.  </p><p>Part 1: - make sure you have both using the same password. </p><p>Part 2: - You would also need to ensure the email address for your domain is set up as 'primary'. This link is all about adding phone numbers etc - ignore that - but it has a good image showing what is 'primary', so you can see what I mean by 'alias' accounts/email addresses and what is set as 'primary'. </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/account-billing/how-to-add-an-email-address-or-phone-number-to-your-microsoft-account-1898efcd-3f0a-6646-46d8-5b681999e047"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/account-billing/how-to-add-an-email-address-or-phone-number-to-your-microsoft-account-1898efcd-3f0a-6646-46d8-5b681999e047</a> </li></ul> <p>Part 3:  -You would also  need to make sure that Pop/Imap has been enabled for access.

But before I tackle them I want to make sure you understand my goal: Will I be able to view messages from gmail and office365 in the same inbox? Or would I still need to click on two separate windows to access each account? If so I may as well just have an icon for office365 [lora@arbrador.com] on my dock as I do for gmail [arbrador@gmail.com] and go back and forth between the two. I was hoping to merge the two into one window so I would not forget to check office365 which I now forget to do and am missing important messages. Thanks so much again! Lora </p>,arbrador,false,0,0

This is usually the email address of the account. Below it, there are folders specifically for that account eg: Inbox, Drafts, Sent....etc </p><p>Each mail account has it's own set of folders. Each mail account is listed one below the other. I've added an image that show how I've got several email addresses listed as mail accounts. I just select the relevant folder to see emails.  </p><p>It is also possible to use something called 'Unified folders' option. It's just a variation showing you a different view option.  This creates virtual folders for all the default folders eg: Inbox. So the Virtual Inbox contains everything in all the Inboxes of all accounts. </p><p>There is also something called 'Tags' - in various folders in various accounts you may have set some emails as eg: Important. By enabling 'Tags' in the Folder Pane you can select 'Important' and it acts like a filter and offers a virtual view of all emails in all folders in all mail accounts that have the tag 'Important' applied. So in first image I enabled it to display - just to show you what it looks like. It's at the bottom. </p><p>The point is this - no matter what 'view' option you want to use in Thunderbird, in one view you see all mail accounts. There is only one window when you run Thunderbird. That's why people use Third party email clients. So they can access all their various email addresses which may be on various servers in one view. Look at the images I've attached as they may give you better idea of what occurs. </p><p>Please note - you may notice some things are a bit different from your view - I've altered the background and chnaged the '+New Message' button to say 'Write'. I've also enabled the 'Menu Bar' toolbar and used code tomove it to the top. But it's still the 'File, Edit, View etc... If you want that 'Menu Bar' enabled and I would advise this as it makes life a lot easier. click on the 'menu app icon' (3 lines) &gt; 'View' &gt; 'Toolbars' &gt; select 'Menu Bar' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
