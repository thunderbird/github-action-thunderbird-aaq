It's available at <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/</a> </p><p>Version 132.0 has no release notes, no change log, no announcements and nothing on the main website because it is the build out for when monthly releases becomes ""production"". At present it is a place holder and anything you find for download should be considered beta in terms of quality and function. Until monthly versions are formally announced these are literally equivalent to beta, not recommended for production. If you want to use pre-release software you are better off using beta which will get frequent fixes, monthlies will not. </p><p>Version 128esr is being delivered via the ESR channel. Users will eventually be able to choose monthly releases, which will be announced when all the pieces are in place. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
