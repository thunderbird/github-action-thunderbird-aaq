I could barely read them and if this is what I need to do to make Thunderbird work for my situation then I'm afraid I'll need to pass on Thunderbird. In case you've misunderstood I'll try again to describe my situation: As an artist/author I've been advised to use my domain which is <a href=""http://www.arbrador.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.arbrador.com</a> to create an email address that is different from my gmail account. So I worked with Go Daddy to set up an address at Office365. They said it would be on Outlook. The problem is I'm finding it awkward to have to check two different places to check both my gmail and outlook accounts. I've been missing many important Outlook messages because I fail to check it. So I've defaulted to using my gmail address for almost everything which is not recommended. Jane Friedman of the Electric Speed newsletter recommended Thunderbird because she has multiple email addresses. So I thought Thunderbird might solve this problem. OK does my explanation help? Perhaps it is not possible to have two disparate email accounts in one system like Thunderbird? Thanks again for all you put into your explanation and perhaps there is a relatively simple way of achieving this. </p>",arbrador,false,0,0
