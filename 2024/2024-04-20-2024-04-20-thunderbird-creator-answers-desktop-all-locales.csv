You see, there is one thing missing from your helpdesk and avenues for contribution: The option to contribute MEANING and PURPOSE. My contribution is to tell you KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid. This is a timely contribution. With every new Thunderbird version come more bells and whistles, most if not all of which are not useful, or only useful to a few. I admonish you instead to take a closer look at the programs' foundation. Several basic issues are still not working, or addressed. For instance, the annoying fact that drafts are not purged from the draft folder when sent. Or that headers/content are more and more frequently garbled when my inbox grow. And it is harder and harder to find the ""repair"" button. Or that I manually have to undo ""sort by threaded"" every single time I want to view an email from a particular sender. Or the fact that the main page of Thunderbird has to be called up from the taskbar every time I want to view it - the main window disappears between viewings, even though individual drafts or emails remain open.  Or that the advanced search function - which used to be easy to find - now is hidden inside another menu, non-intuitively. There are too many options for keeping good things as they are, and NOT trying to change things all the time. This is hard for young, eager programmers to understand, but if this fact is not appreciated Thunderbird will grow less and less interesting and useful. Remember KISS, and read up on Occams' razor.

Luckily our local support were able to restore the affected folders. BUT - every time I opened the restored folders in Thunderbird, all the restored messages would disappear again. Correspondingly, the support team can see at this time large numbers of messages being deleted. </p><p>I've tried to delete the affected mail account from Thunderbird - didn't help. I've hidden my profile and started Thunderbird from scratch, set up the mail account again (so there should have been no leftover information from any previous instance of the account) - didn't help. I can see that whenever I open a folder for the first time, Thunderbird says ""Compacting"" - this is even though I have ""Always ask before compacting"" set. Even after I turn off automatic compacting for space saving &gt;20MB, Thunderbird still compacts when it first sees a folder. </p><p>I have verified this behaviour by connecting to the same mail server using alpine - I see messages flagged for deletion in the restored folder; as soon as Thunderbird touches the folder, they disappear (even though no compacting should be happening and I should be prompted before it does, see above). Conversely, if I remove the ""to delete"" mark from the messages using alpine and then open a folder in Thunderbird, the messages are visible there. </p><p>From my understanding of what Thunderbird should be doing when compacting (or rather when not compacting), I would say the behaviours I've seen are rather significant bugs. But if I've misunderstood and there is some other way to stop Thunderbird from purging messages marked for deletion, I would be grateful for any advice. </p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1648627;1648712;1648713;1648846;1648908;,peter.sollich
