El Thunderbird 127 era una versión Beta actualmente esta en la versión 128, pero según el calendario de release de Thunderbird la versión 127 no se lanzara como estable, en su lugar será la versión 128 ESR: <a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/06/may-2024-community-office-hours-the-thunderbird-release-process/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/06/may-2024-community-office-hours-the-thunderbird-release-process/</a> </p><p>Si se ha resuelto la consulta agradeceríamos marcar como solucionada para que sirva a otros usuarios. ¡Gracias! </p>",pcp04,false,0,0

I presume it is at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird - exit thunderbird and copy the 'thunderbird folder else where for safety - DO THIS AFTER exiting thunderbird - now uninstall both version. if prompted to removed data, do NOT  - now install the preferred version. it should start with the right profile. if not, exit thunderbird, and then copy the backup of the thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overlay what is there - start thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I should have added to my original post that I store my Thunderbird emails on a different physical drive (D:), which is a regular hard drive, while the program itself (along with Windows and all my other programs) is stored on an SSD (C:). I set it up that way to make data backups easier since all data is on the hard drive (D:). I also wanted to reduce wear and tear on the SSD from constantly downloading emails to that drive. </p><p>What I didn't fully appreciate is that Thunderbird *really* seems to want my profile on the C: drive. </p><p>I have deleted both Thunderbird programs and installed the current version from the TB website. The problem I'm having now is trying to get TB to connect with my profile on the hard drive. When I set that profile as the default and try to use it, I get this pop-up: </p>",adlerkralle,false,0,0
