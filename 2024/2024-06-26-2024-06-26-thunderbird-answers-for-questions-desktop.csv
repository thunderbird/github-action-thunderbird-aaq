Funny thing is that I had been getting update notices for Thunderbird in Patch My PC for quite a few months, but many times no update was downloaded by it and often the update listed was the same version of TB that was already on my system. I agree about letting TB do its own updates. There is some weirdness going on with Patch My PC and Thunderbird. </p>",adlerkralle,false,0,0
