You are now in the profile. EXIT thunderbird. Look for prefs.js. if you see other files, such as prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js, etc., that is an indicator. These are simple text files and can be read with Notepad. Starting with the one with highest number, browse to see if it contains all of your accounts.
