I see the folder it gets stuck on (also my sent messages folder), but, as far as I know I have no ability to control the folders being indexed, correct? So I'd have to stash the contents of that folder outside of Thunderbird to prevent it from being indexed, I believe. </p><p><em><strong>Update</strong></em> - I did the ""Repair folder"" under ""Properties"" for each folder the index was getting stuck on. Eventually, the indexing was able to make it through all my mail. So, yay? </p>",chris590,false,0,0
