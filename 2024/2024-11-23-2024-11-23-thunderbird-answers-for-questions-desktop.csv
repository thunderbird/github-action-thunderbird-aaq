You are now in the profile. EXIT thunderbird. Look for prefs.js. if you see other files, such as prefs-1.js, prefs-2.js, etc., that is an indicator. These are simple text files and can be read with Notepad. Starting with the one with highest number, browse to see if it contains all of your accounts. If so, move the other similarly-named files elsewhere as backup (in case you picked the wrong one) and rename this one to prefs.js and restart thunderbird.

One is ""HTML"" the next is ""simple"" and the third is ""text"".   </p><p>When he changed the choice to HTML we got the notification bar and ""option"" back on thunderbird. This is not something that I would ever have tried and if anybody else has the same problem it is worth noting. </p><p>I am not sure how the setting got changed in the first place -possible some update - very unlikely that my wife would have done this even by accident. </p><p>Thank you again for such a prompt response. </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Ron </p>",macofglencoe,false,0,0
