It is as if they are place-holders that are then never populated. I've attached a screen shot showing some of these tabs, with the crash report tab open and displayed. </p><p>About 1-2 months ago I reindexed folders due to mail apparently being missing and this resulted in a huge number of messages that had previously been dealt with becoming marked as unread again.  </p><p>Ideally I would like the blank tabs to be reinstated and to be able to carry on working on my email from where I left off, but if this is not possible, I need to be able to identify the emails that were open in the tabs to be able to pick up the pieces. This is crucially important as I operate multiple accounts and it would be impossible for me to re-establish state any other way, especially in view of the earlier problem with email becoming marked as unread again. That would condemn me to needing to re-open many thousands of email items to identify those that may need action.  </p><p>I renamed global-messages-db.sqlite which has been recreated and rebuilt but nothing has changed. The rebuilt file is significantly smaller than the original and if this implies that there has been data loss, I would rather reinstate the original file, if it is safe to do so. </p><p>My best guess is that the tabs are defined within history.sqlite and I have made a copy of this file but superficially it appears to contain a lot more than just tabs and it has been updated since the crash. </p><p>The most recent change I made to my Thunderbird configuration before the crash was the addition of the British-English dictionary. </p><p>The next most recent change to my Thunderbird configuration was the addition of a Proton Mail account using Proton Mail Bridge. I am accessing this account on behalf of someone who has sustained serious injuries and is unable to access it themselves. If this added account or Proton Mail Bridge is implicated in the crash in any way, I would prefer to remove the account and the Bridge software. </p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help and guidance with this problem. </p><p>Nikita </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1633955;1634054;,sandvika

I've been using Thunderbird for 10+ years, and had never had a problem. Until now. It seems a problem with one of the recent T'bird updates. PLEASE FIX. It should be simple and clear for someone to elect to thread or unthread messages in their inbox, and all of the latest emails should display at the top (or bottom, however you display your emails). </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1633900;,GGG

Sometimes the new email does not actually relate to that subject line, so those new emails wind up being buried under that old subject at some earlier date and essentially untraceable once closed.  How may I undo this default filtering and maintain all emails received in chronological order?  Thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1634511;,timothy_brosnan
