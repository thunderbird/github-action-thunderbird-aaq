If I block delete them it will take days to complete. So 3 questions 1. How do I stop duplicate emails in my trash. After deleting many reappear with the date 01/01/1970 2. Is there a faster way of deleting. I use select email&gt;shift key&gt;find last email&gt;delete 3. Is there a limit to how many emails I can put into the block mentioned in #2 </p><p>Image attached at </p><p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/a6a1nhtyk7yorro3321kf/tbird-delete.pdf?rlkey=aal9y6e74rn3qb0r7v50mctco&amp;dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">link text</a> </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",keithinoz1

I was told it was because it was so old, the security protocols were out of date. I bought the latest iMac (M3 chip) but I still can't download my email. I can send an email from the Mac, and I receive emails on my iPhone, just not my computer. I have the latest version of Thunderbird. 115.7.0 (64 bit). I have deleted some emails, and those will re-download (which is weird) but nothing new. It will show on the bottom left ""downloading 1 of 538"", but never downloads.  </p><p>Please help!  </p><p>Jack. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jaclby
