I was told it was because it was so old, the security protocols were out of date. I bought the latest iMac (M3 chip) but I still can't download my email. I can send an email from the Mac, and I receive emails on my iPhone, just not my computer. I have the latest version of Thunderbird. 115.7.0 (64 bit). I have deleted some emails, and those will re-download (which is weird) but nothing new. It will show on the bottom left ""downloading 1 of 538"", but never downloads.  </p><p>Please help!  </p><p>Jack. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jaclby
