I was told it was because it was so old, the security protocols were out of date. I bought the latest iMac (M3 chip) but I still can't download my email. I can send an email from the Mac, and I receive emails on my iPhone, just not my computer. I have the latest version of Thunderbird. 115.7.0 (64 bit). I have deleted some emails, and those will re-download (which is weird) but nothing new. It will show on the bottom left ""downloading 1 of 538"", but never downloads.  </p><p>Please help!  </p><p>Jack. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jaclby

The same account can receive mail. Among the grants, I found a description that is also related to this. Someone also experienced the same thing in version 115. I read there in the answer that oaut authentication must be set in the smtp settings. I don't have such an option in the drop-down combo of authentication. What to do? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,hu,"",arpadhazy
