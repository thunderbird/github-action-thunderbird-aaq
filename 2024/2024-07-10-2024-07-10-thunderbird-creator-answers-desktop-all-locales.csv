The header fields remained -- ""From"", ""Subject"", etc. -- but the content pane for each email is a total blank. So I right-clicked on the Inbox folder, then ""Properties"", then ""Repair Folder"", and the result was that Thunderbird then deleted even the header fields of those thousands of emails from before July 2, 2024. So now, there's no trace of them, not even the header fields. Before July 2, 2024, there were more than 9,200 emails in the Inbox folder. Now (July 9, 2024) there are just over 100. Fortunately, none of the other folders seem to have been affected -- only the Inbox. So all the emails I transferred to those folders over more than 25 years are still there. Does anyone have a clue as to why Thunderbird would randomly delete almost everything in my Inbox, yet leave the contents of all the other folders intact (even the ""Sent"" folder)? Did Thunderbird do an automatic update on July 2, 2024 that may have caused this disaster? Is there any way I can get those emails back? I use a desktop PC running Windows 10. Thank you. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",wchaserblack

There was a response that said something about that not being a straightforward process, but no details were given on how to do it. </p><p>Most times that these hangs happen are when I start a quick search and it has Body included in the criteria. I have to kill it or else it just sits there forever. It's fairly frequent, but I also still can't get used to this new design and can't remember where things are. I want to revert or find something else. I've been using Thunderbird since Eudora went away. I do have emails saved under Local, as well as Gmail IMAP email for several accounts. </p><p>My current version is 115.12.2 (32-bit) on a 64-bit Windows 10 Pro Dell laptop. Some years ago I'd tried to go to the 64-bit version but for some reason it would not show up as installable. That may have been a previous laptop. I have a new laptop that I need to finish setting up. It's similar to this one, so maybe it would be better to use the old version ""fresh"" instead of reverting on the same laptop. IF someone can provide detailed instructions. </p>",install-and-update;,thunderbird,install-and-update,en-US,"",radarrab
