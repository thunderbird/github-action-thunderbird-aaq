The header fields remained -- ""From"", ""Subject"", etc. -- but the content pane for each email is a total blank. So I right-clicked on the Inbox folder, then ""Properties"", then ""Repair Folder"", and the result was that Thunderbird then deleted even the header fields of those thousands of emails from before July 2, 2024. So now, there's no trace of them, not even the header fields. Before July 2, 2024, there were more than 9,200 emails in the Inbox folder. Now (July 9, 2024) there are just over 100. Fortunately, none of the other folders seem to have been affected -- only the Inbox. So all the emails I transferred to those folders over more than 25 years are still there. Does anyone have a clue as to why Thunderbird would randomly delete almost everything in my Inbox, yet leave the contents of all the other folders intact (even the ""Sent"" folder)? Did Thunderbird do an automatic update on July 2, 2024 that may have caused this disaster? Is there any way I can get those emails back? I use a desktop PC running Windows 10. Thank you. </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",wchaserblack
