I found how to run ""troubleshooting mode"", which appears to disable all add-ons etc;t thanks for that also. However the same thing occured. A message comprising the one word ""test"", sent to myself, arrived virtually instantly as has been normal this past 30 years of my ownoinc computers.  The same single word message, only  to my wife.......is then very very slow to go.  Likewise if I send it somebosy else instead.  So it is only an email to myself that works normally.   An email to any other one individual, (or more) is slow to send.  And an email send to MY address (as in the first scanrio) but with even one added person, is immediately very slow again.  I get a little ""progress""  bar just to send one word.  My Broadband speed is fine. My computer is an I9 multi core very high spec, 3 months old , windows 11.  If that gives you any further clue I' be very grateful indeed to solve this issue. Especially as you clearly know more than I do, and are telling me that the rule is that Thunderbird treates every recipient the same. Something therefore is very wrong here for that rule to be so clearly ignored. It is way beyond my skills or understanding. Thank you again for your response. </p>",info897,false,0,0

My Local Folders missing problem has not been with ""Sent"" but with ""Sent Copies"" under Local Folders, but the view of Local Folders placed below the tree in ""Unified Folder"" mode....and not in the Local Folder placed below the tree in ""All Folder"" mode.  </p><p>That having been said, something unexpected and magical has happend. 30 minutes ago, Sent Copies once again became visible in the Local Folders view in when only Unified Folders is the chosen mode for the folder tree.  </p><p>So maybe it was the extra fiddling I did at your suggestion after clicking on some Unified Folders that did display a ""properties""...or maybe it was just some other mystery. But I now see two subfolders of Local Folders at bottom of Unified Folder mode list....Outbox and SentCopies...and that's all I need. So let's call it solved.  Thanks very much. </p>",kmartinp,false,0,0

Now, TB shows an OAuth2 menu item in the SMTP Authentication Method menu. So I set TB to OAuth2 on the inbound and outbound servers. However, when I use TB to check for incoming emails on this hotmail account, it prints ""Host contacted, sending login info"" and hangs. I might have to configure the hotmail account to enable it for OAuth2 but I don't know how. Any thoughts? Thank you&nbsp;! </p>",av2500,false,0,0
