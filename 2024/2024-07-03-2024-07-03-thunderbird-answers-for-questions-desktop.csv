Sometime antivirus product block this adapter as it was used to send spam 25years ago.

(b) I was unable to log on to my Microsoft account when my VPN (ExpressVPN) was running;  simply pausing the VPN while I logged on solved this, and my Hotmail is now working perfectly in Thunderbird with the VPN running and without being logged in to Microsoft.

I found how to run ""troubleshooting mode"", which appears to disable all add-ons etc;t thanks for that also. However the same thing occured. A message comprising the one word ""test"", sent to myself, arrived virtually instantly as has been normal this past 30 years of my ownoinc computers.  The same single word message, only  to my wife.......is then very very slow to go.  Likewise if I send it somebosy else instead.  So it is only an email to myself that works normally.   An email to any other one individual, (or more) is slow to send.  And an email send to MY address (as in the first scanrio) but with even one added person, is immediately very slow again.  I get a little ""progress""  bar just to send one word.  My Broadband speed is fine. My computer is an I9 multi core very high spec, 3 months old , windows 11.  If that gives you any further clue I' be very grateful indeed to solve this issue.

I don't plan to vary the included folders much in the future...I just want to restore Sent Copies to being visible in the Unified Folders listing for Local Folders.
