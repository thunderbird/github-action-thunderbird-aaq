I recreated a new folder under Local Folders and moved all the emails from the 'AA Saved Mail folder to that new folder.  Now I cannot find a way to delete the AA Saved Mail folder from its nested position.  I've Googled using many different search phrases but came up zero ways to do so.  How do I delete that nested folder? </p>,thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1682264;,eaglesoaring558
