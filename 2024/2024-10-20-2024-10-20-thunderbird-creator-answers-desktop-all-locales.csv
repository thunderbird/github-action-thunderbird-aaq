When I receive an email that has been sent from a cell phone I can read it the first time I look at it.  But if I go back to look at it again I just get a line that looks like this:  ""----_com.samsung.android.email_156839776575490--""    Any ideas why it is doing this? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",dbculp63
