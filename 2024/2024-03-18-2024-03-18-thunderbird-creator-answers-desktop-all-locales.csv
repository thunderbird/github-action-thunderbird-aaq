I had to reset Windows 10 and doing so my Thunderbird disappeared.  I am using High Contrast mode and sometimes white text gets hidden in a background color.  I was kind of expecting a text message. As I progressed through the set up screen I get error messages when I try to click on Done.  Above the Done box is some blue text that I can't read clearly.  The blue text generates a message about IMAP already being there when I click on Done.  There appears to be no correct way to click on Done.  When I click on Cancel my email pops up with Local Folders highlighted.  When I click on Inbox it looks like every thing is back to normal.  I do want to ask someone to add a vertical scrollbar to the setup screen.  Otherwise I have to go through the Windows Setting screens to resize everything to get it to fit on my desktop.  This also requires changing my font size for some reason.  At this point I am becoming really frustrated with Windows 10 - which Mozilla has nothing to do with. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",victorhart

I did it on one machine and immediately got this error. I went back to the old settings and things worked as they should.  After about 5 hours with the online chat help and having added 4 CNAME records at their request things were still the same.  They then said I need to pay $60 for a third party vendor to log onto my machine and find the issue. This point really got my back up. I added a new account using the all new settings and this one saves by default in the Local Folders. I added the account details to my works e mail which is in Outlook by company policy and it runs well with the settings they Domain Host provided. I have other machines still running the older settings that also seem to run just fine.   I have tried to point the save location to the sent mail folder under the account that's having trouble and still it says no box yet when checking properties I see it has a server address. That is imap://****%40****.com@netsol<a href=""http://-imap-oxcs.hostingplatform.com/INBOX/Sent"" rel=""nofollow"">-imap-oxcs.hostingplatform.com/INBOX/Sent</a> The * are inserted by me to cover my e mail address. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",bgos
