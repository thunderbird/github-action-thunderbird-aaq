I had to reset Windows 10 and doing so my Thunderbird disappeared.  I am using High Contrast mode and sometimes white text gets hidden in a background color.  I was kind of expecting a text message. As I progressed through the set up screen I get error messages when I try to click on Done.  Above the Done box is some blue text that I can't read clearly.  The blue text generates a message about IMAP already being there when I click on Done.  There appears to be no correct way to click on Done.  When I click on Cancel my email pops up with Local Folders highlighted.  When I click on Inbox it looks like every thing is back to normal.  I do want to ask someone to add a vertical scrollbar to the setup screen.  Otherwise I have to go through the Windows Setting screens to resize everything to get it to fit on my desktop.  This also requires changing my font size for some reason.  At this point I am becoming really frustrated with Windows 10 - which Mozilla has nothing to do with. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",victorhart

Or I have to click on an old message, then try again, click on another  message I've already viewed then scroll down to where the  new message is.    This morning, tried both several times, still couldn't see the new message that TB insists is there. 2.   At one time, when you opened TB, you were automatically taken to the end of all the messages in your inbox or if you fllter emails to folders, to the end of messages in that particular folder.   No more, you have to scroll down to the end.    Why?    It's a waste of time for me to do that and as far as I know, TB places no limit on the number of emails in an inbox so . . .  why was that changed?   Because it was user friendly?    In my search I noticed that there was one TB user who was so upset he/she/they wanted to return to v. 102.   I wonder how many people, seeing the response, also have returned to a previous version.
