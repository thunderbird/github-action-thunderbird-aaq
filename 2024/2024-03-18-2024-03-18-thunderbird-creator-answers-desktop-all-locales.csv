I had to reset Windows 10 and doing so my Thunderbird disappeared.  I am using High Contrast mode and sometimes white text gets hidden in a background color.  I was kind of expecting a text message. As I progressed through the set up screen I get error messages when I try to click on Done.  Above the Done box is some blue text that I can't read clearly.  The blue text generates a message about IMAP already being there when I click on Done.  There appears to be no correct way to click on Done.  When I click on Cancel my email pops up with Local Folders highlighted.  When I click on Inbox it looks like every thing is back to normal.  I do want to ask someone to add a vertical scrollbar to the setup screen.  Otherwise I have to go through the Windows Setting screens to resize everything to get it to fit on my desktop.  This also requires changing my font size for some reason.  At this point I am becoming really frustrated with Windows 10 - which Mozilla has nothing to do with. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",victorhart

I have noticed this happening with all the other clinics that use the same platform - they all show in my Thunderbird as being from Damini despite having the correct identification encoded in the email From header. </p><p>Is there some way I can fix this so that Thunderbird shows the correct source of the email? ie that it gives preference to the name encoded in the email rather than looking up the contact name for that email address? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Noel </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1642916;1643130;1643137;1643267;,noel29
