How do I bring everything back into a single profile location?,"<p>TB 115.10.1 I have several accounts which all work fine, however when I go in to Troubleshooting information and open my profile folder it is only 2Gb in size.  All my mail accounts and associated files are located in a separate 92Gb profile directory with the same profile name (I know where it is). I want to consolidate all this information in to a single profile directory on another faster SSD on my machine. </p><p>Creating a new profile mapped solely to a copy of the 92Gb profile folder copied to the new SSD doesn't work -no email accounts display.   </p><p>If I then add only the set of files in the main directory of my 2Gb profile in to the newly located copy of the 92Gb profile on the faster SSD all works fine, however if I add a new mail subfolder and I can see the name of that new sub folder is located back in the original 92Gb profile on the old hard drive. </p><p>How do I fix this?  The working 2Gb profile folder is mapping all my mail and accounts to a different location and I can't find out where TB gets the information telling it where the main mail store is.  I want to move this main mail store in to the location of my working profile and move the lot to the faster SSD.  Thanks for any suggestions. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",chris439

Here is some detail:  With a ""fresh"" invocation of Thunderbird, all incoming messages are received, in two different email accounts.  Outgoing messages can be sent. After a while (can be two days, can be a week or more), the following error message is received when sending an outgoing message: <em>Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent...</em> Once this error message happens, all incoming mail (for both email accounts) stops. If she then terminates Thunderbird, and restarts it, she will normally get an error message during the restart, which states that ""Thunderbird is already running, but is not responding.""  If she accepts to terminate this non-responding process, then the next restart of Thunderbird is successful, and she can receive (and send) messages again. The workaround (as noted in another posting) to save the sent message to a local folder allows the current outgoing message to be saved, and she can then copy the saved message to the proper ""Sent"" folder after she restarts Thunderbird.  However, this is very annoying---having to save locally and then recopy---especially if there are several messages in progress when the failure occurs.  In addition, it does not ""solve"" the problem; a restart is still necessary. A similar error message is presented sometimes, when Thunderbird is saving a draft message.  It speaks of ""a copy was not placed in your draft folder"" (or something similar; I don't remember the exact details).  When this error message appears, Thunderbird goes into the same state as above: no incoming messages are received, and a Thunderbird restart is the only fix. Please note that this problem has been showing up for at least the last six to eight months.  It seems to be getting more frequent, to the point where my wife now explicitly restarts Thunderbird every couple of days. Her environment: Windows 10 Enterprise; Dell tower; Thunderbird 128.4.2esr </p><p>I am also running Thunderbird on my laptop.  I have six email accounts.  I have never seen the above error message in relation to sending messages, although I have seen it concerning the saving of drafts.  However, I have never seen it prevent the receipt of incoming messages, the way my wife has. My environment: Windows 10 enterprise; Lenovo laptop; Thunderbird 115.3.1 </p><p>If there is a way to gather more extensive logs from my wife's computer, to aid in solving this problem, I will be happy to help.  Please tell me what to do, or put me in contact with appropriate persons. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",williamatwood41
