Here is some detail:  With a ""fresh"" invocation of Thunderbird, all incoming messages are received, in two different email accounts.  Outgoing messages can be sent. After a while (can be two days, can be a week or more), the following error message is received when sending an outgoing message: <em>Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent...</em> Once this error message happens, all incoming mail (for both email accounts) stops. If she then terminates Thunderbird, and restarts it, she will normally get an error message during the restart, which states that ""Thunderbird is already running, but is not responding.""  If she accepts to terminate this non-responding process, then the next restart of Thunderbird is successful, and she can receive (and send) messages again. The workaround (as noted in another posting) to save the sent message to a local folder allows the current outgoing message to be saved, and she can then copy the saved message to the proper ""Sent"" folder after she restarts Thunderbird.  However, this is very annoying---having to save locally and then recopy---especially if there are several messages in progress when the failure occurs.  In addition, it does not ""solve"" the problem; a restart is still necessary. A similar error message is presented sometimes, when Thunderbird is saving a draft message.  It speaks of ""a copy was not placed in your draft folder"" (or something similar; I don't remember the exact details).  When this error message appears, Thunderbird goes into the same state as above: no incoming messages are received, and a Thunderbird restart is the only fix. Please note that this problem has been showing up for at least the last six to eight months.  It seems to be getting more frequent, to the point where my wife now explicitly restarts Thunderbird every couple of days. Her environment: Windows 10 Enterprise; Dell tower; Thunderbird 128.4.2esr </p><p>I am also running Thunderbird on my laptop.  I have six email accounts.  I have never seen the above error message in relation to sending messages, although I have seen it concerning the saving of drafts.  However, I have never seen it prevent the receipt of incoming messages, the way my wife has. My environment: Windows 10 enterprise; Lenovo laptop; Thunderbird 115.3.1 </p><p>If there is a way to gather more extensive logs from my wife's computer, to aid in solving this problem, I will be happy to help.  Please tell me what to do, or put me in contact with appropriate persons. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",williamatwood41

All POP3 and SMTP settings are correct, verified. The problem appeared a few days ago, probably after an update. The problem with receiving is when I receive emails in bulk from all accounts by clicking the Download button (Download new messages for all accounts). They are downloaded from all servers, except Onet. This problem does not occur if I download messages from Onet by clicking in the menu File/Download messages from/account name. The problem with sending messages appears when after writing an email I click the Send button (Send this message). There is no problem if I click the File menu/Send later, and then in the Outgoing folder I click Send pending messages. Can anyone help me to solve this problem? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lamoral

I can't believe that, up until now, my outgoing messages were all just very short, but after a recent Thunderbird update I now am interrupted when composing an email message, with a notification that my message is being saved in the Drafts folder.  This is somewhat annoying, can that be turned off?  I have saved composed message to Drafts manually on many occasions, so I don't want to kill that function entirely, but I'd like to dispense with that pop-up notification that breaks my fragile train of thought.

This allows me to select several of the mostly junk emails together to delete them. I highlight the first email I want to delete, go to the last one and hit shift and click. Sometimes that can be over a hundred or so emails to delete at once. After selecting delete, sometimes they don't all delete. The email is no longer bolded as though I had read it, but only a portion of the selected actually delete. It sometimes takes 2, 3 or more times of selecting them to get them to all delete. This has just been recently, within the past few months that I have noticed this. Not a terrible problem, but curious as to why this happens. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",eknight
