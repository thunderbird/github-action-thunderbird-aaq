In my case, I'm politically and socially against the big billionaire corporates simply making more money to increase their power over people and governments. I've been using computers from before PCs and even managed a mainframe node for a major Australian government body. I got lazy, however, when Microsoft started producing programs that made it easier for everyone to submit to artificial intelligence. I'm also someone who appreciates the nuances of language in different cultures and even how words we use came from other languages and cultures.  Some very lazy or exclusive people may use written communication loosely, to encrypt and encode - to appeal to those wrapped up in their club-like comfort zones. I, however, have found that people all over the world would prefer to be taught or to learn how to speak and write in language that follows certain formal patterns and that includes all who want to learn different languages. I'm not saying that loose forms of communicating in new and diverse ways shouldn't be allowed. I like playing with word patterns and rap and poetry with no full-stops, commas and capital letters... but not as a serious scholar or even journalist.

Unfortunately, the crash reporter is unable to submit a report for this crash. </p><p>Details: Failed to move D:\tbportable-64bit\Data\profile\minidumps\2c7e1474-c831-45c7-8d3f-5ae576e7a336.dmp to C:\users\vern\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Crash Reports\Pending\2c7e1474-c831-45c7-8d3f-5ae576e7a336.dmp </p> <hr> <p>I noticed that in my ""C:\Users\vern\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Crash Reports"" folder, I do not have a ""pending"" subfolder but instead have an ""events"" folder. I use thunderbird Portable. Could the lack of a ""Crash"" folder be the reason the crash reporter is unable to write the crash report? </p>",vern5,false,0,0
