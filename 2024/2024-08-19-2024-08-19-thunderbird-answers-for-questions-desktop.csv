Definitions differ. </p><p>Are you using the Microsoft one <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/add-or-remove-an-email-alias-in-outlook-com-459b1989-356d-40fa-a689-8f285b13f1f2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/add-or-remove-an-email-alias-in-outlook-com-459b1989-356d-40fa-a689-8f285b13f1f2</a> </p><p>Notice they say it is an email address.  what they do not say,  is that if you use a mail client to send email for one of these ""alias"" addresses that they will strip the information inserted by the mail client and replace it with that of the primary registered alias as the message goes through their mail servers. </p><p>You are far netter off using it as a real email address and using the appropriate sign in information for that address in the SMTP as that avoids the whole stripping of name and email address data.  I will point out that they do not do this is you use their web page interface,  only mail clients. </p><p><br> So you need to have an outgoing server(SMTP) entry in account settings for each and every one of these ALIAS addresses and not use them as an Alias as such. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Click on the emails you want to delete one after the other to select them.  Press the delete key.
