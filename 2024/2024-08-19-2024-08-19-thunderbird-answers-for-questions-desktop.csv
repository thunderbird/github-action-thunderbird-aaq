I will point out that they do not do this is you use their web page interface,  only mail clients. </p><p><br> So you need to have an outgoing server(SMTP) entry in account settings for each and every one of these ALIAS addresses and not use them as an Alias as such. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I assume the questioner simply went to another program. I like Thunderbird but I'm becoming more and more annoyed by the lack of support (and I mean real support) for genuine problems.  I'm an English teacher. I always use upper-case/capital letters at the start of my sentences because sentences start with capital letters. Thunderbird doesn't do this. It should. An add-on is not the answer.  I'll rephrase my question. Why does Thunderbird change the first letter - when the user uses the Shift key to make it upper-case - back to lower-case? Because Thunderbird does this, what's the best way to train it to use and even accept capital letters at the beginning of sentences? </p>",drickar,false,0,0
