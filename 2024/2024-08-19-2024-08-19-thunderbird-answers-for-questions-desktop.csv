I'm an English teacher. I always use upper-case/capital letters at the start of my sentences because sentences start with capital letters. Thunderbird doesn't do this. It should. An add-on is not the answer.  I'll rephrase my question. Why does Thunderbird change the first letter - when the user uses the Shift key to make it upper-case - back to lower-case?

In my case, I'm politically and socially against the big billionaire corporates simply making more money to increase their power over people and governments. I've been using computers from before PCs and even managed a mainframe node for a major Australian government body. I got lazy, however, when Microsoft started producing programs that made it easier for everyone to submit to artificial intelligence. I'm also someone who appreciates the nuances of language in different cultures and even how words we use came from other languages and cultures.  Some very lazy or exclusive people may use written communication loosely, to encrypt and encode - to appeal to those wrapped up in their club-like comfort zones. I, however, have found that people all over the world would prefer to be taught or to learn how to speak and write in language that follows certain formal patterns and that includes all who want to learn different languages. I'm not saying that loose forms of communicating in new and diverse ways shouldn't be allowed. I like playing with word patterns and rap and poetry with no full-stops, commas and capital letters... but not as a serious scholar or even journalist.  Don't bother to answer with any more patronising or paternalistic 'suggestions'.

Verify that. I am assumng a POP account will be in Mail folder and an IMAP account in imapmail folder.

ChatGPT is already offering it.  When you ask about a calendar it talks about an addon.  Thunderbird calendar ceased being an addon in version 78 in 2020.
