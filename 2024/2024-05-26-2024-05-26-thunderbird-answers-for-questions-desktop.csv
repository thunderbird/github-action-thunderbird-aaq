If Outlook continues to work well, I will then abandon Thunderbird. </p><p>Although Outlook appears to do exactly the same thing as Thunderbird, there are some things that are not obvious. For one, it was more difficult to add attachments, and when I figured it out, it put the pictures in the email instead of merely as attachments. More study required. </p><p>Also, the interface isn't quite as elegant as Thunderbird, but I can live with that. </p><p>I will keep you posted if anything untoward happens, but if a couple of weeks go by without hearing from me, you will know that all is well..... </p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.... </p><p>Bud </p>",budizen,false,0,0
