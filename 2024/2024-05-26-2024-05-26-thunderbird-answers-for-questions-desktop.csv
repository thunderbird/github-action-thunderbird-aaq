I use a AMD FX-6300 six core processor which could operate a 64 bit operating system, but I installed Windows 10 32-bit in order to support some legacy software and hardware. Thunderbird used to operate satisfactorily until recently. In addition to the blank drop-down menus, I am also plagued by ""You haven't set up a chat account"" with its inoperative buttons. </p><p>I have an old laptop with Thunderbird 6 installed which I may have to resort to. I re-installed Thunderbird 115 yet again, but this gave only partial short-lived relief. Thunderbird is quite slow to load alongside these present troubles. </p>",ksw40,false,0,0

I mention that, since that is why you are using the 32-bit version. I also suggest checking what software might be interfering with Thunderbird; often, that is caused by well-meaning antivirus products. What you're experiencing doesn't fit in normal problem areas, and that is why I'm thinking something else is happening here, since you state that Thunderbird works, and then it doesn't. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
