That is a choice of Google,  not the Thunderbird folk.  If you have two factor authentication,  you might have to disable it while you add your account,  but having it working  you should be able to simply change to oauth and it will step you through the process of authenticating. </p><p>Right click the folder  you are having issues with (except the italic ones) and in properties make sure you are set to include the folders when getting mail. </p><p>Check in your google settings here <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels</a> that the specific labels are enabled to show in IMAP.

I've tried to get OAuth2 for IMAP, and when I configure it, a separate window pops up to click 'Allow' for Thunderbird to have access.  I click 'Allow' and it defaults to the localhost website.   </p><p>Down at the bottom of the thunderbird window, it notes ""Sending Login Information..."" and will sit there for several hours. If I close the previously 'allow' window, the error 'Authentication failure while connecting to server  <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>. </p><p>I ran back through the configuration, and the hints at the bottom (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-gmail"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-gmail</a>) without any change.   </p><p>IMAP is enabled in my gmail by default.
