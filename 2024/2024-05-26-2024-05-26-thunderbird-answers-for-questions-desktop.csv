I've searched my sent folder and I know I sent Melissa a message but nothing shows up when I include the body in the search.  Until recently this didn't happen. </p>",rj180,false,0,0

That is a choice of Google,  not the Thunderbird folk.  If you have two factor authentication,  you might have to disable it while you add your account,  but having it working  you should be able to simply change to oauth and it will step you through the process of authenticating. </p><p>Right click the folder  you are having issues with (except the italic ones) and in properties make sure you are set to include the folders when getting mail. </p><p>Check in your google settings here <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels</a> that the specific labels are enabled to show in IMAP.

You probably filed for support on the site for fee-paid services, which does not include Thunderbird.  Second, I suggest you just reinstall thunderbird to stabilize where you are and then report issues. (Note: I do not understand the 32-bit x64 comment.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If using Windows, that would be at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird   (not generally needed, but I like being safe.)  Now download and install thunderbird. It will overlay any remaining remnants. I have no idea what may have deleted the prior version, possibly an antivirus program? </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Some such software removes software without notifying the user, and that seems to be happening to you. A possibility is to see how to exclude some programs from being monitored.  I wish you well. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
