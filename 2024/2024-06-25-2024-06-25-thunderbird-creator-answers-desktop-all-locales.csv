This resulted in some apps being deleted. One of which was the Firefox email. Inspite of many attempts to reinstate it I have had no success. There is great difficulty in finding what to do to reinstall.  There are assumptions that I have particular information. Other than our 3 email addresses we do have any code numbers or passwords, as these to were also lost. As it has been several days since the ""repair"" the inability to access Firefox with historic emails is now creating a number of serious issues.  I need urgent help in reinstalling our Firefox email. My inability to find that one person who I know can help is out there. The FAQ were of no help. The request how to reinstall Firefox does not appear to be a FAQ. Ross. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",croquetross

The result is the same whether I enter my password on Thunderbird or not. </p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Thunderbird, and downgraded to an older version.
