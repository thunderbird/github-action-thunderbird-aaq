The only factor that jumps out at me for our case is ESET that someone mentioned.  While I did compact all folders last night, I'm pretty sure this is the first time it's been done so unless TB is set up to compact automatically, this wouldn't seem to apply in our case. Also, while this laptop is creating Inbox-* files, my Toshiba laptop is creating and storing nstmp-* folders. (If I understand it correctly, these are the temporary backup folders and these are being created/saved because the backup was interrupted?) </p><p>So, do I need to log this somewhere as a bug and ask for a fix or will those of you in-the-know do that? and, in the meantime is it safe to just delete these files as they are created?

All my TB emails initially went to my TB inbox. </em> </p><p>The mail account above 'Local Folders' account is your imap mail account. Image shows 27 new mail in 'Inbox'. It looks like you may have a gmail account because gmail use a folder called 'All Mail'. There are a few other servers that use the gmail format.  It does look a bit odd because the 'Spam' folder is missing and you have two folders that are used as 'Archive' - which is incorrect.  'Please note gmail consider the 'All Mail' as the default archive because that's where it stores all your emails. </p><p>Gmail stores every email in the 'All Mail' folder. Incoming, outgoing and archived (any email that does not have a label attached). Gmail understands that putting everything in one folder is about as useless as it gets, so they invented something called 'labels'. Labels are a type of 'tag' which is applied to the emails stored in 'All MAil'. Depending upon what 'label' has been applied, a virtual copy of that email stored in 'All Mail' can get put into the relevant 'label'.  That means all incoming tend to get the  'label' called 'Inbox' or 'Spam'. It means emails can now be displayed in a manner that's more logical to the user and can be easier to organise and locate. It also means you can apply as many 'labels' as you like to any particular email and see virtual copy in various folders. In the webmail account those 'labels' look like a more conventional folder hierachy.  </p><p>Thunderbird has no concept of 'labels', so in an imap account, all folders synchronise with server and download whatever is in each 'label' and it stores them in 'mbox' files that appear as Folders in the Folder Pane.  Those emails that are in the imap 'Inbox' are not virtual copies.  So by subscribing to see 'All MAil', it means you have downloaded everything twice.  As emails on server are only stored in one location, it means if you delete anything from 'All Mail' it will get deleted from all other folders because it no longer exists. If you delete emails, they must get put into the server 'Trash' folder which in some cases may be called 'Bin'. Gmail will then auto empty the 'TRash' periodically, so in effect you never need to manually empty the Trash unless you really want to. If you choose to delete and do not put emails into Trash - you by-pass the Trash - gmail understands that instruction to mean remove label and keep in 'All Mail' as if archived. </p><p>Most people do not subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder purely because it doubles up everything and if your Anti-Virus decided to try and fix that mbox file, you stand a good chance of losing everything in the imap account and on the server. So if you want o keep seeingit, then do make sure your anti-virus is not allowed anywhere near your profile and if you do allow scanning then never let it fix anything it finds. </p><p>It's important to see all the server folders otherwise you might miss incoming mail that has been auto directed to the server spam folder.  I suggest you subscribe to see the 'Spam' folder. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:I don't know what the area ""below the Local Folders"" is called so I have used that description.  In the uploaded image from W10 is a portion of that area. If you know what that area is called, could you please inform me?</em> </p><p>It's displaying all the various folders in the 'Local Folders' account. 'Trash' and 'Outbox' are default created folders. 'Outbox' is used by all accounts if you choose 'Send Later' when creating emails. All the other folders you created eg: 1931 Census </p><p>To access any of those folders you click on the folder eg: 1931 Census and it will display list of emails it contains in the 'Message List' Pane. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;: In W10, right clicking Local Folders allowed new Folders to be created and a few emails from Inbox were copied/moved to those folders. In effect, this was a way of saving those emails.  </em> </p><p>Imap account folders synchronise with server to display whatever is stored on server, so in effect they are not truelly independent copies. Getting copies of emails from an imap folder put into 'Local Folders' account means you then have a copy stored on your computer which is totally independent of the server. </p><p><br> The image you have uploaded was from a W10 computer. But you seem to be talking about a W11 computer. </p><p>Can I presume you talking about two entirely different computers? Are you saying you can see a load of folders in W10, but not in W11&nbsp;?

Everything. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:The download from Mozilla TB did not create a SPAM folder,  but there is a TRASH folder.  So are the two the same?</em> </p><p>No, they are not the same. If set up initially as an Imap account then all the default server folders should be auto subscribed and seen. You also should not have two folders set up for Archives. </p><p>In Thunderbird you need to get that 'Spam' folder sorted because gmail/ whatever server..do usually auto empty Trash and Spam periodically and there's nothing more annoying that missing good emails that gmail thought were spam. </p><p>In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li>     Right click on imap mail account name folder </li><li>     Select 'Subscribe' -See image below as guide - it's an older version but  'Subscribe' is still in same location. </li><li>     click on 'Refresh' </li><li>     Select 'Spam' </li><li>     click on 'Subscribe' </li><li>     Click on 'OK'  </li></ul> <p>Report back on whether Spam is now showing in Folder Pane on <strong>W10 </strong>computer. </p><p>Before you transfer everything - maybe you should check a couple of things first on the W10. Can you post the following: </p><p><strong>W10 computer:</strong> </p> <ul><li> In Thunderbird </li><li> Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Scroll down to 'Mail and News Accounts' section </li><li> Copy all the data in that section and paste it into this forum question. </li></ul> <p>It means I can check that a Pop account has not been altered into an Imap account. In other words, it was initially set up as Imap from the start and is still Imap. I can also see what server you are using which helps to understand whats going on. </p><p>Then can you logon to your webmail account via a browser. I need to see the entire list of folders usually displayed on the left.  Create an image file of what you see and upload image file to this forum question. This will help me understand what should be displayed in the imap account. </p><p>If you are using a gmail server then I would expect something like the image below. It's an image of my gmail webmail in  'Settings' &gt; 'Labels' You can see all the default folders are at the top and all the 'labels' are below (they display as folders in the imap account). You can see how I have all the folders I created are selected to 'Show in Imap' </p><p>I'm wondering why you have the 'Archives' folder - I created a 'Label' called 'OldStore' where I keep archived emails because if I use 'All Mail' then they get mixed up with everything. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
