The only factor that jumps out at me for our case is ESET that someone mentioned.  While I did compact all folders last night, I'm pretty sure this is the first time it's been done so unless TB is set up to compact automatically, this wouldn't seem to apply in our case. Also, while this laptop is creating Inbox-* files, my Toshiba laptop is creating and storing nstmp-* folders. (If I understand it correctly, these are the temporary backup folders and these are being created/saved because the backup was interrupted?) </p><p>So, do I need to log this somewhere as a bug and ask for a fix or will those of you in-the-know do that? and, in the meantime is it safe to just delete these files as they are created?

All my TB emails initially went to my TB inbox. </em> </p><p>The mail account above 'Local Folders' account is your imap mail account. Image shows 27 new mail in 'Inbox'. It looks like you may have a gmail account because gmail use a folder called 'All Mail'. There are a few other servers that use the gmail format.  It does look a bit odd because the 'Spam' folder is missing and you have two folders that are used as 'Archive' - which is incorrect.  'Please note gmail consider the 'All Mail' as the default archive because that's where it stores all your emails. </p><p>Gmail stores every email in the 'All Mail' folder. Incoming, outgoing and archived (any email that does not have a label attached). Gmail understands that putting everything in one folder is about as useless as it gets, so they invented something called 'labels'. Labels are a type of 'tag' which is applied to the emails stored in 'All MAil'. Depending upon what 'label' has been applied, a virtual copy of that email stored in 'All Mail' can get put into the relevant 'label'.  That means all incoming tend to get the  'label' called 'Inbox' or 'Spam'. It means emails can now be displayed in a manner that's more logical to the user and can be easier to organise and locate. It also means you can apply as many 'labels' as you like to any particular email and see virtual copy in various folders. In the webmail account those 'labels' look like a more conventional folder hierachy.  </p><p>Thunderbird has no concept of 'labels', so in an imap account, all folders synchronise with server and download whatever is in each 'label' and it stores them in 'mbox' files that appear as Folders in the Folder Pane.  Those emails that are in the imap 'Inbox' are not virtual copies.  So by subscribing to see 'All MAil', it means you have downloaded everything twice.  As emails on server are only stored in one location, it means if you delete anything from 'All Mail' it will get deleted from all other folders because it no longer exists. If you delete emails, they must get put into the server 'Trash' folder which in some cases may be called 'Bin'. Gmail will then auto empty the 'TRash' periodically, so in effect you never need to manually empty the Trash unless you really want to. If you choose to delete and do not put emails into Trash - you by-pass the Trash - gmail understands that instruction to mean remove label and keep in 'All Mail' as if archived. </p><p>Most people do not subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder purely because it doubles up everything and if your Anti-Virus decided to try and fix that mbox file, you stand a good chance of losing everything in the imap account and on the server. So if you want o keep seeingit, then do make sure your anti-virus is not allowed anywhere near your profile and if you do allow scanning then never let it fix anything it finds. </p><p>It's important to see all the server folders otherwise you might miss incoming mail that has been auto directed to the server spam folder.  I suggest you subscribe to see the 'Spam' folder. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:I don't know what the area ""below the Local Folders"" is called so I have used that description.  In the uploaded image from W10 is a portion of that area. If you know what that area is called, could you please inform me?</em> </p><p>It's displaying all the various folders in the 'Local Folders' account. 'Trash' and 'Outbox' are default created folders. 'Outbox' is used by all accounts if you choose 'Send Later' when creating emails. All the other folders you created eg: 1931 Census </p><p>To access any of those folders you click on the folder eg: 1931 Census and it will display list of emails it contains in the 'Message List' Pane. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;: In W10, right clicking Local Folders allowed new Folders to be created and a few emails from Inbox were copied/moved to those folders. In effect, this was a way of saving those emails.  </em> </p><p>Imap account folders synchronise with server to display whatever is stored on server, so in effect they are not truelly independent copies. Getting copies of emails from an imap folder put into 'Local Folders' account means you then have a copy stored on your computer which is totally independent of the server. </p><p><br> The image you have uploaded was from a W10 computer. But you seem to be talking about a W11 computer. </p><p>Can I presume you talking about two entirely different computers? Are you saying you can see a load of folders in W10, but not in W11&nbsp;?

It will transfer everything you currently see and use on W10 and make it the same on W11. It will completely overwrite whatever is currently on W11.  The Copy of that W10  .../Roaming/'Thunderbird' folder includes all profiles, all mail accounts,all folders, all emails, all address books, everything in calendar, all preferences.

If set up initially as an Imap account then all the default server folders should be auto subscribed and seen. You also should not have two folders set up for Archives. </p><p>In Thunderbird you need to get that 'Spam' folder sorted because gmail/ whatever server..do usually auto empty Trash and Spam periodically and there's nothing more annoying that missing good emails that gmail thought were spam. </p><p>In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li>     Right click on imap mail account name folder </li><li>     Select 'Subscribe' -See image below as guide - it's an older version but  'Subscribe' is still in same location. </li><li>     click on 'Refresh' </li><li>     Select 'Spam' </li><li>     click on 'Subscribe' </li><li>     Click on 'OK'  </li></ul> <p>Report back on whether Spam is now showing in Folder Pane on <strong>W10 </strong>computer. </p><p>Before you transfer everything - maybe you should check a couple of things first on the W10.

It's almost as if you have been trying to use gmail imap as if it were set up as pop. Imap accounts are designed to store emails on server, but show an identical copy in imap account in Thunderbird. This means regardless of whether you logon using webmail account or use imap account you should see identical emails. Any emails you are storing in W10 under 'Local Folders' should be a Copy of anything important or if you need to get emails off the server to increase quota then you can also use Local Folders to store emails on your computer that are independent of the server. </p><p>The image also shows you have unchecked default folders that gmail use and imap accounts need to access. </p><p><br> <strong>Findings:</strong> On the far left blue area - it shows all the default folders. By default gmail will automatically put all sent emails into the default 'Sent' folder. It is positioned just below 'Important'.  Select that 'Sent' folder and check - I expect it has a copy of all sent emails. On far left blue area - below the default folders are the 'Labels' that you have created. As you can see - you have created exactly the same name as the default. The real problem is with [Imap]/Drafts and [Imap]/Sent. </p><p>In the white area, the top part is displayed and it shows all the 'System Labels'. Those displayed in image are only the default folders/labels.  I can see that for some unknown reason there are lots which have been deselected to show in Imap and that is not helpful for certain folders. </p><p>I'm going to suggest that you get the W10 computer set up correctly before you copy everything onto the W11 computer. </p><p><strong>On W10 computer:</strong> In Thunderbird The 'Sent' folder and the 'Drafts' folders are probably ones you created. You need to stop seeing those folders, so you can delete them off the server. I'm also suggesting you stop seeing the 'All Mail' folder because there is no point is seeing everything twice and it's less risky. But that is really your choice. </p><p>In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li>     Right click on imap mail account name folder </li><li>     Select 'Subscribe' </li><li>     click on 'Refresh' </li><li>     Select 'Sent' and 'Drafts' and 'All Mail' - so only those are highlighted </li><li>     click on 'UnSubscribe' </li><li>     Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p><strong>Now access the webmail account via a browser.</strong> On far left is the list of system folders and below are the folders you created. Check - if you have anything in the  [Imap]/Drafts label then move those emails up to the system 'Drafts' folder.  Check - if you have anything in the  [Imap]/Sent label which is not in the system default Sent folder then move those emails from [Imap]/Sent up to the system 'Sent' folder.  </p><p>In   'Settings' &gt; 'Labels' Scroll down past the 'System' labels and keep scrolling past the 'Categories' until you find the 'Labels' section at the bottom. </p><p>Look for:  </p> <ul><li> [Imap]/Drafts and [Imap]/Sent. </li><li> It will have the options 'Remove' and 'Edit' to the right of those labels you created. </li><li> Click on 'Remove' to get rid of both of them.  It's too confusing having identical folder/label names especially when not required.  </li></ul> <p>I think it's a good idea to have an '[Imap]/Archives' label because gmails method of just dumping all you select as archived into the 'All Mail' makes it difficult to find out what is archived. So make sure '[Imap]/Archives' has the 'Show in Imap' selected. </p><p>You also have a '[gmail]/Starred/Charting' label.   That means 'Starred' has a \Noselect flag. This means the folder can contain child folders eg: 'Charting', but not messages and in thunderbird will show in italic font.  Gmail have a specific folder for displaying anything that gets 'Starred'. It is a default system folder.  You may have a different use for the 'Charting' folder - it might contain preselected specific emails for other purpose and not just any 'starred' email. In which case make sure it is also selected to 'show in Imap'. </p><p>It seems you have created some more labels - they are inthe W11 image but not in the original W10 image of Folder Pane. So you will also have these labels:  '[Imap]/Cemetery' and [Imap]/Thunderbird' Make sure both of those labels have 'Show in Imap' selected. </p><p><br> Once you have done the above sorting out of labels.... </p><p>Scroll up to the top to see the <strong>system labels</strong> and you need to select the checkbox '<strong>show in Imap'</strong> for all the following: </p> <ul><li> 'Inbox' (should be auto selected) </li><li> 'Starred'  - this means you can auto see in imap anything 'starred'. </li><li> 'Sent' </li><li> 'Drafts' </li><li> 'Spam' </li><li> 'Trash' </li></ul> <p>Then go back into 'Thunderbird' - we are still on the <strong>W10</strong> computer.

They are not created by default.  In same image, you have shown that the real default server 'Sent' and 'Draft' labels have been unchecked to 'Show in imap' - so its highly likely you will not see them in your 'Subscribe' list.  This means at this moment you do not know which one you are using and I'm trying to get you to use the server default folders because you are using an Imap account. </p><p>So that's why I asked to unsubscribe from seeing the 'Sent' and 'Drafts' and then remove the [Imap]/Sent and [Imap]/Drafts labels from webmail so thay do not appear in the list. I also asked you to select the 'Show in Imap' for various required default server folders which include 'Sent' and 'Drafts'.  Then you will be able to subscribe again, but this time to see the correct default 'Sent' and 'Drafts'. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I found that when 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' are unchecked as imap in Gmail they no longer appear above Local Folders.</em> </p><p>Correct - these folders you want and need to see, so please select 'Show in Imap' as advised.  </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I need you to have full copies on the server because you are about to lose the W11 Local Folders. That is a scary statement. </em> </p><p>On W10 you have many folders in the 'Local Folders' account and I'm presuming those emails are required and you would like to see them on the W11 computer.  But that process will remove whatever is currently in the 'Local Folders' on W11. That means before copying anything from W10 to W11, you need to make sure whatever is in W11 'Local Folders' is backed up.  At this moment on 'W11' - you have 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' in the gmail account as imap folders - they will display whatever is stored on the server as seen via webmail account. That can be subscribed to be seen by any imap account providing the webmail 'Show in imap' is selected. But I do not know whether you have everything in those imap account folders. You posted an image showing that you also have same name folders in the W11 'Local Folders' account. This makes me wonder if you have moved some emails off the server into Local Folders. Do you have any emails in the 'Local Folders' &gt; 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' which are not displayed in the Imap 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' folders&nbsp;? If yes, then get copies back into the imap account 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' folders so they get uploaded onto the server.  It's so much easier to then subscribe to see those emails in W10 and W11. If you do not want to put them back on the server, then it's a more lengthy process and you'll need to perform a separate backup. I'm suggesting you put them back onto server because you maybe familiar with using the Right click on highlighted emails and selecting the 'Copy to' method but this time selecting gmail imap folders. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:In many of the folders' contents they are neither available as hard copies nor can I contact the authors for resends. </em> </p><p>I'm talking about W11 computer and only about the 'Local Folders' account which only has two folders 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' - it is those folders contents that need to be protected - hence get copies back onto server by copying them back into the imap folders of same name - or tell me you need to perform a different method of backup. </p><p>What folders are you talking about when you say ""In many of the folders' contents they are neither available as hard copies nor can I contact the authors for resends. "" Do you mean the gmail imap account folders called 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' do not have many emails? Do you mean the 'Local Folders' account folders called 'Cemetery' and 'Thunderbird' do not have many emails? You need to be very explicit about what folders and in what account because you have same name folders in imap and in Local Folders. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:  If W11 Local Folders will be lost, is that also the case for W10?</em> No. The 'Local Folders' account is on a completely separate computer. You basically have two completely different 'Local Folders' accounts. One is on W10 and it has a lot of folders  and the other is on W11 which only has two folders.  The point being when you have got everything set up correctly, the idea is to put everything currently on W10 onto W11. </p><p>Because you have an imap account on W10 and W11 that means it will only display whatever is on server no matter what computer it's on. So in effect the gmail imap account is identical on W10 and W11 and once you've sorted out the Sent and Drafts, it will be using the correct default folders. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
