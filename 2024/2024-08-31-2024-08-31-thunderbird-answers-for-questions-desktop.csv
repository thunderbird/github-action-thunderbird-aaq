True? If so, that implies that when you copied to local folders the account folders only had headers. IMAP doesn't populate content unless you click to read the messages. In that case, there is no need to reinstall. Once IMAP messages are copied out of the account folders, thunderbird no longer populates content there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
