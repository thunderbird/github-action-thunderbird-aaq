I don't know how Windows upgrades are done these days. Did the upgrade erase your old profile? Is there some way to access it as it was before the upgrade? Do you have a back-up? Copying mbox files from your old profile or from a back-up should be a reliable way of getting them into your new profile. </p><p>2. Your files look fine to me. You seem to have an mbox file and an index file for each local folder, as you should. I just did a little test to try to duplicate your situation. I was surprised that a test transfer of files into my profile showed only a few messages until I repaired the folder because I have moved many mbox files into my profiles in the past without any problems that I can recall. Have you tried repairing one of your local folders? Right click on the folder, select properties from the drop-down menu, then click on ""Repair Folder"". Results? </p><p>3. If that doesn't work, I would move one pair of mbox file and index file, e.g.,  ""Attic"" and ""Attic.msf"", outside your profile and import the mbox file, letting Thunderbird create a new index file. Steps: close Thunderbird, move those two files outside your profile to a convenient location, open Thunderbird, install the ImportExportTools NG add-on, right click on ""Local Folders"" in Thunderbird, select ""ImportExportTools NG"", then ""Import mbox Files"", then ""Individual mbox Files"", then ""Attic"". What happens? </p><p>Even if these steps are not successful, they may help someone diagnose the problem better and then solve it. </p><p>Rick </p>",user213815874572776100201782415079883066567,false,1,0

In fact, by simply using the built-in Windows Security and adding the profile folder as an exclusion, the level of security is adequate and far less likely to cause problems than BD, or any other 3rd-party AV app. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

Such is the case for my question: I had done some Google searching shortly after the announcement that WordPad was dropped, and got some of the suggestions I tried and discarded.  My timing was off - too soon.  The article published in PC Magazine was after my my evaluation of the suggestions.
