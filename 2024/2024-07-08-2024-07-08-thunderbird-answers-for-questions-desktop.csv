That lets you continue happily with whatever version you like. There are many happy users with version 91 and earlier, so it is certainly possible. Asking that enhancements not be done because you don't need them doesn't make for a good strategy. Software is complex, and there are always going to be bugs. If you feel that future updates are out of the question, the simple strategy is to make backup of your profile periodically. Then, if for whatever reason there is an update you don't like, just restore the backup profile and reinstall your preferred version over the installed version. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

HOWEVER, if you are planning to reinstall, I always suggest taking the extra precaution of making a full copy of the profile. That is done in two steps: - be sure that thunderbird is not running - copy the profile, normally at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to somewhere else  then, if the profile is affected in the fresh install, just  - exit thunderbird  - copy the saved thunderbird folder back to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p> <pre>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0 =unthreaded    Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.    ------------ 	 To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: This must be done on an account by account basis. - select table view  - the icon just to right of 'quick filter' button above message list pane - select a message folder and apply all desired attributes - View&gt;sort by from menu bar (if not shown, click alt key) - click the icon at right side of column display in message list pane - select the entry near bottom 'Apply current view to...' - highlight 'folder and children' - move mouse left to see account name and move left again to display all account folders. Now CLICK. - a small menu will appear to confirm setting all folders within that account.  I did a simple (okay, crude) video at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts	  - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0
