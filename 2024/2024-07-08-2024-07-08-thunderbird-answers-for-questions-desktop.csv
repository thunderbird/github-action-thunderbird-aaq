That lets you continue happily with whatever version you like. There are many happy users with version 91 and earlier, so it is certainly possible. Asking that enhancements not be done because you don't need them doesn't make for a good strategy. Software is complex, and there are always going to be bugs. If you feel that future updates are out of the question, the simple strategy is to make backup of your profile periodically. Then, if for whatever reason there is an update you don't like, just restore the backup profile and reinstall your preferred version over the installed version. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

HOWEVER, if you are planning to reinstall, I always suggest taking the extra precaution of making a full copy of the profile. That is done in two steps: - be sure that thunderbird is not running - copy the profile, normally at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to somewhere else  then, if the profile is affected in the fresh install, just  - exit thunderbird  - copy the saved thunderbird folder back to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
