Good price, no shipping cost, arrived as estimated, solid, easy to set up and works well. Brother web site easy to navigate and has all the software, drivers manuals and anything that may be wanted available.  Installed on a computer with Windows but when a mandatory Microsoft update corrupted my system, installed Linux Mint and installation of the Brother printer again was simple; just required a little additional reading.  One last item to mention. When it comes to replacement cartridges, they are considerably less than Pantum, HP and others. I use printers primarily for documents, and although there may be periods of non-use, do not have to be concerned about cartridge drying up like on a bubble-jet. Precisely why I just use the HP All-In-One for scanning now just for scanning. Bubble-jet cartridges do not last as long or have as good of print.  Our neighbors to the North know how to make a printer just as local Garmin knows how to make and provide customer support for GPS and their products. Been with computers since about 1982 and can say without question, best printer I have had to date. Highly recommended this printer. Puts the others to shame. Walmart can show pride in offering the Brother printer to customers. </p> <h6 id=""w_"">====</h6> <p>Due to issues with Windows10, I decided to change the last of my computers to Linux Mint 21.3.  </p><p>The plan was to back up the Thunderbird profiles (as usual) on my main desktop to a flash drive, install Mint and then copy the profiles to the Thunderbird that is preloaded with Mint; I have moved Thunderbird numerous times on various computers to new computers and/or new installations. Example: from Win95 to Win98, Win98 to Win7, and Win7 to Win10 without incident. This is my first time performing a Thunderbird transfer to Mint although I have performed quite a few Mint installations.   </p><p>Unfortunately, after backing up the Thunderbird profiles and other vitals, and successfully loading Mint, something went terribly wrong. After the final reboot required by Mint, files on an external portable ss drive starting being erased, and then the Mint OS on the C drive of the computer would not start.  </p><p>The computer would not allow me to install Mint again so I loaded Windows7 (since the upgrade to Win10 was done as instructed on the M$ site so I did not have an installation disk or image), and released the secure boot. Then Mint was able to be installed but presented a new challenge. </p><p>The challenge is the Thunderbird structure in Mint is different than the Thunderbird structure in Mint. Although I created one of my email accounts in Thunderbird on Mint, there is not a profile I could locate. Therefore, the profiles from Windows cannot simply be copied and then the pkcs11.txt deleted. Therefore, although I have the data, I do not know how to use it or recreate the email accounts. I dread the thought of purchasing a small computer with Win10 just so I can access my email accounts and numerous folders of email. However, at this time I may not have any choice. Not sure if there are any repair shops that could ""fix"" the problem.  </p><p>In the past I would simple copy one email account at a time, msf files and .sbd sub-folders, but again, I cannot locate a profile or even an email account in Mint for Thunderbird. </p><p>Can this issue I be resolved, or am I trying to go up the creek without a paddle? This is the first time that I can recall not being able a solve a software problem. I have also never had a problem with any Ubuntu or Mint installation although there are always issues with Windows. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1682551;,DesertOutlaw1

Utilizo en Mozilla Thunderbird varias cuentas de correo para diversas cosas, el problema que tengo es que aparece en emisor o destinatario un nombre que deseo cambiar... A pesar de que escribo un correo desde una cuenta específica o recibo una respuesta en mi bandeja de entrada de esa cuenta, el sistema me muestra un nombre de usuario que deseo cambiar. ¿Podrían orientarme para realizar ese cambio? Me es difícil explicarlo. Por ejm. envío un correo utilizando la cuenta XGando MCA (gandoxmca@gmail.com)... o recibo respuestas en esa cuenta; sin embargo, en el seguimiento veo ""Estudio Viñales"", incluso con distintas cuentas... Envío una imagen de la situación para que se vea el ""problema"" Muchas gracias </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,es,"",xavier_g

When I am out of the office, I check e-mails on my phone and my home machine. By the time I am back to the office, pretty much all e-mails are ""processed"" by me already. But, as I wake up my Windows box from sleep, notifications for all those ""processed"" e-mails start to pop up one by one. E-mail counter does not show anything and e-mails themselves are appearing as ""read"" or do not appear at all if they were deleted already. But notifications keep popping up. Feels like every time e-mail is received, notification is pushed into some sort of queue and, when my PC is woken up, this queue is being processed regardless of what happened to e-mails. My Linux machine works fine with Thunderbird in this respect. </p><p>Problems on WIndows started about a week ago. </p><p>P.S. As I went to check current version I run, Thunderdrbird decided to upgraded itself to 128.3.2esr, so will have to wait to tomorrow to see if thsi upgrade fixed the issue. Changelog is not mentioning anything in relation to this particular issue </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",rudolfl1
