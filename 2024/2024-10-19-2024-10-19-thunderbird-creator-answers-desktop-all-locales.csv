To view the list of open windows I have used the Window tab on the system toolbar (the toolbar at the very top of the desktop I am working in; MacBook Pro). This would normally provide a list of the windows with their individual messages by subject. Since the recent major upgrade the window view tab shows messages with the identical title: ""Mozilla Thunderbird"". Therefore I now have to click each one to figure out which email I want to bring to the front which is a pain when I'm synthesizing information from across multiple emails (why I use the ""open in new message window"" in the first place). I've attached a screen shot. </p><p>I would appreciate any pointers on anything that I can do to change this back to a more informative list of open windows - or at least let me know that this is a known issue and is being worked on. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lffortson
