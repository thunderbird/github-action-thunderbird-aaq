1470025,2024-10-18 17:19:33 -0700,2024-10-18 17:19:33 -0700,separate email windows now have all the same title,"<p>I use the Reading &amp; Display setting ""Open messages in a new message window"". To view the list of open windows I have used the Window tab on the system toolbar (the toolbar at the very top of the desktop I am working in; MacBook Pro). This would normally provide a list of the windows with their individual messages by subject. Since the recent major upgrade the window view tab shows messages with the identical title: ""Mozilla Thunderbird"". Therefore I now have to click each one to figure out which email I want to bring to the front which is a pain when I'm synthesizing information from across multiple emails (why I use the ""open in new message window"" in the first place). I've attached a screen shot. </p><p>I would appreciate any pointers on anything that I can do to change this back to a more informative list of open windows - or at least let me know that this is a known issue and is being worked on. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",lffortson

I just checked my email today through Thunderbird, and none of the filters I set are showing up. I was able to locate three versions of my msgFilterRules.dat file (one in my local folder, one in my (obsolete) pop folder, and one in my imap folder)  </p><p>My guess is that one of them has my filters, but got saved in the wrong place or something, and now my filters won't appear. I could be wrong about that, I but don't know how to check which one might have my filters are there, or import them into my settings. </p><p>If I can't get my filters back, though, how would I go about preserving them? It's very frustrating that they disappeared, and I don't want that to happen again. </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",folkpunkdruid
