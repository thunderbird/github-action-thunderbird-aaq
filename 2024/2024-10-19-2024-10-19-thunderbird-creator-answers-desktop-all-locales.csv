Good price, no shipping cost, arrived as estimated, solid, easy to set up and works well. Brother web site easy to navigate and has all the software, drivers manuals and anything that may be wanted available.  Installed on a computer with Windows but when a mandatory Microsoft update corrupted my system, installed Linux Mint and installation of the Brother printer again was simple; just required a little additional reading.  One last item to mention. When it comes to replacement cartridges, they are considerably less than Pantum, HP and others. I use printers primarily for documents, and although there may be periods of non-use, do not have to be concerned about cartridge drying up like on a bubble-jet. Precisely why I just use the HP All-In-One for scanning now just for scanning. Bubble-jet cartridges do not last as long or have as good of print.  Our neighbors to the North know how to make a printer just as local Garmin knows how to make and provide customer support for GPS and their products. Been with computers since about 1982 and can say without question, best printer I have had to date. Highly recommended this printer. Puts the others to shame. Walmart can show pride in offering the Brother printer to customers. </p> <h6 id=""w_"">====</h6> <p>Due to issues with Windows10, I decided to change the last of my computers to Linux Mint 21.3.  </p><p>The plan was to back up the Thunderbird profiles (as usual) on my main desktop to a flash drive, install Mint and then copy the profiles to the Thunderbird that is preloaded with Mint; I have moved Thunderbird numerous times on various computers to new computers and/or new installations. Example: from Win95 to Win98, Win98 to Win7, and Win7 to Win10 without incident. This is my first time performing a Thunderbird transfer to Mint although I have performed quite a few Mint installations.   </p><p>Unfortunately, after backing up the Thunderbird profiles and other vitals, and successfully loading Mint, something went terribly wrong. After the final reboot required by Mint, files on an external portable ss drive starting being erased, and then the Mint OS on the C drive of the computer would not start.  </p><p>The computer would not allow me to install Mint again so I loaded Windows7 (since the upgrade to Win10 was done as instructed on the M$ site so I did not have an installation disk or image), and released the secure boot. Then Mint was able to be installed but presented a new challenge. </p><p>The challenge is the Thunderbird structure in Mint is different than the Thunderbird structure in Mint. Although I created one of my email accounts in Thunderbird on Mint, there is not a profile I could locate. Therefore, the profiles from Windows cannot simply be copied and then the pkcs11.txt deleted. Therefore, although I have the data, I do not know how to use it or recreate the email accounts. I dread the thought of purchasing a small computer with Win10 just so I can access my email accounts and numerous folders of email. However, at this time I may not have any choice. Not sure if there are any repair shops that could ""fix"" the problem.  </p><p>In the past I would simple copy one email account at a time, msf files and .sbd sub-folders, but again, I cannot locate a profile or even an email account in Mint for Thunderbird. </p><p>Can this issue I be resolved, or am I trying to go up the creek without a paddle? This is the first time that I can recall not being able a solve a software problem. I have also never had a problem with any Ubuntu or Mint installation although there are always issues with Windows. </p>",DesertOutlaw1;MattAuSupport;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/128.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;solver_id:2975047",5,0,1,,,

A few days ago, my e-mail stopped working. Somehow the IMAP configuration had changed to POP. In consultation with a support person from the ISP (Teksavvy), the only fix was to delete the account within Thunderbird. So firrst, I used the export feature of Thunderbird to port all my e-mails out of Thunderbird, and the result is a file, ""Thunderbird_profile_backup.zip"". I double-clicked on the file and received this message: ""Unable to expand 'Thunderbird_profile_backup.zip' into 'email backup 2024-10-18'. (Error 1 - Operation not permitted)."" I downloaded ExpressZip, and that did not work. Then I tried Winzip 12 Mac, which gave the message, ""Cannot open file 'Thunderbird_profile_backup.zip'. It does not appear to be a valid archive.""
