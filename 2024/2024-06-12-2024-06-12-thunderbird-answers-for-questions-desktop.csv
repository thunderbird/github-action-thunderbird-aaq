I am not a developer, but the current version is 115.12.1.

Why is it that as soon as something you do not understand occurs folk jump to hacked.  </p><p>Now I am forced to guess,  but Google and Gmail do not use old style passwords to authenticate,  they use the oauth2.0 protocol and that protocol used tokens issued when you authorize Thunderbird to have access to your google account (mail, calendars, contacts etc) and renewed periodically by Google until they again require to to re authorize the continuing access. </p><p>Saved Passwords are generally shown with in the provider column with a protocol for which the entry applies.  tings like IMAP:// SMTP:// Chrome:// and oauth://   The ones with oauth:// will be gibberish.  That is normal, and will be updated as required by Google.  You do not have an option to not use oauth with Google. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
