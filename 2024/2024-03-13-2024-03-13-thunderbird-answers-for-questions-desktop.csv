Can you tell me how to make the window of message creation with this attached file open? </blockquote> <p>In Windows, the usual process is to select 'Send to' in the file context menu and then 'Mail recipient'.  This will open a new message in the default mail app with the file attached.  It sometimes fails if other mail apps like Outlook are installed and are conflicting with TB being the default app.  In that case, define TB as the default both in Windows settings and TB Settings/General/System Integration. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
