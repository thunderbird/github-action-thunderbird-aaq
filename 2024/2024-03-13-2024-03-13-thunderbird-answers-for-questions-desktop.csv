When I switched to table view I still had the same issue. My problem is that in the message panel on the right I used to be able to scroll through from one email to the next, even if I was in a sort setting that didn't include the other emails in the thread. It even had them nicely separated so it was easy to tell where one email ended and the next one began. For example, if I highlighted new messages and clicked one I was able to seamlessly scroll through the other messages in the thread. Now when I click it I can see only the specific email and the rest of the thread isn't available. </p><p>In the image below I have one email highlighted, and it's the only email I can access on the message panel unless I physically click another email on the panel on the left. It's especially frustrating when I get into long threads because I have to click through each email individually to find the part of the conversation I'm trying to reference. </p><p>Sent emails also used to automatically appear in the thread at the end of the conversation if I would scroll down so that I could reference what I said to a person as soon as I responded (without having to check the sent folder). </p>",dannymarchiori,false,0,0

So in effect you have to select the next in thread. The change in not providing the vertical lines means you cannot tell whether that email in conversation was in reply to only original or in reply to a reply of original.  </p><p>I'm going to check on whether there is a preference for enabling/disabling of vertical line in replies. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
