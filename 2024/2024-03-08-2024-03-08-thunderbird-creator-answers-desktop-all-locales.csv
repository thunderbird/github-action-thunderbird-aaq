Tonight I accidentally told it to save a misspelled word. I clicked on edit in the window, and it brought up my dictionary, but it was way longer than my screen, and I could find no scroll bar. It also would not let me move the dictionary window! Can anyone help me overcome this so I can delete the incorrect word? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1641052;,Pattit

That works just fine, so I know my isp is working correctly. </p><p>Long and short, I restored my profile back to last night 5pm but that didn't fix.  I tried restoring back to a week ago, no go.  Then I restored the entire ~/Library/Thunderbird folder, no go. </p><p>Finally just created a new imac account which is reading emails now just fine but it's using up too much isp server space so I want to go back to the POP arrangement as before, using the previous profile.

Thunderbird is used for three separate email addresses. The first two addresses (for my wife and me) are registered to one account. The third email address belongs to a separate account. Both accounts happen to use the same ISP. The problem is that when a one new email is received the Thunderbird icon reports two. If  there are say four unread emails, Thunderbird reports eight - double the actual number. This problem does not exist with the third email address. How can I correct this doubling of the count of unread emails? </li><li> 2. If unused for a period of time (number of hours not identified) Thunderbird will not respond when the icon is clicked on to bring it to the top of the screen. A message then appears stating that it is not responding. It is then necessary to close it down and restart it. Is this a known problem? Can it be fixed? </li></ol> <p>The computer runs Windows 10 and has 16GB of memory. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1641091;,balbados

As a result, the message you are trying to view is sqeezed into less than half your screen, if there are pictures in the message it's totally useless - you can't see them properly. </p><p>Two months ago, somebody posted that they had a solution - then, NOTHING several 'updates' on. </p><p>I've been in touch directly with Wayne Mery, and he said the 'solution' had thrown up another problem. How can that be? You always used to be able to reduce the list to two or three lines. Why not just put the code back as it was? </p><p>Am I missing something?

Why did this start to happen? And how do I avoid it? Couldnt find any settings in Thunderbird. </p><p>Note that the support departments tell me that its not their software... Which end do u beleave is truncating the text? </p><p>2) Its also very annoying that Thunderbird has started to put many emails don into the Spam-folder, but the most annoying thing is it seems like its impossible to find any menu-submenu popup, tool or button to remove it again from Spam folder and to tell Thunderbird to remember never to put this Sender into spam-folder again! </p><p>So will there come some fixes soon to this? </p><p>Thanx </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1641088;,LoopStudio
