Both accounts happen to use the same ISP. The problem is that when a one new email is received the Thunderbird icon reports two. If  there are say four unread emails, Thunderbird reports eight - double the actual number. This problem does not exist with the third email address. How can I correct this doubling of the count of unread emails? </li><li> 2. If unused for a period of time (number of hours not identified) Thunderbird will not respond when the icon is clicked on to bring it to the top of the screen.
