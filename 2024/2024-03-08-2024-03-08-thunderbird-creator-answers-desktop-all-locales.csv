Tonight I accidentally told it to save a misspelled word. I clicked on edit in the window, and it brought up my dictionary, but it was way longer than my screen, and I could find no scroll bar. It also would not let me move the dictionary window! Can anyone help me overcome this so I can delete the incorrect word? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1641052;,Pattit

I have my primary email account set up as well as a few gmail accounts.  The gmail accounts got new mail but my primary did not. </p><p>I switched to a new user account on the Mac and set up a tbird there using Imac.  That works just fine, so I know my isp is working correctly. </p><p>Long and short, I restored my profile back to last night 5pm but that didn't fix.  I tried restoring back to a week ago, no go.  Then I restored the entire ~/Library/Thunderbird folder, no go. </p><p>Finally just created a new imac account which is reading emails now just fine but it's using up too much isp server space so I want to go back to the POP arrangement as before, using the previous profile.  Are there other bits to restore to besides ~/Library/Thunderbird? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",PIZZAFOUNDRY
