I have been on Auto update for years now and could not put in correct password. It was suggested I go back to 102 and start over with a new account.  I did. I have 102 and can send and receive emails.  Problem is 102 does not show all emails that show in my same account when I log into <a href=""http://Ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ionos.com</a> host of my email account. I created another problem going to Thunderbird 102, birthdays.  I have no access to my Thunderbird calendar not only for this month but all months this year and forever. I made a copy of everything in my account prior to going back to 102 to get a new password.   How to I get my 2014 calendar back.  And first thing I do if and when I get it back is to use a pen and paper to write down birthdays and whatever I want to remember and save it on paper just in case this happens again? Thanks. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",email14
