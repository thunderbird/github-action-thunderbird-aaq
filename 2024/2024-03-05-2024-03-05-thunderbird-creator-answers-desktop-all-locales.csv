I created another problem going to Thunderbird 102, birthdays.  I have no access to my Thunderbird calendar not only for this month but all months this year and forever. I made a copy of everything in my account prior to going back to 102 to get a new password.   How to I get my 2014 calendar back.  And first thing I do if and when I get it back is to use a pen and paper to write down birthdays and whatever I want to remember and save it on paper just in case this happens again?

Just tried sending a 7mb mp3 file to a recipient via FileLink. I set up a FileLink connection to a Send instance in the USA. Every attempt to send the file to a recipient resulted in endless loading and copying the message to my drafts folder and my sent folder, but the Send button on the message never darkened and allowed me to send the message. Also I get an error message from Thunderbird telling me it canât copy the message to my drafts and sent folders. After two plus hours of waiting, I had to cancel the messages. Tried restarting Thunderbird.   </p><p>I tried using Dropbox instead but Dropbox always pauses my uploads no matter what I do and which browser I use. I ended up sending the mp3 file as a regular attachment. That eventually worked but again the message couldnât be saved to my sent folder, and again Thunderbird insisted on saving a draft copy while the very long file attachment loading process went on for over a half hour. My question is: why does it take so long for Thunderbird to load an attachment to a message, and why doesnât FileLink work?  I tried to send a 1.6mb photo in jpg format to myself, and even that took a half hour, and I wasnât sure the process worked until I received my message with the photo. Do I need to disable my Norton software to use Thunderbird?  Disable my browser extensions?  Or do I just need to find a different email client? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",mightysparrow

1441553,2024-03-05 06:40:02 -0800,2024-03-05 06:40:02 -0800,"Two Gmail accounts in Thunderbird, occasionally emails stop coming through","<p>For some time I have been using Thunderbird with three email accounts one of which is a Gmail account.  This has generally worked OK.  Every weeks or so a message came up asking me to allow Thunderbird to access my Google account to which I always said âAllowâ.  I call this message the âGoogle panelâ.  I am guessing this comes up whenever Thunderbird updates or whenever Google make some change.  It is a bit irritating but I can live with it.  Recently I have added in a second Gmail account, and since I have done this I have had a lot more problems.  When the Google panel described above comes up I have to choose which of the two Gmail addresses it is asking me to allow access.  There doesnât seem to be any way of knowing which one has made the request so I choose one of the two listed at random, if I guess correctly then everything continues normally but if I guess incorrectly I get an error (404).  The good news is that if I guess incorrectly the panel reappears within a few seconds and selecting the other account sorts everything out. The more serious problem is that from time to time emails from one of the two accounts just stop coming through.  A dialog box with the message âThe STAT command did not succeed.  Error getting message number and sizes.  Mail server <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> responded: [AUTH] Invalid credentialsâ appears.  This has happened to both of the accounts at different times for no obvious reason.  After this happens it stays that way until the Google panel appears for the email address that has stopped working.  This can take a couple of weeks. The only sure way that I've found to resolve this before the panel comes up is to clear the passwords for that account out of the password manager (Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Passwords &gt; Saved Passwords).  Then when I request Get Messages I am asked to allow Google to access the account, and once that has been done the account works again.  This is obviously inconvenient and a fix that requires frequent implementation is not desirable. Even if I clear out all the passwords for both Gmail accounts and start fresh it is normally within a week that one of the accounts stops working as described above. </p><p>Some other facts about my setup: </p><pre>   Cookies are enabled (Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security, Accept third-party cookies)    I have it set up to store incoming emails from all accounts in a folder in Local Folders so I have a single inbox containing all incoming messages from all my accounts.    I use POP not IMAP    I leave the PC running overnight so Thunderbird is open continuously    I have two other non-Gmail accounts as well as the two Gmail ones    I have a Windows 11 PC and am currently using Thunderbird version 115. </pre> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can prevent these problems and have both accounts running reliably? </p><pre>Barry Williams </pre>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",barryw99999
