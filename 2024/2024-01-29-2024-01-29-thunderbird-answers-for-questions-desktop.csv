Things like antivirus scanning,  cloud syncing of the location, slow network responses when the data is on a local server or NAS or some form of streaming backup is in use. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My personal preference is to first install thunderbird, exit, and then use the OS's file management tool to copy the profile to overlay the default profile. That guarantees it is identical to what was on PC. Or, you could use tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbird installation. IMPORTANT: be sure the profile on PC was created when Thunderbird was NOT running. Another option would be to copy profile to somewhere on hard drive, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles, click the 'create profile' button and follow the prompts to name it and click the browse button to locate and select the profile you copied. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Cuando abres el archivo adjunto PDF desde el Thunderbird en realidad se abre con el Microsoft Edge, este seria el problema? en ese caso es porque en el Thunderbird esta configurado como default para abrir PDF el Microsoft Edge, eso se cambia en Ajsutes-&gt;General-&gt;Archivos y adjuntos: Formato de documento portable (PDF) cambiar a ""Vista Previa en Thundebird"".
