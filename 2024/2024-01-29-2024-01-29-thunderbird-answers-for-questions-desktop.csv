That guarantees it is identical to what was on PC. Or, you could use tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbird installation. IMPORTANT: be sure the profile on PC was created when Thunderbird was NOT running. Another option would be to copy profile to somewhere on hard drive, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles, click the 'create profile' button and follow the prompts to name it and click the browse button to locate and select the profile you copied. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
