My original account is active but it contains only INBOX SEND and TRASH. The original folders have disappeared.

Second, thunderbird is designed such that reinstalling need not affect the accounts. That is, before doing anything major, you should always 1) exit thunderbird and then, 2) copy the profile elsewhere. Also, the final prompt on an uninstall is whether to delete account data. So, even if you did a reinstall, the accounts will still be there and not lost. But it's not needed. I just added that as extra info. </p><p>On your problem, it is often helpful to delete the account if it's cause setup problems. The DONE you mention just means that Thunderbird found the servers. Your individual account remains unconfirmed. I always propose omitting password during setup and waiting for the prompt for it.

I clicked on the 3 small horizontal lines at the upper right section of my screen when I was in my index and then clicked on one of the 3 items available:  Settings, Account Settings, or Add-ons and Themes. I can't remember which one worked, but one of them did!  </p><p>A few minutes ago, I tried your suggestion, just to see if it too would work, but it didn't. F10 didn't respond when I clicked on it. I don't know why I couldn't get your suggestion to respond. Why did mine? Any ideas? </p><p>Al Venosa </p>",advenosa,false,0,0
