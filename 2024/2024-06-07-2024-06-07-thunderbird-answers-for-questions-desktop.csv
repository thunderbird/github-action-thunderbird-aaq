Second, thunderbird is designed such that reinstalling need not affect the accounts. That is, before doing anything major, you should always 1) exit thunderbird and then, 2) copy the profile elsewhere. Also, the final prompt on an uninstall is whether to delete account data. So, even if you did a reinstall, the accounts will still be there and not lost. But it's not needed. I just added that as extra info. </p><p>On your problem, it is often helpful to delete the account if it's cause setup problems. The DONE you mention just means that Thunderbird found the servers. Your individual account remains unconfirmed. I always propose omitting password during setup and waiting for the prompt for it. Posting screenshots of your incoming and outgoing settings often prove useful, so those with Yahoo experience can comment on the settings. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Look also for duplicate account setups (account names followed by -1, -2, etc.) as the  NSTMP files can be immediately deleted, and the others have a possibility of having duplicates of your messages. If found you would need to review. - restart thunderbird and the folders will be repopulated.  </p><p>Now, you can see whatever the savings are.

I suggest viewing in File Explorer to see last update date of prefs.js file and whether there might be multiple copies. There is a possibility that some other program (antivirus?) is preventing thunderbird from saving it. I make this assumption because, once you enter the password, you are able to access the account, but not the next time. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
