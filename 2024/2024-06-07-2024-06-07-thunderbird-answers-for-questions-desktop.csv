My original account is active but it contains only INBOX SEND and TRASH. The original folders have disappeared.

Second, thunderbird is designed such that reinstalling need not affect the accounts. That is, before doing anything major, you should always 1) exit thunderbird and then, 2) copy the profile elsewhere. Also, the final prompt on an uninstall is whether to delete account data. So, even if you did a reinstall, the accounts will still be there and not lost. But it's not needed. I just added that as extra info. </p><p>On your problem, it is often helpful to delete the account if it's cause setup problems. The DONE you mention just means that Thunderbird found the servers.
