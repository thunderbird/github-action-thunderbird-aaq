It kept asking for verification. When I realized the problem I changed out the '@' but I can't change the password in Thunderbird. New emails are accessible in Gmail and Outlook but Thunderbird doesn't show then and nothing happens when I use 'get messages'. I need to delete the problem account to re-enter it, when I try to add the email address as a new account Thunderbird just says it already exists and does nothing. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1653109;,tom.loewen.sk
