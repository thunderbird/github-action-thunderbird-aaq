My email mbox files are on a network drive, but so are my profiles, so I'm not sure why one would work / be written to (the 'popstate' file) but not the other (the 'Inbox' file). </p><p>One thing I have done is stop filters from running automatically when getting new emails, and also preventing TB from downloading new emails on startup. I think the combo of all of these things with a network drive was too much for TB to handle at once. I now run these manually one by one. </p>",misc32,false,0,0
