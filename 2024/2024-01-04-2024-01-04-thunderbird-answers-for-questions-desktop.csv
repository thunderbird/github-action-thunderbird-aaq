It took a while to find out how to disable this. In the mean time I went through hell looking for replies. Now I am continually badgered with updates. Also, apparently, this next update is even worse. I do not need it, do not want it, and will never upgrade to it. I am now in the process of installing an earlier version that I will never upgrade. If Thunderbird really wants to do it right with upgrades then give us a choice to ignore layout changes and never change layout options without asking. That is arrogant and rude! I am insulted by Mozilla's attitude.  I do not need calendars, schedules or anything else messing up my menus and layout. The earlier version has all I need. I hate to say it, but I have not been able to find a suitable replacement for Thunderbird. If I could, believe me, after what they did, I would not even use an earlier version.

Gmail sees your your sending domain name and the domain of the email host as being different and rejects the mail. Your email provider needs to make security adjustments to their server.

You should verify that you have a separate SMTP server with unique name in Documentation field of SMTP settings pane and connected to the appropriate account. Generally, you need just one password for each account. For more help, please share more info on the problem. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

The answer isn't found looking at the list of passwords, it's under the single Outgoing Server (SMTP) button. Well, thanks (Ah-ha!), I finally understand the issue. </p><p>If there are separate email addresses using the ""same server"" from the email provider's point of view (eg <a href=""http://smtp.emailprovider.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.emailprovider.net</a>) there need to be be separate servers defined from the client (Thunderbird's) point of view. </p><p>1. Open Thunderbird. 2. Click Tools &gt; Account Settings (or) click View settings for this account from Home. 3. Click Outgoing Server (SMTP). 4. Click Edit. 5. Change the description to the account name 6. Fill in the Server Name (can be the same for multiple accounts from the same email provider) 7. Change the port to 465 or 587 (or whatever is recommended) 8. Make sure SSL/TLS is selected under Connection security (or whatever is recommended) 9. Change the Authentication method to Normal Password. 10. Change the User Name to the account email address  Click OK. THEN click ADD... and enter the information for the next account. Repeat for each account. </p><p>Now there is a server defined for each account. Then when sending an email and the password fails, Thunderbird will ask for the password. Enter the password and check ""save in password manager"". Do that for each account. </p><p>Hope that helps. </p>",mrpetep,false,0,0

From your post, all we know is that the sending failed. It might be incorrect SMTP server settings.
