You can click on a column header to reverse the sort. eg: If you want emails sorted by Date, then click on the 'Date' column header.

That's how my Thunderbird was set earlier today before all this mess (I checked it as part of my troubleshooting because the Comcast/Xfinity help document also stated that was the incoming pop server).  Maybe the help doc was outdated, but I was still getting email with that setting.

I even tried the pop3 server you mention.  Nothing.  By nothing I mean that TB used to reflect its actions in the very bottom of the TB window (something akin to ""connecting"" and ""receiving files"" or something like that).  Now, as of close to noon Eastern today, there is nothing showing in that bottom bar.  Ever. </p><p>So what I'm wondering is why would TB not even try to establish a connection and at least post a request to the server?

In that case I could select each account individually and when I did that, I got the password re-entry pop-up and all is now working.
