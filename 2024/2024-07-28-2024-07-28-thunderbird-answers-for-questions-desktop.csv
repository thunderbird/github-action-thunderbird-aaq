If this is IMAP (which I infer it is) and there are thousands of folders, this places a huge demand on your internet connection. Assuming all folders are set for offline use (settings&gt;synchronization&amp;settings - advanced button), I suggest clicking file&gt;offline&gt;download to retrieve them and, after the download, export to PC files so future searches will go much faster. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Disabling and re-enabling sync on the folder via subscribe will de exactly that.  The server will notify Thunderbird it's image is out of date,  everything will be deleted and it will start the download over again. </p><p>Your issue is most likely you have exceeded the allowance of data (bandwidth) google allow for an individual for the day.  See <a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en</a> </p><p>With a store of gigabytes it may take a week or more to fully sync,  and if you have an antivirus scanning in the profile folder or scanning the encrypted communications months, if ever, gets closer to it.  Essentially the sync can be interrupted and timeout and this gets much worse when something else is probing the connection (antivirus)  it will start over after a timeout,  and for downloads will eventually get there after lots of restarts of the process and lots of deletions of what has already been downloaded because the last attempt failed ,  but I don't recommend email scanning at this time to either the profile folder or email downloads generally. </p><p>I would also suggest, initially in this case as least, that you use the settings in Thunderbirds account settings to not store emails on the local system.  This will mean that Thunderbird will download just enough information to populate the lists in the user interface but not all the mail bodies,  they will be downloaded on demand when a message is selected to be read.  This will greatly reduce the bandwidth needed to establish the account.  If after you have folders that look like they have the mail in them you could set it to download mail locally if you like,  but lots of people never store IMAP mail locally.  It is certainly not a local backup even when they do as it can be deleted simply be the server being uncontactable. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
