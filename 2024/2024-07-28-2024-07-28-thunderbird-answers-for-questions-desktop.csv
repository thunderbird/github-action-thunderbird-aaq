I was pondering my problem when I had a Eureka moment. What if Thunderbird was exhibiting one of its quirks as it does with “sort by” in a folder? When I use “sort by” for my view in one folder I find that Thunderbird alters my “sort by” view for other folders where I have not requested a change. You get used to this and are on the lookout for it. What if there was another Thunderbird quirk that I was unaware of? With that in mind I trawled through all my settings to see if anything had changed without me requesting it to do so. I eventually found something! Usually, I do not have the “quick filter” command line on display but that is where I discovered my problem. For whatever reason Thunderbird had decided all by itself to cancel “Unread, Starred and Contact” messages hence me being unable to see any emails! I removed the tick from “Unread, Starred and Contact” in the “quick filter” and all my messages magically appeared. I now know to look at both “sort by” and “quick filter” if I am having problems. Why Thunderbird randomly does this sort of thing is a mystery to me but, perhaps, developers may find a solution for the future. Excuse my long posting but I hope that other users might benefit from my experience. All the best, Wayne </p>",wayneallenfamily,false,0,0

Essentially the sync can be interrupted and timeout and this gets much worse when something else is probing the connection (antivirus)  it will start over after a timeout,  and for downloads will eventually get there after lots of restarts of the process and lots of deletions of what has already been downloaded because the last attempt failed ,  but I don't recommend email scanning at this time to either the profile folder or email downloads generally. </p><p>I would also suggest, initially in this case as least, that you use the settings in Thunderbirds account settings to not store emails on the local system.  This will mean that Thunderbird will download just enough information to populate the lists in the user interface but not all the mail bodies,  they will be downloaded on demand when a message is selected to be read.  This will greatly reduce the bandwidth needed to establish the account.  If after you have folders that look like they have the mail in them you could set it to download mail locally if you like,  but lots of people never store IMAP mail locally.
