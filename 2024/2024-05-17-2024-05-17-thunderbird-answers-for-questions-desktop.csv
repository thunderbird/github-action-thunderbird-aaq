If you were to start thunderbird fresh, you would see the Local folders are INSIDE the profile, not external. The standard profile includes two folders for user content: Imapmail and Mail, and Local Folders is a subset of the Mail folder. I have worked this forum for years and helped countless users and Local Folders is not separate, as in your configuration. What you have indicates that you started with a profile, then created a new profile, and then adjusted the profile to point to a component of an earlier profile.
