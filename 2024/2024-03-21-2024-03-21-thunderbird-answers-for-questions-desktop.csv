What it says is that the server is either not reachable, or that the rejection is due to some kind of config error - one of these 'detailed' MS error messages thus. As indicated earlier, we could probably save ourselves a lot of useless work if there were contact to someone with access to the MS syslog, to see what the exact cause of the rejection is. I had hoped that there they might be such expert contacts somewhere at Moz?  Re antivirus: No Re VPN: Yes. Testing has shown that disengaging it 'solves' the issue.

Non so dove tu abbia letto questa cosa ma è completamente sbagliata. IMAP serve ad avere sul tuo computer una copia esatta della posta che hai sul server. Inoltre IMAP può essere usato per creare ulteriori copie su altri dispositivi (un secondo PC, uno smartphone, etc.). Il server e tutti i dispositivo collegati come IMAP vengono costantemente sincronizzati per cui qualsiasi azione fai su uno di questi, viene replicata su tutti gli altri. Ad esempio se cancelli una mail in Thunderbird, verrà cancellata anche dal server e dagli altri dispositivi collegati alla prima connessione. </p><p>Qui c'è una spiegazione più estesa -&gt; <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/differenze-imap-pop3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/differenze-imap-pop3</a> </p>",@next,false,0,0

Although my original post was not so much an idea, but an inquiry.(It was implied as it seemed obvious, even though I didn't ask explicitly). </p><p>That's because Thunderbirds changes to nesting new and existing Emails is a good idea in itself, which I like. </p><p>But in the process of making things better, they left out what was good before - highlighting at a glance, in bold, for new Emails.
