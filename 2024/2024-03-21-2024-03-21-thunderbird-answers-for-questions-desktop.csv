It is inaccessible allegedly because of inactivity... because I have not logged directly in to Google in a browser (or by using a 'Sign in with Google' link).  This, according to Google.  When this happened back in December, I had to prove it was me, and had the right to access the account in order for me to regain access to that account.  As I mentioned in my OP, I had, at the time, dismissed it as just my dumb luck to have been caught up in an inactivity problem. But now again, the same thing has happened with yet another gmail account.   </p><p><strong>""Have you actually asked at google?""  </strong> Unless you have a paid account (which I did not know existed until last December), you cannot contact and get support from Google on anything.  The only support available is online.  And THAT support basically advises that if the steps outlined don't get you back into your account... c'est la vie </p><p><strong>""...or are you assuming your issue is related to your account being deactivated for lack of use?""</strong> I use T-bird exclusively for email - I have for years.  When I turn my computer on, the first thing gets launched is Firefox.  Then T-bird.  Then I check for new mail.  Both stay open as long as I'm at the computer.  I check for email everyday, several times a day, on all my email accounts - 3 gmail accounts; 1 yahoo account; 2 AOL accounts.  If you were in my place, what would you assume the issue is? </p><p>Also, something I hadn't thought about until just now...  when this happened with the other incident in December, in addition to checking for/popping email daily, I HAD been using one of those 'Sign in with Google' links nearly everyday - and still do.  So, it would seem to me that issue should never have happened.   For this latest issue, I do not use any 'Sign in with Google' links, because, as mentioned in my OP, this email account is not used for fun. </p><p>I came here to see if anyone else had experienced this problem, and had perhaps figured out how to fix it. Or what was causing it.  After a couple of days of few views and no replies, it became apparent that I'm just the lucky one!  If I had not tried to log in to gmail in my browser to change my password, I would never have realized that I could not log in.  I do not understand the seemingly contradictory situation: T-bird can log in to my gmail, but I can't. </p><p>Thanks for your reply. </p>",FitAintBrkDntFxIt,false,0,0

They expect you to connect from somewhere in the world related to that location.  Or at least your connection in Budapest and your connection in Pretoria be more than a few minutes apart. </p><p>VPN's have become very popular,  but as their only function is to hide your physical location via changing your IP address they make a total hash of hacking protections implemented by sites that expect you to be where you already told them you were,  or connected on this device and the phone you previously told them you had. </p><p>When you connect to a website and they have some concerns about hacking derived from this masking of your physical location,  they tend to fall back to the two factor authentication and send you a code to your phone.  You enter it and everything is good.  The mail client however is an automated system.  Not some manual system where a phone message can be used to authenticate you.  In my case. I might even be asleep as I don't shut down my mail client every day so it gets mail while I sleep.  Generally when you fail in this sort of automated situation then the connection just fails as a fallback is not really appropriate,  although you may be getting email from Outlook/Microsoft telling you that a connection attempt was refused. </p><p>Fundamentally you have only a few choices;   </p> <ul><li> Change the settings to exclude connections to your mail servers from the VPN.  Most of the VPN providers offer special settings or exceptions for certain sites as mail failing to work is one of the biggest issues with VPN use.  So they generally already have a solution to your issue handy.  This would be a preferred outcome </li><li> Get rid of the VPN.  Seriously decide if it really improves your security.  If you are like the majority of internet users these days, spending your internet time on social media and email, web site you have existing account with that are billing you like Ebay and Amazon the benefits of a VPN are rather limited,  perhaps even to only circumventing geo locating on television and other media. A VPN can improve security,  but it has to be matched to the needs of the user/device rather than adopting it like an antivirus program. </li><li> Stop using a mail client.  I do not recommend that,  but it is an option. </li><li> You may also be able to use the System and Thunderbird's proxies to route certain traffic away from the VPN connection.

Non so dove tu abbia letto questa cosa ma è completamente sbagliata. IMAP serve ad avere sul tuo computer una copia esatta della posta che hai sul server. Inoltre IMAP può essere usato per creare ulteriori copie su altri dispositivi (un secondo PC, uno smartphone, etc.). Il server e tutti i dispositivo collegati come IMAP vengono costantemente sincronizzati per cui qualsiasi azione fai su uno di questi, viene replicata su tutti gli altri. Ad esempio se cancelli una mail in Thunderbird, verrà cancellata anche dal server e dagli altri dispositivi collegati alla prima connessione. </p><p>Qui c'è una spiegazione più estesa -&gt; <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/differenze-imap-pop3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/differenze-imap-pop3</a> </p>",@next,false,0,0

Come indicato precedentemente, le intestazioni dei messaggi sono ancora visibili in Thunderbird sul computer locale. Tuttavia il corpo del messaggio sarà scaricato solo ""su richiesta"" e non sarà disponibile in modalità non in linea. </em> Questo comportamento è deciso dalla impostazione che citavi tu: <em>Conserva su questo computer i messaggi di qualunque cartella di questo account</em> </p><p>Questo significa che Thunderbird <strong>inizialmente scarica solo le intestazioni dei messaggi e recupera il corpo del messaggio solo quando lo apri</strong>. Una volta aperto però il messaggio è stato scaricato localmente e quindi occupa comunque spazio d'archivio. In altre parole è una opzione utile a risparmiare spazio solo se apri una piccola parte dei messaggi e gli altri li scarti o elimini senza aprirli. </p><p>Del resto perdona l'ovvietà, ma se non vuoi avere la posta salvata sul PC perché usi un client?

La soluzione professionale è Outlook, ormai è un passo quasi obbligato, ma cercavo di tenere duro e non per un fatto di soldi.  Grazie per la spiegazione, quello che manca a questo punto è un tasto che permetta di tanto in tanto di ricaricare sul server il corpo dei messaggi, un pò come iCloud o One Drive che hanno l'opzione ""libera spazio"" per non tenere i files sul pc, ma da quanto ho visto non c'è e quindi ecco perchè tutto quello spazio occupato. </p><p>Se qualcuno che legge avesse un suggerimento gliene sarei molto grato. </p>",bbose42,false,0,0
