Non so dove tu abbia letto questa cosa ma è completamente sbagliata. IMAP serve ad avere sul tuo computer una copia esatta della posta che hai sul server. Inoltre IMAP può essere usato per creare ulteriori copie su altri dispositivi (un secondo PC, uno smartphone, etc.).

This error usually happens when a person has more than one email account and one of the accounts is using the wrong SMTP server. Thank you. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0

I also receive send and receive emails on my  my laptop.  but normally only use the laptop when I'm traveling.  I'm assuming they're the same account because I use the same email address and the emails I receive on my PC and laptop are the same emails.  (received emails on my laptop disappear when I open up Thunderbird on my PC)  I'm having no problem sending emails from my laptop, (no error message) </p><p>I'm not sure what the ""SMTP server pane"" you mentioned is, but I pressed the ""Outgoing SMTP"" listing on the side of my account settings and I've attached the screen that came up.  </p><p>I should also say that I copied the SMTP server that is listed on my laptop account settings into my PC's SMTP server space but I still got the error message when I tried to send an email Thank you so very much for your time in responding to this.. </p>",carole26,false,0,0
