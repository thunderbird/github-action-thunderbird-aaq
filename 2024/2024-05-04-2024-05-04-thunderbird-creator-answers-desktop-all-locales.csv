A registry change maybe? </p><p>A previous thread I started requested help for an issue that transpired when I updated from 102 to 115 back in 2023. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1424162"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1424162</a> After messing with it, I uninstalled the 115 update, deleted Thunderbird folders in my user's AppData folders and reinstalled the last update I knew that worked with the email that Thunderbird was having a problem which was 102.  I had turned off auto-updates and got my four email accounts back like I prefer. </p><p>Last month I was presented with an update notification that I confused with a Firefox update and installed it.  Darn - the Unified Folder in that one email was messed up again.  I attempted some settings changed to the folders and it seemed to work. I was not too thrilled with the toolbar change at the top, preferring the small print Menu Bar at top, with Tabs directly under and finally Mail Toolbar at bottom but I resigned to live with the change. </p><p>A few weeks passed and the Unified Folder for that one email once again had a couple of subfolders under the account AND ALSO I noticed that syncing with my iPhone and other computers stopped. I was having to delete messages twice.  TIME TO UNINSTALL AND FIND 102 AGAIN. </p><p>Not a huge deal besides needed to redo the columns to my preferences and I finally figured out the child inheritance to other folders thing with all this practice re-configuring to older versions. </p><p>So the question...<strong> is there a chance that I can have the new update notification stopped?</strong> I don't want to even be notified by way of a periodic popup that I have to be on my toes so I can dismiss. </p><p>Thanks, Steve </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",sgayres
