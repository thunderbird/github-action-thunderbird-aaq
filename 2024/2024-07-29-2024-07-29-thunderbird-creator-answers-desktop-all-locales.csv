I do not want to import into the app but sync like my iPhone is doing so if I enter an event in any of them it will show up in the other one. Pretty simple but I can not find this in the Thunderbird desktop app. </p><p>please help Kind regards Richard </p>",calendar;needsinfo;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1665072;1665084;1665093;,rleroux8
