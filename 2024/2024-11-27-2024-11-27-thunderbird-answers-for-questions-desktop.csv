Next, delete the msf file in the Mail folder, which is a few levels below the Thunderbird program folder. After that, start Thunderbird and check if the same symptoms appear. (If you delete the msf file, nothing will be displayed immediately after startup, but the email contents should appear after a few minutes.) </p><p>I hope that solves the problem. </p>",Hisayuki.Fukuda,false,0,0

Maybe the problem is not with Thunderbird, but with the Gmail settings. You can try logging in to Gmail and checking if POP access is enabled in the settings. </p><p>I hope that solves the problem. </p>",Hisayuki.Fukuda,false,0,0
