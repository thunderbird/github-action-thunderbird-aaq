Okay, this may sound strange, but here is the real way to set fonts on Thunderbird. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default. If your message fonts seem small, I suggest going large, such as 20, and then resize as needed.  Here goes: </p> <ol><li>  in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  </li><li>  then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  </li><li>  select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  </li><li>  select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. </li><li> if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) </li><li> In settings&gt;composition, set Sending Format to 'automatic' (just my preference, not required) </li></ol> <p>NOTE: if font size is still too small, try a larger number, such as 20. the numbers in thunderbird are points, not pixels.  </p><p><br> With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), no HTML will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,2
