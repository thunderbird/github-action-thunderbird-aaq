From the 'hamburger' menu, select Help &gt; Troubleshooting information. 1b. Under ""Application basics"" scroll down to ""Profiles"" and click the link to ""about:profiles"" 1c Scroll down to ""Root Directory"" and click the link to ""Open Directory."" 2. Create a new directory with an extension of "".default"" (I called mine ""Leon.default"") 3. Copy the ""profiles.ini"" to a different directory (e.g. your own ""Documents"" directory) so that you can edit it. 4. Use an editor such as LibreOffice Writer to edit ""profiles.ini""  5. change the ""Path"" from ""xxxx.default"" (where ""xxxx"" can be a string of numbers and letters) to the name of the new directory that you created (e.g. my new directory was ""Leon.default"") 6. Save the new ""profiles.ini"" file. 7. Copy or move the new ""profiles.ini"" file so that it over-writes the ""profiles.ini"" file in the new Thunderbird folder. 8. Find your old Thunderbird folder (Mine was in a hidden directory called "".thunderbird""). 9. Find the most recent subdirectory there that has a "".default"" extension. It will have a name like ""51ymuit0.default."" 10. Open that subdirectory 11. Move the contents of that subdirectory into the new subdirectory that you created in step 2 (Mine was called ""Leon.default). 12. Start Thunderbird. If everything works, your old emails and settings will be restored. </p>",leon.arundell,false,0,0

My inference is that it stops working on September 16, but that an updated version is available. It's been years since I used Outlook, so can't advise on any versions. Regarding question 2, I believe you can import contact info if in csv or ldif format. On question 3, there are two layouts for the addressbook. That can be set by clicking the icon to the right of the search box on the addressbook pane, ticking (or unticking) table view. On question 1, I defer to others. If you need to convert quickly, I believe there are a few proprietary products to convert PST to mbox, but I have no experience with them. I wish you well in this. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
