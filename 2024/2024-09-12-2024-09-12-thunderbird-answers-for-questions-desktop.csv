Copy the ""profiles.ini"" to a different directory (e.g. your own ""Documents"" directory) so that you can edit it. 4. Use an editor such as LibreOffice Writer to edit ""profiles.ini""  5. change the ""Path"" from ""xxxx.default"" (where ""xxxx"" can be a string of numbers and letters) to the name of the new directory that you created (e.g. my new directory was ""Leon.default"") 6. Save the new ""profiles.ini"" file. 7. Copy or move the new ""profiles.ini"" file so that it over-writes the ""profiles.ini"" file in the new Thunderbird folder. 8. Find your old Thunderbird folder (Mine was in a hidden directory called "".thunderbird""). 9. Find the most recent subdirectory there that has a "".default"" extension. It will have a name like ""51ymuit0.default."" 10. Open that subdirectory 11. Move the contents of that subdirectory into the new subdirectory that you created in step 2 (Mine was called ""Leon.default). 12. Start Thunderbird.

There is nothing wrong with the idea, except nothing old works without a lot of work these days. </p><p>That 1962 Ford is still good, except it does not like unleaded and it is not considered safe by modern standards.  Unfortunately that approach does not work well when applied to software or computing in general.  The hardware and software, while past it's initial rush of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">Moores law</a> is still evolving quickly.  As something of an advocate for Mozilla and Thunderbird, I still acknowledge that it is also like all software prone to security errors.  There have been literally hundreds in the 15 years since you bought your copy of Outlook 2007,  Thunderbird's list is here <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/thunderbird/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/thunderbird/</a>  Microsoft do not lay out the information in as simple a manner,  but rest assured there have probably been more about outlook in the same time frame.  All of that is basically background to the ""it's not broke so don't fix it approach"" as general users we don't really know what is broken. </p><p>In my home I have some concerns about the privacy of my email,  but in a business situation you do not want everyone able to read just about everything, most especially not my competitor in business.  For this reason alone maintaining recent versions of software is imperative.  Despite a desire to do so,  you can not rely on your antivirus product. They are also only as good as their last build and yesterdays is not current enough. </p><p>While I am happy for you to look in on Thunderbird and perhaps settle on it going forward as a mail client.  It is not Outlook. While the two programs share a basic mail reader functionality, that is where the similarity ends. </p><p>So let's look at how the import from Outlook works.  It uses what is a very old windows technology, Dynamic Data Exchange to ask the Outlook program for data and then place it into your profile.  What this means in practice is Thunderbird can only ever know what the running instance of outlook knows.  So if you have a huge library of PST files.  Thunderbird will not get anything from them, only the ""default"".  Thunderbird can not read a PST file and really has no idea what it is. </p><p>It is also relevant that imported mail goes into the local folders account in the ""Imported outlook"" folder you have mentioned,  but there will be a number appended to the folder name with each import attempt.  Where this imported mail ends up is your decision,  you can move it.  But Thunderbird places it there. </p><p>You say that your accounts were not imported.  Is that because there is no entry in the list of accounts in account settings,  or has Thunderbird imported your account (when you look in account settings on the menu) but has configured them to use the global inbox on local folders?  POP mail accounts using the global inbox do not appear in the folder pane on the left if the user interface. </p><p>You say your imported mail contacts were scrambled.  That description sounds exactly like hundreds I have read over the years when folk try and import CSV files and do not take the time, or are unaware they need to, align the field names in Thunderbird and the file.  So how did you import your address books? </p><p>I see in this topic <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1463480"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1463480</a> further indications that you import may be CSV.  Import from outlook in the V31 era should have imported contacts without resorting to CSV.  But and this is the part you are probably not going to like.  The display name in Thunderbird is automatically generated when you add a new contact, you can edit it afterwards,how that impacts import I do not know.   </p><p>Below we have a CSV import windows and it clearly demonstrates how the software gets confused when field manes do not align. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-09-13-22-04-43-c7cc8b.png""> </p><p>In this instance the company name and address will both go somewhere unfortunate unless manual intervention is used to correct the fields. </p><p>Now to the next issue with CSV.  I see David suggesting the spreadsheet,  but if you are using 2007 era Outlook, I guess your spreadsheet is also from a similar time and came with Microsoft Office.  Excel has only in the past year or so come to cope with Unicode text files correctly. Despite that being the default text in Windows XP.  Back in 2013 I wrote this <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2013/03/importing-csv-files.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post </a>counseling against the use of Excel at all if importing CSV to Thunderbird and offered workarounds for those that insisted on Excel.

I had already created the address in D: for Thunderbird to look for my mail, and had simply copied across all of the contents of folder Thunderbird to that address, and the Profile in D: did ten receive and post all mail. However, I have just followed your steps to create Default User and that does still receive and post mail. What I did not mention was that I had other email addresses. I have two that are in the Default User profile, and one is a <a href=""http://virginmedia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">virginmedia.com</a> mail account. Do I create for these other New Profiles but now use the actual name of the addressee? I also have an unspecified Guest Profile, which has never been used, and that is in a separate Profile to the other three. As it is has been created but never specified, I guess I can now deleted it from Thunderbird, and when everything else is sorted and the contents of Thunderbird on C: has been deleted, re-create ready for another to define, and then that would automatically be on D:? Further I also have a Google Messages account on Thunderbird. Can I presume I do not need to do anything to that? </p>",alan.macleay1,false,0,0

When my kids lived here, and I am going back 26 years, it seemed to make sense for them to have discrete profiles. Since they left home I now have three accounts inside one Profile, my Profile, and as a token to their previous use of this app here I created one account in its own Profile, waiting for one of them to set up their own mail account, which has not happened, and I don't think it will. I can happily delete this. When I tried to move Thunderbird from C: to D:, I had simply set the new address in Account Settings\Server Settings, having copied those corresponding files to D:. Whilst that worked I found I was then unable to delete Thunderbird in C:, because some files were still being accessed, hence my post for help. Last night, after I posted I decided I would repeat your exercise for the other two mail accounts, now neglecting the additional profile during this morning. This seemed to work fine last night, however, when I looked at it this morning I could not see my mail, nor write nor receive mail from the account I had changed. I have today spent four hours setting up Thunderbird to operate only from Drive D:, have got my mail back and it all seems to work fine, but I have done this by avoiding the route you suggested. But let me explain. When I look in Help/Troubleshooting Information/About Profiles I now have one Profile, Alan, which points to C:, is the Default and cannot be Deleted. I have another Profile, Alan Macleay (which I have recently created) which I can change to Default, but which changes back later. If I Rename Profile Alan, can I later delete it, or maybe rename Alan Macleay, as well, but to Alan, can that then become the Default? I need to remove all reference to Drive C:. I have another question, sorry. When I launch Thunderbird, I have a popup which allows me to choose the Profile. If I choose Alan Macleay, as opposed to Alan, this leads me to creating and importing and setting up Thunderbird from the start, which I wanted to avoid. So my question is how can I change the Root and local Directory for the Profile Alan? Sorry I am making a bit of a meal of this, but I am stuck. </p>",alan.macleay1,false,0,0

What I was trying to do was to create more space on Drive C, and having 5+ gig on Thunderbird it seemed a good idea to move the data over to Drive D:. Last night I thought I had a drain wave, but maybe it was not such a good idea. I thought if I installed Thunderbird on Drive D: this could do it. I have spent all day, I live in London so you can guess the hours I have spent on this. I created Thunderbird on D:, at this moment in time I have my THREE mail accounts, up and running. My main accounts seems to be working fine, with no lost mail. The other two accounts are running, I can post and they can receive, I have most of my old mail there as well. I have also been doing those set up issues that you can imagine.  I did try move the Thunderbird folder from C: and lost Thunderbird on D:.  When I copied the Thunderbird folder back on C: the program worked as before, so I am guessing I am still linked to C:. But is it possible to run the app on D: without the mail data there?

I now have Thunderbird running with all four email accounts. Sorry I said three, but forgot my Goggle account. I have installed all the emails I previously had, and their folders, and those I had subsequently received since I started this. I had installed Thunderbird on D: and from what I can see it is only looking on D:. I have used Thunderbird since Netscape left the scene, and obviously have kept it uptodate with new releases but it had taken a while here to get it looking like it had. I guess with upgrades my previous settings were being preserved. In doing this work I have created quite a mess, with folders which are now not needed, and they are on C:, and my Desktop and D:. I will give those folders which I am using an identifier, which will make it easier to sort out and should I need to re-visit it. I will endeavor to do that tomorrow. I do have one question though. My hope was to create 5 gig of space on C: by removing those emails, do I need anything to remain on C: for the program to run?

I had noted a few rather vague emails from Microsoft about 'Modern Authentication, and had loaded OAuth2 on my cellphone to get my outlook  email to work on it. Seemed OK Then I got an email from MS on my desktop, saying like ""Fix this before the 16th Sep or else..."" I first tried putting in OAuth2 in as 'Authentication method'.  But then the response was ""Naah we don't support that.  Your outlook must be out of date""  (I have had it on a monthly subscription account for ages, but don't recall any 'update' notices) So I tried re-downloading and re-installing MS365.  That seemed to make things happier, although I can't see what it actually did. On redoing my <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account in TB with 'autodetect' for settings, it came back with 'none' for 'connection security'.  That produced a rather surprising response that outlook 'did not do encryption'. So I thought [unprintable] let's try 'STARTTLS'.  After a bit of digital grumbling, it seemed to settle down, and added the account. But it didn't seem to be doing anything. After restarting from scratch, it came to life, and seems to be working properly now. My settings are now as for the post by ""The Pillenwerfer"" above, but for STARTTLS in both 'in' and 'out'.

PM has an ‘easy switch’ feature. Basically a very easy to use import feature for all gmail, then I used the PM Bridge to sync the gmail import into TB.  Going forward, I set a forwarding rule in gmail to PM that syncs to TB. Seems like a lot, but setup was easy across the board, and far more effective than struggling with the gmail setup in TB.   Protonmail is an excellent, safe and secure system. If you haven’t already done so, try a free account. TB is a great application that works in tandem with PM. The two go great together by providing an offline repository for your PM email.  Thanks again everyone. Jeff </p>",jh.mk01,false,0,0

Your messages sent with TB might be running afoul of the spam filters applied by some recipients.  Things that might trigger a spam filter include signatures with remote images, messages with many links, embedded remote images etc.  Recipients might not even be aware of such filtering, but I'd first ask if your mail is being directed to a Spam/Junk/Bulk folder.  Also, try sending a simple plain text message with no signature and see if that gets through.

I suggest you use the webmail from your browser to check exactly what is in the account on the web.  </p><p>Additionally the quota is not necessarily mail only.  For example Google send out total usage of allocated space rather than just mail as they do not differentiate the source,  so it may be your photos that are backed up to Google, or your phone backup that is filling your quota, not mail.  That is if it is a google account. Each provider is just a little different. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is Google that I use for email and photos, but when I check my storage I have like a terabyte or more left.

Google takeout allows the downloading of your entire google email store by label which can be archived on a hard disk for later viewing then the data can be deleted from the cloud storage.
