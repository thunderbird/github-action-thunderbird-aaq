Create a new directory with an extension of "".default"" (I called mine ""Leon.default"") 3. Copy the ""profiles.ini"" to a different directory (e.g. your own ""Documents"" directory) so that you can edit it. 4. Use an editor such as LibreOffice Writer to edit ""profiles.ini""  5. change the ""Path"" from ""xxxx.default"" (where ""xxxx"" can be a string of numbers and letters) to the name of the new directory that you created (e.g. my new directory was ""Leon.default"") 6. Save the new ""profiles.ini"" file. 7. Copy or move the new ""profiles.ini"" file so that it over-writes the ""profiles.ini"" file in the new Thunderbird folder. 8. Find your old Thunderbird folder (Mine was in a hidden directory called "".thunderbird""). 9. Find the most recent subdirectory there that has a "".default"" extension. It will have a name like ""51ymuit0.default."" 10. Open that subdirectory 11. Move the contents of that subdirectory into the new subdirectory that you created in step 2 (Mine was called ""Leon.default). 12. Start Thunderbird.

There is nothing wrong with the idea, except nothing old works without a lot of work these days. </p><p>That 1962 Ford is still good, except it does not like unleaded and it is not considered safe by modern standards.  Unfortunately that approach does not work well when applied to software or computing in general.  The hardware and software, while past it's initial rush of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">Moores law</a> is still evolving quickly.  As something of an advocate for Mozilla and Thunderbird, I still acknowledge that it is also like all software prone to security errors.  There have been literally hundreds in the 15 years since you bought your copy of Outlook 2007,  Thunderbird's list is here <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/thunderbird/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/thunderbird/</a>  Microsoft do not lay out the information in as simple a manner,  but rest assured there have probably been more about outlook in the same time frame.  All of that is basically background to the ""it's not broke so don't fix it approach"" as general users we don't really know what is broken. </p><p>In my home I have some concerns about the privacy of my email,  but in a business situation you do not want everyone able to read just about everything, most especially not my competitor in business.  For this reason alone maintaining recent versions of software is imperative.  Despite a desire to do so,  you can not rely on your antivirus product. They are also only as good as their last build and yesterdays is not current enough. </p><p>While I am happy for you to look in on Thunderbird and perhaps settle on it going forward as a mail client.  It is not Outlook. While the two programs share a basic mail reader functionality, that is where the similarity ends. </p><p>So let's look at how the import from Outlook works.  It uses what is a very old windows technology, Dynamic Data Exchange to ask the Outlook program for data and then place it into your profile.  What this means in practice is Thunderbird can only ever know what the running instance of outlook knows.  So if you have a huge library of PST files.  Thunderbird will not get anything from them, only the ""default"".  Thunderbird can not read a PST file and really has no idea what it is. </p><p>It is also relevant that imported mail goes into the local folders account in the ""Imported outlook"" folder you have mentioned,  but there will be a number appended to the folder name with each import attempt.  Where this imported mail ends up is your decision,  you can move it.  But Thunderbird places it there. </p><p>You say that your accounts were not imported.  Is that because there is no entry in the list of accounts in account settings,  or has Thunderbird imported your account (when you look in account settings on the menu) but has configured them to use the global inbox on local folders?  POP mail accounts using the global inbox do not appear in the folder pane on the left if the user interface. </p><p>You say your imported mail contacts were scrambled.  That description sounds exactly like hundreds I have read over the years when folk try and import CSV files and do not take the time, or are unaware they need to, align the field names in Thunderbird and the file.  So how did you import your address books? </p><p>I see in this topic <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1463480"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1463480</a> further indications that you import may be CSV.  Import from outlook in the V31 era should have imported contacts without resorting to CSV.  But and this is the part you are probably not going to like.  The display name in Thunderbird is automatically generated when you add a new contact, you can edit it afterwards,how that impacts import I do not know.   </p><p>Below we have a CSV import windows and it clearly demonstrates how the software gets confused when field manes do not align. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-09-13-22-04-43-c7cc8b.png""> </p><p>In this instance the company name and address will both go somewhere unfortunate unless manual intervention is used to correct the fields. </p><p>Now to the next issue with CSV.  I see David suggesting the spreadsheet,  but if you are using 2007 era Outlook, I guess your spreadsheet is also from a similar time and came with Microsoft Office.  Excel has only in the past year or so come to cope with Unicode text files correctly. Despite that being the default text in Windows XP.  Back in 2013 I wrote this <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2013/03/importing-csv-files.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post </a>counseling against the use of Excel at all if importing CSV to Thunderbird and offered workarounds for those that insisted on Excel.  Fundamentally Excel is a complication no one needs in an already complicated process. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

When my kids lived here, and I am going back 26 years, it seemed to make sense for them to have discrete profiles. Since they left home I now have three accounts inside one Profile, my Profile, and as a token to their previous use of this app here I created one account in its own Profile, waiting for one of them to set up their own mail account, which has not happened, and I don't think it will. I can happily delete this. When I tried to move Thunderbird from C: to D:, I had simply set the new address in Account Settings\Server Settings, having copied those corresponding files to D:. Whilst that worked I found I was then unable to delete Thunderbird in C:, because some files were still being accessed, hence my post for help. Last night, after I posted I decided I would repeat your exercise for the other two mail accounts, now neglecting the additional profile during this morning. This seemed to work fine last night, however, when I looked at it this morning I could not see my mail, nor write nor receive mail from the account I had changed. I have today spent four hours setting up Thunderbird to operate only from Drive D:, have got my mail back and it all seems to work fine, but I have done this by avoiding the route you suggested. But let me explain. When I look in Help/Troubleshooting Information/About Profiles I now have one Profile, Alan, which points to C:, is the Default and cannot be Deleted. I have another Profile, Alan Macleay (which I have recently created) which I can change to Default, but which changes back later. If I Rename Profile Alan, can I later delete it, or maybe rename Alan Macleay, as well, but to Alan, can that then become the Default? I need to remove all reference to Drive C:. I have another question, sorry. When I launch Thunderbird, I have a popup which allows me to choose the Profile. If I choose Alan Macleay, as opposed to Alan, this leads me to creating and importing and setting up Thunderbird from the start, which I wanted to avoid. So my question is how can I change the Root and local Directory for the Profile Alan? Sorry I am making a bit of a meal of this, but I am stuck. </p>",alan.macleay1,false,0,0

What I was trying to do was to create more space on Drive C, and having 5+ gig on Thunderbird it seemed a good idea to move the data over to Drive D:. Last night I thought I had a drain wave, but maybe it was not such a good idea. I thought if I installed Thunderbird on Drive D: this could do it. I have spent all day, I live in London so you can guess the hours I have spent on this. I created Thunderbird on D:, at this moment in time I have my THREE mail accounts, up and running. My main accounts seems to be working fine, with no lost mail. The other two accounts are running, I can post and they can receive, I have most of my old mail there as well. I have also been doing those set up issues that you can imagine.  I did try move the Thunderbird folder from C: and lost Thunderbird on D:.  When I copied the Thunderbird folder back on C: the program worked as before, so I am guessing I am still linked to C:. But is it possible to run the app on D: without the mail data there?

I have used Thunderbird since Netscape left the scene, and obviously have kept it uptodate with new releases but it had taken a while here to get it looking like it had. I guess with upgrades my previous settings were being preserved. In doing this work I have created quite a mess, with folders which are now not needed, and they are on C:, and my Desktop and D:. I will give those folders which I am using an identifier, which will make it easier to sort out and should I need to re-visit it. I will endeavor to do that tomorrow. I do have one question though.

Do I have this right?   Alan </blockquote> <p>The thing is this...Thunderbird....no matter where the actual program is stored, it expects data to be stored in the default location and in Windows OS that gets put into your specific User Account.  Here: C://Users/User name/ </p><p>The amount of data that needs to remain in C:drive is minimal. But crucially it contains the data that Thunderbird needs, so it understands where the profile is actually located. Many people, probably most, leave it in the default location: eg: C: Users/User name/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/'profile name' folder </p><p>However, some people need to move it do to large size etc. So may choose to put profile on another Drive eg: D: drive. </p><p>In your case you had got it all wrong. You did not understand what a 'profile' was and therefore managed to separate the mail account data from the profile and then to make life harder, you had changed all the mail account name folders so making it difficult to see what aligned with what. Then whilst still running a profile from the original location got it to look at the moved mail account data. This might show you emails, but it's going to cause you no end of issues and you cannot remove anything from C.  Which is really defeating the objective. You also cannot perform a proper backup or use the data to move to another computer if required.  I'm going to help you sort it all out. </p><p>You provided good information and I was able to understand where all the bits and pieces were lurking. </p><p>So at this point, I need you to follow the instructions to get all the account 'Local directory:'  including Local Folders pointing to the data in the actual profile. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Most of your issues were caused because you did not  know the purpose of various files and folders nor did you understand that a mail account is not a profile.

I had noted a few rather vague emails from Microsoft about 'Modern Authentication, and had loaded OAuth2 on my cellphone to get my outlook  email to work on it. Seemed OK Then I got an email from MS on my desktop, saying like ""Fix this before the 16th Sep or else..."" I first tried putting in OAuth2 in as 'Authentication method'.  But then the response was ""Naah we don't support that.  Your outlook must be out of date""  (I have had it on a monthly subscription account for ages, but don't recall any 'update' notices) So I tried re-downloading and re-installing MS365.  That seemed to make things happier, although I can't see what it actually did. On redoing my <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account in TB with 'autodetect' for settings, it came back with 'none' for 'connection security'.  That produced a rather surprising response that outlook 'did not do encryption'. So I thought [unprintable] let's try 'STARTTLS'.  After a bit of digital grumbling, it seemed to settle down, and added the account. But it didn't seem to be doing anything. After restarting from scratch, it came to life, and seems to be working properly now. My settings are now as for the post by ""The Pillenwerfer"" above, but for STARTTLS in both 'in' and 'out'.

PM has an ‘easy switch’ feature. Basically a very easy to use import feature for all gmail, then I used the PM Bridge to sync the gmail import into TB.

Protonmail is an excellent, safe and secure system. If you haven’t already done so, try a free account. TB is a great application that works in tandem with PM.

I suggest you use the webmail from your browser to check exactly what is in the account on the web.  </p><p>Additionally the quota is not necessarily mail only.  For example Google send out total usage of allocated space rather than just mail as they do not differentiate the source,  so it may be your photos that are backed up to Google, or your phone backup that is filling your quota, not mail.  That is if it is a google account. Each provider is just a little different. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is Google that I use for email and photos, but when I check my storage I have like a terabyte or more left.

Google takeout allows the downloading of your entire google email store by label which can be archived on a hard disk for later viewing then the data can be deleted from the cloud storage.
