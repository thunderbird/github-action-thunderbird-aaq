This can be frustrating, but there are a few potential solutions you could try: <strong> </strong> <strong>Use Plain Text Mode: 'Sometimes, rich text formatting can interfere with hyperlinks. Try composing your email in plain text mode (if Thunderbird supports it) and then paste your text with hyperlinks. This might ensure that the links are preserved. </strong> </p><p>Paste as HTML: Instead of directly pasting the text, try pasting it as HTML. You can do this by right-clicking in the email body and selecting ""Paste as HTML"" or by using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V in some applications). This should retain the formatting, including hyperlinks. </p><p>Use an External Text Editor: If Thunderbird's built-in functionality isn't preserving hyperlinks, you might try composing your email in a separate text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). Once you've added the hyperlinks there, copy the entire text (including hyperlinks) and paste it into Thunderbird. </p><p>Check Thunderbird Settings: Ensure that Thunderbird's settings are configured to allow rich text formatting and hyperlinks. Sometimes, these settings can inadvertently affect how text is pasted. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Make sure you're using the latest version of Thunderbird. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that might address issues like this. </p><p>If none of these solutions work, you might consider reaching out to Thunderbird support or checking their online forums for further assistance. They may have specific troubleshooting steps tailored to your issue. </p>",tomfinn7781,false,0,1

It is the number Zero which should never be the date of an email.  But it is a good indicator of garbage in garbage out computing. </p><p>Now  the next issue is how do these duplicate appear.  Despite what you say,  the fact they have previously been downloaded means nothing, unless they were deleted at the time of downloading,  something that can only occur in POP mail accounts and only if the server does what it is told.  The Hotmail/Live/outlook one does not do as it is told. </p><p>Fundamentally most folk that have these issues have one of two constants.  A failing hard disk on which the file is stored,  or an antivirus product that is corrupting the reads and writes to the disk.  How have you recovered from these events in the past?

So, maybe you would have needed to uncheck them all and then you would be able to go through each one and reselect the correct field. </p><p>I've added an image which shows the blue checkbox on the right side which seemed to be auto selected. But note the item on the left does not necessarilly match the item on the right. The drop down was not offering what was required because it's already selected. Uncheck the blue box and it gets added back into the drop down list. </p><p>I did report this as a bug some time ago and maybe it's still not been looked into. First image shows eg: Home Address = Mobile number - this is wrong - but drop down only offers 'Mobile number'&nbsp;! Uncheck those blue icons on the right and the drop down now offers them. So you can work through each items and get it matched correctly. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
