This can be frustrating, but there are a few potential solutions you could try: <strong> </strong> <strong>Use Plain Text Mode: 'Sometimes, rich text formatting can interfere with hyperlinks. Try composing your email in plain text mode (if Thunderbird supports it) and then paste your text with hyperlinks. This might ensure that the links are preserved. </strong> </p><p>Paste as HTML: Instead of directly pasting the text, try pasting it as HTML. You can do this by right-clicking in the email body and selecting ""Paste as HTML"" or by using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V in some applications). This should retain the formatting, including hyperlinks. </p><p>Use an External Text Editor: If Thunderbird's built-in functionality isn't preserving hyperlinks, you might try composing your email in a separate text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). Once you've added the hyperlinks there, copy the entire text (including hyperlinks) and paste it into Thunderbird. </p><p>Check Thunderbird Settings: Ensure that Thunderbird's settings are configured to allow rich text formatting and hyperlinks. Sometimes, these settings can inadvertently affect how text is pasted. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Make sure you're using the latest version of Thunderbird. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that might address issues like this. </p><p>If none of these solutions work, you might consider reaching out to Thunderbird support or checking their online forums for further assistance. They may have specific troubleshooting steps tailored to your issue. </p>",tomfinn7781,false,0,1
