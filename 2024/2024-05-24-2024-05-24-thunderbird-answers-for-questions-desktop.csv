This can be frustrating, but there are a few potential solutions you could try: <strong> </strong> <strong>Use Plain Text Mode: 'Sometimes, rich text formatting can interfere with hyperlinks. Try composing your email in plain text mode (if Thunderbird supports it) and then paste your text with hyperlinks. This might ensure that the links are preserved. </strong> </p><p>Paste as HTML: Instead of directly pasting the text, try pasting it as HTML. You can do this by right-clicking in the email body and selecting ""Paste as HTML"" or by using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V in some applications). This should retain the formatting, including hyperlinks. </p><p>Use an External Text Editor: If Thunderbird's built-in functionality isn't preserving hyperlinks, you might try composing your email in a separate text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). Once you've added the hyperlinks there, copy the entire text (including hyperlinks) and paste it into Thunderbird. </p><p>Check Thunderbird Settings: Ensure that Thunderbird's settings are configured to allow rich text formatting and hyperlinks. Sometimes, these settings can inadvertently affect how text is pasted. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Make sure you're using the latest version of Thunderbird. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that might address issues like this. </p><p>If none of these solutions work, you might consider reaching out to Thunderbird support or checking their online forums for further assistance. They may have specific troubleshooting steps tailored to your issue. </p>",tomfinn7781,false,0,1

Nor do I care how long these people have been giving advice.  I only care about what actually works in my experience with this program when I do as directed, and the fact of what does not happen when none of these ported solutions work. Period.  Please do not misrepresent me. I never made the ‘assertion’ that “Pasting (sic) does not work.” Pasting the text DOES work but the embedded hyperlink URL does  not paste with the text. Only the text pasted. This only happens when I use Tbird so, ergo, the bug is demonstrably Tbird's </p><p>No, saving as a draft (a purported work-around commonly parroted in several forums) also does not work. Obviously if no URL is pasted with the text then nothing is saved in the draft. Nothing comes from nothing. Once the draft is pulled up no blue hyperlink appears and when sent no hyperlink is  sent– just the plain text. Nothing begets nothing. Conversely the fact that exact same method of  copy and paste hyperlinked text works in Outlook just fine clearly demonstrates the problem is with Tbird. “Microsoft expectations” is nonsense. </p><p>Elementary deduction: that copying and  pasting the exact same hyperlinked text DOES work fine in Outlook but does not work in Tbird demonstrates the defect lies with Tbird and the argument  that “lots of folk” who are “long time Thunderbird and open source users” do not experience the same issue only proves ""lots of folk"" do not have a workable answer to this problem and their answer is simply wrong in fact. So if you do not have a solution please do not troll me with the arguments about what  “lots of folk” experience. I am not interested in winning an argument over purported “Microsoft expectations’ but in solving this problem.  We are not here to verify “other folks’” experience but to solve this problem and if you do not have the answer please do not inject yourself into this query; but simply admit there might be something you do not know rather than insist on the validity of answers that do not work. </p>",jpjrsf,false,0,0

Sometimes more time, testing &amp; troubleshooting is needed to learn what is causing the issue. </p><p>But rather than offer you more steps to try then watch you return, get defensive &amp; berate others saying you've already tried that and did we understand the question and so on &amp; so forth, I'm just going to close this question &amp; leave you with these final thoughts (of which may anger you, simply for trying to help you troubleshoot your problem). </p><p>The main problem: “Paste as HTML: Instead of directly pasting the text, try pasting it as HTML. You can do this by right-clicking in the email body and selecting ""Paste as HTML"" or by using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V in some applications). This should retain the formatting, including hyperlinks.” </p><p>Observations: Your Thunderbird version is unknown. For all we know, you could be using a older version of TB which is missing the ""Paste as HTML"" option from the right-click context menu. </p><p>You could have a addon installed that is breaking the context menu &amp; hiding the ""Paste as HTML"" choice from you. You would need to disable ALL your addons in Thunderbird, restart the program then test again to see if the option was returned to the context menu. You might angrily retort you don't have any addons installed. Are you sure? You better check. If confirmed no addons are installed, move on to the next troubleshooting idea. </p><p>Could your Thunderbird profile be broken somehow? Is it very old profile &amp; a settings file got damaged thus hiding this option? Or again, are you using a very old version of Thunderbird where this option is not present? </p><p>Finally, no support forum anywhere on Earth can guarantee your problem will be solved. It takes lots of patience, lots of testing, lots of troubleshooting and lots of time. Sometimes if you work thru a premade list of common fixes it can help you narrow down the problem faster. If a support forum can't solve your issue, we are never happy about it &amp; continue to think about it in the future in case we finally find the obscure resolution to your problem. Endlessly talking about the problem can not magically produce a solution. Real troubleshooting work must be done. </p><p>I suggest you slow down, stop getting very frustrated, analyze the problem with a calm mind &amp; try different ideas to see what may be causing the issue. Even something like 3rd party programs have been known to inject themselves in Firefox &amp; Thunderbird causing maddening issues that take us a long time to finally find out they were the cause. </p><p>So I leave it to <strong>you</strong>, to analyze, troubleshoot &amp; test this problem until you find a solution. I wish you the best of luck, I truly do. </p><p>Thanks to everyone who offered their ideas to fix the solution here. I really appreciate your patience in dealing with issues like this. </p>",Noah_SUMO,false,0,0

A failing hard disk on which the file is stored,  or an antivirus product that is corrupting the reads and writes to the disk.  How have you recovered from these events in the past?

Not just for Thunderbird. </p><p>I think the issue is your antivirus is locking access to the file the mail is stored in because it is scanning it after the last email came in.  Generally we recommend a permanent exemption in antivirus products for the Thunderbird profile folders for this reason.  Perhaps add one now.  Exempting Thunderbird is one thing,  keeping the antivirus out of the file system when Thunderbird is trying to use it is another. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

""There is not an Thunderbird for Android as yet."" </blockquote> <p>As I believe @Matt misunderstood the question, I will answer a bit more extensively, while  addressing Mozilla here as well. I can confirm, that Thunderbird, as well as most x64-Windows apps run considerably fast on Win11-ARM64-architecture, since the newer Qualcomm CPU's have an heavily improved x64-virtualization engine, which makes devices using them now very competitive in speed &amp; power consumption, compared to x64 Intel notebooks (similar experience differences like Apple Macbooks with M vs. Intel CPUs). </p><p>I have a ThinkPad X13s (with the predecessor Snapdragon 8 Gen3) of the current Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, which ships now on Microsoft Surface Pro 11 and these new CPUs have even greater performance! </p><p>Of course, every kind of virtualization costs a bit performance. But in the case of my ThinkPad, performance feels equal to x64-apps (general purpose &amp; web) running on my Intel x64 Surface Pro 7+. But when you run an ARM64-app (almost all apps directly from Microsoft have been re-coded) and specifically Google Chrome, then you get a significant speed bump with very short response times, that it will simply excite you, as it did me! Look at my Chrome Browser ARM64 vs. Waterfox_x64 benchmarks attached, which basically means, using ARM64 apps is like adding a turbo charger into your x64-device. </p><p>I hope Mozilla will soon release an ARM64 version of Thunderbird (like for Firefox) to get me even more excited! @Matt Is this already addressed at Mozilla? </p>",mozilla.firefox94,false,1,0
