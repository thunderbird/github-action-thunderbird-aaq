Did you understand the question?  </p><p>I don't see that on my setup. (What “that” in your set up?)  </p><p>In the attached picture, (the attached picture is WAY too small to see no matter how deep I scroll.) ) I pasted (Ctrl+V) the content of your topic into a message after selecting it and copying (Ctrl+C).  </p><p>What are you talking about? Why would you paste the content of my topic into a message to test the issue? How is that relevant?  Since neither “content” my “topic” heading nor the “content” of query contains any hyperlinked text it could not possibly address the issue of  hyperlinked text pasting into a Thunderbird email. You are just pasting in non-hyperlinked text. How is that relevant?   </p><p>Make sure the message format is HTML. (You mean in Settings? My settings are set to HTML and text and have tested all other options.  Only plain text pastes in sans hyperlink.) I do not have a clue what you are trying to say. </p>",jpjrsf,false,0,0

So I guess that is the intended way to 'hide' a period. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
