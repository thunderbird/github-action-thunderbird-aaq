The global search in particular,  but increasing other search methods as they are moved to use the global search database, do no search on numbers. Basically you never get any response useful to you. It all has to do with something called the tokenizer, that decides what to index. If you have the customers name,  I suggest you search on that.  But keep in mind multiple words are searched separately.

It still causes problems with the password in safe mode or troubleshooting mode.  I double checked all my accounts in thunderbird for passwords and everything is setup as normal password.  The passwords are right.  I ran a test this morning and logged into one of my accounts manually.  I then restarted thunderbird and it said that the userid or password is wrong for one of my accounts.  I click enter password and pasted the password.  I tried it with checking the box to save it to password manager even though I previously verified that was correct.  The error went away for this account.  Great.  I then closed thunderbird and opened it again.  Still no error for this one account.  I closed it again and tried about an hour later and once again for that specific account, it said the password or userid is incorrect. </p><p>This is on a windows 10 machine.  Is there anything I should be checking on my hotmail account for some sort of setting I could try and then change thunderbird to connect differently?  My gmail account is working fine on thunderbird.  I hate that when I launch thunderbird, some of my accounts pull in emails fine and then later those exact accounts that previously pulled in says it is a wrong password or userid.   </p><p>I am willing try anything.  3 days ago, I had 10 strains of hair, now I am down to 2.

This is because the antivirus has the file to be updated locked at the time the update is to be written so the change is written in a new file.
