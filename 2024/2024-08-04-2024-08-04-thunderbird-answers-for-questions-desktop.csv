I was asking how to store a password in Thunderbird when it opens a browser session internally?

So there are many nice features you can add, but how do you store the credentials. </p><p>If I use a regular browser non of this is an issue, as those store the credentials for websites you visit. </p><p>Any feedback is appreciated, as I haven't found a solution. </p>",gregstressner,false,0,0

Using help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scrolling down to 'profile folder' and clicking 'open folder' puts you into the current profile and, at least for Windows users, backing up one folder shows you a list of all profiles.
