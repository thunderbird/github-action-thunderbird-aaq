Using help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scrolling down to 'profile folder' and clicking 'open folder' puts you into the current profile and, at least for Windows users, backing up one folder shows you a list of all profiles. In such case, you may see your full (old) profile there. And with the tolls&gt;import&gt;addressbook&gt; sqlite option, you may be able to salvage the addressbook. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
