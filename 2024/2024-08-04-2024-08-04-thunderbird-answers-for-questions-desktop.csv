I was asking how to store a password in Thunderbird when it opens a browser session internally?

Thunderbird is very susceptible to having updates corrupted with external interference, such as antivirus and other software that monitors activity. My suggestion is to turn auto update off when running a business, and do full backup prior to all updates. I encourage that for all software on which the business is dependent, not just thunderbird. Going further, I wouldn't upgrade ever unless the upgrade fixed a business problem or provided a useful feature. Just my two cents from my own career experiences. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Dit probleem was er tot vandaag ook met mijn 3 pop-accounts maar daar lukte het vandaag ineens wel om verschillende smtp servers in te stellen.
