Since then I can't receive any e-mail, so I've had to use a different app, but I'd prefer to use Thunderbird. I've tried re-starting the computer, un-installing and re-installing Thunderbird, changing the Firewall settings in Microsoft 11 but NOTHING has worked. </p><p>Please help!

I have another IMAP account which is fine. The main account still shows in the list but no subfolders. The data file still shows in the Profile/Mail folder but I am not able to select this file in the Copies and folders in settings for this account. The only option I get is for the other IMAP account. Could someone please steer me in the right direction. </p><p>Thanks </p>,thunderbird;accessibility;,thunderbird,accessibility,en-US,1698203;,rkpenfold

It remains as if I never sent it. When I close it, I find it ends up in my draft folder. I previously put my email address in the bcc field and it came back to me so I could save it. That no longer occurs. Has an update occurred that I'm not aware of? I don't approve of what's happening now and will be looking for another email client if this problem can't be corrected. </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",JimC0738

I was using Thunderbird mail when up pops this pop-up asking for my password.  I have never had to use a password to access my emails with thunderbird email. I tried a Yahoo mail password, a mozilla account password, a thunderbird account password--none are wanted. I can't find where to change a password or add a new password. </p><p>How can I get some help not sent via email. </p><p>Ruth Lewis theparnassus@frontier.com </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",theparnassus
