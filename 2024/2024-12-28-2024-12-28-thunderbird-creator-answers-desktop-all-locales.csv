I have updated each time the program told me of an available update. Each time without any issue, updating to 115.16.1, then 115.16.2, then 115.17.0 without any issue.  </p><p>However, I updated to 128.5.0 earlier this month and then everything went wrong. Betterbird just started freezing constantly, with the ""(Not responding)"" message coming up every time I tried to delete an email or start a search, taking 20 to 60 secs to become responsive again. Then it very quickly became completely unusable, taking 20 to 30 secs to respond when I just selected an email to view, and if I then clicked on something else before it had responded, it would completely freeze and I would have CTLR+ALT+DEL to kill the process and restart the program. It would appear to work again for 10 to 15 secs again before starting to do the same thing again. </p><p>I have attempted to uninstall and re-install the program using the older version when the program worked properly but then it came up with a message a start up telling me that I have to create and setup the entire program and email accounts again as the profiles were no longer compatible with the older version. As I didn't have the time or the patience to do that, I gave up and went back to Outlook for a couple weeks.  </p><p>I then noted that 128.5.0 had been updated to 128.5.2 so I thought I would try again, assuming a bug had been fixed. I have installed 128.5.2, setting everything and all the email accounts up again from scratch and found that it was working properly again. It worked perfectly for 2 days and then the same problem all over again of hanging and freezing, especially when I am trying to delete a viewed email, taking up to 2 mins to become responsive after deleting an email, with a message at the bottom of the program saying ""Moved 1 message to Trash"". I then delete another email, with the same result, but then after it has deleted the second message, the first message suddenly re-appears and when I delete that again, the second message re-appears again.  </p><p>When I CTLR+ALT+DEL, I can see that the process has orange or red indicators using 10%+ CPU and 30-40% Memory. This is 6-core 32GB RAM system that runs and handles everything else I do with ease. </p><p>Sorry for the long post, but hopefully all the extra info will be of assistance. I really liked the program for the couple months that it worked perfectly for me, but now I am just out of ideas. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1698397;,AussieCabling
