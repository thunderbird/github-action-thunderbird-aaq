I currently see no entries under ""Saved Passwords"".  As far as I can tell, the only way to trigger password saving is at the point of creating a new account, by checking the ""Remember password"" box.  However, that box remains gray and is unable to be checked.  I'm running Thunderbird 115.13.0 (up-to-date) on Windows 11, and get the same results with/without Norton 360 or other similar utilities installed/running.

I am using SpamAssasin to identify spam type mails. I'll include a screenshot to best illustrate my concerns...(attached) </p><p>Even tho I continually go into my spam folder, I seem to veyr much need to do this, so many of my regualr mails now end up there. I right click on each to Mark - Mark not as junk and yet over the days of use they are still being sent to that junk folder. As an exampl the ones from Meta are receipts for virtual games bought from their store. Several days back I marked those as not junk, the header of the mail rarely changes, but still they are being sent to my junk folder. </p><p>Within Outlook, on line, those mails are meant to be diverted to my Meta folder. If I was to go back to using Outlook, avoided opening it for quite some time now, I would expect to find those mails within that folder, and the Amazon ones within a Amazon folder. That is due to rules created for their placement within such  folders. </p><p>I guess my question is two part..... </p><p>why do such mails seem to persist in being marked as spam..? Secondly is there a ways to ensure they end up in their intended folders..? </p><p>by right clicking on them now they ar ethe nsent to my general inbox, including the BBC type. </p><p>Is there no such thing as a safe senders list tha tcan include omains and indivudal people / companies etc..? </p><p>Many thanks </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",morgan.tate
