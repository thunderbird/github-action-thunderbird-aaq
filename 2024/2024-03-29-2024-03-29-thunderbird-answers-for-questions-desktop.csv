However, when I first set up thunderbird on my Lenovo laptop, it uploaded all inbox emails from Comcast, it tool a long time to upload and then a long time to digest but then I had all my old emails on my laptop, would it be easier to just start up Thunderbird on my new laptop and connect to Comcast and let the files all upload again? If this is so fine, however how do I get Thunderbird after the inbox is uploaded, to impor the sent folder from Concast? Thanks. </p>",mnero,false,0,0
