And yes, I have been reding and trying to follow the Thunderbird post you cite for several months...I have tried EVRY suggestion in that Aricle, and EVERY SUGGETION in the Microsoft article it cites...and I HAVE updated TB with every new release....AND i have NEVER ONCE had a OAuth2 connection to IMAP server.  </p><p>I will try your safe mode suggestion shortly. (I did run the tests described in my previous post after telling Norton Smart Firewall to remain off for 60 minutes.) </p><p>(FYI, In early June, TB showed me a message from Google server telling me I needed an App password. Which I obtained and use with no problem.  I just now tried resetting in TB my Gmail IMAP server setting to OAUTH2 as a test, but, after restarting TB,  I am not receiving new  mail from Gmail (though no error messages shown).  So I guess neither of my email accounts has ever had a Successful IMAP connection with TB using OAUTH2, although, as I said, SMTP with hotmail via OAUTH2 works fine). .

For POP account info, try the Mail folder to see if your account is there, and look in Mail\Local Folders to check for an local folders  - check in each profile.
