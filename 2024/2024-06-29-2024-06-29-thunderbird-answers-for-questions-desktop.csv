When you told me that 0AUTH2 needs the original passord, not the App password, a lightbulb went off. With your help, after removing old Google passords, setting the google acct to OAUTH2 worked great for IMAP and SMTP. Same approach to Hotmail...And for the first time ever myTB has been receiving and sending via hotmail using OAUTH2 and the <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> url for IMAP.   So I'm not sure why I couldn't get this to work for months before I switched to the app password with Hotmail...but the point is,  TB and the servers are once again communicating. So thank you very much for that.  Two problems have arisenm in part I think as a result of a couple program crashes by TB while I was working with settings, or something similar.  Can you help me fix the following:  1) An extra view of Local Folders without the most needed subfolders  entered the folder tree view, but the problem is that the new Local Folder arrival with missing many subfolders took over the position that is most useful to me. It inserted itself  in the folder tree at the bottom of all the folders in my 2nd email account at the bottom of the Unified Folder display.  </p><pre>Unfortunately, the good, Original and useful Local Folders group can only be seen much further down the folder tree at the end of the All Folders display. (I need and rely on the Unified Inbox, Sent, Junk and Trash folders...I  could uncheck the All Folders option if ""Sent Copies"" was visible where it used to be under Local Folders, instead of only appearing in the Local Folders view visible at the end of the ALL Folders list that  shows below the Unified Folder tree.   </pre> <p>So that is remaining problem #1: How to restore sent copies to the Local Folder view that is visible at the bottom of the Unified Folder display (which now only includes ""Outbox""  as a subfolder of that Local Folders)? </p><p>Second problem is: I'm seeing a big handful of duplicate emails showing up in the Unified Folder Sent folder...I've cleared up most of this problem by deleting Smart Folders from the Mail Folder in the profile...but this repair fixes most, but still permits a handful of duplicates to remain, especially in the Sent folder. It's possible that the problem is aggravated by too many messsages in the Unifed Sent Folder (TB says 4,354), and I am planning to archieve and trim this considerably.  But a month ago there were no dupes and the sort was working perfectly, so something else may be involved as well.  </p><p>If you can help me solve these remaining problems, both of which arose in the past 2 to 4 weeks of intensive effort to solve the OAUTH2 problem...I could finally feel life was returning to normal after an extended nightmare.  Again, thank you for your precise, knowledgable, careful,  correct, and rapidly offered, help. </p>",kmartinp,false,0,0

My first suggestion is to see if there are prior profiles. Try this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' in left sidebar and click 'open folder'  - you are now in the profile, back up one folder so that you are in the Profiles folder.  - that may show multiple profiles. Only the one you are using is active; the others are dead weight - click to each of them. For POP account info, try the Mail folder to see if your account is there, and look in Mail\Local Folders to check for an local folders  - check in each profile. If you find some account info that appears recent, post a screenshot of the message folders and we can assist in recovering them. thanks. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
