Note: it's not all emails, it's only some - and not all necessarily with the same characteristics i.e. it is not all emails from one person or anything obvious like that. </blockquote> <p>There is this odd thing,  where mail that is downloaded to pop is considered delivered by some providers and not included in subsequent pop sessions from another device or mail clients.  Like this settings in Google mail. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-07-07-17-47-50-1eab05.png""> </p><p>Then there are the varying ideas about SPAM.  In the POP mail specification there is only a mail drop.  No folders at all.  In practice this is becoming more the inbox folder rather than the original ""mail drop"" with the effect that the ubiquitous moving of email to spam folders leaves those mails unavailable for POP download. </p><p>Trying to understand what the special ideal with a specific mail provider and POP is not as straight forward as it could be,  but spam filtering,  leaving millions of emails on IMAP servers and a general demand to be a packrat of every email ever sent to a mail account means providers are becoming ever more creative in ""encouraging"" add driven webmail.  You may even find that your provide is moving certain ""important"" mails to their own folder.  Leaving them out of the pop download as a result.  I faced this with the Google ""Important"" folder messing up POP downloads for message categorized as such. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
