(They call it ""modern"" authentication because they can't be seen to actually offer a standards based solution to anything.)  The option for app passwords is going away as well as normal passwords. </p><p>oAuth requires that the default of allowing cookies in Thunderbird is enabled and you may well encounter issues with more aggressive antivirus products blocking the initial authorization web page flow either through cookie management (blocking) or localhost blocking. </p><p>See the support article on the subject <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/microsoft-oauth-authentication-and-thunderbird-202"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/microsoft-oauth-authentication-and-thunderbird-202</a> </p><p>Note specifically the server names in the image and document.  They are not what they used to be and your not using the correct server names will mean that the authentication has no issuer.  in the case of all of the Micrisift/outlook/libe/msn/hotmail account the server name for incoming accounts is <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> and for outgoing (SMTP) accounts <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>  use of anything else will fail. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

What I really want to find out is why if I follow the process as it should be (with app passwords and OAuth2 Authentication, I get the error message that the server has already been installed and nothing I do gets me away from this message.  I checked under outgoing server (SMTP) and there is nothing related to outlook or office365.   </p><p>Marty </p>",duhnel,false,0,0

Those request are asking you to do that.   </p><p>Clicking the X in the corner of the widow just means you remain unauthenticated and can not get your mail for that account. So every folder you click, every time Thunderbird tries to get mail etc results in another authentication request.  So the cure is log in using the windows being provided, when they are provided. Late attempts just offer some sort of timeout message. </p><p>Note that Google started the oauth craze.  So  you will not get a different result there.  Or at Yahoo, they jumped on that band wagon a couple of years ago, along with AOL.  I think some of the European providers like GMX still allow passwords,  but I do not know for how long. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
