Note that this is my only address on <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>; I got it back in the late 90's- early 20's, not sure if MS bought it by then or not.  At some point (2012-2014) MS gave us an option to switch to @outlook.com or keep our @hotmail.com email address, I decided to keep <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> address. Didn't change the password setup (other than periodically change my password) until now, having to switch to OAuth2. </p><p>The Saved passwords contain three entries for hotmail, as shown in image below. </p><p>As an experiment, from my Windows system, I created a new <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account, uninstalled Thunderbird, along with the AppData from Roaming and Local folders.    Installed Thunderbird, went through the steps and allowed Thunderbird to automatically detect using my new <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email address and it selected the same information to set up IMAP and SMTP with OAuth2.   It popped up a web page asking for my password and that was it.  Checking <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> Security, it showed that Two-setup verification was off.  I was able to send email. </p><p>Next, I turned off two-step verification, added my hotmail account again to Thunderbird.  When setting it up, it asks for my password.  Thunderbird populated mailbox folders from hotmail, then I tried sending an email, but it again asked for my password only (no verification with two-step off) and still won't send email.  So the issue is not my 2FAS app generated code.  Other than email address differences, everything else is the same in Thunderbird for IMAP and SMTP. </p><p>What I don't understand is if IMAP can connect using my password via OAuth2 and download my email, then why doesn't SMTP via OAuth2 like my password (note that I copy/paste my password from my password manager) in sending email. </p><p>I assume that without two-step, OAuth2 is just using SSL/TLS to protect the transmission of the password. </p><p>Is there something else I can check on hotmail, to compare with outlook account? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",csmith11,false,0,0

Like this settings in Google mail. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-07-07-17-47-50-1eab05.png""> </p><p>Then there are the varying ideas about SPAM.  In the POP mail specification there is only a mail drop.  No folders at all.  In practice this is becoming more the inbox folder rather than the original ""mail drop"" with the effect that the ubiquitous moving of email to spam folders leaves those mails unavailable for POP download. </p><p>Trying to understand what the special ideal with a specific mail provider and POP is not as straight forward as it could be,  but spam filtering,  leaving millions of emails on IMAP servers and a general demand to be a packrat of every email ever sent to a mail account means providers are becoming ever more creative in ""encouraging"" add driven webmail.  You may even find that your provide is moving certain ""important"" mails to their own folder.  Leaving them out of the pop download as a result.  I faced this with the Google ""Important"" folder messing up POP downloads for message categorized as such. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If the program did not update,  then there is nothing changed that could ""glitch"". You probably have more than one ""security"" or ""safety"" product installed that updates hourly.  But it is Thunderbird which they caused to stop functioning so it is a ""Thunderbird glitch""  most likely it is a software firewall or antivirus ""glitch"" and the brand on those has nothing to do with Thunderbird. </p><p>Third party antivirus products mostly update hourly,  then there are these iniquitous VPNs which cause untold email issues and other dud products like CCleaner that actively delete settings and we still have folk wanting to blame the product with the symptom not the cause.
