Urgent!,"<p>Microsoft sent email last night announcing the end of ""Normal Password"" for Hotmail, and warning  that Hotmail would REQUIRE ""modern authrentication"" beginning 9/16. I have personal desktop subscription to Microsoft 365.  I have set Microsoft account to 2FA and checked in Tbird that cookies are enabled.  </p><p>I have spent hours and days trying &amp; failing. With server <a href=""http://imap-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap-mail.outlook.com</a> using OAUTH2,  Thunderbird won't sync and shows message saying  that server doesn't support the authentication protocol please enter another one.  With 2FA still turned on and using Normal Password setting and entering an App Password from Microsoft, the Imap connection is fine about 85% of the time, needing re-entry of the App password about once a day or so (usually requires several tries until App Password gets accepted.) </p><p>The 0AUTH2 fails with Norton Smart Firewall turned Off or Turned On-makes no difference.  </p><pre>(Sending email with Outlook and 0AUTH2 DOES work okay.) </pre> <p>I've also tried Imap connection with a different server:  <a href=""http://Outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.office365.com</a>, using 0AUTH2.  </p><pre>In this case, Tbird shows me a Timeout error and never makes an Imap connection to the server.   </pre> <p>I've been limping along with the app password, and ""normal password"" authentication, but now Microsoft announces they will stop accepting connections that are not 0Auth2  (""modern authentication"") from Tbird or any other software after 9/16.  The clock is ticking. I've tried every remedy I've seen online from Tbird or from Microsoft. Nothing has yet allowed a QAUTH connection for Tbird to a hotmail IMAP server.
