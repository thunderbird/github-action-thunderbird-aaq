The unit is a new SAMSUNG Tablet 9A and is owned by a friend.  I installed Thunderbird for Android on the unit.  I cannot set it up because it requires OAuth2 Authentication and it is not available within the TB for Android.  I use TB on many units using Linux and they work fine.   </p><p>I do not want to use Gmail client but maybe I have to.  Is there anyone aware of how to solve this problem so I can set him up with TB, which I prefer? Robert </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",robertdaleweir
