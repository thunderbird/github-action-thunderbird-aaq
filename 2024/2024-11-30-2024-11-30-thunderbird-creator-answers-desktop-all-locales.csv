I have tried every password I have and nothing works. Keep getting message ""Mozilla Thunderbird (Not Responding) and I cannot use my email account. Today I have found I have 2 accounts, same email address on the same account. Where and how this has come from I don't know. I have tried to delete the second account but it will not delete. It says it is loading 286 messages and at present 40 mins later is still going this is on top of the original account I have. Can you help??? How do I get my email account running smoothly so I don't throw the whole thing out the window. I hate turning on my computer. My kindle works better than my Mozzilla account (not computer savy).

The symptom is that I discover, after hours of working, sending mail, and receiving mail, that the ""sent"" mail is all actually stuck in Local Folders Outbox. If I click on Outbox I can see the email messages that are waiting to go out.  The only way to get them to go out is to quit Thunderbird and then restart, at which point I can see them go out, one by one. </p><p>This has happened to me many, many times, but not every day - or even every week.

I don't think that's the problem. While I am working, I frequently have to switch to an internal vpn to access various things. I don't like to run video conferencing or other high bandwidth tasks through the vpn server, so I generally disconnect when I don't need it. I *think* Thunderbird is sometimes getting confused about the network - perhaps when I've started composing an email with vpn running but switching vpn off before sending.
