When I 'click' get mail the 'system' tries to connect (the little blue line in the lower right corner is active and I soon get a message 'unable to connect'). I have been into SETTINGS and ACCOUNT SETTINGS numerous times and have made some changes with no success. I am wondering if it is a password issue (how to fix?) or a change somewhere else that I haven't found. I note thunderbird has 'recently' added encrypted requirements, Is there something there I should know about? I do not use a proxy server and have set for NO PROXY on internet connections.
