The unit is a new SAMSUNG Tablet 9A and is owned by a friend.  I installed Thunderbird for Android on the unit.  I cannot set it up because it requires OAuth2 Authentication and it is not available within the TB for Android.  I use TB on many units using Linux and they work fine.   </p><p>I do not want to use Gmail client but maybe I have to.  Is there anyone aware of how to solve this problem so I can set him up with TB, which I prefer? Robert </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",robertdaleweir

It was working fine until 12:20 on Nov 29. Thunderbird had just installed the latest updates (128.5.0esr (32bit))and it seemed to be OK. At about 1430 I was at xfinity store and made changes to my cable TV package. I informed the agent about my email problem, but he wasn't able to provide any help. When I returned home, I was still (and currently) unable to connect to the email server. When I 'click' get mail the 'system' tries to connect (the little blue line in the lower right corner is active and I soon get a message 'unable to connect'). I have been into SETTINGS and ACCOUNT SETTINGS numerous times and have made some changes with no success. I am wondering if it is a password issue (how to fix?) or a change somewhere else that I haven't found. I note thunderbird has 'recently' added encrypted requirements, Is there something there I should know about? I do not use a proxy server and have set for NO PROXY on internet connections. All of my other 'normal' internet sites seem to work OK. What am I missing? appreciate any ideas. John </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1691076;,jemmot
