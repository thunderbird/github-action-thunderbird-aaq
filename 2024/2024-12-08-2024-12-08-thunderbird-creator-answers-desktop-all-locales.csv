Whenever the Synology drive is doing other tasks and Thunderbird is symultaneously trying to update the calendars, the following will consistently occur: </p><p>1)  A small error next to the calendar will appear stating the calendar is momentarily unavailable. 2)  If the Synology continues to be busy, the calendar will automatically disable and a button will appear next to the calendar to enable it.  All appointments and tasks are removed from the calendar and task windows/tabs. </p><p>If step 2 occurs, the calendar will not re-enable automatically.  It will remain disabled until the user manually re-enables it.  This risks tasks and appointments being missed. </p><p>I regard this as a bug.  A serious one.  Is there a solution that I have not yet found despite looking everywhere? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",rhys.perrin

How has this not been fixed in over 2 years?? </p><p>And why does it even remember removed accounts? If I remove it from the list of accounts I expect Thunderbird to delete all mentions of it from my system. </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,1692775;,zoran.ravic

One is Outlook and the other is via IMAP. I find tag function works well in any email of the Outlook account. But for my IMAP account, once I tag any email, it soon disappears after any further operation (e.g., clicking any button). What happened here? Is there any way to fix it? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",mingjia.xie

Each time I wanted to send from my NTL account I got a pop-up message asking me (Think I recall correctly) to insert my NTL password. I ignored it and switched my sending email address to my gmail email account. Now I find difficulty sending both in Gmail and in Virgin, sometimes having to wait several minutes for the email to go, sometimes it not going at all, other times waiting for a copy, then occasionally ""can't copy to the ""sent"" folder so save in ""Local Folder"". </p><p>I would be grateful for advice how to revert to the previous excellent service i always had with Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",gramlagansingh

Da qualche tempo quando apro Thunderbird inizialmente l'applicazione non riesce a scaricare nuovi messaggi, come potete vedere sull'immagine che allego del registro attività, e solo in un secondo tempo riesce a farlo. Per ovviare al momento ho impostato gli account a non controllare i nuovi messaggi all’avvio (deselezionandolo sulla scheda impostazione server), e solo dopo chiedo di scaricare i nuovi messaggi da tutti gli account. Precedentemente questo non avveniva e non riesco a ricordare dopo quale aggiornamento ha iniziato a verificarsi. In attesa di un vostro gentile consiglio, ringrazio e vi auguro buone prossime feste </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,it,"",brusalbert
