Whenever the Synology drive is doing other tasks and Thunderbird is symultaneously trying to update the calendars, the following will consistently occur: </p><p>1)  A small error next to the calendar will appear stating the calendar is momentarily unavailable. 2)  If the Synology continues to be busy, the calendar will automatically disable and a button will appear next to the calendar to enable it.  All appointments and tasks are removed from the calendar and task windows/tabs. </p><p>If step 2 occurs, the calendar will not re-enable automatically.  It will remain disabled until the user manually re-enables it.  This risks tasks and appointments being missed. </p><p>I regard this as a bug.  A serious one.  Is there a solution that I have not yet found despite looking everywhere? </p>",thunderbird;performance-and-connectivity;,thunderbird,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",rhys.perrin
