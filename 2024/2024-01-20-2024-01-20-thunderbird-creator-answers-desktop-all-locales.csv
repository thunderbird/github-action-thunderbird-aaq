I followed all instructions to get all my email addresses into Thunderbird. But Thunderbird did not load any of my emails from one server (Earthlink) beyond January 3rd.  As far as I know all of my emails accounts were IMAP. Proton Mail loaded all past emails once I entered the correct encrypted password from their Bridge app. But hundreds of emails from Earthlink are missing.. I looked at my Thunderbird Profile and it was updated to todays date, date of opening update.  I did not receive any notice to backup this file before this update.  What are my remedies here? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",earthling808

1437242,2024-01-19 17:27:06 -0800,2024-01-19 17:27:06 -0800,Thunderbird: Copies of messages not being saved in SENT folder,"<p>Hi all, </p><p>Two days ago, copies of messages I send stopped being automatically saved to my TBird SENT folder. This is the case whether I send the messages to myself or other addressees. </p><p>I use Windows 10, TBird 115.6.1, and Gmail (with POP3 for the affected account).  </p><p>BTW, this is not happening with an IMAP account I also use with TBird. Copies of messages I sent continue to be automatically saved to that account's Sent folder (as usual). </p><p>After researching this problem for several hours today, I've found that it's not an uncommon issue. The general advice is to navigate to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders, check the Place a copy in, select Other, then point to the Sent folder of the affected account. (Alternatively, a copy can be requested to be placed in the Sent folder under Local Folders, which is actually what I've had set for many years of using TBird). </p><p>I tried sending multiple test emails to no avail. Nothing solved the problem of no copies in SENT. Despite that, every time I sent a new email, my Sent folder message count showed the addition of one more message, but no message appeared. Right now my Sent folder says there are 14 messages there, but none actually appear. The folder is empty. </p><p>I then tried several other alternative suggestions from Mozilla and other websites. Nothing works. Copies of emails I send are being saved to my Sent folder on Gmail webmail. Just not in Thunderbird. </p><p>I also tried the REPAIR option for my Sent folder. No effect. Shut down the program, re-started it, etc. </p><p>I verified that I had set TBird as an exclusion in Windows Security. </p><p>As a last resort (since this is a very troublesome problem!) I created a new ""Copies"" folder under my Local Folders and set the ""Place a copy in"" that new folder instead of into Sent. That did actually work. Copies of emails I sent after that did show up in that new ""Copies"" folder. </p><p>I would appreciate any assistance you can give, as I suspect my TBird Sent folder has somehow become suddenly corrupted. If so, can you suggest how to proceed. Thanks very much! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",kakaako

Now I'm not a seasoned frontend dev, but I have made a few websites already and know how html+css works and if I don't know I'll check the <a href=""http://developer.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">developer.mozilla.org</a> site (among others).   </p><p>If I send myself a test message, when I open it I see only the image placeholders, although the corresponding links are there (the cursor changes and I see the link on the bottom).   </p><p>Yes the html file works since it displays fine in any browser and in TB my message view is set to both html and text.  I thought it might have been the Environment Path variable that didn't include the image file path (made no difference).  I also put an exception in the Mail Content section in the Privacy and Security settings (made no difference).  So it doesn't matter if I use a file (via the global settings) or if I use a signature plugin (Signature Switch).  I know browsers are pretty forgiving, but if the html was really the problem I'd see it (and VS Code would also probably let me know if something was incorrect).  And the Signature Switch plugin uses just the bit of code within the body tag, no need to include the header that's in the html file. </p><p>I've seen many bug reports on this subject that are either archived or set as ""<em>solved</em>"", but it doesn't appear to be really ""solved""!  Oh and my TB is on auto update and I'm on Win10.  The only thing I can add is that in the preview pane in Windows Explorer, when I click on the html file, the images are also shown as placeholders and on top of the pane there's a message saying the images have been blocked...so I don't know if it's a Windoze thing only or not. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pduclos
1437247,2024-01-19 18:40:58 -0800,2024-01-19 21:21:29 -0800,Thunderbird suddenly cannot login to hotmail server - sometimes!,"<p>Hi. I have used Thunderbird for a long time. I have never had a problem accessing my hotmail account for emails. Overnight Thunderbird now posts error message boxes when trying to login to the hotmail server. It reports incorrect username or password. Neither has been changed by me and comparison with Eset Password Manager shows them to be correct. I can login to Outlook online using the same login credentials an get my emails that way. I have also changed my Outlook hotmail password while logged in in my browser and updated everything on the PC to match of course. </p><p>I have massaged the server Settings for hotmail and have had the system working again, for a while. Twice I have reset the settings to a different server and back again and that seems to clear the problem for a while. Then the error messages switch on again consistently. At this moment using ""File"" -&gt; ""Get New Messages For:"" -&gt; ""Hotmail"" works without any problem and the automatic scheduled checking reports ""No messages to download"" so it appears to be working.  But that is after just coming back to my PC to find a string of failed attempts, each with its own error box, which have appeared since I last ""fixed"" the problem and assumed it was now fine. </p><p>My server settings are Type: POP;  Name: <a href=""http://pop-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail.outlook.com</a>;  Port: 995;  Username: same as for browser access (which works);  Password: As in Thunderbird's stored passwords matching Password Manager and working browser access. </p><p>In my paranoia I have even wondered if I am being locked out by Microsoft somehow.  Can anyone suggest what is going on here? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1631645;1631657;1631664;,bordonbert

1437263,2024-01-20 00:20:34 -0800,2024-01-20 00:20:34 -0800,Gmail Inbox Categories,"<p>Having recently migrated our O365 Exchange/Outlook email to Google Workspace, one of the most useful benefits is the automated assignment of Inbox Categories (Promotions, Updates, Forums) that mostly keeps my Primary Inbox free of automated items.  However, using the Gmail browser-based UI is painfully awkward compared with Outlook so a good desktop app is an essential I'm keen to find.   </p><p>Thunderbird is the only app I've seen that comes close to matching Outlook's functionality and ease of use, but it doesn't support Gmail's critically important Inbox Categories, so all the automated stuff is in my main Inbox making it unworkable for me.   </p><p>If Google had enabled filters to work based on these categories, it would be a simple matter to automatically move the automated items to my 'Automated' Label which would keep my Primary Inbox clear and this would reflect in my Thunderbird Inbox, but in their wisdom, they've not yet implemented this despite the obvious benefits to the user.   </p><p>They've also not exposed this categorisation to the MAPI interface which is, I'm guessing, the main reason why the Inbox Categories are not supported in Thunderbird, right?   </p><p>However, Canary is one app that does support these.  It's pretty lame as a client, but it does show that it's possible to offer Inbox Categories in a desktop app without replicating the entire Gmail UX (as Kiwi does).   </p><p>Thunderbird is the only app I've seen that offers an Outlook-style approach to handling email so the addition of support for Gmail Inbox categories would make it the perfect solution for users that want to combine the flexibility and power of this way of working with the solidity and reliability of Gmail.   </p><p>I can't imagine I'm the first to notice this so I'd be surprised if it's not already being looked at, but if not, what would it take to initiate this? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Tolqua
