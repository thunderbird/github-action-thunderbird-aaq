If it isn't working, there is likely an external app or factor interfering.  Run Windows in safe mode to bypass startup apps like antivirus, VPN, online backup etc.  Create a new test profile in TB from Help/Troubleshooting Info, about:profiles.  Add the gmail account as IMAP with the settings provided by the setup wizard. </p><p><a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Gmail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Gmail</a> </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
