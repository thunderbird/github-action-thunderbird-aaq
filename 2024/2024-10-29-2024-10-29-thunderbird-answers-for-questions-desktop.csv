Thunderbird is set to automatically apply updates to keep the application serving users properly. Most users appreciate that service. That setting may be turned off by users, and it is the user's responsibility to develop some basic awareness of what the app does. It is also possible to return to a prior setting when the update is found to not meet the user's preferences. I will also add here that support on this forum is from fellow users, not developers, not 'owner', not managers.

In the case of the message reading tab or window there is no delete as there is a compulsory button in the message header toolbar. </p><p>If you do not have a toolbar in the header of the message you are reading,  then the issue is where is it.  Not as you originally asked where is the delete for the main toolbar.  As you appear to be using a heavily customized user interface,  perhaps something in the customization have removed the toolbar. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-11-02-08-19-16-b026ed.png""> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

I wish the old 'account colors' extension was comparable with the newer versions of T-Bird. The old '<strong>Dorando key config'</strong> (custom shortcuts) was nice too, but I found a work-around with the ""tbkeys-lite"" keyboard duplicate message, whereas the old was instantaneous.

The old style addons has implicit access to everything on your computer and every part of Thunderbird.  It was convenient and fast,  but it was also a security nightmare. Essentially installing an addon came with having implicit trust in the addon author to do not wrong by you.  In terms of Thunderbird and mail that was essentially faith well placed.  Not so much for browsers. </p><p>As Thunderbird is built on ""the Mozilla platform"" it shares much of it's code with Firefox and the addons ecosystem is one of those shared components.  There are differences,  like Thunderbird calls web extensions mail extensions.  The differences are really about the fact most web extension APIs are about useless for mail manipulation so Thunderbird had to build an extensive additional API's for mail in addition to the web API's Firefox builds so chose to use another name in the hopes of reducing confusion with addon developers. </p><p>I should probably also mention <a href=""https://www.betterbird.eu/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">BetterBird</a>.  It is a soft fork of Thunderbird with many of the complaints older Thunderbird users have with the current implementation fixed or the rough edges rubbed off.  It is 100% compatible with Thunderbird.  I use it as well as Thunderbird and financially support the project because having competing implementations is probably good for Thunderbird's core stability.

The Thunderbird I installed has been running great.  So good to have it again.   Before I got it installed, I had to revert to Xfinity email.  What I missed most was Thunderbird's message filtering ability.  I get so many bogus emails with Alias names that Xfinity was not able to filter.  Now, with TB back, I can view the email source info and make a message filter for that email. Feels like I just got home from a long, dark trip.  Good luck Jim. Jerry </p>",HarryJarr,false,0,0

I was under the mistaken impression that all information about contacts would be included in mailing lists. Now knowing that this is not the case, what I would like to do is nest some of the current addressbooks (whose contacts I rarely access) as ""sub-addressbooks"" (that include all contact information) within a single addressbook that contains the ""sub-addressbooks"" in the same way a file folder can contain subfolders.
