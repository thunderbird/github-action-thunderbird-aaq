At that time most of the December incoming emails were spoiled and inaccessible. </p><p>Now the failure has spread back all the way to the beginning of the inbox -- incoming emails from 2017 and 2018 which I had kept there for lack of a better place to put them. </p><p>What can I do?  Other than stop using Thunderbird?!  I am on Beta, would it help to go to the normal version? </p><p>How would I do that? </p><p>I have lost hundreds of incoming emails, valuable ones by definition (i.e. because I chose to keep them). </p><p>I am using 1220b1 (32-bit) in Windows 10. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mctangora

The only way I have figured out to get them back is to quit and re-open Thunderbird. I have only one add-on and one theme active. Turning them off doesn't change anything. It's not a critical issue, just annoying. But if there's a solution, I'd love to know!  </p><p>This is a relatively recent development... since the last update, I think. But it's happening at least once a day, often more. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lotsofjoy

We use Outlook email addresses. From July until last week, we were still receiving Windstream emails and had gradually been telling everyone to use the new Outlook addresses. </p><p>Now Windstream is insistent that we give them a password. Typing in the only password we know is not working. I can often click cancel and move on, however Windstream is now locking Thunderbird up so I have to use Task Manager and restart. </p><p>After all this time, we really do not need to continue receiving emails through Windstream. We did fine with setting up the new Outlook addresses, but we are clueless on disabling the old Windstream addresses. </p><p>As you see this is not really a Thunderbird problem, but I am hoping that someone can help anyway. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",EastTenn

Currently TB will receive mail but unable to send.   </p><p>This is complicated in that Lindsay is paying <a href=""http://iPrimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">iPrimus.com.au</a> a monthly fee to enable him to use an old email address xx@bluep.com.  I can log in to the iPrimus web portal to send and receive xx@bluep.com emails, <a href=""https://webmail.iprimus.com.au/?_task=mail&amp;_mbox=INBOX"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webmail.iprimus.com.au/?_task=mail&amp;_mbox=INBOX</a>. </p><p>I downloaded Thunderbird version 115.6.0 (64-bit) on my pc this morning and the Auto Set Up configured <a href=""http://mail.bluep.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.bluep.com</a> as the incoming (POP) and outgoing (SMTO) servers.  Mail is coming in but not sending. </p><p>I changed the outgoing server to <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a>, default port 587 however messages still cannot be sent and Thunderbird shows that smtp settings must be reconfigured. </p><p>I spoke this morning to iPrimus Tech Support who advised the default smtp port should be 25, not 587.  However I have found that resetting the smtp port to 25 does not enable emails to send. </p><p>Note that I have previously set the smtp port to 587 which enabled sending on non ISP connections.  This ability would be required as Lindsay is using whatever Wi-Fi service is available in the facility. </p><p>iPrimus Tech Support have suggested I should contact Thunderbird (Mozilla) about this problem. </p><p>Can you advise Thunderbird server settings for this situation. </p><p>Thanks for you assistance.

I have always sorted all my email by DATE. Newest at the top. I use FOLDERS for sorting names or subjects I correspond with.  </p><p>I want all my email in all my folders to  sort by DATE. I missed seeing a lot of messages when THREADS became part of Thunderbird. Now I have to look all over the place if every new email I get is sent as a response to a previous email. Before all new email was at the top. Now it is everywhere within a folder and it takes me way too much time to keep looking for the latest emails. </p><p>Is there any way to  just turn THREADS off without loosing the ability to see ALL emails. </p><p>Thanks. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",FredBerney
