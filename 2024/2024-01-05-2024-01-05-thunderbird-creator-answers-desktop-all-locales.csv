At that time most of the December incoming emails were spoiled and inaccessible. </p><p>Now the failure has spread back all the way to the beginning of the inbox -- incoming emails from 2017 and 2018 which I had kept there for lack of a better place to put them. </p><p>What can I do?  Other than stop using Thunderbird?!  I am on Beta, would it help to go to the normal version? </p><p>How would I do that? </p><p>I have lost hundreds of incoming emails, valuable ones by definition (i.e. because I chose to keep them). </p><p>I am using 1220b1 (32-bit) in Windows 10. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1628395;,mctangora

The only way I have figured out to get them back is to quit and re-open Thunderbird. I have only one add-on and one theme active. Turning them off doesn't change anything. It's not a critical issue, just annoying. But if there's a solution, I'd love to know!  </p><p>This is a relatively recent development... since the last update, I think.

We use Outlook email addresses. From July until last week, we were still receiving Windstream emails and had gradually been telling everyone to use the new Outlook addresses. </p><p>Now Windstream is insistent that we give them a password. Typing in the only password we know is not working. I can often click cancel and move on, however Windstream is now locking Thunderbird up so I have to use Task Manager and restart. </p><p>After all this time, we really do not need to continue receiving emails through Windstream. We did fine with setting up the new Outlook addresses, but we are clueless on disabling the old Windstream addresses. </p><p>As you see this is not really a Thunderbird problem, but I am hoping that someone can help anyway. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",EastTenn

Mail is coming in but not sending. </p><p>I changed the outgoing server to <a href=""http://smtp.iprimus.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.iprimus.com.au</a>, default port 587 however messages still cannot be sent and Thunderbird shows that smtp settings must be reconfigured. </p><p>I spoke this morning to iPrimus Tech Support who advised the default smtp port should be 25, not 587.  However I have found that resetting the smtp port to 25 does not enable emails to send. </p><p>Note that I have previously set the smtp port to 587 which enabled sending on non ISP connections.  This ability would be required as Lindsay is using whatever Wi-Fi service is available in the facility. </p><p>iPrimus Tech Support have suggested I should contact Thunderbird (Mozilla) about this problem. </p><p>Can you advise Thunderbird server settings for this situation. </p><p>Thanks for you assistance.
