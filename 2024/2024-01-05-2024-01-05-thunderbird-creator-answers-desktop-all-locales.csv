The folder within the profile folder:  3647222921wleabcEoxlt-eengsairo.files will not paste because its file name path is too long. Even when I edited the windows registry to allow long file names (changed the registry value for long file names from 0 to 1) I still get the same error message when pasting the copied profile folder into an external hard drive.  Will the backed up copy of the profile folder if installed into a new computer still allow thunderbird to function properly without that folder (i opened that folder and it is actually empty)? Can thunderbird's code be rewritten to shorten this file name? Other solutions anyone can recommend? thank you </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1628535;1628536;1628537;,billJ24556

I have just had a new hard drive fitted to my old PC after a horrendous OneDrive incident.  I have installed Thunderbird on my new drive but it does not seem to have loaded a Profiles folder in my AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird - just Adobe, Microsoft and Mozilla (Firefox).  Can you tell me where else it might be so that I can paste in my old Thunderbird folder (with years and years of emails) &nbsp;? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1628559;1628562;1628587;,sarahereira
