This is the last OS release that my hardware will support. </p><p>I have spent a lifetime in software, so I will do my best to present the problem cogently.  Perhaps it will save you some time. </p><p>I am having real problems understanding and deploying filters.  I have four email accounts, which makes it a bit more complex.   </p><p>I cannot detect whether filters are to be applied to EACH INBOX of my four email accounts, or if filters are GLOBAL to any given profile. </p><p>I THINK from my observations that both are true.  You may define filters for individual email accounts, but if you to to Tools/Message Filters, all defined filters are shown. </p><p>No matter what I try, my filters don't achieve the desired result of automatically filtering mails into separate sub-folders.  I have to drag each email manually, which can be a big job sometimes.  Filters used to work, and I USED to think I understood them. </p><p><strong>So what is the execution flow? </strong> Does mail first flow to the inbox of each individual email account and is filtered THERE, or is it all automatically sent to the Inbox on Local Folders and is filtered THERE?   </p><p>I highlighted an individual email account, and went to Tools/Message Filters, and the filters there can be different from other filters that I have defined. </p><p>For example, in each of four email accounts, I may define two or more filters, BUT the last one in the order is called ""Match All"" which is defined to move ALL mail in that account to the Inbox on Local Folders.  All incoming mail does indeed end up in the Inbox, but no filtering appears to be done. </p><p>Then I figured that filters must be global to a Profile, and defined my filters to Local Folders.  Again, no joy. </p><p>I have read all the web pages having to do with filters and I THINK I'm defining them properly (I could hardly get them wrong - as clear as the instructions are).  But there is no discussion of the SCOPE of filters. </p><p>I'm both confused and stuck, folks.  I would appreciate some help from smarter people. </p><p>Sincerely, Bob Shimizu Somewhat Competent User </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1645608;,bob366

At first, with an earlier, but recent, build of Thunderbird, the subscriptions would not be renewed if I did not quit Thunderbird before I restarted my Mac.  Recently (like a couple of days ago), I quit Thunderbird, then restarted my Mac to update the OS to latest patch level.  When I launched Tbird, I had to resuscribe to all of my iCloud IMAP folders.  After that was done, I quit Tbird and then restarted it.  I then had to resubscribe to my iCloud IMAP folders.  I have a lot of them, so this is a time-consuming tedious process. </p><p>Yesterday, I quit Thunderbird and began using Apple Male client (which I detest due to their ""smartfolders"").  A bit ago, I launched Thunderbird and it resubscribed to a few of my iCloud IMAP folders.  I opened the Subscribe tool and rechecked a bunch of the unchecked folder boxes.  It looks like it is trying to subscribe (i.e., I can see the status messages in the field at the bottom of my Tbird window that say the subscriptions are in process), but it is taking a very long time and they are not displaying in the left-hand folder pane. </p><p>So, I've seen others  reporting problems with IMAP and iCloud mail, but not this exact problem.  Is this Apple trying to force folks to stop using IMAP?  Does Tbird need to have its IMAP code updated/debugged?  I really really want to keep using Tbird. </p><p>What sort of diagnostics should I run? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1645607;,luther905
