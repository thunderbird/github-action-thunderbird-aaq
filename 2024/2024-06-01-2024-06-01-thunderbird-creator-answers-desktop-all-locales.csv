Recently TB update115 happened and <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> go moved to Yahoo.  Under the old systems, (<a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> and pre 115) I was able to have spam emails delivered directly to my Spam folder.  With the migration of cox to Yahoo, and TB 115 I don't have a Spam folder.  I have a Bulk folder and a Junk folder.  I have figured out that the Bulk  has replaced the Spam folder.  However, spam does not show up in the folder automatically.  I have to select the folder, then after about 3-5 seconds messages will appear.  Again, in the past spam would be moved to the spam folder and the folder would change to dark and a # would appear beside the folder indicating that a new message had been added to the folder. </p><p>Is there a way that I can set up TB115 to do the same thing?  I have tried but I can't figure it out.  Thanks in advance. </p><p>Dave Hokaj  dchokaj@cox.net </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dchokaj

Last night, I looked up an article that said I have to use Oauth2 instead of normal pw. I made that change on the windows 11 machine and a popup occurred that wanted the number from the google authenticator on my phone. I gave it that and it checks mail now just fine.  </p><p>This morning I went to one of the Windows 10 machines and did exactly the same. I tried some different server names online and tried some, but after a while I started getting a little window that asked my email address and pw. I put my hotmail address in and got this message:  </p><p>Microsoft Accounts or personal email addresses don’t work here. Make sure you enter your work or school account (e.g. user@contoso.com). If you want to reset a Microsoft Account password, click here. </p><p>Now this is the very same hotmail email that worked on windows 11 with the same server settings last night.  It still works.  </p><p>Now, on the windows 10 machine with those same settings, I get the blank extra window. The extra window appears, does not populate, and disappeared.  </p><p>It is:  <a href=""https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=9e5f94bc-e8a4-4e73-b8be-63364c29d753&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&amp;scope=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office365.com%2FIMAP.AccessAsUser.All+https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office365.com%2FPOP.AccessAsUser.All+https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office365.com%2FSMTP.Send+offline_access&amp;login_hint=redacted@hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=9e5f94bc-e8a4-4e73-b8be-63364c29d753&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&amp;scope=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office365.com%2FIMAP.AccessAsUser.All+https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office365.com%2FPOP.AccessAsUser.All+https%3A%2F%2Foutlook.office365.com%2FSMTP.Send+offline_access&amp;login_hint=redacted@hotmail.com</a> </p><p>I had no opportunity to do what worked on the windows 11 machine just last night.
