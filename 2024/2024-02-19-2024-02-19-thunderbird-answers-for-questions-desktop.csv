The example image you posted - that sender chose to use a table to contain the detail of the content which does not use most of the available space. It is set at a specific size.  Using Ctrl + + you can 'zoom' that message content so that the pixel size is increased and thus everything becomes larger expanding until you stop increasing the zoom. </p><p>So as an example the width of the table may be set at 600px in the html css code. When you use 'zoom' you are not increasing the number of pixels they are still 600px, but you are increasing the size of an individual pixel so basically the same number of pixels is now using more space. </p><p>Basically, the fact that under normal settings some emails do not use all the space is because sender created email to look like that and if combined with reader choosing the widest option for Message Pane then even more unused space will be displayed. Obviously, no one can predict what a sender will put in their email, some use tables to control content and you cannot predict what table settings they choose or whether they set tables within tables. This means it's likely to be different for each email.  </p><p>Currently, I've not investigated a way to control table elements of received emails which can be used in a userChrome.css file because it's not possible to rewrite the code for every email that contains a table with preset width settings. There is an addon called Header Tools Lite which I use to correct bad emails, but it's risky and not something for the average user as you may end up corrupting an email. It's not a general setting in Thunderbird. That's the problem - it's code put in by the sender and not code generated by Thunderbird. Hence why Zoom works because it can control pixel size. </p><p>If you use 'Simple HTML' then you will never have an issue. I'm not sure why you think data is lost because it isn't. You should just see less structural layout eg: it removes the tables. </p><p>However, if you are contantly needing to increase the Font Size in the Message Pane by manually using Zoom, for all emails in general because you find it difficult to read incoming mail then your Font Size settings for reading and writing email maybe too small. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> scroll to 'Language &amp; Appearance' </li><li> click on 'Advanced'. </li></ul> <p>Whatever size you are currently see you need to increase it. You need to set same setting for both 'Latin' (western encoding) and 'Other Writing Systems' (unicode encoding). </p> <ul><li> Select 'Fonts for: choose 'Latin' </li><li> Set 'Proportional Size' to eg: 18 </li><li> Set 'Monospace Size' to 18 </li><li> Set minimum size to 16 (allows a bit smaller but stops smaller font size) </li></ul> <ul><li> Now set identical settings for 'Fonts for:' and select 'Other Writing Systems' (bottom of drop down list). </li></ul> <ul><li> Finally, ReSelect 'Fonts for: choose 'Latin' </li><li> click on 'OK' to save new settings. </li></ul> <p>From now onwards the 'medium' font displayed in Message Pane and when you compose a message will be size 18px.

It is however used to set the SMTP server to be used, based on the associated Identity. </p><p>Thunderbird will use the SMTP associated with any identity,  or default to the ""default"" identity to send a mail regardless of the From part of the address.  Just click in the down arrow to the right of the from and select  ""Customize from address"" and make some stuff up if you want to see this in action in real time. Certainly the outgoing SMTP server might balk at sending the made up address,  or it might not.  Thunderbird will not offer any resistance as long as the data inserted looks legitimate. </p><p>Now as to the entries in the From list,  they are identities,  not SMTP servers.  There will also be grey lines in the list that signify the change of accounts.  The first entry after the grey line is the default identity for the account.  Subsequent entries in the list as other defined identities in that account.  For example the following is a single accounts entry in the from list for one of my profiles. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-02-21-14-15-24-d27e69.png""> </p><p>When you click reply,  Thunderbird takes the to: email address, or the reply to: email address and inserts that in the from.  It is not really related to identities, or SMTP servers.  It is just a bit of email semantics that generally you are expecting to reply from the address the mail was sent to. </p><p>In the case of some large email providers,  they will ""correct"" the details of the from and name used etc to what they have in their online settings for the account.  Which further makes explaining identities a chore. </p><p>So as mentioned before there are identities,  which essentially set up a number of preferred settings for outgoing mail which are shown in the below image. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-02-21-13-47-59-480432.png""> </p><p>Clicking the manage identities will show the list of identities associated with this account.  I also think this is where you are going to find your ""phantom"" identities and are not phantoms. </p><p>So  you should generally have one SMTP server for each identity,  and there should be one identity for every email incoming email address.  Then there is no reverting to defaults. </p><p>So to summarize (I hope). Thunderbird has one or more identities associated with every incoming account.  Identities determine the SMTP server from the list to be selected when sending mail. The SMTP server sends the actual email,  but has nothing todo with the formatting, composition or layout of the email. </p><p>Hence these addons to help folk manage their interactions relating to their identities. Identities are poorly understood,  incredibly useful to those that know how to get the best from them but they are also very confusing to those trained in the ways of Microsoft mail and difficult to explain in the context of ""a mail account"". Or really in termsof incoming and outgoing.  They are really a third abstraction. </p><p><a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/identity-chooser/?src=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/identity-chooser/?src=search</a> <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/correct-identity/?src=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/correct-identity/?src=search</a> </p><p>I like the idea of this one using the storage location to identify like identities for sending mail.

There is not another mail client that I am aware of that does it in this three item way.  But when used correctly is a very powerful feature.  Especially as Identities can mimic having another account.  This is especially helpful for those that use the features offered by most of the larger web mail providers to get mail for another account.  Th mail arrives in Thunderbird via the second account,  but using identities you can set replies to go via the original account,  with other personalised data so if that account is say a business account you have all the right titles etc in the display name and the reply to email address is correct as far as the recipient knows is concerned when you reply. </p> <blockquote>I went into the account settings of each of my five accounts, and I see there is only one identity in each, and the Email Address listed in the ""Public Data"" section of the identity has no impact on the accounts Server Settings in terms of which email address it is bringing email in from.
