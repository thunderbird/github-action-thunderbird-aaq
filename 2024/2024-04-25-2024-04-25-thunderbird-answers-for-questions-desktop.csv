Also discovered the captioned folder is my profile and the date/time stamp updates many times daily - so there is no evidence of a version upgrade being pushed.

I could go to the bit level on the hard drive and search for crumbs,  but decided to go to a backup from a month ago, replaced the InBox file, and got back my emails - save the last months' worth.  </p><p>My guess is (just) the InBox file itself was mysteriously trashed or deleted, the ""repair"" put back a new (empty) one, populated it with emails still lingering on the server, and what I was looking at in Thunderbird pre-repair was the index. I hate not knowing, and hate even more not being in control of my own system, but anything suggested going forward on my part is conjecture or speculation.
