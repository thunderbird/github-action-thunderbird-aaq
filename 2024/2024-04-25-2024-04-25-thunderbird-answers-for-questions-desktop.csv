Also discovered the captioned folder is my profile and the date/time stamp updates many times daily - so there is no evidence of a version upgrade being pushed. Also discovered each folder has its own file (in the profile) and opened the ""InBox"" file only to see the few emails post-repair. Tried some data recovery tools but it found nothing. I could go to the bit level on the hard drive and search for crumbs,  but decided to go to a backup from a month ago, replaced the InBox file, and got back my emails - save the last months' worth.  </p><p>My guess is (just) the InBox file itself was mysteriously trashed or deleted, the ""repair"" put back a new (empty) one, populated it with emails still lingering on the server, and what I was looking at in Thunderbird pre-repair was the index. I hate not knowing, and hate even more not being in control of my own system, but anything suggested going forward on my part is conjecture or speculation. If anyone can tell me how one file in an ""apps"" folder that is deep down on a perfectly functioning SSD drive can be singled out for (and must have been) deletion, I would be very humbled and appreciative of their input.  </p><p>Thanks again for responding, Matt! </p>",fpreckel,false,0,0

But chances are a similar problem will resurface at some point later. So You'd still have to create the exclusion for the Thunderbird profile.

All default folders - Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc will display at the top of Unified Folders section and each will contain the selected accounts relevant folders. So a 'Unified Inbox' top level folder should contain all emails located in the various 'Inbox' folders from all accounts.
