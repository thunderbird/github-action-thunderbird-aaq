If computer won't boot, a tech support person could remove hard drive and extract data for you. The profile on old computer would have been at the c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder. Retrieving that thunderbird folder is key. If you can do that, we'll proceed to next step. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

From what I can tell, the default theme is dark, and there is no obvious, available way to change to a light theme. </p><p>Next, I have done just as you advise, unticking  'Use system colors,' and setting text to black and background to white. It simply does not affect anything, even after relaunching the app. Screenshot is attached, just so you know I am not making this up. </p><p>Any advise from here?
