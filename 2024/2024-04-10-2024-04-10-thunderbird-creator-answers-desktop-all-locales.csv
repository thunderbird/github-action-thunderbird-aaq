It works well but Thunderbird has created on the server sent/trash/archive/drafts folders instead of using the ones that exists, and thus I can't access my history when I am in Thunderbird. </p><p>Is there anyway to parameter this? I couldn't find any, there are only options to store in local or on the folder created by Thunderbird (see picture). Thanks in advance for your answers! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",blf_linz
