It works well but Thunderbird has created on the server sent/trash/archive/drafts folders instead of using the ones that exists, and thus I can't access my history when I am in Thunderbird. </p><p>Is there anyway to parameter this? I couldn't find any, there are only options to store in local or on the folder created by Thunderbird (see picture).

Whenever I am away from that network, Thunderbird bombards me with error messages because it cannot sync a specific calendar (An error occurred when writing to the calendar Contact birthdays! Please see below for more information.) This is the first calendar on the list of calendars so I think it just happens to be that one that causes the error. What I would like to do is have Thunderbird detect that it isn't on my home wifi and not sync the calendars. Is this possible? Thanks! </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",rod.naugler
