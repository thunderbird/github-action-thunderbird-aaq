Thunderbird is the only one that I use and haven't been able to receive any new e-mails for the past week or so.  You notified me that my account had been compromised or words to that effect, and that I needed to create a new password.  I did this(with a bit of difficulty) and still have no new e-mails coming in to this account.  I did try to SEND an e-mail out, and at first it stopped me for my NEW password.  I gave it, and it then allowed the e-mail to go out just fine.  I sent one or two more since then and they too seemed to have worked fine.  For some unknown reason though, I STILL am NOT receiving any new e-mails.  Can you please help me with this problem? NOTE:  As I am STILL NOT able to receive any e-mails, would it be possible for you to send me any possible solution for this problem via my regular USPS mailing address? David Beard [removed address info from public support forum] Thanks much for any help you can supply. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1657570;,dlbeard

Until about a month ago everything was working fine but now when I make an order or amend the existing order the email from Sainsburys does not come in. I have the email 'service@sainsburys.co.uk in my address book both on Thunderbird and Talktalk. Now, I changed my email address with Sainsburys just to see what would happen and the shopping order confirmation email came in fine but if I use my normal email address nothing is getting through by email. Sainsburys have offered some advice to no avail so now I ask you - how can I get back my emails coming in when I order from Sainsburys? May I add that the Tesco site works fine.  I wonder if it is from the 'glitch' sainsburys had a few weeks ago when all orders were deleted etc? Thanks for any help at all. Regards </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1657556;1657557;,victorsj

I keep getting an error code AUP #OUT-1500 that says: ""The email address you are sending as must match the email address you used to auth. ""  But I have changed nothing.  Everything worked fine Thursday when I went to bed; got up Friday unable to send.  I can receive all day.  And I can send using my provider's website, but I'd rather use Thunderbird as usual.  What the heck just happened?  None of the Support suggestions work.  Thanks for any wisdom you can impart! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1657569;,ljmd5
