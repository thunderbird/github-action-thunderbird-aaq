Thunderbird is the only one that I use and haven't been able to receive any new e-mails for the past week or so.  You notified me that my account had been compromised or words to that effect, and that I needed to create a new password.  I did this(with a bit of difficulty) and still have no new e-mails coming in to this account.  I did try to SEND an e-mail out, and at first it stopped me for my NEW password.  I gave it, and it then allowed the e-mail to go out just fine.  I sent one or two more since then and they too seemed to have worked fine.  For some unknown reason though, I STILL am NOT receiving any new e-mails.  Can you please help me with this problem? NOTE:  As I am STILL NOT able to receive any e-mails, would it be possible for you to send me any possible solution for this problem via my regular USPS mailing address? David Beard [removed address info from public support forum] Thanks much for any help you can supply. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dlbeard
