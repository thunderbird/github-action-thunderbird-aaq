I have Thunderbird installed on the new computer with her account.  Thunderbird on the Win10 comp is 32 bit and the Win11 comp is 64 bit.  Both are the same version (115.10.02).  On the old computer, in the MAIL folder there is ""<a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a>"" which has her mail files (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc.).  Should I just copy all the files inside the ""<a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a>"" folder to the new computer? </p><p>Is there anything else I need to copy and paste from the old TB to the new TB folder?  I'm guess that I will have to at lease copy and paste the abook.sqlite file from the old to the new.  Any other folders or files. </p><p>Maybe I'm doing this wrong and there is an easier way to do this?  I've read the article about moving data on the TB Support page but it doesn't mention anything about TB data from a Win10 32 bit to a Win11 64 bit computer.
