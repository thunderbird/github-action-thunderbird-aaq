When done, however, none of them showed up in the main window. The latest email did not change, was from around a month ago. When I ask Thunderbird to Get Messages it says there are no new emails to download. </p><p>Also, I had previously opened emails in the top bar from the last time I had opened Thunderbird, but they were blank, no title and no content. (See screenshot #2) </p><p>I restarted Thunderbird several times, no change.  </p><p>I then upgraded to 115.10, hoping this might fix the issue, but it has not.  </p><p>Since restarting Thunderbird, 2 new emails have come in and are showing correctly, but none of the initial 400 emails downloaded today are showing anywhere. (See attached screenshot #1) </p><p>I repaired the Inbox folder, no help. I renamed the ""Inbox.msf"" file and had Thunderbird rebuild it, no help.  I renamed the ""global-messages-db.sqlite"" file and had Thunderbird rebuild it, no help. </p><p>All of the initial batch of 400 emails - and the emails I had previously opened - just disappeared. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what to do here? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1652600;1652604;,misc32

I also no longer get the notification that ""Thunderbird has blocked remote content..."" How can I restore this without deleting and rebuilding the account? I'm sure this was mistakenly activated but it needs to go away!!! </p><p>On a further note, I have found that if I move a  message from my in-box to ANY other folder, I get the normal message view, with all the correct toolbars and indications and controls!

When viewing the same file via an iOS device or inside Dropbox there is no black blob. Also, when viewing the same file via the full Adobe Acrobat APP on my W10 Desktop PC there is no black blob. This black key-shape blob only shows inside T'bird's inbuilt PDF previewer. </p><p>I know how to change the preview function inside Tbird to instead open any PDF in Acrobat, but as I quite like the T'bird PDF preview feature does anyone know why these black keys are appearing and how to get rid of them? </p><p><strong>Further info:</strong> The only PDFs with the black blobs are those created via my W10 Desktop PC's PowerPoint APP's ""Save as Adobe PDF"" function. There is no such black blob on the PowerPoint pages themselves, and again no blobs appear when viewing the new PDF on any iOS device or within Dropbox. Additonally, and since writing the above lines, I have emailed the PDF to a friend who has opened it on his W10 Laptop and there are NO [again, NONE] black blobs on his screen [he uses Outlook as his email handler]. Thus, I feel certain the problem is within T'bird's PDF preview code. </p><p>Is there any fix for this? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",derrickings
