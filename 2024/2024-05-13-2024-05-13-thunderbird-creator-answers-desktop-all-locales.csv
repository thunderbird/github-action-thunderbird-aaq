When ""done"", however, none of them showed up in the main window. The latest email did not change, was still from around a month ago. When I ask Thunderbird to Get Messages it says there are no new emails to download. </p><p>I restarted Thunderbird several times, no change.  </p><p>I then upgraded to 115.10, hoping this might fix the issue, but it has not.  </p><p>Since restarting Thunderbird, 2 new emails have come in and are showing correctly, but none of the initial 400 emails ""downloaded"" today are showing anywhere. </p><p>I repaired the Inbox folder (right click &gt; Properties &gt; Repair Folder), no help. I renamed the ""Inbox.msf"" file and had Thunderbird rebuild it, no help.  I renamed the ""global-messages-db.sqlite"" file and had Thunderbird rebuild it, no help. View Ignored Threads does not help. View &gt; Threads &gt; All is selected. Emails are not in the Trash folder, or any other folder. </p><p>All of the initial batch of 400 emails - and the emails I had previously opened - just disappeared. </p><p>Opening up the Inbox MBOX file directly, I can see that these 400 emails were never actually downloaded into this file. Not sure what happened. </p><p>Opening up my remote email host, I can see that those 400 emails are still there, to the exact point when I last closed Thunderbird. </p><p>Asking Thunderbird to download new messages does not download these remote emails. </p><p>How do I reset Thunderbird to start the process over and re-download these emails again? Part of TB seems to think it's already downloaded these emails, while another part of TB never actually did. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what to do here? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1652600;1652604;,misc32

When viewing the same file via an iOS device or inside Dropbox there is no black blob. Also, when viewing the same file via the full Adobe Acrobat APP on my W10 Desktop PC there is no black blob.

There is no such black blob on the PowerPoint pages themselves, and again no blobs appear when viewing the new PDF on any iOS device or within Dropbox. Additonally, and since writing the above lines, I have emailed the PDF to a friend who has opened it on his W10 Laptop and there are NO [again, NONE] black blobs on his screen [he uses Outlook as his email handler].

Been using Thunderbird for a long time without issues, but last week it stopped sending and receiving emails through the Skymesh internet provider. Still sends &amp; receives Hotmail/Gmail/Yahoo, but will not connect to any Skymesh accounts. Have reinstalled/updated, but no change. SMTP timeout and if I change settings I get the 10060 error. Could not even connect to their Webmail page either.  If I turn VPN on, then I can access their Webmail page. Rang Skymesh, they poked around and said it was all this end and with Thunderbird.   Seems an IP number change via VPN with Opera resolved the Webmail page access, but I cannot do that thru Thunderbird.    Running Win 7.
