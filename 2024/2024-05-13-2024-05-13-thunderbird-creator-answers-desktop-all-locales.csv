When done, however, none of them showed up in the main window. The latest email did not change, was from around a month ago. When I ask Thunderbird to Get Messages it says there are no new emails to download. </p><p>Also, I had previously opened emails in the top bar from the last time I had opened Thunderbird, but they were blank, no title and no content. (See screenshot #2) </p><p>I restarted Thunderbird several times, no change.  </p><p>I then upgraded to 115.10, hoping this might fix the issue, but it has not.  </p><p>Since restarting Thunderbird, 2 new emails have come in and are showing correctly, but none of the initial 400 emails downloaded today are showing anywhere. (See attached screenshot #1) </p><p>I repaired the Inbox folder, no help. I renamed the ""Inbox.msf"" file and had Thunderbird rebuild it, no help.  I renamed the ""global-messages-db.sqlite"" file and had Thunderbird rebuild it, no help. </p><p>All of the initial batch of 400 emails - and the emails I had previously opened - just disappeared. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what to do here? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1652600;1652604;,misc32

When I try to permanently delete a bunch of emails it deletes them and then I get a synchronizing inbox bar and the 1,000 or so emails come right back into my inbox.

When I open an email now (in my 'in-box'), it automatically fills in ""To"" and ""From"" fields. I no longer get my 'in-message' toolbar in the upper right-hand corner of the message window (tab). I also no longer get the notification that ""Thunderbird has blocked remote content..."" How can I restore this without deleting and rebuilding the account? I'm sure this was mistakenly activated but it needs to go away!!! </p><p>On a further note, I have found that if I move a  message from my in-box to ANY other folder, I get the normal message view, with all the correct toolbars and indications and controls! Attached are the correct and incorrect screenshot of the same message, just in different folders. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help that anyone can provide. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rpneal44
