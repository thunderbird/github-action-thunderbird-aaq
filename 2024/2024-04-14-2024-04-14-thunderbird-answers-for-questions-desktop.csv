But do review her account settings for details, such as use of complete email address and not just the prefix prior to the @ sign, and that her SMTP settings reflect her email address. Beyond that, I don't know their policies. If available, that might be a question to them - a list of policies they enforce.

First, I suggest creating a backup so that you won't lose anything.  To  do that:  </p><pre>  - exit TB   - copy c:\users\&lt;her id&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to anywhere else for safekeeping    - now, start TB.  If you see obvious duplicate folders that are not directly related to an account (such as INBOX), try just deleting the folders. I presume the Outlook Express folders are in Local Folders, so that approach may apply there as well. For duplicate input files, highlight each and rightclick and look at properties. I think the 'real' one will show in location with something such as '....Mail/accountname/inbox  and the clone will appear as something else. Delete that one.  </pre> <p>If you don't like that approach and want to assemble a new profile yourself, you could do this: - first, do the above recommended backup anyway. Things can always go wrong. - click help&gt;troubleshooting information, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - exit TB.  you are now in the profile. the addressbook is abook.sqlite and any saved addresses from incoming messages will be in history.sqlite. copy both elsewhere  - for messages, POP message folders are in Mail\accountname\  where you will see such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf etc.  duplicates will have a different name and I'm guessing you'll spot the duplicates. Copy the ones you need.  This approach also applies to IMAP accounts, which are in Imapmail folder. This is the simple process. Copy nothing. When IMAP accounts are opened and there are no message folders, they are recreated automatically.   - for non account folders, look in Mail\Local Folders folder.  Here again, you will see message folders and can probably recognize what is good and what is not. Copy what is good.   - at this point, you have the parts to reassemble a profile. OR... you can delete the duplicate parts and restart TB and see if all is okay.  -FOR POP ACCOUNT: if you reassemble the profile and set up the POP account again, do NOT include password yet. You need to copy all the saved message folders and any other files that were in the account folder PRIOR to entering password. Otherwise, Thunderbird will start downloading messages that have already been downloaded.    - there, done. I hope this helps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I read those instructions and really they do not look like they have been reviewed in the last 10 years. </p><p>Outlook: 2013 is listed there was another release in 2016. Lightning: Interpreted in version 78 in 2020. </p><p>Google require oauth as the authentication method,  but I see nothing in those instructions that would see it move from normal password, and that would be in line with them being quite dated.  The oAuth requirements are quite recent really. <a href=""https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en</a> and <a href=""https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/09/winding-down-google-sync-and-less-secure-apps-support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/09/winding-down-google-sync-and-less-secure-apps-support.html</a> </p><p>So now we come to the error.  A a 403 Access Forbidden error could occur either with oauth or not,  but given Google stated intention regarding passwords I am thinking you are not currently trying with an oauth authentication method and need to do so. </p><p>Off topic I guess,  but is it only students that get @nyu.edu addresses?  Are staff faculty somehow identified as such?  I am asking because this could be made oh so much easier if the email addresses ending with @nyu.edu were identified by Thunderbird as Google addresses.  I could file a bug to have that happen,  but really I don't have enough information to support such a global request.  So I am looking for more. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

On the web you access via <a href=""http://email.nyu.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">email.nyu.edu</a> which brings up an NYU branded authentication page. The same page TB used to bring up.

Sometimes they appear to execute before the entire message is actually downloaded.  This becomes most apparent with filters on message bodies are involved. </p><p>The length of time between  mail checks comes into this.  Is it set to something like the default 10 or 15 minutes?  Increasing checking frequency can see mail never actually completing as the next check over runs the last still incomplete. </p><p>Check the physical filter log file.  Mine is some 85mb when I checked it today and it loads like molasses on a cold morning.  Even after the view text box finally appeared (that took about a minute)  it was still not fully loaded viewing today's filtered items took another couple of minutes.
