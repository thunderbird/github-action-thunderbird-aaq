I suggest you check the relevant files in your profile and monitor of they are say read only,  or something is preventing new copies being written.  Often multiple files with numbers are also found in this sort of circumstance as Thunderbird's response to a write error is a new file with a number,  which it never ever refers to.   </p><p>Generally this type of error related to file contention caused by antivirus scanning,  cloud sync or streaming backups,  although remote storage of the profile sometime sees this as well because of network latency. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I've done a complete search of my desktop computer for messagefilter*.dat, but it found nothing.  Not only that, but I have a laptop computer set up in much the same way as the desktop.  A search on that also turned up nothing, but with the laptop changes in the message filters *are* saved!  Could the message filter file have a different name than messagefilter*.dat? </p>",coffent1,false,0,0

The profile data files are frequently changed in an update often in the data storage format and there is no way to unchanged them, or revert them.v  So making it easier to do something that is not supported is actually going to be a disservice.   </p><p>On Windows Thunderbird will simply refuse to use the profile that has been updated without a command line override,  but I understand some things are not a strictly enforced with Linux. </p><p>However, you are welcome to place your feedback/Ideas in the feedback hub.

Please post a screen show of you settings for this account and the incoming account settings page that shown which outgoing server that identity will use.  Lots of older accounts have a single SMTP server with the provider (cox spectrum) and multiple email addresses used it.  This no longer works with spectrum.  If you send email from BillyTheKid@Charter.net then the username on the SMTP used to send must match up with the account name for that email address.  </p><p>Instructions for creating a screen shot here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem#w_create-a-screenshot-on-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-create-screenshot-my-problem#w_create-a-screenshot-on-windows</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have posted a comment on <a href=""http://connect.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">connect.mozilla.org</a> as you suggested. I have also looked at the link you gave and I can get to the sort groups part and unthread folders, but then the next part to unthread multiple folders doesn't work because I can't find the ""options button that shows     </p><pre>   context menu.&nbsp;:"" </pre> <p>This is an example of unnecessary complications, there should just be an option in an easily found part of Thunderbird e.g. ""Settings"" to do a global unthread. I can't understand that if people want to make something a default they can't make an easy option to undefault it! They are just annoying and wasting everyone's time. </p>",chrisardy,false,0,0
