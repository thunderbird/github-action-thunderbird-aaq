I suggest you check the relevant files in your profile and monitor of they are say read only,  or something is preventing new copies being written.  Often multiple files with numbers are also found in this sort of circumstance as Thunderbird's response to a write error is a new file with a number,  which it never ever refers to.   </p><p>Generally this type of error related to file contention caused by antivirus scanning,  cloud sync or streaming backups,  although remote storage of the profile sometime sees this as well because of network latency. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I've done a complete search of my desktop computer for messagefilter*.dat, but it found nothing.  Not only that, but I have a laptop computer set up in much the same way as the desktop.

The profile data files are frequently changed in an update often in the data storage format and there is no way to unchanged them, or revert them.v  So making it easier to do something that is not supported is actually going to be a disservice.   </p><p>On Windows Thunderbird will simply refuse to use the profile that has been updated without a command line override,  but I understand some things are not a strictly enforced with Linux. </p><p>However, you are welcome to place your feedback/Ideas in the feedback hub.

Please post a screen show of you settings for this account and the incoming account settings page that shown which outgoing server that identity will use.  Lots of older accounts have a single SMTP server with the provider (cox spectrum) and multiple email addresses used it.  This no longer works with spectrum.

First, I suggest creating a backup so that you won't lose anything.  To  do that:  </p><pre>  - exit TB   - copy c:\users\&lt;her id&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to anywhere else for safekeeping    - now, start TB.  If you see obvious duplicate folders that are not directly related to an account (such as INBOX), try just deleting the folders. I presume the Outlook Express folders are in Local Folders, so that approach may apply there as well. For duplicate input files, highlight each and rightclick and look at properties. I think the 'real' one will show in location with something such as '....Mail/accountname/inbox  and the clone will appear as something else. Delete that one.  </pre> <p>If you don't like that approach and want to assemble a new profile yourself, you could do this: - first, do the above recommended backup anyway. Things can always go wrong. - click help&gt;troubleshooting information, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - exit TB.  you are now in the profile. the addressbook is abook.sqlite and any saved addresses from incoming messages will be in history.sqlite. copy both elsewhere  - for messages, POP message folders are in Mail\accountname\  where you will see such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf etc.  duplicates will have a different name and I'm guessing you'll spot the duplicates. Copy the ones you need.  This approach also applies to IMAP accounts, which are in Imapmail folder. This is the simple process. Copy nothing. When IMAP accounts are opened and there are no message folders, they are recreated automatically.   - for non account folders, look in Mail\Local Folders folder.  Here again, you will see message folders and can probably recognize what is good and what is not. Copy what is good.   - at this point, you have the parts to reassemble a profile. OR... you can delete the duplicate parts and restart TB and see if all is okay.  -FOR POP ACCOUNT: if you reassemble the profile and set up the POP account again, do NOT include password yet. You need to copy all the saved message folders and any other files that were in the account folder PRIOR to entering password. Otherwise, Thunderbird will start downloading messages that have already been downloaded.    - there, done. I hope this helps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
