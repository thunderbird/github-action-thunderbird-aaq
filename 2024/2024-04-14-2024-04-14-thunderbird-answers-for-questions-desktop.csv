I suggest you check the relevant files in your profile and monitor of they are say read only,  or something is preventing new copies being written.

For example, there are some antivirus products that force a small advertisement attached to messages. My only other thought was whether her email server setup might be using your id and not hers. IONOS posted in january that all accounts must have SMTP email id match the email id of the email message. Otherwise, I don't know what policies they are considering. But do review her account settings for details, such as use of complete email address and not just the prefix prior to the @ sign, and that her SMTP settings reflect her email address. Beyond that, I don't know their policies. If available, that might be a question to them - a list of policies they enforce. And they do owe you that, since her emails are being rejected for policy reasons.  I wish you well in this. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

First, I suggest creating a backup so that you won't lose anything.  To  do that:  </p><pre>  - exit TB   - copy c:\users\&lt;her id&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to anywhere else for safekeeping    - now, start TB.  If you see obvious duplicate folders that are not directly related to an account (such as INBOX), try just deleting the folders. I presume the Outlook Express folders are in Local Folders, so that approach may apply there as well. For duplicate input files, highlight each and rightclick and look at properties. I think the 'real' one will show in location with something such as '....Mail/accountname/inbox  and the clone will appear as something else. Delete that one.  </pre> <p>If you don't like that approach and want to assemble a new profile yourself, you could do this: - first, do the above recommended backup anyway. Things can always go wrong. - click help&gt;troubleshooting information, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - exit TB.  you are now in the profile. the addressbook is abook.sqlite and any saved addresses from incoming messages will be in history.sqlite. copy both elsewhere  - for messages, POP message folders are in Mail\accountname\  where you will see such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf etc.  duplicates will have a different name and I'm guessing you'll spot the duplicates. Copy the ones you need.  This approach also applies to IMAP accounts, which are in Imapmail folder. This is the simple process. Copy nothing. When IMAP accounts are opened and there are no message folders, they are recreated automatically.   - for non account folders, look in Mail\Local Folders folder.  Here again, you will see message folders and can probably recognize what is good and what is not. Copy what is good.   - at this point, you have the parts to reassemble a profile. OR... you can delete the duplicate parts and restart TB and see if all is okay.  -FOR POP ACCOUNT: if you reassemble the profile and set up the POP account again, do NOT include password yet. You need to copy all the saved message folders and any other files that were in the account folder PRIOR to entering password. Otherwise, Thunderbird will start downloading messages that have already been downloaded.    - there, done. I hope this helps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
