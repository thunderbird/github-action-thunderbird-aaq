But do review her account settings for details, such as use of complete email address and not just the prefix prior to the @ sign, and that her SMTP settings reflect her email address. Beyond that, I don't know their policies. If available, that might be a question to them - a list of policies they enforce.

We created a second account (my e-mail) on my wife's machine and it would not send to that account (go the error message described earlier).  Configured Outlook on that machine and was able to send from my wife's account.  So there seems to be something wrong with Thunderbird on my wife's machine.  They looked back at the error message and it basically says that my client is not in compliance with RFC 5321/5322.  But we know that is not true because everything works on my machine (PC running Windows 8 - my wife is on Windows 10).  So my assumption is that Thunderbird was somehow corrupted or something else is corrupted that causes that RFC violation.

First, I suggest creating a backup so that you won't lose anything.  To  do that:  </p><pre>  - exit TB   - copy c:\users\&lt;her id&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to anywhere else for safekeeping    - now, start TB.  If you see obvious duplicate folders that are not directly related to an account (such as INBOX), try just deleting the folders. I presume the Outlook Express folders are in Local Folders, so that approach may apply there as well. For duplicate input files, highlight each and rightclick and look at properties. I think the 'real' one will show in location with something such as '....Mail/accountname/inbox  and the clone will appear as something else. Delete that one.  </pre> <p>If you don't like that approach and want to assemble a new profile yourself, you could do this: - first, do the above recommended backup anyway. Things can always go wrong. - click help&gt;troubleshooting information, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - exit TB.  you are now in the profile. the addressbook is abook.sqlite and any saved addresses from incoming messages will be in history.sqlite. copy both elsewhere  - for messages, POP message folders are in Mail\accountname\  where you will see such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf etc.  duplicates will have a different name and I'm guessing you'll spot the duplicates. Copy the ones you need.  This approach also applies to IMAP accounts, which are in Imapmail folder. This is the simple process. Copy nothing. When IMAP accounts are opened and there are no message folders, they are recreated automatically.   - for non account folders, look in Mail\Local Folders folder.  Here again, you will see message folders and can probably recognize what is good and what is not. Copy what is good.   - at this point, you have the parts to reassemble a profile. OR... you can delete the duplicate parts and restart TB and see if all is okay.  -FOR POP ACCOUNT: if you reassemble the profile and set up the POP account again, do NOT include password yet. You need to copy all the saved message folders and any other files that were in the account folder PRIOR to entering password. Otherwise, Thunderbird will start downloading messages that have already been downloaded.    - there, done. I hope this helps. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

First, import to Local Folders. Then, if not many, you could highlight a few at a time and click the 'copy to' context entry. If many, then I suggest creating a filter to copy to the imap folder and delete the local folder after completion. This can be problematic as imap was not designed for high volume uploads. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thunderbird then opened with just three entries under Local Folders: Inbox, Trash, and Outbox.  I then successfully imported the address book.  However, when I attempted to import messages from the saved profile, not only did I get all the inbox messages but also a whole string of other folders with their own set of inboxes, etc.  I did not expect that since I chose just the ""Mail Messages"" option and unchecked the ""Accounts and Settings"", ""Address Books"" and ""Calendar"" boxes.  Since most of those newly created items in the folder pane were empty I was able to delete them.  The imported inbox items are in a separate Inbox, not in the newly created Inbox but we can live with that. </p><p>The remaining problem is the missing email folders she had saved, which were in the Outlook Express Import folder.  That folder appears in the folder pane but is empty.  Where would Thunderbird store all those files and folders?  If they are in the profile does that mean I need to start over and import the saved profile? </p><p>Thanks, Bob </p>",silveraz,false,0,0

Are staff faculty somehow identified as such?  I am asking because this could be made oh so much easier if the email addresses ending with @nyu.edu were identified by Thunderbird as Google addresses.
