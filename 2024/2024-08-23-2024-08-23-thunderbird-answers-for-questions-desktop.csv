I had an antivirus program interfere so much with my Thunderbird profile folder that nothing moved to the junk folder until I removed the antivirus product. </p><p>But there can be other issues, like having the profile folder in the documents folder (not a good idea) or even having the prpfile on some sort of cloud backed up location in your local drive. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

With other browsers, it might be a similar setting.  With a browser like Edge, I think the best method is to define TB as the default app for mailto links in Windows Settings, Apps, Default apps, Choose defaults by link types. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
