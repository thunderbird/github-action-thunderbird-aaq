I had an antivirus program interfere so much with my Thunderbird profile folder that nothing moved to the junk folder until I removed the antivirus product. </p><p>But there can be other issues, like having the profile folder in the documents folder (not a good idea) or even having the prpfile on some sort of cloud backed up location in your local drive. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

With other browsers, it might be a similar setting.  With a browser like Edge, I think the best method is to define TB as the default app for mailto links in Windows Settings, Apps, Default apps, Choose defaults by link types. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

It takes me a bit of time to find out how to do even this because in Windows 11 the message I am typing fills the screen and I have to go back down to the task bar to find the Thunderbird file list, there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain all the tabs visible on the screen when composing a message, but I guess I just haven't found it. By the way when I get your reply from Mozilla and click on ""This solves my problem"" in the Mozilla email page, my browser says ""Page not found"", however if I click on ""This doesn't solve my problem"", I get to the answer where I can mark it as ""This solves my problem"". Just mentioning it.  Its all far too clever for me. Thanks </p>",old_nic,false,0,0
