She has no bother with TB 115 on her machine, my TB 115 was acting oddly for a couple of weeks in that it showed new email when there wasn't any, then TB128 was auto-installed four days ago when it deleted all sent messages since May this year and now refuses to save sent messages at all. It does send and receive OK. I have a second rarely used account with BT via TB and this appears to be working normally. Maybe there is corruption on my Fastmail/TB interface? </p>",foxyjm,false,0,0

You could try altering the icon by adding a different Tbird icon for one on taskbar. Unpin from Taskbar. Changed the Tbird icon in desktop shortcut. Then pinned to Task bar. Finally alter the Target. </p><p>Maybe that would leave you with two shortcuts but different icons? </p><p>Alternative is to just have one shortcut on desktop which starts the 'Profile Manager' and then you can choose which profile to open, Target&nbsp;: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" -P </p><p>However, you are wanting to '-no-remote' so enabling more than one instance of Thunderbird. </p><p>Or access another profile from within Thunderbird. Help &gt; Troubleshooting information Under 'Application Basics' - near the bottom - Profiles - click on 'about:profiles' This opens in a new tab which you can choose to keep open if desired. It will list all profiles - to open another profile in a new window click on the appropriate 'Launch Profile' button.  </p><p>Another alternative looking at this from another angle. Install another identical version of Thunderbird - but install into a different location. Maybe install a 64bit into&nbsp;: C:\<strong>Program Files</strong>\Mozilla Thunderbird\  I suggest that because you said the other version was in C:\Program Files <strong>(x86)</strong>\Mozilla Thunderbird\ Maybe you could install in another drive eg: D:// Create a folder called 'Program Files' Then download and when you want to install select the Custom option,and choose: D://Program Files So you end up with D://Program Files/Mozilla Thunderbird Then set it up to run on a specific profile Via 'about:profile' and select a 'Set as Default' for desired profile. </p><p>As you now have two separate versions of Thunderbird, you can have two separate desktop shortcuts and therefore two separate TBirds on Taskbar. AS each Thunderbird uses it's own profile as default. That would mean you do not need to alter the Target.  </p><p>Example: Currently I have two completely different versions running. The version 115.14.0 is running from: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\ That is a 64bit which I deliberately installed in Program Files (x86)  </p><p>The beta version 130.0b1 is running from ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird Beta\ That is 64 bit installed into the usual place for 64bit programs. </p><p>My profiles are all in the default location&nbsp;:  C://Users.Username/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles I have three profiles. A profile called xxxxxxxx.default is the default when 115.14.0 is running. Another profile called 'xxxxxxxx.default-beta' is the default when the beta 130.0b1 is running. </p><p>I can run both at same time. I do not need to state 'no remote' as each is an independent Thunderbird program. I do not need to select which profile as each auto runs on the profile I set it to use. Both shortcuts and those on Taskbar are also independent. Do not need to alter Target as they are independent. So even if I get an update nothing is effected. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It is never going to be slick or simple because it is one of the most basic and oldest data interchange formats out there. Plain text organized in rows,  sometimes with and some times without column heading to identify what the comma, or semi colon or data separator columns should represent.  Some implementations quote text other do not.  Sometime the CSV will be comma separated and also contain commas in the text and not quote text so you have to manually massage the data into place. </p><p>We can add the complexity that Excel,  the source of so much of peoples CSV files was incapable of reading and writing unicode text until recently and you have a mess.  Excel imported and exported unicode and turned in into something unrecognizable in the process.   </p><p>Largely the issues are based on the ignorance of folks about what they are doing and what they need to do to get their data into an acceptable import situation.  But that is not a reason to remove a working import option.   </p><p>The ""drop down"" is constrained that it can only use a field name once.  That you found being limited to only using a field once a problem is unfortunate,   but the persons email address for example can only go in the address book once.  Fundamentally the best approach to CSV has always been to ensure your field identifiers in the CSV file as closely match the fields Thunderbird is expecting to import as possible.  I wrote a blog post on the topic,  some 10 years ago. <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2013/03/importing-csv-files.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2013/03/importing-csv-files.html</a>  It was written to support a much less forgiving user interface for CSV import.  But the data setup is still important because the computer can only guess what should be what based on the field names given and there is no ""intelligence"" there, artificial or otherwise. </p><p>Should you wish to share your feedback or ideas with the developers rather than your peers in this support forum who really have no say in development, you might like to use the feedback and ideas link in Thunderbird's help menu.
