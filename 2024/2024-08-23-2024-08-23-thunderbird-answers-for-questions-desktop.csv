Maybe install a 64bit into&nbsp;: C:\<strong>Program Files</strong>\Mozilla Thunderbird\  I suggest that because you said the other version was in C:\Program Files <strong>(x86)</strong>\Mozilla Thunderbird\ Maybe you could install in another drive eg: D:// Create a folder called 'Program Files' Then download and when you want to install select the Custom option,and choose: D://Program Files So you end up with D://Program Files/Mozilla Thunderbird Then set it up to run on a specific profile Via 'about:profile' and select a 'Set as Default' for desired profile. </p><p>As you now have two separate versions of Thunderbird, you can have two separate desktop shortcuts and therefore two separate TBirds on Taskbar. AS each Thunderbird uses it's own profile as default. That would mean you do not need to alter the Target.  </p><p>Example: Currently I have two completely different versions running. The version 115.14.0 is running from: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\ That is a 64bit which I deliberately installed in Program Files (x86)  </p><p>The beta version 130.0b1 is running from ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird Beta\ That is 64 bit installed into the usual place for 64bit programs. </p><p>My profiles are all in the default location&nbsp;:  C://Users.Username/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles I have three profiles. A profile called xxxxxxxx.default is the default when 115.14.0 is running. Another profile called 'xxxxxxxx.default-beta' is the default when the beta 130.0b1 is running. </p><p>I can run both at same time. I do not need to state 'no remote' as each is an independent Thunderbird program. I do not need to select which profile as each auto runs on the profile I set it to use. Both shortcuts and those on Taskbar are also independent. Do not need to alter Target as they are independent. So even if I get an update nothing is effected. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I think I managed to fix it. </p><p>I made a guess that the actual email message files were probably OK, and it was just the config files that held info about the email accounts that was messed up.
