It takes me a bit of time to find out how to do even this because in Windows 11 the message I am typing fills the screen and I have to go back down to the task bar to find the Thunderbird file list, there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain all the tabs visible on the screen when composing a message, but I guess I just haven't found it. By the way when I get your reply from Mozilla and click on ""This solves my problem"" in the Mozilla email page, my browser says ""Page not found"", however if I click on ""This doesn't solve my problem"", I get to the answer where I can mark it as ""This solves my problem"".

Usually, they get bored after a while. It's important no one responds to those emails because it's likely they will go to a different email address confirming your email address is live. Sometimes those emails contain content which is designed to include remote content and the sender has tracker content in email.

They are just abusing the email address. This is the most common. </p><p>However, it is sensible to access webmail account and modify the password.

Are you able to logon to your webmail account using a browser&nbsp;? </p><p>Thunderbird may prompt for a 'Primary Password' if you have manually set one up. This is usually requested once per session when you initially start up Thunderbird and also if you attempt to view stored passwords. 'Primary Password' have one purpose to deny access to seeing stored mail account passwords in Thunderbird.  It is not a mail account password nor does it prevent seeing and sending emails. </p><p>Mail account Passwords - most people allow Thunderbird to store passwords used by Thunderbird to access the server in order to download emails.   Mail Account Passwords can be the same identical password you would use to access your webmail account via a browser for a particular email address.  Some servers use a normal password to access webmail accounts but insist people create and use app specific passwords for third party access - eg: Thunderbird. Some servers insist on using Oauth2 tokens which have to be set up using your normal password, but from then onwards the stored password is actuall an oauth token. </p><p>To change or modify a password - this can only be done via the webmail account. Then it can be updated in Thunderbird. </p><p>Servers may temporarilly block a user if several attempts to access the server fail due to incorrect password.  This is because the server may suspect the attempts are being done by a hacker.  </p><p>Thunderbird does not know if password is correct or not - it only knows the password it is instructed to use. It is the server which decides whether the password is good. It is also possible the password is good but not when combined with the other server settings.  </p><p>If you cannot access webmail using password, then Thunderbird will not be able to access server using the same password. You could see what password is currently stored by Thunderbird and try to use it access the webmail account. </p><p>Thunderbird stores passwords here: </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Under Passwords section </li><li> click on 'Saved Passwords' </li><li> Click on 'Show Passwords' </li></ul> <p>If using version 128*&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> If you have set up a 'Primary Password' - you will be asked for that password. </li><li> If you have not set up a Primary Password then you will see a 'Windows Security' window prompting for password. This means it wants the same password you use when you start up computer and enter password to get access to the User Account.  This can be disabed but you will need to enter that password in order to disable it. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It is not a server and it does not offer email addresses. </p><p><strong>1.</strong>Normally, people already have an email address. That email address could be provided by their Internet Service Provider. Maybe you have created a free email address with a server such as gmail or yahoo.
