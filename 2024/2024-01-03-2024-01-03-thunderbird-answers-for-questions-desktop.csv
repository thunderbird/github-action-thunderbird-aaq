So, I tried another solution I found online: Recreate the accounts, and then in the server settings of the email account, change the folder to redirect to the old mailbox in the mail folder.

Do they each have unique descriptions in the description field for each? Have you checked each account setting pane to verify that each is linked to a unique SMTP server? I say this because the problem only began when you added the third account. Getting SMTP servers mixed up is a common situation. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

(first part will take some time, though) </p><p>After that, to always copy new messages to your folder under ""Local Folders"", you could set up a message filter for your gmail account that just copies all new messages to your local folder. (Tools -&gt; Message filters). Once you're confident that the filter works, you can start regularly deleting messages from your gmail inbox (or even change your filter to directly move them to the local folder). </p><p>But keep in mind that then the only copies of your messages will exist on your local disk.
