(i don’t want an encrypted backup, but something readable.) I thought I could use Thunderbird and set up a POP3 account on Thunderbird with the option to leave emails on the server. It downloaded only the Inbox, not the subfolders. I read on the Forum that that is what happens with POP3. My understanding of IMAP is that I don’t get the actual email on Thunderbird, because it stays on the Comcast server.  </p><p>Is there a way to download all those emails and folders to Thundebird (to keep) and then delete them from Comcast? I don’t plan to use the Thunderbird client for my day-to-day email, simply to store the last 10 years of email. </p><p>I have tried to research the forum articles so that I don’t bother anyone needlessly, but can’t find an answer.
