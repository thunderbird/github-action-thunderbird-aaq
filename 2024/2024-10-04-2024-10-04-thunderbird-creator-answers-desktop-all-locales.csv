And i did this: </p><p>Inbox: So far in Gmail i moved alot of emails from the Inbox to another folder. How can i disable that folder to sync in Thunderbird? Because as soon as i log in, every folder starts to sync and download automatically. </p><p>Outbox: I did some research and its seems that is not possible to move emails from outbox to another folder. Is there any way that i can only download emails only after specific date? </p>",thunderbird;settings;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1679648;1679652;1679692;1679872;1680137;1680281;,estebangalassi45

Have evolved a fairly elaborate configuration of local (POP) email folders, rules, calendar, and accounts to manage &amp; organize email activity, retention, archiving, etc.  I've not had to deal with Profiles in previous upgrades and don't have much experience with it. </p><p>The recent Oct 1 push of Firefox &amp; Thunderbird 131.0 releases took me by surprise.  I was able to re-implement the previous Firefox profile to recover bookmarks, cookies, passwords, etc.  However, when T-Bird warned that 131.0 was Beta &amp; unsupported I took the suggestion to download &amp; install the current supported release:  128.3.0 (I was on 128.2.3).  Then hell came. </p><p>Once downloaded, installed &amp; launched, Thunderbird 128.3 cautioned the new profile created with T-Bird 131.0 was incompatible with previous versions and that I should create a new one, which I did.  Still could not get new T-Bird to recognize previous profile, so I tried uninstalling, downloading &amp; reinstalling 128.3 multiple times, each time prompted to create a new profile before proceeding.  I tried to follow the previous profile restoration process detailed on support forums &amp; articles, but none seemed specifically relevant to my situation. </p><p>I located my profiles in the appdata roaming profile folder, including what I think are most recent based on size of mail folders.  Can't determine whether I had just one or several in use due to the extent of my setup.  Could really use some help &amp; advice to: 1)  Determine which profile was in most recent use prior to T-Bird upgrade. 2)  Whether more than one profile was in use. 3)  Re-implement the profile I was using on T-Bird 128.2.3 with my new 128.3.0 </p><p>Regards &amp; many thanks in advance, John C Houston </p><p>PS  You'll ask why I would upgrade to 131.0 from 128.2.3.  Answer:  it was on auto-update and 131.0 is what was pushed.  No more auto-updates for this guy! </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1679429;1679482;1679515;1679517;1679644;1679655;1679877;1679941;1679944;1679951;1680302;,curtiss3
