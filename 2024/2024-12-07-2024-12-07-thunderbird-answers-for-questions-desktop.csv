However, they have also altered what password to use and what email address can use the SMTP. Read on: </p><p><strong>1.</strong> Your microsoft account and your hotmail/outlook/msn/live account all need to have the same password. So all your microsoft accounts need to be using same password. You may have other accounts which use the outlook server.  Info at this link says:  </p> <ul><li>     <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-sign-in-to-hotmail-c378938b-c0eb-40c1-b99e-338dd9e776a8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-sign-in-to-hotmail-c378938b-c0eb-40c1-b99e-338dd9e776a8</a>  </li></ul> <p><em>Can't sign in to Hotmail or <a href=""http://Outlook.com?"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com?</a></em> <em>Notes: Your Hotmail or <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> password is the same as your Microsoft Account password.</em> </p><p>You must logon to the microsoft webmail account via  browser to sort it out.  Once all your accounts are using same password..... </p><p><strong>2.</strong> In microsoft account accessed via a browser If you have more email addresses or hotmail addresses etc , microsoft now regard one is 'primary' and all others are alias to the account. This is not a problem when it comes to receiving mail, but can be an issues when you want to send. When it comes to 'sending' - that is smtp in  Thunderbird - it can only send using the 'primary' email address.  You can choose what you want to be set as 'primary', but whatever email address you set up as 'primary' - only that email address can be used for SMTP. So if you want to send using @dbmail email address then make sure it is set up as the primary email address. But then if you have an <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account as well, it will only be able to send using the dbmail primary email address. So choose the email address which you want to set up as 'primary'. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>3. </strong>In Thunderbird, Cookies must be enabled in order to set up Oauth. </p> <ul><li>     Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li>     Check under Web Content - </li><li>     Select: 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Accept third party cookies' 'Always' </li><li>     Click on 'Exceptions' button next to Accept cookies from sites to make sure you are not blocking cookies from Microsoft sites, such as&nbsp;:<a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">office365.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.live.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.msn.com</a>  </li></ul> <p><strong>4.</strong> In Thunderbird....When creating account or if account is created but you need to check server settings: This is just an example where the username is for hotmail but it can be for any email address account in the microsoft account. Account Settings must use the following: Server Type:  <strong>POP</strong> Mail Server </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port 995 </li><li>     User Name: xxxx@hotmail.com </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/LTS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2  </li></ul> <p>Server Type:  <strong>IMAP</strong> Mail Server </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port 993 </li><li>     User Name: xxxx@hotmail.com </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/LTS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2  </li></ul> <p><strong>SMTP:</strong> </p> <ul><li>     Server Name: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> </li><li>     Port: 587 </li><li>     Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li>     Authentication method: OAuth2 </li><li>     User Name: example@hotmail.com (Please note this must be whatever email address is set up as the 'primary' email address)  </li></ul> <p><br> </p><p>Once you have all these settings and got the password sorted. </p><p>Restart Thunderbird When you get the Microsoft pop up window asking for password, type it in and click on 'Sign in'. You may then get another window asking to allow Thunderbird access to server - click on 'Accept' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It is possible that there is more than one profile in the old profile folder. If you locate the right file, it will have the addresses.

Because her filter was first, it moved the message to her folder and at that point the second filter had nothing to do as the action had already been taken on the inbound message.

Below is a log for someone who wants to know more. </p><p>I wanted to have the messages in a subfolder under ""Local Folders."" So, I created this subfolder in Thunberbird by right-clicking on ""Local Folders."" I looked at the path, /home/norio/.thunderbird/&lt;random&gt;.default-release/Mail/Local\ Folders/ but &lt;subfolder_name.sbd&gt; has not been created. (This might be because I didn't restart Thunderbird.)  So, while Thunderbird still running, I created  &lt;subfolder_name.sbd&gt; by mkdir command in Linux and copied the message file Inbox under this new directory. I restarted Thunderbird, and messages appeared under ""Local Folders/&lt;subfolder_name&gt;"". New file  /home/norio/.thunderbird/&lt;random&gt;.default-release/Mail/Local\ Folders/&lt;subfolder_name.sbd&gt;/Inbox.msf was created automatically. </p>",norio,false,0,0

Yes TB has a local folder (username/appdata/Local/TB/Profile).  I orig went online asking how to move my Local folders to another drive.  Procedures were: A. Copy those profiles found in above reference. B. Did so, created directory in D:, copies those profiles into new area. C.  Changed pointer in Account Settings. D. Shutdown TB and restarted. E.  Local folders were all scrambled! I've taken snapshot of Local contents below: </p><p>Action two: A. I have extensive backups (I user Acronis - both total file backups, C:segment backups - and Cloud backups for both as well as local external drive)  A.  Recovered the above TB directory and all below it.  B. Started TB and again corrupted Local folders. Action Three: A. Recovered complete username/appdata... which included ALL TB structures found below that directory.  B.  Started TB again, and all Local folders corrupted again. Suspicion:  I'm beginning to think there is somewhere ""outside"" the appdata structure that stores ""Local"" information as well and got confused when it experienced conflicts between the two.  That's just a guess.  Currently, I have TB that can't access ANY of my 97GBs worth of emails that go back years with information I need.  I hope this clears up some confusion on your part.  BTW, there is a Profile directory under username/appdata/Local...  as well as Profile directory under username/appdata/Roaming.  However, the online research I originally made never mentioned ... Roaming structure and ....Local made sense anyway with it's name. The picture below SHOULD have names like 1-Home_Depot, 1-Lowes, 2-Receipts, 2-Tax _Info_2024, etc for a BUNCH of folders. NOTE:  Not sure if TB has same named folders in other OS, like MAC etc. </p>",floyd6789,false,0,0

But I did run Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode and it was just as slow sending emails with attachments. I also checked the Task Manager, and I see that TB is the second highest memory hog (behind Google) with 262 MB of memory used. Not sure if that's normal or not.  </p><p>I tried bypassing TB and using my server (SiteGround) email system. I found one of my recent emails with an 18 MB attachment and forwarded it to my wife as a test. It sent in less than 10 seconds. When I sent that same email the other day through TB, it took almost 2 minutes to send and copy to my Sent folder. So it definitely looks like this is a Thunderbird issue and not an OS or Internet speed issue. </p>",jim265,false,1,0

Also, 262 MB is very little memory. </p><p>Suggest you run a network speedtest on your PC in the browser and check the upload speed.
