Understanding and implementing your suggestion is a little over my head technically but at a more simplistic level I wonder why Microsoft would change something that I've successfully used for years and not tell me about it with specific instruction as to how to proceed.  Also find it curious that the the error message indicates a problem with the <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> server when the email server I'm set up to access is a earthlink server (<a href=""http://sprynet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sprynet.com</a>) which has nothing to do with Microsoft or <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>.  (The only reason I have a Outlook account, which I almost never use, is because apparently you can't own a Windows computer without one).  Also interesting that after getting the error message saying login failed my earthlink messages are still downloaded (after a slight delay).  And when I send an email I get no error message.  Causes me to wonder if the problem is a bug or some recently corrupted code in the Thunderbird software. </p>",tedhine,false,0,0

It's almost as if  ""deleting"" a message causes these new mailboxes to appear.  And each mailbox seems to duplicate the next.  They are not all messages but instead a select number. If I manually move a message to the trash rather than using the ""delete"" button in the message pane, this does not happen.  Compacting the folders does not cause this to happen. I do have two pop email accounts, and the new folder creation seems to happen only with the earthlink account.  It does not happen with the non-earthlink account, but the disappearing list happens as well. </p>",albear1,false,0,0
