It worked the same way as Send to Mail, but started a new <em>Thunderbird</em> message. (Print  &gt; PDF &gt; Send to Thunderbird.)  I seem to recall doing something in Automator when I set it up years ago, but for the life of me, I can't remember what. That Macbook drowned in January and was unsalvageable, and that workflow which I used constantly, was lost. </p><p>I just spend two hours scouring the internet, both Thunderbird- and MacOS-related sites, with no luck. Yes, I know I can save to PDF and then add it to a new outgoing message, but I had it setup so I could do all of this in one step from the system print dialog, and I do this frequently enough that I really want that functionality back. It's not as simple as dragging Thunderbird.app into the PDF Services folder; I've tried that. </p><p>Does anybody have this working on their Mac? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dascalargo
