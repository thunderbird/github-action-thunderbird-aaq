Message received says 'Authentication failed'. This happens repeatedly (for at least 20-30 times) and appears to relate to my password. It suggests 'Retry' or 'Enter new password'. The 'Retry' repeats as before so I check the Saved Passwords and enter the one saved. I get the same message. I am using Version 115 and have been for some time. </p><p>Could this be related to a change of Profile? There must be a way to reset the password? I have checked all the settings and no errors appear, all settings confirmed. </p><p>I have thought about a Recovery Mode and seem to remember seeing a message that I do have that. I just don't know how to access it. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1647481;,gee.jay1

Is there a way to do this?  The answers in older discussions, pertaining to older versions of Thunderbird/Firefox, may no longer apply and it is frustrating to try and find pertinent discussions when you have to open and close each discussion looking for answers. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1647473;,nonpsvdl

It is no longer possible to move emails from the Inbox to the empty folders. NOTE: Inbox, Sent and Trash still works. </p><p>Question-1: What happened&nbsp;? What can I do&nbsp;? Can I recover all my emails in the archive folders&nbsp;? </p><p>Question-2: Can I restore my Thunderbird mail system as it was, e.g. 2 weeks ago&nbsp;? </p><p>Question-3: As an emergency plan (if all my emails are lost&nbsp;!):  Can I reset Thunderbird without deleting mails in Inbox, Sent and Trash&nbsp;?
