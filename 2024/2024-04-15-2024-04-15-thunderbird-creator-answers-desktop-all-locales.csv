For example right now my last email showing says 6:41 PM when it is actually 9:44 PM.  This is costing me sales on items I have listed on the marketplace because I have no current notification via emails.

Message received says 'Authentication failed'. This happens repeatedly (for at least 20-30 times) and appears to relate to my password. It suggests 'Retry' or 'Enter new password'. The 'Retry' repeats as before so I check the Saved Passwords and enter the one saved. I get the same message. I am using Version 115 and have been for some time. </p><p>Could this be related to a change of Profile? There must be a way to reset the password? I have checked all the settings and no errors appear, all settings confirmed. </p><p>I have thought about a Recovery Mode and seem to remember seeing a message that I do have that. I just don't know how to access it. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",gee.jay1
