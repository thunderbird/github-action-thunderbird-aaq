Message received says 'Authentication failed'. This happens repeatedly (for at least 20-30 times) and appears to relate to my password. It suggests 'Retry' or 'Enter new password'. The 'Retry' repeats as before so I check the Saved Passwords and enter the one saved. I get the same message. I am using Version 115 and have been for some time. </p><p>Could this be related to a change of Profile? There must be a way to reset the password? I have checked all the settings and no errors appear, all settings confirmed. </p><p>I have thought about a Recovery Mode and seem to remember seeing a message that I do have that.

Is there a way to do this?
