Configuring for Comcast IMAP+SMTP, in the usual manner; nothing esoteric about that, all very routine. </p><p>Machine A seems to be working okay, no errors. TB up to date on this machine, connected over an ethernet wire, if that makes any difference.  </p><p>Machine B, getting spam prompted over IMAP 1014 errors. No other information is provided than 1014. </p><p>I have tried dropping the account configuration hundred percent, restarting TB, re-adding the account configuration, to no avail. Still spam 1014 errors. </p><p>I did happen to notice TB needed an update, so I did that as well. Still 1014 errors. </p><p>I have also tried dropping that email saved password from the saved passwords, and responding to the subsequent re-enter password prompt. Also to no avail. </p><p>What if anything might have changed, and how can we contend with this? What is so corrupt, do we need to be mucking around in any AppData files, roaming files, etc? </p><p>We are not the only ones, apparently, to have bumped into this issue. Not sure if this is also Comcast specific, since a recent TB and/or IMAP specification change, i.e. maybe we try with a gmail account, for instance. </p><p>Wondering also, is it IMAP and/or Comcast somehow tieing Machine A to the IMAP and not releasing that association? Knowing a little bit about IMAP in this regard. And/or somehow now prohibiting Machine B+ from establishing a connection? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",mwpowelllde

When it's launched, it posts the customary ""Downloading Message 1 of [N]"" status report, but then hangs right there, takes 3 or 4 minutes even to (re-)populate the tabs and panes that had been open, doesn't get past the alleged first new msg even in 15 or 20 minutes.  When it does populate the Inbox pane, it shows no messages newer than last night just before shutdown.  Very sluggish response to cursor, too: for ex. 30 seconds from clicking on a msg title in the Inbox pane to displaying that msg, even longer to bring up Help/About (with ""Not Responding"" shown in its title bar.) </p><pre>  I get my mail through gmail's IMAP server but prefer to use Tbird's interface . Thinking there might be something evil about the first msg that was waiting to be downloaded, I used gmail's web interface to review everything new since last night, deleted several msgs that had attachments, then started Tbird again.  No change.  Can't even get Tbird into the ""Work offline"" state because it attempts download-of-new-msgs immediately after being started.   The only consistently effective way I have found to STOP the hung Tbird is through (Classic) Task Manager's ""Processes"" list, which usually shows five or six ""thunderbird.exe"" instances.  After selecting whichever has the largest memory allocation I click on ""End Process.""   This all ""feels like"" a bollixed internal state.  Does Tbird store internal-state information in its own file, or is it buried in the Registry?   If I attempt restoration from a backup, which files are needed; or is that unwise?  I see there is a mid-April update available to 115.10; would installing it reset current messed-up internal state, or will that already messy situation prevent the update?   Is there any risk of losing my Inbox, Sent, etc contents? </pre> <p>Thanks!!! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",IrvT
