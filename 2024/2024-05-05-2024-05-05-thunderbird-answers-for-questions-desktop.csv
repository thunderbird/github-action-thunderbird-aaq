Let's call the Email1, Email2, and Emal3. As the settings exist now, I am able to send test emails between emails 1&amp;2 and send emails to email 3 from both 1&amp;2. However, I am not able to send any emails to accts 1 or 2 from email 3.  Email1 &amp; 2 are on the same smtp server but I had to remove the smtp1 and 2 designations in order for them to work. Email 3 server keeps switching to email 1 server and the server won't authenticate the user name or password. It's odd as both email 1 &amp; 3 are on xfinity and email 2 is a sub acct of email 1, being hosted by another ISP. I attempted to use OAuth for the email accts, but the server wouldn't accept it, so I went back to the normal passwords and it was happy and worked to the extent I have described above. Bottom line is that email 1&amp;2 work just fine, but email 3 can receive but not send without reconfiguring the outgoing server manually. One note- my smtp edit button pulls down the menu but it has one server designated as the ""default"" server. I don't see anything to remove that designation. The Mailwasher prgm is easy to configure and seems to be working fine with Tbird to the extent I've described. Something is screwed up with the outgoing server settings on email 3.

I'm beginning to believe that the issue is with comcast as my wife's account is also having issues getting incoming mail.

These steps usually work - create at least one address in the thunderbird addressbook - highlight the book, click the three dots to the right and export the CSV. - use this as a template for whatever you export from your work PC.  - open in spreadsheet software to see exact layout of first row. That is the ticket  - use that first row as a guideline in rearranging your work CSV so it is a perfect match - then the import should go smoothly. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I  personally would leave ATT if I could, but I need the emails in the file folders I've created on Thunderbird. About 10 years ago microsoft dumped my email account and I lost all my contacts and folders with important information. Sometime after that ATT helped me set up a key, but it turned out to be good for one use. I haven't been able to receive email on my ipad purchased a year ago and can't restart it on my older one. Hopefully one key will open mail on both my ipads and not mess up the yahoo account on my desktop or my iphone which are currently working.
