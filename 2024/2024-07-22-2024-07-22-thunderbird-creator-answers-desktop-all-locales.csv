My concern is that Microsoft is saying that they don't want people using passwords and I'm not sure that I can continue doing what I'm doing today and still use Outlook 365. </p><p>I have an <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> email address and I have a second email account from a totally different provider.  I forward all of my <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email to this second, alternative email account however I do not use the alternative email accounts SMTP server to send my mail.  I instead have my SMTP settings in Outlook 365 to use Outlooks SMTP server.  I do this just in case someone decides to look at the email's header information so it the outbound information in the header does not expose the email address of my second alternative email account.  Doing this pretty much ensures that I get very little spam as <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> scans it before it gets forwarded and my alternative account scans all forwarded email a second time before it appears in my inbox.  So to be perfectly clear my inbound pop server settings are configured for my alternative email address and my SMTP settings are configured to use <a href=""http://Outlook.Com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.Com</a>'s SMTP server. </p><p>Getting down to the heart of the problem Microsoft says that soon I will no longer be able to use my password with their SMTP server and they indicated that Thunderbird could be configured to use OAuth2 instead and they even provided an screen shot of the setup.  Unfortunately, Outlook 365 does not provide the ability to configure the SMTP server to use OAuth2 so this is why I would like to know from a Thunderbird expert if it can be configured with different inbound and outbound server settings and that I can use OAuth2 instead of passwords. </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1663374;,wchull51
