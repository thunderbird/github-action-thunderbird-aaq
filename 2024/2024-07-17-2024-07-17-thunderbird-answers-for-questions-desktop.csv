I concur to your strategy with my comments:  - first, check account settings&gt;synchronization&amp;storage to verify that all folders can be downloaded - now, click file&gt;offline&gt;download to ensure that all IMAP messages are fully downloaded to the PC  - I would then exit thunderbird and copy the message folders to external drive via windows file explorer and then move them to the Local Folders area in profile. I can give details on that, if needed.  - now, after creating the new IMAP server account, you can upload the saved messages. Since IMAP was not designed to do that dance, it can be problematic, so I suggest creating a manual filter to copy messages from local folders to the IMAP account, and then to spot check to ensure that the transfer was successful. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
