Those people can check out if they are blacklisted by using eg: spamhaus - <a href=""https://check.spamhaus.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://check.spamhaus.org/</a> </p><p>It's also possible you are downloading those emails but cannot see them - eg: if you have set them up  to be ignored: Check this to see you have any emails set up as 'ignored' View &gt; Threads &gt; You should have 'all' selected, but for this test also select 'Ignored threads' </p><p>Ignored threads would appear and display a red circle in the 'threads' column header.

It looks like the theme you are using somehow has white background and white text in the 'Menu Bar' and 'Composition Toolbar' area. </p><p>You seem to be using either 'userChrome.css' file OR you may have downloaded a theme. What theme are you using? Whatever theme you are using swap it for thunderbird 'Light' default theme and then report on whether you can see that missing toolbar. Thunderbird is not responsible for any theme you download and use.  So if this is a theme you have downloaded then you need to contact the author of that theme and tell them about your problem. </p><p>Maybe the theme is not suitable for the version of Thunderbird which you are using.
