That 'primary password' is basically a protection on your computer to stop other prying eyes from being able to access your stored passwords. It does not prevent opening of Thunderbird or anyone seeing any emails.  </p><p>That 'Primary Password' is very useful if you share a computer and also allow other people access to your User account.

You can also only create and update /modify the email address/account password via that webmail account. At the moment I think you are using what you call the  8/2 password. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> In Thunderbird, you created a mail account for the juno email address. That account has to use the same password as you use to access the webmail account.   I can see from the other part of conversation that altering certain settings has got emails downloading again. This is the account which you need to have stored passwords for incoming and outgoing. It will also use the  8/2 password because that is one set up in webmail. </p><p><br> <strong>3.</strong> Primary Password The purpose of the Primary Account password to stop prying eyes getting to see your stored passwords. As you do not share your computer with any else - you do not need a Primary Password. </p><p>Now lets be very clear. I would never advise anyone to use a mail account password as a Primary Password. In your case, I would advise that you get rid of that Primary Password because it's confusing you. You do not store your mail account passwords in the Primary Password, so it's not going to effect anything to do with your mail accounts. </p><p>Go to 'Settings' &gt; 'Privacy &amp; Security' Under 'Passwords' section </p><p>You will see two checkbox options. Both of them offer a level of security designed to stop people from seeing stored passwords. The top checkbox is selected&nbsp;: 'Require device sign in to fill and manage passwords' This means you get prompted to enter your computer User Account password That's the password you enter when you start up the computer and it asks you to logon to the computer so you see the desktop. It has nothing to do with any password in Thunderbird or anything to do with the juno account. </p><p>The next checkbox is also selected&nbsp;: 'Use a Primary Password'.  If you do not set a Primary Password then the top checkbox option works instead. </p><p>You can switch off both if you only use your computer at home and you are not concerned about what people can see OR just use the top one which asks for computer password. </p><p>First follow instructions to remove the Primary Password.

It looks like the theme you are using somehow has white background and white text in the 'Menu Bar' and 'Composition Toolbar' area. </p><p>You seem to be using either 'userChrome.css' file OR you may have downloaded a theme. What theme are you using? Whatever theme you are using swap it for thunderbird 'Light' default theme and then report on whether you can see that missing toolbar. Thunderbird is not responsible for any theme you download and use.  So if this is a theme you have downloaded then you need to contact the author of that theme and tell them about your problem. </p><p>Maybe the theme is not suitable for the version of Thunderbird which you are using.
