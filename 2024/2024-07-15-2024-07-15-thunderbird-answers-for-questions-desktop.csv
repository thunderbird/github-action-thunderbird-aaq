Enabling them let me get to the next step, where it wanted to use the Passkey that I just set up. That's connected to the fingerprint sensor on my laptop.  However, I couldn't get it to prompt me to use the sensor, so I had to select ""use another method"" (for which I chose confirmation via my phone).   </p><p>This now works.

Both of the had the same description. It's only documentation, but the most common reason for the message your husband received is when a user has one email address on the incoming server settiings and a different on on the SMTP settings. This commonly happens when a person has two or more accounts and gets them crossed. By putting the email account in description field, the likelihood is minimized because the error will be obvious when viewing link to SMTP settings from the account pane. As it is, that wasn't his problem.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
