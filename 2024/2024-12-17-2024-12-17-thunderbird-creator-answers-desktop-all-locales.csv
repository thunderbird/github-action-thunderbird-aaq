One happens if TB has been open and I ask it to download new messages using the little cloud symbol or “Get Messages”: “The account xxx@sbcglobal.net is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages.”  Or if I open TB and it just starts with the login process, the error messages is a popup: “Connection to server <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a> timed out.”  TB manages two other accounts, both of which are functioning normally.  One of them is also an <a href=""http://sbcglobal.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sbcglobal.net</a> account, and both sbcglobal accounts are set up identically: Port 995, SSL/TLS, Secure Mail Key (rather than OAuth2).  Version is 115.18.0 32bit, Windows 22H2.  Logging in to the server shows many emails that have arrived since the problem started.
