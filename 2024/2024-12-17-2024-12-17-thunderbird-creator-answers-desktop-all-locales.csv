Lord, how I've tried. to STOP Thunderbird, GMail (web), and Outlook (web) from putting ANY emails in Junk or Spam folders.  Apparently, GMail and Outlook have ""services"" on their websites that mark things as JUNK before they ever get to me.  I have turned OFF everything I can find in Thunderbird to stop stuff from going in JUNK/SPAM folders, but emails still get there. </p><p>Since I am apparently unable to STOP emails from going to JUNK/SPAM folders, it would be really helpful if Thunderbird showed little numbers as to how many emails are in there.  It currently does NOT.  Do I have something set incorrectly or is that a ""feature"" in Thunderbird?   </p><p>Would appreciate any help. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1695210;,dalewebb1

It had been receiving emails routinely up to that time.  There are two error messages associated with this.  One happens if TB has been open and I ask it to download new messages using the little cloud symbol or “Get Messages”: “The account xxx@sbcglobal.net is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages.”  Or if I open TB and it just starts with the login process, the error messages is a popup: “Connection to server <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a> timed out.”  TB manages two other accounts, both of which are functioning normally.  One of them is also an <a href=""http://sbcglobal.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sbcglobal.net</a> account, and both sbcglobal accounts are set up identically: Port 995, SSL/TLS, Secure Mail Key (rather than OAuth2).  Version is 115.18.0 32bit, Windows 22H2.  Logging in to the server shows many emails that have arrived since the problem started.  I have gotten nowhere with ATT/SBC, they don't seem to want to provide any support anymore if they hear the word Thunderbird.
