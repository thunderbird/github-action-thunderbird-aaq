The upgrade failed, corrupting the boot partition, which I tried thru mid-June to recover.  </p><p>I had to set it aside to focus on my new job; I'd just recently found new --to me --articles helping me to recover the boot.   Part of this recovery was performing a non-destructive reinstall of the 22.04.3 (installing via the ""something else"" option, and selecting the partitions for the install, thus avoiding creating a new partition table &amp; reformatting the partitions).   As the reinstall worked very well, it recognized my prior (May '23) Thunderbird and updated/ upgraded it from whatever I had been on to the new supernova version.  I can't find the prior release number I was on when the system failed, but there are a few files re extensions, etc. from the day before the failure --in the .thunderbird directory, profile.   <strong>Q1: Any hints on finding this prior version number?</strong> </p><p>This supernova upgrade is significant, but it seems my prior version's account info, settings, to link me to my gmail account, etc., didn't get recognized?   it feels like it was an incomplete upgrade. <strong>Q2: any quick config/ recoveries to get the new version to recognize the prior version's settings, etc.?</strong> </p><p>I <em>always</em> kept Tbird up to date;  <strong>Q3: what was the Ubuntu-compatible version in late May 2023?  </strong> This would be the version I was on... I believe.   </p><p>I had a customized, detailed email file structure, using the add-on ""LocalFolders"" to access several separate email folders.  I'd used this for many years, and hope I can transition forward to the supernova using the same --or being able to migrate my disparate files to the supernova structure, if required. <strong>Q4:  can the collective experience of those reading offer up steps to recover my prior Tbird data, limitations, pot-holes to avoid?</strong> </p><p><strong>thank you all so much!</strong> </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",baillargeonbm

This generates the following error: </p><p>""The operation failed because another operation is using the folder. Please wait for that operation to finish and then try again."" </p><p>I didn't change the way TB operates or presents the mail view that was being mentioned or recommended when Supernova first came out so I am still using the old view.  </p><p>Now, since the error doesn't tell me what folder is impacted or what operation(s) are underway for those folders, what can anyone do to figure out what is happening? My suspicion is that there may be a conflict with some message filters but that is really just a guess. Is there a log I can look at that will record more details about the error? Can the error message be changed to provide specifics about what happened? Why does it ask me to wait and try again when there is no way to intervene in the process? If I go back online and then offline right away I get the same error so I guess waiting doesn't help.
