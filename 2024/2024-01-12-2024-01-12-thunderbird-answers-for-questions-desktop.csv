It will call TB uninstaller and when it has finished it will scan for leftover files and registry entries. You have a choice of reg or deep scan. I always do the deep scan if I an having problems; but when I tried this with TB it brought up a whole wack of Wordperfect entries - which I don't want to delete. Usually you can just say ""delete all"" and it's fine - don't know why it went weird this time. Try a reg scan first. The other thing is that it is a ""new and improved"" version (like TB!!!) and I am running an older version. I think it's Ver 2.1.7. They have changed the GUI and it's not so easy to get used to.
