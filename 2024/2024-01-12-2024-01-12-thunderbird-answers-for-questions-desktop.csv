There I see 'Account Name'. This section describes my current HEP settings.  I go to Account Actions in bottom left hand corner, drop down menu says 'Add Mail Account'.  I assume this is where I would be adding another entry for my new HEP.  This would create a new 'Account Name' with its set of the basic file folders.  Then I would have to copy over the file folders from the first 'account'.  I believe this action is what would fulfil David's suggestion.   I am going to assume my interpretation is correct.  If it is, then this is what I do not want to do unless there is no other way.  My entire effort is to see if there is a way the first 'Account Name' entries can be modified to accommodate my new HEP, thereby avoiding the creation of a new 'account' entry with its necessary copying, then deletion of the original and renaming of the new 'account'. For the sake of argument, I realise there is really only 1 account and it is with the HEP.

The issue here is did the email you sent via google actually arrive?  That would indicate at least if there is something odd in the SMTP server,  or if it is actually just a wrong rsponse. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It will call TB uninstaller and when it has finished it will scan for leftover files and registry entries. You have a choice of reg or deep scan. I always do the deep scan if I an having problems; but when I tried this with TB it brought up a whole wack of Wordperfect entries - which I don't want to delete. Usually you can just say ""delete all"" and it's fine - don't know why it went weird this time. Try a reg scan first. The other thing is that it is a ""new and improved"" version (like TB!!!) and I am running an older version. I think it's Ver 2.1.7. They have changed the GUI and it's not so easy to get used to.
