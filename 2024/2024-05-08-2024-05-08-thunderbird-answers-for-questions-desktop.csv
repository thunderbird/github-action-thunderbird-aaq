Since it's non-standard, one can predict chaos... and not really easily filterable content      which more general filters could address....       [] cf.,         [] Some vendors use 1 email address, for all communications:                            adverts, accounts, alerts, sign-in, flilght changes, sales...          In this case, a universal generality (1 folder for HEALTH), are not very helpful, since it is essentially,          like  a MSoft DOS filesystem model,  is, over time, a large unstructured mix of types of content.                     I'd classify those vendors as VERY-Unstructured-Email-Sender </pre> <pre>        Still, some coarse structuring like HEALTH is still useful, given many other  coarse grain categories;            Just be aware that you can get alot of less desirable stuff, yet still from the same vendor. </pre> <pre>      HOWEVER,          [] Not all vendors use one 'sending address' for all email.

Particularly problematic are vendors like airlines, health care, credit reporting agencies, bigBox, Selling-sites...

It occurs as far as I see only on IMAP, not only in one directory/eMail-account, but from time to time in diefferent accounts.

Multiple NSTMP-files occupy 32GB to 350GB space on HDD up to the maximum space on HDD - the only way to get rid of it is to close TB an deleting these files ...
