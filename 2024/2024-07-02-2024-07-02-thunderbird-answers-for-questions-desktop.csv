Some software that does installs an uninstalls sometimes does not remove entry for prior version from their database. And if you tell that software product to uninstall the old one, you might find that it installs both because, in fact, only one was there. Look in c:\program files and I think you will find just one copy of Thunderbird. Trying an uninstall to fix the display will be far more trouble than you want. It's not thunderbird's fault . </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
