Yes, I moved files from C to D and deleted them from C. But what I do remember is that C drive must have the program files retained there. Do not move them. I had moved Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Videos, etc. to the D drive. And yes, that frees up space on the C drive. But C drive is permanent. Those program files must be left there. I will warn about some problems I did have. A few files went to D, but stayed on C - but not taking up space? I just left them alone and ignore them on C. i.e. I never access C. When I open any file/on Docs, etc. It is in D so I know the transfer took place. Hope this helps. </p>",oblibm8391,false,0,0
