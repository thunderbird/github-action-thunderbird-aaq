In such case, the profile on C can be deleted. The entry of which I speak is probably fewer than 50 bytes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Yes, I moved files from C to D and deleted them from C. But what I do remember is that C drive must have the program files retained there. Do not move them. I had moved Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Videos, etc. to the D drive. And yes, that frees up space on the C drive. But C drive is permanent. Those program files must be left there. I will warn about some problems I did have. A few files went to D, but stayed on C - but not taking up space? I just left them alone and ignore them on C. i.e. I never access C. When I open any file/on Docs, etc. It is in D so I know the transfer took place. Hope this helps. </p>",oblibm8391,false,0,0

Some software that does installs an uninstalls sometimes does not remove entry for prior version from their database. And if you tell that software product to uninstall the old one, you might find that it installs both because, in fact, only one was there. Look in c:\program files and I think you will find just one copy of Thunderbird. Trying an uninstall to fix the display will be far more trouble than you want. It's not thunderbird's fault . </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

According to my sys 115.11.1 and 115.12.2 are both located at c:\program. Attached is the MapiProxy_InUse.dll version 115.11.0 above it sits Mapiproxy.dll with version number 115.12.0, it appears that Thunderbird has decided to use the older version .dll . </p>",newmachine5600,false,0,0
