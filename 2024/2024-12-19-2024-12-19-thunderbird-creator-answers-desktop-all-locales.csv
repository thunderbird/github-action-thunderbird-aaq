Before this occurred, I was able to mark email messages with Tags that I had previous set up but it now appears that even when selecting an appropriate Tag for a particular message, whilst it initially 'coulors' it in accordance with the pre-defined colour, when my cursor is removed from the email message, the Tag is lost [and colouring]! Even when attempting to sort messages by Tags, none appear at all.... I have in my TB a number of different email accounts namely, Apple ones [x3], Hotmail [Outlook now] and Gmail and yet none of them seem to support [or retain] Tags anymore as they once did. Previous TB versions enabled me to use this feature - is there a good reason why it no longer works? Lastly, whilst I don't really know what a 'sandbox' is, I installed TB from the Microsoft Store in the hope that it would remain automatically updated - was this a mistake? Lastly this may assist TB experts of which I am most definitely not one, sadly.... </p><p>128.5.2esr (64-bit) Release notes Thunderbird Windows MSIX packagethunderbird-MSIX - 1.0 </p>",microsoft;thunderbird;tags;,thunderbird,tags,en-US,"",DNBMcC

I exported my Outlook calendar and imported it to Thunderbird.  The calendar works, no problem. </p><p>The problem is that when I open Thunderbird and select the calendar for the first time Thunderbird hangs.  If I check the message indicates that Thunderbird is busy.  After a period of time everything works.  The only time this occurs is when I start Thunderbird and select the calendar for the first time.  Can you tell me why? </p><p>If it makes any difference when I imported the calendar I did not realize how Thunderbird worked and I imported it creating a new calendar with the name of the imported file.  I had a Home calendar with nothing in it and my imported calendar.  I decided to export the calendar that was created during the import.  I then imported that file to the Home calendar and deleted the original imported calendar. </p>",thunderbird;crashing-and-slow-performance;,thunderbird,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",ConeWH
