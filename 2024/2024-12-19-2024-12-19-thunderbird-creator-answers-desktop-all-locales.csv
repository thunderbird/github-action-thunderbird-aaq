This would be very convenient and avoids the need to keep opening up TB to check.  I recently tried eM Client, which had this feature, but, returned to TB to avoid other dislikes I found in eM.

Before this occurred, I was able to mark email messages with Tags that I had previous set up but it now appears that even when selecting an appropriate Tag for a particular message, whilst it initially 'coulors' it in accordance with the pre-defined colour, when my cursor is removed from the email message, the Tag is lost [and colouring]! Even when attempting to sort messages by Tags, none appear at all.... I have in my TB a number of different email accounts namely, Apple ones [x3], Hotmail [Outlook now] and Gmail and yet none of them seem to support [or retain] Tags anymore as they once did. Previous TB versions enabled me to use this feature - is there a good reason why it no longer works? Lastly, whilst I don't really know what a 'sandbox' is, I installed TB from the Microsoft Store in the hope that it would remain automatically updated - was this a mistake? Lastly this may assist TB experts of which I am most definitely not one, sadly.... </p><p>128.5.2esr (64-bit) Release notes Thunderbird Windows MSIX packagethunderbird-MSIX - 1.0 </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",DNBMcC
