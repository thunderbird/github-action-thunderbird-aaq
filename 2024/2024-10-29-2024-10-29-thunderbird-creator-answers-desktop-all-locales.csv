I was in the middle of an email when Thunderbird was shutdown against my will and updated??? or whatever hell this is.  I was also forced to use my google to sign in as you obviously do not care about a decent internet as you claim.  I am so stressed now I don't know what to do and cannot find how to get help.  So sick of being bullied by companies.  So sick of  it.  I just wanted to look at my emails and answer a few and now it's a nightmare.  You are just like the rest. Hypocrites.  Why is there no help.  And I don't mean the constant hoops ppl have to jump though just to have to find some shit article that never answers the questions, or some forum where no one ever answers the question either.  Real help.  But always no human just little lords at a distance.  Such smug elitist cruelty.  I thought Mozilla was supposed to be different.  Nope.  </p><pre>I now longer recognise what is in front of me.  I can't tell what is the beginning and the end? Everything is different and awful.  Why are my emails in alphabetical (from what I can tell) order? Why have the columns shifted?   There are no borders that I recognise?  Where is the search bar at the top so I can search emails from the same origin? Why are there no headings. </pre> <p>Why do you do this?   I am now in a horrible mess.  I need to see how things are arranged.  I do not recognise what I was just looking at!  Do you understand the enormity of this? I had several emails open that I need to keep track of.  How do you justify this? How dare you do this and then tell us to be ""nice"" when you have forcefully inflicted updates and no help.  Then open page where you ask for money for this injustice? I won't do that again.  I cannot even find today's emails.  Just why&nbsp;:/  This is wanker consultant behaviour - fixing/changing something that aint broke.
