I was redirected to a website in order to donate. I didn't trust it  and shut the pc down. Today (29/10) I tried again but got a messing while starting Thunderbird up: ""Checking mail server capabilities"". When trying to send an email I was redirected to a pop-up: ""Add Security Exeption"". I'm not receiving any mails and can't send either. I didn't change any settings/passwords but had several Microsoft updates lately. Any idea how I can use my preferred email program again?

The window is not visible unless I close or minimize enough other windows to display it, and then there is the little spinning multicolored circle that means it's hung.  This lasts a long time, I'm not sure how long because I usually force quit it, but many minutes.  After the force quit it works normally... until the next time the system wakes.
