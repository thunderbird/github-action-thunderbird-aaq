I've attempted to change settings and I'm thinking that possibly I've screwed it all up.  I've changed the passwords through Comcast a few times but it seems to also be screwed up.  I've been with Thunderbird for a long time and donated 3 times this past year.  Now I have constant problems signing in with the same old password so I've contacted Comcast to change the passwords.  Is there anywhere on Thunderbird where I can check to see what passwords are still listed for me?  I have 4 email addresses.
