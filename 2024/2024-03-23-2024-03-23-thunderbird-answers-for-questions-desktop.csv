I CANNOT define a folder for one specific year and another for the next year, e.g. one folder for 2022 and one for 2023 etc. at a storage to be chosen e.g. my NAS box. Moreover I see that mails are stored (or archived) just for one year(!) even taking into account that in ""Eigenschaften"" (properties) and ""Aufbewahrungsregeln"" (storige regulation?) the setting ""keine Nachrichten löschen"" (no messages to be deleted) is activated (see attached screenshot).

That would cause appropriate folders to be created and updated. If you want to save all messages without archiving, you might run a filter to copy all incoming mail to a local folder and the zip the folder at end of year. I do not believe you are losing mail.
