Thunderbird junk processing.  All mail placed in the junk/Spam folder is flagged with the red identifying icon.

Google, Microsoft,Yahoo etc. basically all mail providers have server side spam filtering and place mail in a spam or junk folder, or in the case of yahoo a bulk mail folder.  If you have an IMAP account then this is the most common cause of stray entries in the junk/spam folder.  To use spamassasim I understand you need to use POP,  so that would not be your issue here so we need to move on to number three. </p><p>3. Antivirus program with junk/spam/SCAM detection.  These features are generally only controlled via the user interface of the antivirus program but the functionality is injected into the running Thunderbird in the same way malware infects a system.

It was MailWasher I was thinking of not spamassassin.  Mailwasher required POP to function because it needs to user to access the mail on the server and do their manual spam sorting before any mail is downloaded.  All very 2001. </p><p>You posted this image. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-07-23-23-39-22-73bb46.png""> </p><p>That clearly shows that the emails in the list are not junk according to the Thunderbird junk filter. This is what that icon would look like if Thunderbird considered the email to be juink/spam.  <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-07-25-23-56-09-d008ef.png""> </p><p><br> My guess is spamassasin is not marking the mail as spam as Thunderbird would trust their decision and also mark as spam if you have that option enabled.  But mail prior to it being enabled will not have the flag set perhaps as the filtering does not work on existing only new mail.  It is probably the <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> mail servers they also have spam filtering doing this activity.  Because you are using IMAP,  checking the mail server really does not achieve much as everything about your mail is syncronised via IMAP to match regardless of the device.  So if you had a defective spam filter on your phone,  that would also be reflected on your desktop and online in the web application/site.  It is also a really good way for Microsoft to get access to your entire contacts list as you then need to upload it so it can be whitelisted on their spam filter. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You would need to create an <strong>IMAP </strong>mail account in Thunderbird for that existing email address. </p><p>Imap accounts mean you can access all folders which already exist on the server as seen via webmail. It also  means you choose to download full copies of emails or just headers and this choice can be set up for all folders or specific folders. It also means if you choose to download full copies then you can create a backup. It also means you can choose to keep copies of specific emails in the default 'Local Folders' mail account - really handy if you need to delete email off server, but want to keep a copy. </p><p>Thunderbird has two different ways of viewing emails and I would recommend you use the 'Table View' when it comes to viewing lists as they take up less space. See image below as a guide to enable the 'Table View' </p><p>2. Message Filters There are various ways to 'filter' messages in Thunderbird. </p><p>example 1 select a folder - in this example lets use the 'Inbox' Use the 'Quick Filter' toolbar to only display unread emails in that selected folder.  Enable the 'Quick Filter' toolbar if not displaying. Click on the 'Unread' button to display only unread emails. </p><p><strong>If all the unread emails are those you wish to delete:</strong> Use 'Ctrl+'A'  to highlight all emails they will display in lower Message PAne area as 'n' conversations where 'n' is a number You will see an 'Archive' and a 'Delete' button click on 'Delete' All selected Emails will now get moved to the imap 'Trash' folder </p><p><strong>If you want to select only unread which are older than a specific date:</strong> Click on first email you wish to delete to highlight it. hold down 'Shift' key scroll down and click on last email or any email lower if doing it in batches as there may be a lot of emails. all emails in between get highlighted. </p><p>At this point, you can still check the emails that get put into 'Trash', so if you deleted in error then it can still be rescued and moved into a folder of choice. </p><p>To fully remove all the deleted emails from trash: </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Trash' and select 'Empty Deleted' </li></ul> <p>Then 'compact' the folder from which you deleted the emails. Compacting is not compressing. Compacting checks the file containing all emails and removes everything which has a mark as deleted tag applied. This completely removes all traces of deleted emails and recovers space. </p> <ul><li> Right click on Inbox folder in left 'Folder Pane' and select 'Compact' </li></ul> <p>Compacting is a quick process - often less than a second, but a large deletion may be a couple of seconds, you should see info on compacting process in bottom status bar. I advise that whilst it is compacting the Inbox, do not try to use the Inbox and do not exit Thunderbird. </p><p>Info on compacting: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders</a> </p><p>You can also use 'Message Filters' 'Tools' &gt; 'Message Filters' Info on 'Message Filters' <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/organize-your-messages-using-filters"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/organize-your-messages-using-filters</a> Where you can select 'Manually Run' - do not select 'Getting new mail' as this runs automatically when getting new mail.

Repeat same filter on other folders as required. </p><p>Then check the Trash to make sure it does not contain anything you do not want to get rid of.

In my case, the folder name is not the name of the account but the name of the inbound server (e.g., '<a href=""http://imap.ionos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.ionos.com</a>').  </p><p>I gave up using Thunderbird junk filtering. Instead, I have a filter that sends anything not in my address book to spam and another that sends anything in my address book to the inbox. I do have to check spam periodically and add someone or some organization to the address book. To keep my address book from being cluttered I set up a separate address book called ""allowed organizations."" Sometimes the same organization uses different addresses from the same domain.  To cover those cases I have an exceptions filter that moves any message from the set of domains listed (specified by using, e.g., ""ends with '<a href=""http://usps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">usps.com</a>') to the inbox. (The exceptions are repeated in the filter that sends messages not in my address books to spam.) </p><p>The main problem with this setup is that I use two computers and have had to track down where address books and filters are stored to keep them in sync. The personal address book is stored in a file called âabook.sqlite.â Other address books need to be exported and imported.  The message filters are stored as described above.  </p><p>IMAP works very well for keeping messages synchronized among various devices. In addition to my two computers, I have a phone and tablet. I use all four devices for email, but let the computers manage the junk filtering.  It would be desirable if mail clients like Thunderbird could devise a common means of sharing address books and filters through the cloud, so that an update on one machine is immediately reflected on another. Thunderbird could develop such a means on its own, yet it would be better if that paved the way for providing sharing addresses and filters among various clients. One way might be for Thunderbird to allow the use of other address books (like Googleâs) in place of (or in addition to) its own. My Samsung phone, for example, allows you to select where an address is stored. Google Contacts is one of the choices. Itâs confusing on Samsumg, because itâs not always clear what choice youâve made, but the idea is a good one: allow users to store addresses in a place that is readily shareable. </p>",rmrubinsl,false,0,0

When you first start Tbird, it pulls all the connection info correctly as a new session, then on the second attempt it has cached some of the info so reuses it. It could be because the 'new email' has downloaded in between (especially if that sent by you email has been received) and as you mentioned the passwords for the SMTP server and IMAP are different. You could check if this is the issue by turning off checking for new mail on start up, time period etc and just have manual check on. Then restart Tbird. Send one email, then try a second without downloading email. If that works then try a download of new email and try a third send, and see if that works. </p>",jennydeione,false,0,0

BH's tech support has gone way downhill in the last 10 years, but it's like an old marriage, too much trouble and expense to get divorced. </p><p>I saw a post somewhere, maybe on this site, saying that the popstate.dat file can get corrupted, especially if you leave tens of thousands of emails on the server despite using POP. However, I was able to open that file in Notepad and copy everything into Excel. It does not appear to be corrupted. It has 27,576 data rows. My TB inbox now has 34,000+ messages. Maybe that counts as corruption?  </p><p>Later yesterday I got a different TB error message: ""The DELE command did not succeed. Error marking a message as deleted. Mail server box&lt;nnnn&gt;.bluehost.com responded: [SYS/TEMP] Server shutting down."" I don't remember if that message appeared before or after the repeat download started. </p><p>What the heck? I still had a webmail (Roundcube) window open pointing to the inbox directly on the server. I was able to navigate around with no issues. There was no indication that the server had shut down. And that would certainly be a funky thing to do just because of an error deleting a single email. </p><p>I set up a TB mail filter to move emails from 2023 into a local folder, making my inbox smaller, in hopes of avoiding corruption because of the large re-download. I might also move emails from the first half of 2024 into another local folder for the same reason. But obviously it's a PITA that I now have tens of thousands of duplicate messages. If TB had a counterpart to Outlook VBA, I could maybe figure out how to write a script to delete duplicate messages. But I haven't heard that there is any such gripping language. I know of no other feasible way of deleting tens of thousands of duplicate messages. Is there an easy way? </p><p>More emails came in overnight that do not appear to be duplicates, so maybe both issues indicated by the error messages referenced above have somehow magically resolved themselves, but who knows how and whether either of them will recur. </p><p>I saw that there was a TB update yesterday. I was hoping someone would immediately notice that there was a bug in the update and release a new version, but Help &gt; About doesn't indicate that.

Restoring just portions creates an incomplete profile and results in thunderbird prompting to create an email account. And, if that isn't working, you might try copying important components into a new profile. That is  - create a new profile (or use the one you're now using) and  - import the addressbook (abook.sqlite) with tools&gt;import, and  - install the importexportools addon,  - then create local folders for each POP folder in old profile to salvage  - then, highlight each folder, rightclick and use the importexport option to import mbox file, and then  - select one of the POP folders in the old profile (e.g., 'input' but NOT input.msf).  - repeat for each POP folder - this saves the messages downloaded to date. When resetting the POP accounts, you will have new messages in the POP account's input folder and prior messages in the new local folders. If you want to merge them, you can repeat somewhat  some prior tasks. That would be - highlight each of the new local folders you created, rightclick and select the importexport option to export as eml.  - then, highlight the POP input folder, rightclick, select the importexport option to import eml.  and then you will have rejoined the folder and can now delete the local folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Well I've looked in every Mail folder and sub folder under Thunderbird and ThunderbirdOLD and I've yet to see my first mbox file (or folder if there is such a thing). I could go on with example after example. I was hoping for a simple solution like maybe copy/pasting everything under ThunderbirdOld to a new profile would fix it.

I'm currently using T'bird Ver 115.10.1 on a Win10 laptop. </p><p>I started using T'bird about two years ago and I update whenever I get a notice to do so. I needed it for two Gmail accounts when Gmail forced me to stop using my previous software (Agent) due to ""security issues"" (according to them). So I chose to use Thunderbird there instead, but still use Agent for other pop3 accounts with a different (not free) provider. I've not yet learned the inner workings of T'bird though. Just followed the instructions on setting it up for two Gmail accounts and was able to import 10 years of email into those two T'bird profiles.  Can't say it didn't go without a hitch but.... close enough for a rookie. </p><p>I always start Thunderbird by clicking a Tb desktop icon that pops up Profile Manager and that lets me choose between Profile1 or Profile2. I've never thought of either one as a ""default"". My peremptory action came when I chose to open ""Profile2"" and then meant to move the cursor to the bottom and click on ""Start Thunderbird"".  Unfortunately, when the cursor was passing over the ""Delete Profle"" button, my twitchy trigger finger clicked the mouse clicker and up pops a little warning window. The first thing I saw was a highlighted button that said ""Don't delete files"", so I immediately clicked it.... and it was all over but the weepin' and the cryin'. And that's pretty much where I am now. </p><p>I've never created a backup for Thunderbird although I've known I should. Just never got a round tuit so it's still on the ""to do"" list. And, until now, I've never looked at T'bird in Windows Explorer. So I just assumed a ThunderbirdOLD folder was created recently when I deleted Profile2. But maybe it has been there all along for some reason and I never noticed. I have no clue what that reason might be though. So I just now looked in Windows Explorer at those two folders (T'bird and T'birdOLD) and was surprised to see their Last Modified dates were 2 days apart. ThunderbirdOld on 12/11/2021 and Thunderbird on 12/13/2021. So now I know T'birdOLD has been there all along. And those dates could be about the time I was first trying to get it set up. But here I go assuming again. The dates seem about right for that though. </p><p>I think of ""Default"" as a profile that would open when a named T'bird profile has NOT been chosen. But I've never opened Tb without first choosing which profile I want to use. And I was thinking a profile folder name would contain at least the profile's name so to give me a hint as to where the profile's files are stashed. I was obviously way wrong on that one too. </p><p>I hope I haven't made a royal mess but -shrug- who knows? The only thing I've deleted for sure was the profile name from Profile Manager when I took my peremptory action (love that. It's going into my vocabulary bucket if that's ok with you&nbsp;:-)  And the only things I've created (that I'm aware) are new profile names in Profile Manager (i.e Profile2-2, Profile2-3, Profile2-4 etc) and I've copy/pasted various files into those new profiles to see what happens. Didn't delete anything though. Oh! btw, I've now created a completely new (no copy/past files added) Profile2 POP3 account with Yahoo for now because I'm being punished in time out at Gmail for making too many attempts to sign in. Their robot apparently thinks only an interloper would do such a thing. They keep sending messages to my alternate account telling me what a great job they're doing protecting my account. aarrgghh!!  However, my Profile1 account at Gmail still works just fine. </p><p>Still trying to figure out how to post a screen shot of Windows Explorer. Hopefully I'll have it in my next post. Anyhow, I tried typing ""%appdata%\Thunderbird\profiles"" into the Windows Explorer search bar but I've never been good at ""searching"" and what came up didn't make sense. Guess I screwed that up somehow. </p><p>I normally just manually go find stuff myself.  So..... C:\Users\RFant\AppData\Roaming\.... and then there's both \Thunderbird and \ThunderbirdOLD. </p><p>Under each of those last two is a \Profiles folder with (drum roll) more folders in them.  </p><p>Now I have a question. If I post the folder names contained in \Profiles folder as a screen shot, I'll essentially be posting my email address on a rather public Forum. I know we're all good friends here but is there some other way we can do this? I just now looked at the last modified dates and they were a surprise to me. All of the Thunderbird\Profiles folders were dated within the last few days. And 2 of the 3 folders in ThunderbirdOLD\Profiles (.default and .default-release) were dated 12/13/21 and 12/12/2021 respectively (about when I first set up T'bird). But the 3rd folder folder date was 7/24/2024. That was yesterday. </p><p>I'm getting more baffled by the minute. </p><p>And if that weren't enough, when you said ""go up a level"" for profiles.ini, did you mean up a level from \Profiles?  If so, that would be in \Thunderbird and \ThunderbirdOLD. The \Thunderbird profiles.ini last modified date is 7/24/2024 (yesterday) and \ThunderbirdOLD profiles.ini last modified date is 12/13/2021 (iow when I first installed T'bird). </p><p>Again, my email address is contained in both profile.ini's. Will it be ok if I replace my real address with ""Profile2"" when I post the profile.ini contents here? </p><p>I hope I haven't confused the situation more than ever. And I appreciate any help in rescuing my email and folders etc. I just now went back to proof read what I've written here and I don't see any glaring errors but my brain is a bit scrambled after writing all this. So feel free to ask questions whether I can answer them or not. I'll try try again. But right now, I need a nap. </p>",RWFant,false,0,0

Or now as I decided a cup of coffee might help. </p><p>You are right in one respect.  The folder name in the profile manager is usually located after the random digits in the folder name,  following the full stop or period as our American cousins name it.  But not always, a profile can be renamed in the profile manger so the name on creation and the current name are not necessarily linked. </p><p>The profiles.ini file is what dictates profile names. </p><p>I have a profile named tester.  It appears in the profiles.ini file like </p><pre>Name=tester IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/zwldg1rp.tester Default=1 </pre> <p>So to explain that, </p><p><strong>Name</strong> is the name displayed in the profile manager or about:profiles <strong>IsRelative</strong>  This tells the profile manager if the profile is located relative to the location of the profiles.ini. In this case it is True or 1 <strong>Path</strong>  In this example the path from the profiles.ini file to the profile folder, relative to the location of the profile.ini file. </p><p>If the IsRelative was 0 or False as this is a boolean. Then the path will be an absolute path to the location of the profile folder.  This is usually the case when a drive other then the default drive is used to hold the profile folder.  For Windows computers that will begin with a drive letter,  but a UNC path is also valid as it is required for Unix, Linux and macOS as they really do not use drive letters in their paths. </p><p>This is what I want to examine in your profiles.ini,  to be honest naming the profiles as complete email addresses in not something I had ever considered.  I understand naming profile like work, play, abc biz etc,  but with an address,  that I had never considered.  So you could change the information,  but I suggest just removing the domain part of the email.  That way we will both be talking about something that does not require a complete codex to translate.  You are as you say struggling.  Lets make is as simple as possible. </p><p>I want you to ignore the Thunderbirdold folder.  My guess is you renamed it when you originally set things up to get a fresh start and it has lingered ever since. </p><p>So we are only talking about the Thunderbird folder.  I gave the path as %appdata%\Thunderbird\profiles for a reason,  you chose to ignore it,  but in explicitly points to the Thunderbird\profiles folder,  but asked the operating system to resolve that path to the appdata object that windows maintains to point to a relative location.  That may or may not be where you have been looking.  I am guessing it is,  but it is a way to be sure.  Just as I will tell folks to go to troubleshooting information on the help menu and click the show profile folder.  It is a way of interrogating the computers about where they think things are.  To ensure what I think is the case is the same case the programs think is, I ask them.  </p><p>Even knowing where my profile is on the physical disk,  I will still use that extended clicking process to get Thunderbird to tell me the path for some things. Just to see where Thunderbird thinks the profile is.  Especially when it is not doing things like load what I expect it to. </p><p>So using the path %appdata% is what Thunderbird does when it reaches out to the operating system to load the profile.ini file. It attempts to load the file %appdata%\Thunderbird\profile.ini not C:\Users\RFant\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\profile.ini  They may well be both pointing to the same file,  but the only way to be sure is emulate the same sort of request and see for yourself. </p><p>SO in \Thunderbird\profile in each iof the sub folders you will see a pref.js file.  Do they have dates in the time frame of interest here?  Generally they are updated with any preference changes when you close Thunderbird,  so recent dates should be sort of expected.  Also check the <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database"" rel=""nofollow"">global database </a>date (global-messages-db.sqlite).  That should be updated every time mail is retrieved,  so very recent dates on it would be the order of the day. </p><p>I am guessing if you indeed removed the profile and not the data that there will be a folder in the \Thunderbird\profiles folder that is not referenced in the profile.ini file and it is there we need to look.  But I am still missing so much information. </p><p>I am hopeful your profile is still there and can be brought back into use. </p><p>Note there is a Mozilla pastebin. <a href=""https://pastebin.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.mozilla.org/</a> while it is public,  you could paste your profile.ini data there and only have it exposed to the world for a day or two rather than permanently.

It was like two completely separate email accounts for about two years until I accidentally hit the delete button for Profile2. I should have immediately hit the cancel button but didn't see it until I had already hit the ""Do not delete files"" button. So Profile2 vanished but I'm told its data is saved somewhere.
