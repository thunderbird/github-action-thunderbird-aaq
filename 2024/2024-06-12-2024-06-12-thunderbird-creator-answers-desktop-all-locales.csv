It's double-spaced in Word, but when I paste it into T'bird, it's single-spaced. I've tried everything I can think of, to no avail.

I am looking for a way to modify the color, style and size of the current day number (Today) in the Mini-Month of the Calendar pane.  If there is a css to modify it, I guess it should also apply to the Mini-Month in the Today Pane. But I am mostly interested in the Calendar pane. </p><p>The current one view is fine, but I sometimes get a bit lost when navigating the Calendar. Thanks </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",mint.kelp741
