I am looking for a way to modify the color, style and size of the current day number (Today) in the Mini-Month of the Calendar pane.  If there is a css to modify it, I guess it should also apply to the Mini-Month in the Today Pane. But I am mostly interested in the Calendar pane. </p><p>The current one view is fine, but I sometimes get a bit lost when navigating the Calendar.

I have experienced this problem occasionally in the past and for a day at most, the problem usually associated with virginmedia. However this is now proving to be disruptive and I don't where the problem lies, with Thunderbird or Virgin. None of my settings etc. have been changed and I can access everything if I go directly to the virginmedia website but the handling of the emails is cumbersome.  Any ideas? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",daddy.ricky
