Rather, it appears I must manually apply these settings to each folder, which is tedious given I have a large number of sub-folders in my inbox folder. </p><p>Is there a way to apply the settings for one folder to all others, or to change the default settings for each (existing) folder? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",thunderbirds_are_go
