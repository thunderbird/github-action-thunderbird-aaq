Rather, it appears I must manually apply these settings to each folder, which is tedious given I have a large number of sub-folders in my inbox folder. </p><p>Is there a way to apply the settings for one folder to all others, or to change the default settings for each (existing) folder? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1660541;,thunderbirds_are_go

How do I get them back?,"<p>I changed the email server in settings and all my stored emails are gone! Win10, Tbird 115.10.1. How do I get them back? Only one Email acct of three are stored on the server and those get downloaded to a different computer and then removed from the server. </p><p>Background: I was wondering why I didn't get any new emails for a few days and apparently GoDaddy migrated servers without telling me. So the settings there were screwed up as a result of a ""~"" instead of a ""-"" in the server name which the tech support guy changed. I was eventually able to access emails at my GD acct using their webmail. </p><p>But the server name changed so new emails weren't downloading to my computer. I went into Tbird settings and changed the SMTP servers to the new server address and now I don't have ANY of the old emails which I neglected to backup. ALL I did was to change the server address. </p><p>Is there a way to change/view/merge the T-bird user folders so I can access the old emails, folder and directory?
