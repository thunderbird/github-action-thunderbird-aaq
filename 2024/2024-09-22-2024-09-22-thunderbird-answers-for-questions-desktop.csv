I have two other PC's on this network all W11 all running same TB all tested with same Accounts/Profiles and this one PC is the only one that will not send Yahoo with attachment when using OAuth2 authentification. I even created a fresh working yahoo account using my credentials on another PC and copied it over to this one and it failed.

Only with me OAuth2 times out if I send an attachemnt with Yahoo. </p><p>The cerificates only happens when creating the Yahoo accounts. Once done it's done. You will not have seen it happen unless you start fresh.  This also happend on the other two PCs when setting testing accounts for this nightmare. Also If you have an existing Yahoo account and create new ones you will not get the certificated request. It's already in your system. </p><p><strong>As an obsolute spaced out Idea here is a theory since nothing else worked: </strong> </p><p>This PC has had TB since 2015 some time after 2015 Yahoo changed the rules and wanted one time passwords then years later it never requested but has OAuth2 available. I changed to OAuth2 because it was required by Outlook this year so I did all accounts. If I hadn't done Yahoo all would still be good. </p><p>So, From what I can tell/experienced Yahoo knows my computer ID and TB, what if there is a conflict between old and new. Yahoo expects from my PC the OTPWs since it's still in their accounts and knows my computer so when I changed to OAuth2  it kept expecting My PC to login via OTPWs but is confused when using OAuth2 with the right credentials. As a fail safe to prevent people from loosing email support as a guess it falls back to text only send and receive.  </p><p>I go back to OTPWs and all works as it should. I can send attachments. </p><p>That is the only reason I can think of as to why this PC is targeted even after fresh W11 and TB.  I guess the only way to prove my theory is if somebody else whom has gone straight from OTPWs to OAuth2 as I had keeping the OTPWs still in Yahoo servers or for me to uninstall TB again &gt; go to Yahoo website &gt; Login and delete all OTPWs and start again by reinstalling TB with OAuth2 credentials.  </p><p>At the moment I have literally wasted days on this and am sick and tired of it. For the moment OTPWs still works and allows me to send attachments so I may just leave well enough alone. </p>",Lastinline,false,0,0

I am only using standard themes, in fact I tried several others to be sure. It's def a feature of TB but while using the new upgrade it turns out it is not compatible with my most used add-on, QNote, so I had to roll back to v115.15. Anyhow in 115 that thingie is still there but it turns out not to be as annoying as in 128. It only pulsates when placing my cursor near the corner. If you are using 115 or 128 you will see a little blue triangle when it's not pulsating. Just to be clear, what i mean by pulsate is that the triangle fans out like a wave in a gradient of colors like an animated gif file might do and it covers about an inch of my text. Anyhow, perhaps someone knows what the intention of this is because it is driving me nuts. </p>",lockmaster56,false,0,0

The blue triangle appears whether using 115 or 128. I tried it with all addons disabled and it persists. But it gets weirder... The thing pulsates when I hover the mouse curser within an inch of the triangle. If I move and inch to the right, the pulsating stops.
