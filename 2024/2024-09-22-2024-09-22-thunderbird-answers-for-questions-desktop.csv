I am only using standard themes, in fact I tried several others to be sure. It's def a feature of TB but while using the new upgrade it turns out it is not compatible with my most used add-on, QNote, so I had to roll back to v115.15. Anyhow in 115 that thingie is still there but it turns out not to be as annoying as in 128. It only pulsates when placing my cursor near the corner. If you are using 115 or 128 you will see a little blue triangle when it's not pulsating. Just to be clear, what i mean by pulsate is that the triangle fans out like a wave in a gradient of colors like an animated gif file might do and it covers about an inch of my text. Anyhow, perhaps someone knows what the intention of this is because it is driving me nuts. </p>",lockmaster56,false,0,0

All I can suggest is you run in Help/Troubleshoot Mode in case there is something causing the dialog to be incomplete.  It might also just be an artifact of the version of TB for your version of Linux. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
