Here is more detail:  With a ""fresh"" invocation of Thunderbird, all incoming messages are received, in two different email accounts.  Outgoing messages can be sent. After a while (can be two days, can be a week or more), the error message shown above is received when sending an outgoing message.  Once this error message happens, <strong>all</strong> incoming mail (for both email accounts) stops. If she then terminates Thunderbird, and restarts it, she will normally get an error message during the restart, which states that ""Thunderbird is already running, but is not responding.""  If she accepts to terminate this non-responding process, then the next restart of Thunderbird is successful, and she can receive (and send) messages again. The workaround (as noted above) to save the sent message to a local folder allows the current outgoing message to be saved, and she can then copy the saved message to the proper ""Sent"" folder after she restarts Thunderbird.  However, this is very annoying---having to save locally and then recopy---especially if there are several messages in progress when the failure occurs.  In addition, it does not ""solve"" the problem; a restart is still necessary. A similar error message is presented sometimes, when Thunderbird is saving a draft message.  It speaks of ""a copy was not placed in your draft folder"" (or something similar; I don't remember the exact details).  When this error message appears, Thunderbird is in the same state as above: no incoming messages are received, and a Thunderbird restart is the only fix. Please note that this problem has been showing up for at least the last six to eight months.  It seems to be getting more frequent, to the point where my wife now explicitly restarts Thunderbird every couple of days. Her environment: Windows 10 Enterprise; Dell tower; Thunderbird 128.4.2esr </p><p>I am also running Thunderbird on my laptop.  I have six email accounts.  I have never seen the above error message in relation to sending messages, although I have seen it concerning the saving of drafts.  However, I have never seen it prevent the receipt of incoming messages, the way my wife has. My environment: Windows 10 enterprise; Lenovo laptop; Thunderbird 115.3.1 </p><p>If there is a way to gather more extensive logs from my wife's computer, to aid in solving this problem, I will be happy to help.

If thunderbird is still on old PC, do ths - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - locate 'profile folder' and click 'open folder; - exit thunderbird  - you are now inside the profile. I will presume the account is POP.   - click Mail folder and you will see list of account names  - click an account name and you will see its folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc. copy the desired folders to external media (the .msf files can be ignored)  - now click the Local Folders folder and do the same here. If you see other folders such as xyz.sdb, click to see the files inside it.  - now you have all the desired message folders on external media  - on New PC, create a Local Folder for each of the folders you saved. Names may be different from original, if desired - now, highlight one of the newly-created local folders, rightclick, and select the importexport option to import mbox. Then seleck one of the files on the external media and click ok.  - repeat the process for each item  - when, done, I suggest doing a backup. if the profile is in the default location on Windows, I suggest this - exit thunderbird - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media  - now, if you have to restore, just copy the backedup thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overlay existing thunderbird folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Then...  see in the next screenshot no. 50....,... the ONLY option that is ""greyed out"" is ....""import mbox files"".  That is the frustrating last hurdle it seems.

Is the account IMAP?    if so, you cannot import mbox files into IMAP. If this is IMAP, you can do that, but you mist first do the steps I suggested, and then you can either: - open all messages in each account, highlight them, right click and select the 'copy to' option. OR, you can  - do the steps I suggested t Local Folders - then use the import/export addon to export as eml files to a folder outside of thunderbird and then use the import/export addon to import eml to the IMAP folders.   Either way is problematic, since uploading to IMAP is not how IMAP is designed. You would need to spot check that the messages all upload completely. If your intent is to preserve the messages, saving in Local Folders and using a PC-to-cloud backup service may prove easier and safer. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It's a lot of time commitment on your part, and that's why I offered the alternative of a PC-to-cloud backup service. If you upload, I suggest creating a filter to do that, as it slows the process somewhat for a more stable upload. Always use COPY. Then, when you're content that all is well, you could delete the local folders. l(And I've gone down deeper rabbit holes on this forum than this one.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I must however tell you what is happening now. </p><p>Thanks to your clarification (that’s not an accusation; it would have been clear to a normal person originally!) I have  created a new empty ""test"" folder in “Local Folders” on the NEW computer,  (instead of in the “Inbox!”). Immediately, when I right clicked the new empty folder, the option of “Import mboxfile” WAS finally available! Not greyed out!  Great. Thank you! </p><p>I then went to the OLD computer and tried to “shift/c” all the mail folders under “INBOX” to get them onto the sd card, so as to ferry them across from old comp to the new. However, it will only let me copy one folder to the SD Card at a time. Not a complaint; I’m glad to have achieved anything.   (NOTE:  IF any folder has an inner subfolder, it would NOT include the sub folder when I copied the “master” folder; I have to open the “tree” and click both the “master” AND inner subfolders in order to get each one onto the SD card.  Having then got them all onto the SD card I then transfer the card to the New Computer, and open Thunderbird.  From there  I CAN  “shift/c” multiple folders on the sd card, and import them to Local Folders en masse. Which speeds things up. The folders all appear under Local Folders, and arrive with their contents. Wonderful. (As I had previously (incorrectly) created new recipient folders in  the Inbox, I can also drag the contents from the newly imported folders (In the Local Folders) into the ones I created in the Inbox. ) ( That may seem mad to you (?) but I’m just used to seeing them up there.)  </p><p>All I need to do now... ( I think!) is to reunite the subfolders back into their appropriate “master” folder” and hopefully all is done.&nbsp;! (So I didn’t need (it seems) to create any New Folders in readiness to receive;  as the “import” action  brought the old folders in complete with their contents. (I suppose it would be necessary if bringing in the individual emails, but that would have been confusing for me on the sd card)  Likewise ..I still do not understand the IMAP issue, but suffice to say it all seems to have worked as I describe here, despite my having an IMAP address.   I mention that not from any position of understanding, but it may be that a “tweak” has been created recently to avoid that issue, and if so it will perhaps affect any advice you give in future. Or of course, in my ignorance,  that is yet to come back and bite me! .  </p><p>Anyway; It SEEMS all is well now, and I would never have done it without your kindness and information (and patience!)   SO very grateful to you. If you ever visit Norfolk I’ll buy you a beer.  Have a great week/month/life.  Steve (and Fiona! ) </p>",info897,false,0,0

Ma la domanda posta è molto più dettagliata e ci vuole anche una risposta precisa: Il file SNTMP (che sono diversi nella cartella iMAP Gmail) hanno dimensioni enormi che stanno portando l'hard disk ad non avere più spazio all'interno. Il problema sta nel fatto che cancellando un file temporaneo (facendo prima la copia di esso) della dimensione di 15Gb, alla riapertura di Thurderbird alcune mail segnano il testo in bianco o non si vede il loro contenuto La cosa che mi preoccupa è se ci sono ripercussioni sulla casella e sul server di Gmail avendo eliminato questo file temporaneo.
