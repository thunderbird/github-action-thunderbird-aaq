If thunderbird is still on old PC, do ths - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - locate 'profile folder' and click 'open folder; - exit thunderbird  - you are now inside the profile. I will presume the account is POP.   - click Mail folder and you will see list of account names  - click an account name and you will see its folders, such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc. copy the desired folders to external media (the .msf files can be ignored)  - now click the Local Folders folder and do the same here. If you see other folders such as xyz.sdb, click to see the files inside it.  - now you have all the desired message folders on external media  - on New PC, create a Local Folder for each of the folders you saved. Names may be different from original, if desired - now, highlight one of the newly-created local folders, rightclick, and select the importexport option to import mbox. Then seleck one of the files on the external media and click ok.  - repeat the process for each item  - when, done, I suggest doing a backup. if the profile is in the default location on Windows, I suggest this - exit thunderbird - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media  - now, if you have to restore, just copy the backedup thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overlay existing thunderbird folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Is the account IMAP?    if so, you cannot import mbox files into IMAP. If this is IMAP, you can do that, but you mist first do the steps I suggested, and then you can either: - open all messages in each account, highlight them, right click and select the 'copy to' option. OR, you can  - do the steps I suggested t Local Folders - then use the import/export addon to export as eml files to a folder outside of thunderbird and then use the import/export addon to import eml to the IMAP folders.   Either way is problematic, since uploading to IMAP is not how IMAP is designed. You would need to spot check that the messages all upload completely.

I must however tell you what is happening now. </p><p>Thanks to your clarification (that’s not an accusation; it would have been clear to a normal person originally!) I have  created a new empty ""test"" folder in “Local Folders” on the NEW computer,  (instead of in the “Inbox!”). Immediately, when I right clicked the new empty folder, the option of “Import mboxfile” WAS finally available! Not greyed out!  Great. Thank you! </p><p>I then went to the OLD computer and tried to “shift/c” all the mail folders under “INBOX” to get them onto the sd card, so as to ferry them across from old comp to the new. However, it will only let me copy one folder to the SD Card at a time. Not a complaint; I’m glad to have achieved anything.   (NOTE:  IF any folder has an inner subfolder, it would NOT include the sub folder when I copied the “master” folder; I have to open the “tree” and click both the “master” AND inner subfolders in order to get each one onto the SD card.  Having then got them all onto the SD card I then transfer the card to the New Computer, and open Thunderbird.  From there  I CAN  “shift/c” multiple folders on the sd card, and import them to Local Folders en masse. Which speeds things up. The folders all appear under Local Folders, and arrive with their contents. Wonderful. (As I had previously (incorrectly) created new recipient folders in  the Inbox, I can also drag the contents from the newly imported folders (In the Local Folders) into the ones I created in the Inbox. ) ( That may seem mad to you (?) but I’m just used to seeing them up there.)  </p><p>All I need to do now... ( I think!) is to reunite the subfolders back into their appropriate “master” folder” and hopefully all is done.&nbsp;! (So I didn’t need (it seems) to create any New Folders in readiness to receive;  as the “import” action  brought the old folders in complete with their contents. (I suppose it would be necessary if bringing in the individual emails, but that would have been confusing for me on the sd card)  Likewise ..I still do not understand the IMAP issue, but suffice to say it all seems to have worked as I describe here, despite my having an IMAP address.   I mention that not from any position of understanding, but it may be that a “tweak” has been created recently to avoid that issue, and if so it will perhaps affect any advice you give in future. Or of course, in my ignorance,  that is yet to come back and bite me! .  </p><p>Anyway; It SEEMS all is well now, and I would never have done it without your kindness and information (and patience!)   SO very grateful to you. If you ever visit Norfolk I’ll buy you a beer.  Have a great week/month/life.  Steve (and Fiona! ) </p>",info897,false,0,0

In base alle regole di formattazione del file MBOX, viene quindi analizzato singolarmente ogni messaggio:  <ul><li> Se il messaggio è ancora attuale, viene copiato in un nuovo file MBOX temporaneo denominato Nstmp. </li><li> Se il messaggio è contrassegnato come eliminato o spostato, quel messaggio verrà ignorato e non sarà posto nel file MBOX temporaneo.  </li></ul>  Questo processo viene ripetuto progressivamente per ciascun messaggio fino al raggiungimento della fine del file. Al termine di questa procedura, il file di memorizzazione del messaggio originale verrà eliminato e sostituito da quello nuovo. A questa operazione seguirà la generazione automatica di un nuovo indice per questo file di messaggio (chiamato, ad esempio, INBOX.msf).

Ma la domanda posta è molto più dettagliata e ci vuole anche una risposta precisa: Il file SNTMP (che sono diversi nella cartella iMAP Gmail) hanno dimensioni enormi che stanno portando l'hard disk ad non avere più spazio all'interno. Il problema sta nel fatto che cancellando un file temporaneo (facendo prima la copia di esso) della dimensione di 15Gb, alla riapertura di Thurderbird alcune mail segnano il testo in bianco o non si vede il loro contenuto La cosa che mi preoccupa è se ci sono ripercussioni sulla casella e sul server di Gmail avendo eliminato questo file temporaneo.
