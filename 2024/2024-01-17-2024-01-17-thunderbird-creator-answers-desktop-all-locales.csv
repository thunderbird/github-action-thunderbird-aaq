There appears to have been a change a few months ago. I used to be able to move an unread email from UNREAD to a subfolder, and it would disappear from the UNREAD folder. That no longer happens. I want it to happen, because then I can see which emails (in the UNREAD folder) still need my attention. I don't want to mark the email as 'read', because then it won't show as 'unread' in the subfolder, which I want it to do, as I then know it needs further attention, and because it makes that subfolder show in the list of subfolders that have unread messages in them. I don't want to have the same unread email in both the UNREAD folder and in the subfolder. This used to work, but now it doesn't. Any ideas greatly appreciated.
