There appears to have been a change a few months ago. I used to be able to move an unread email from UNREAD to a subfolder, and it would disappear from the UNREAD folder. That no longer happens. I want it to happen, because then I can see which emails (in the UNREAD folder) still need my attention. I don't want to mark the email as 'read', because then it won't show as 'unread' in the subfolder, which I want it to do, as I then know it needs further attention, and because it makes that subfolder show in the list of subfolders that have unread messages in them. I don't want to have the same unread email in both the UNREAD folder and in the subfolder. This used to work, but now it doesn't. Any ideas greatly appreciated. Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1631035;,gcwesq

It is necessary to transfer several folders (over 100) from POP3 to IMAP at once. Previously, it was possible to select several folders at once and move them. Now I can only transfer one folder at a time. I tried to go to the profile folder and just copy the folder files from there, but when Thunderbird is turned on, these folders are immediately deleted. Is there any other way? Thank you in advance. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",wanderer.in.the.universe
