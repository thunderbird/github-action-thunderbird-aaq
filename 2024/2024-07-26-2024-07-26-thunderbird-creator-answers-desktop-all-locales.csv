I receive and read/ manage my mail using Thunderbird. I received the following message from Microsoft (see below). Can you please advise me what to do to maintain my access through Thunderbird. Thank you for your help NP </p><p>_______________________________________ Update your sign-in technology before September 16th, 2024 to maintain email access. </p><p>The safety and security of your information is top priority for Microsoft. To help keep your account secure, Microsoft will no longer support the use of third-party email and calendar apps which ask you to sign in with only your Microsoft Account username and password. To keep you safe you will need to use a mail or calendar app which supports Microsoft’s modern authentication methods. If you do not act, your third-party email apps will no longer be able to access your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, Hotmail or <a href=""http://Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Live.com</a> email address on September 16th. </p><p><br>  </p><p>What do you need to do? </p><p>If you are receiving this email, you are currently using an email or calendar app that uses a less secure authentication method to connect to your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> email account. You will need to upgrade your third-party mail and calendar app to a version which supports modern authentication methods. </p><p><br>  </p><p>Microsoft provides free versions of Outlook for your PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices which can be easily downloaded and connect to your email account. Using an updated version of an Outlook application will ensure you are connecting in the most secure way. </p><p><br>  </p><p>How can you set up your Gmail, Apple Mail, or other third-party mail application? </p><p>Various non-Microsoft applications will have their own steps for connecting to your <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> email account using modern authentication methods. See our help article - Modern Authentication Methods now needed to continue syncing Outlook Email in non-Microsoft email apps. However, you may need to contact the creators of those applications to provide you with instructions. In many cases, simply removing and re-adding your account with the latest version of that application will configure it to use modern authentication methods.  __________________ </p>",customize-settings-and-preferences;,thunderbird,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,1664280;,npuetz3164

Last was the ""Assembling message"" prompt that seems to have gone away.  Today, however, I have a brand new one that makes no sense to me. </p><p>On the PC this morning with no issues and e-mail was fine.  Thunderbird told me there was an update so I applied it and shut down the PC. Came back about 6:30PM and fired up the PC and, when I started Thunderbird, it prompted me to create a new e-mail account!  What?  I checked my profile and it was still there and I even compared it to my last differential backup and it appears to be right.  Not corrupted. </p><p>Using the profile manager, I see it still knows where the profile is located and I even clicked it, selected it and said use it but it again started with the ""create a new account""!  Tried the usual methods of creating a new profile, renaming, using the old data, etc. but, every time I try, it only gets me to the ""create new account"" interface. </p><p>I even went so far as to revert to a previous Windows restore point to get back to the previous version of Thunderbird but it STILL does not want to use the existing profile.  Uninstalled and reinstalled Thunderbird and again tried to point to the old profile and no joy.  It simply does not want to use the existing profile. </p><p>Normally when I build a new PC or reload Windows to start fresh, I am always able to point Thunderbird at my old profile like nothing changed and it always worked.  Today, however, it does not want to use what I was using this morning. </p><p>Anyone else get this today? </p>",troubleshooting;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1664276;1664460;,qhorque

J""ai essayé toutes les solutions proposées par l'aide de Thunderbird en passant par les les paramètres et  l'éditeur de configuration cela ne change rien. Je peux bien sûr augmenter la police en modifiant à chaque mail  mais ce que je veux c'est retrouver la fonctionnalité qui me permettait de ne pas avoir à re sélectionner la hauteur des caractères à chaque fois. j ai pu modifier la taille de  l 'interface entière mais cela ne change pas la police dans les messages.
