Just now, a new screen pops up with this message:   ""an error occurred during connection to localhost"".  I have 2 email accounts that I use with T-bird.  The one is with comcast; it is the account that comes up with the error message.  The other account is with Breezeline, and it appears to be unaffected.  However, and this is the problem, I cannot send or receive email from either account.  I am going to try to send both a hard copy of the error message, and the data from the T-bird program that I am using.  Your help is appreciated.

But in a newly created test profile (on the same system), the add-ons are listed without this ""error"". Please see attached screenshot with both profiles side-by-side with ImportExport Tool NG as an example. Thus, it appears that my main profile has become mangled up somewhat.
