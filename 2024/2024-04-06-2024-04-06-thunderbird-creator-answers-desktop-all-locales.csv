Several months ago there was a password problem with my internet account preventing me from logging into my internet/email service and all my devices could not send or recieve emails. I changed my password on my cell, my Windows 10 computers and they worked fine.  My Thunderbird on my Ubuntu on the other hand rejected my password and I also checked all of my port and server settings with the help of my internet service provider tech support including comparing settings from other email clients. Still no password being accepted. My internet/email service provider tech agent suggested removing my account from my client and reentering it and this worked. </p><p>Several months later I changed my main email passwords again on incoming mail and outgoing mail servers on my account, verified my port settings are correct, which they were including the type of security and protocols used. When I select the desktop icon I get prompted to enter my main password and hit enter and the window keeps reoccurring as if it has rejected my password. I select cancel allowing me to enter and again clear and reenter password and again it is rejected. I removed my account (I think) and go through the motions of reinstalling my account and get a pop-up indicating the server already exists which puzzles me. Ports, security settings, password are all correct and tested on other devices. I can even use a browser and log onto my internet service providers server and access my account and my password works but not on my Thunderbird. Should I consider uninstalling and then reinstalling my Thunderbird on my Ubuntu? I think by mistake I deleted all of my emails BUT I have selected IMAP so my emails I want are still on my service providers server.  IF I uninstall and reinstall how do I save my contact list.
