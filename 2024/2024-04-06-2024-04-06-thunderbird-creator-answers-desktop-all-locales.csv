Just now, a new screen pops up with this message:   ""an error occurred during connection to localhost"".  I have 2 email accounts that I use with T-bird.  The one is with comcast; it is the account that comes up with the error message.  The other account is with Breezeline, and it appears to be unaffected.  However, and this is the problem, I cannot send or receive email from either account.  I am going to try to send both a hard copy of the error message, and the data from the T-bird program that I am using.  Your help is appreciated.  Thanks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dziadze1

This March my computer crashed and I had to re-install the operating system and all of its programs including Thunderbird. But the backup zip file (when extracted to a folder from the zip file) is in sqllite files, not profile or ics calendar formats. Thus the backup cannot be restored. How do I get Thunderbird to accept these types of files to import the address book, calendar and message filter? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",stephenc
