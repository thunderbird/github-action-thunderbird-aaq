My Wife's computer password got corrupted and unable to get messages.  I deleted TB and deleted any reference to Thunderbird in the registry.  Turn off and restarted PC, downloaded new install and run and all the setting from before automatically were in place and still could not get pass the password issue.  My computer does not have any password.   </blockquote> <p>I find that very hard to believe.  You might not be asked for one,  but Thunderbird will have it stored from when the account was initially set up. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb</a> </p> <blockquote> My wife's PC, under setting, does not have any saved passwords or a Primary password or even the ""Use a Primary Password"" checked.  If it is checked there is nothing there.  It just will not get passed the password issue being always asked when trying to ""Get Messages"". </blockquote> <p>Being asked for a password when you ""get messages"" would indicate that there is an issue authenticating with the server.  Quite possible the issue is not even Thunderbird by some antivirus product that has been allowed to overreach. </p> <blockquote> How do you get rid of all the infor, setting, password requirements and to be able to restart with a clean Thunderbird install or get passed the password issue?  Making my brain hurt. </blockquote> <p>I am rather glad you messed up the removal as what you did was perhaps the least productive thing you could do as, if successful, you would have left nothing to work to identify what the problem is. </p><p>Who is the mail provider?

Junk is the messages Thunderbird thinks are SPAM and are managed by Thunderbird junk settings. 2. SPAM is the messages your mail provider thinks are SPAM and on the whole will ignore Thunderbird's settings. </p><p>Normally you should only have one folder which Thunderbird and you mail provider share for SPAM/Junk mail.  The simplest thing is to go into account settings and change the folder used for junk to the SPAM folder.  You will still have two folders,  but the Junk one should change it's icon to a standard folder icon and can be deleted once you decide the folder has nothing useful in it. </p><p>Then we get to the truly messy part of SPAM filtering.  You can't train your mail providers filter and what it does has nothing to do with Thunderbird.  Thunderbird filter is a learning filter.  I have not heard of a mail provider having such a thing.  They work with one size fits all.  Most have some form of whitelisting on their web site, like you have to add the senders to your online address book or the like.  Finally the truly messy part.  There are ""internet security suites"" or antivirus products that think they can help manage spam for you and they can add a third independent player in the spam filtering of your email address. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Nothing I did would fix it,  until closed Thunderbird and deleted the relevant MSF file in the profile for that folder.
