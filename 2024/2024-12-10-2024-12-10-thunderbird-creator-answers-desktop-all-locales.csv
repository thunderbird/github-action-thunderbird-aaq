This feature is incredibly useful for identifying spam and getting an overview of the content before clicking into messages. I noticed that Thunderbird doesn't offer this type of functionality. After some research, I found two outdated plugins that previously offered this capability in column view, but they no longer work. Is there a way to implement this feature in Thunderbird, or are there any plans to reintroduce it? It's a significant feature that is currently the only thing preventing me from fully switching to Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,"",andrew284

Tengo Thunderbird 115.16.3 (64-bit) para Mac. Dispongo de Mac Os High Sierra, y no voy a actualizar, porque los nuevos Os de Mac, son lentos y pesados.  El caso es que, solo Hotmail, me está dando problemas. Dice que la contraseña no es la correcta, cuando eso no es cierto. Me sucede en dos equipos distintos, con el mismo Os. Hoy, incluso, vino un cliente, que le está sucediendo en el iPhone. Me suena a algo de Microsoft, para molestar a los usuarios de Mac, pero no sabría deciros el motivo. Instalé Thunderbird, porque Mac Mail, (Que no me gusta un pelo), dejó de funcionar hace ya mucho, y por eso, os he elegido. Llevo ya un par de años, muy contento, pero ya hace unos meses, que está pasando esto. He probado las configuraciones de la info de vuestra web de ayuda, pero nada funciona. Evidentemente, algo está mal. Si nos podéis ayudar a mí, y al resto que están preguntando, pues agradecidos. Y si es culpa de Microsoft, como me imagino, comentarlo, así ya directamente borro las cuentas basura de hotmail que tengo para nada, y ya me olvido para siempre de Microsoft. Gracias!. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,es,1694094;1694173;1700870;1703280;1703383;1703471;,joaquinmjuan
