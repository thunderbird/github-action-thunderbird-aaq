This feature is incredibly useful for identifying spam and getting an overview of the content before clicking into messages. I noticed that Thunderbird doesn't offer this type of functionality. After some research, I found two outdated plugins that previously offered this capability in column view, but they no longer work. Is there a way to implement this feature in Thunderbird, or are there any plans to reintroduce it? It's a significant feature that is currently the only thing preventing me from fully switching to Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",andrew284
