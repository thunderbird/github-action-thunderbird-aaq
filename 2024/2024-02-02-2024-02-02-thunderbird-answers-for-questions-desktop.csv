This sometimes happens when the email host updates security settings. Possibly, if you share the email domain (e.g., gmail, spectrum, etc) and your server settings for incoming and outgoing, some suggestions may surface. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Otherwise, I have no suggestions. If you do have a backup, the addressbook is named abook.sqlite. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
