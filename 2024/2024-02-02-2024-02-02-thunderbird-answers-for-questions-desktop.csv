Why your drafts folder for any account would be something other than a folder names Drafts I have no idea.  But I did not set this stuff up.  You might want to check account settings (for all accounts as the drafts folder can technically be any folder in Thunderbird,  not just one in ""this"" account. </p><p>But as I said, I really am guessing as your images are hard to view or even open. Side by side is not possible at all. They are huge.  SO I have provided some generic information on the colour icons Thunderbird uses. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You do not see them in the apple or Google store,  the windows store is likewise missing them.  That leaves a very small residual market for software installs these days and an even smaller group who would be requesting such things,  generally in the Linux community and they tend to be the network administrators and server administrators that are prepared to spend time verifying what they downloaded is what they started out with. I remember updating MVS systems on Wang hardware and spending inordinate amounts of time verifying CRC checks on the update files, without ever having one fail the test and that was on 8inch floppies where data issues were relatively common. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
