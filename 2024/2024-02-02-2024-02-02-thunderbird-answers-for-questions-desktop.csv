You do not see them in the apple or Google store,  the windows store is likewise missing them.  That leaves a very small residual market for software installs these days and an even smaller group who would be requesting such things,  generally in the Linux community and they tend to be the network administrators and server administrators that are prepared to spend time verifying what they downloaded is what they started out with. I remember updating MVS systems on Wang hardware and spending inordinate amounts of time verifying CRC checks on the update files, without ever having one fail the test and that was on 8inch floppies where data issues were relatively common. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,1

We are still dealing with the rugged individuals that decided about 20 years ago that they were staying with Eudora. Now it does not work they are looking for support like as if the products are even in the life times of most folk.  They have a similar mindset to those that want to turn off update.  It is their right to do so,  and it is their right to expect someone to remember how things were done five years or 10 years ago when they finally decide they need to change.  Easier and probably more productive to get them onto another product now.   </p><p>However the process is freely available to anyone that bothers to do a google search.

My feeling is those that are asking for help are also the ones most likely to be badly affected by their failure to use current software in the future and the most dependent, or they would have just googled the answer and applied it.  Hence my reluctance to help them with that. </p><p>I spent time with a friend yesterday that had decided to upgrade is copy of a Nuance product.  Except his upgrade was for the previous version and what he had was almost 10 years old. Upshot is he now has neither the old or the upgraded software and he is looking for a refund.  I would rather see folk keep current and it avoids those sort of issues.  Only in the most extreme cases where the product simply does not function do I really support going to an older version. </p><p>Your method will work, but it is a crude hack that actually creates errors when there is actually an official and published method to disable updates that does not.

I posted this because this forum is a service to users and there are those with a legitimate need to monitor updates. I fully agree with your position on how some users go for years without updating and then ask us to do the heavy lifting to get them up to speed -- and then they complain that their old addons don't work and that it's our fault. Yes, I do agree.  </p><p>But we also see people running businesses, where there are multiple employees, each using Thunderbird. A minor hiccup of an update and do serious damage and confusion in a business office. From my own career experiences, I believe all software used in a business environment should be controlled by management-approved update policies. That is, whether it's a financial app or an inventory app or an email app, all updates should be tested offline prior to release to employees, and any changes in look-and-feel or function should be communicated prior to a rollout. My post provides the information to allow such control.  </p><p>Yep, my solution qualifies as a 'hack', but I found the official approach was not consistent, and I wanted a solution that was guaranteed to work. Mine does. Should I have left this alone? I guess we could debate this over a beer and cheeseburger: you have a technical depth I will never acquire, yet I see the pain of businesses struggling when suddenly hit by an unanticipated update.

My feelings and advice will be very different for the different protocols.  But I am assuming POP for the time being. 2. Seriously consider upgrading your operating system.  No testing is done on windows 7 as far as I know and it is so far out of support that antivirus products are starting to really cause issues.  Add to that this is the last version of Thunderbird that will support windows 7. 3.  NSTMP files and hence folders in Thunderbird are a result of failed attempts to compact the contents of the folder.  That is an essential function around keeping Thunderbird running.  What the NSTMP file is, is a copy of the folder with all the previously deleted mails removed that was destined to replace the existing folder when it is complete.  When the compact has built the new storage file it deletes the existing one and renames the nstmp one. </p><p>Now we get to where you are.  Your antivirus is probably out of control and you need an exclusion in it somewhere to stop it playing in the Thunderbird profile directories.  While it is possible to get NSTMP files simply by pulling out the power plug,  they are generally only caused by antivirus blocking the process with it's own inane meddling, resulting in a compact failure. </p><p>First,  select the folder with the missing mails and right click and select properties.  Then the repair button.  In almost all cases that will return the list of email to the folder. The generation of the index file that populates the user interface was messed up usually by a third party application and a repair rebuilds it. </p><p>Note that in most cases the NSTMP file is a complete copy of the folder at the time of compaction,  but it is not guaranteed. </p><p>See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders</a> and especially <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders-potential-complications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders-potential-complications</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have tried Windows restore routine which claims to be able to put back the IMAP directory as it was in late January, but that fails as well because as soon as Thunderbird is opened, it polls the IMAP server and then deletes  all the old messages which have just been recreated. In a nutshell, there appears to be no way any of the email can be resurrected. </p>",frankzen,false,0,0
