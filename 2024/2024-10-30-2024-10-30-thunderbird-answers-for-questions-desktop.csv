I would take the easy route and just disable autoupdate for now. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To bypass that, you would need to embed the logo into the email instead of linking to the web host. That, of course, increases the size of the message. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In the desktop version, I have configured a Directory Server (LDAP) specific to my company, which provides access to the email addresses of all employees. However, I’ve noticed that this functionality is unavailable in the mobile version, which poses a significant limitation. Without this feature, I cannot access company contacts from my phone unless they are already saved in my address book. </p><p>Could you please let me know if there’s an option to enable LDAP in the mobile app or if there are plans to include this functionality in future updates? It would be highly beneficial to have this feature available to improve work communication efficiency from mobile devices. </p>",marinita6999,false,0,0
