VISA sends a passcode to Xfinity by email.   I input this code into my logon at my bank.  Both my checking account and credit card account logins still work.  The only thing that is blocked is my logon to Thunderbird.  I am not sure why.  I don't know how to get Xfinity to send a pass code to Thunderbird.
