To verify this , check that you have two distinct SMTP server setups and the 'Description' field should be unique for each. Then, check the 'account settings' pane to verify that each is linked to the appropriate SMTP server. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You are right that without password entry on account creation, account is indeed been created. But, auto download of messages begins. </p><p>Before starting this topic, last days, I am on my testing machine (PC) with Ubuntu Thunderbird, creating a couple of profiles, and making some test with creating a gmail account on 2 of the profiles. I created this account on these two profiles by entering both username+password. So, now, with your piece of advice: -I removed gmail account from these two profiles -I created the account only on the one profile without entering password </p><p>So, after this, server settings (incoming and outgoing) are setup correctly, but unfortunately auto download begins. I think that password is somewhere stored on Thunderbird from the past days, is read from there, and download starts. </p><p>Another strange thing now is that, although auto download starts, only inbox folder is coming, and not with all messages. I go to my Gmail account via web browser, and all folders are there working correctly. I do not know why only inbox is downloaded. But this is the less important. </p><p>I have my backup on other PC, and on web browser everything is there. The problem is where password is being read from Thunderbird (if this is the problem) although I do not enter it. </p>",netad98,false,0,0

As I said above, I unsubscribed ""All Mail"". </p><p>However, I don't want to keep my emails forever in Gmail, so I periodically go there (on the website) and delete all emails from there (because they remain there even if I already moved everything from the Inbox to the Local Folders), but once they get to the Trash, Thunderbird triggers the Message Filters. </p><p>Hence I'd like to make Message Filters apply only to Inbox. </p>",nmp5,false,0,0

IMAP accounts 'own' the messages whether online or in local folders. If you want messages on PC and not online, then I suggest you make a new folder in Local Folders, then COPY desired messages there (or use filter for that), and then delete from account. That lets  you have messages locally and not in Gmail.  </p><p>Separately, filters just act on inbox, so you're okay there. If you have other online folders, you can rightclick and select properties and confirm that they are not checked when retrieving messages. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Because, Thunderbird was moving emails to Local Folders in duplicate, one from ""Inbox"", and another from ""All Mail"". And the same is happening now once it goes from ""All Mail"" to ""Trash"" (when I delete in the Gmail website, from All Mail). </p><p>&gt; If you want messages on PC and not online, then I suggest you make a new folder in Local Folders, then COPY desired messages there (or use filter for that), and then delete from account. </p><p>Not sure I fully understood this process.
