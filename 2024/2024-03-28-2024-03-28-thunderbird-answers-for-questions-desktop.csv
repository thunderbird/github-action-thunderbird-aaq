I did not install ReFwdFormatter because it appears that ReplyWithHeader does what ReFwdFormatter does plus more. </p><p>Is it expected to have to re-install Add-ons to get them to work after migration? </p><p>I still would like to know what happened to my 24 hours worth of new emails. </p><p>Thanks to anybody who can provide the answers. </p>,bkoopers,false,0,0

Although the box is there to insert it, the account will be successfully created if the server settings are correct.

As I said above, I unsubscribed ""All Mail"". </p><p>However, I don't want to keep my emails forever in Gmail, so I periodically go there (on the website) and delete all emails from there (because they remain there even if I already moved everything from the Inbox to the Local Folders), but once they get to the Trash, Thunderbird triggers the Message Filters. </p><p>Hence I'd like to make Message Filters apply only to Inbox. </p>",nmp5,false,0,0
