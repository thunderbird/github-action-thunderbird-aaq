To verify this , check that you have two distinct SMTP server setups and the 'Description' field should be unique for each. Then, check the 'account settings' pane to verify that each is linked to the appropriate SMTP server. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

IMAP accounts 'own' the messages whether online or in local folders. If you want messages on PC and not online, then I suggest you make a new folder in Local Folders, then COPY desired messages there (or use filter for that), and then delete from account. That lets  you have messages locally and not in Gmail.  </p><p>Separately, filters just act on inbox, so you're okay there.
