However, I currently can look at my bank accounts without using a Smart Phone. My cheeking account sends a passcode by a land line telephone call. On my credit card account VISA sends me a passcode by email to Comcast. Both accounts can be used without using a smart phone. Thunderbird as the right to only support smart phones but they could easily support both smart phones and landline phones.
