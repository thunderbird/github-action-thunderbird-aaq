Para probar, elimine una de las cuentas pop3 del movil y reenvie un correo a esa cuenta, que tambien tengo en la notebook y el mensaje no llega. Esto estaba funcionando. Las cuatro cuentas que tengo son de dos servidores distintos.   Pienso que tal vez se haya desconfigurado algo en Thunderbird, como por ejemplo el tema de recordar la clave de las cuentas. Quise buscar ese tema en Thunderbird y no lo pude encontrar. Entro en ajustes y no veo la forma de cambiar la clave de cuenta o hacer que el programa la recuerde.

Elimine una cuenta de cada servidor de correo y la volvi a crear. Ademas, saque de la bandeja de entrada de una de las cuentas una gran cantidad de mensajes , cerca de 16000, que estaban sin leer. Se habian descargado al crear la misma y llegaron mensajes que databan del 2020 en adelante. Cuando los elimine (en realidad los movi a otra carpeta), me ingresaron 20 adicionales . Cada vez que vaciaba la carpeta de entrada me salia un cartel que me decia que no se podia compactar porque habia otro proceso que lo impedia. Cerraba todo, volvia a ingresar y se solucionaba.  Tendra un limite la carpeta de entrada?. Lo raro es que me paso en las 4 cuentas simultaneamente , pero una sola tenia muchos mensajes. Espero que esto le sea util.

However, any labels (lists) that are created in Contacts via the browser appear in Cardbook, and any changes made to the list in Cardbook do sync with Contacts, and vice versa.  So, the trick seems to be to create the labels in the browser in Contacts, and then they can be edited in Cardbook. </p>",sfhowes,false,1,0

Didn't matter -- my  Thunderbird POP and SMTP to Yahoo mail which had worked flawlessly for years was completely broken. </p><p>I read dozens of Yahoo, Mozilla, and third-party help pages including <a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/pop-settings-sln4724.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo POP settings</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-yahoo"" rel=""nofollow"">Thunderbird and Yahoo</a>. I tried dozens of combinations of settings: SSL/TLS vs STARTTLS, Normal password, Encrypted password, Oath2, ports 995, 465, 587, and even changing to IMAP (which I hate) on 993. Nothing worked. And of course I could still log in and access <a href=""https://mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo mail</a> via Firefox. I also knew it wasn't a firewall or anti-virus problem because Thunderbird still worked doing POP/SMTP with my other, non-Yahoo, accounts. </p><p>Bottom line is that the online help/instructions were misleading. They stated things like, <em>""If you try to use Yahoo Mail in a third-party email client using less secure sign-in technology ...""</em> and <em>""Third-party email apps (that do not use our Yahoo branded sign-in page) ... you'll need to generate and use an app password.""</em> There was even one which specifically said this was only necessary if ""you don't normally use a password with Yahoo mail."" </p><p>I forgive myself for misunderstanding all of it because,  a) What's ""less secure"" about SSL/TLS/STARRTLS technology?   b) I always needed a password for Yahoo mail, and  c) Thunderbird had always worked with that one. </p><p>But either something changed on exactly the day I upgraded my Thunderbird, or the older one somehow ignored/worked around this ""app password"" requirement. Right now, with Yahoo and current Thunderbird versions it's absolutely necessary to generate an app password by logging onto your Yahoo account, navigating to Security, and clicking the ""Generate and manage app passwords"" link. Use the one it creates (not your normal one) when Thunderbird fails to connect and asks for a password, and a pre-existing POP/IMAP/SMTP configuration or a new one as per the normal setup instructions in the links above should work. </p><p>Again, I hope this saves someone the pain I went through. </p>",thanks4opensource,false,0,0

The thunderbird folder contains not only the default profile, but also the file that identifies it as the profile to use. That guarantees a successful copy if the default is used. That is also why, in copying the thunderbird profile, you must allow overwriting any existing files.  Go to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird and open profiles.ini. it is just a text file and can be accessed with Notepad. This file has the name of the profile to open and it is this file that thunderbird opens to determine the profile. Compare the name in profiles.ini to the name of the profile folder you copied in. For a default setup, they will match. You can edit the profiles.ini if the actual profile folder has a different name. If unsure, please post contents of the profiles.ini file and a screenshot of profiles folder to show name of profiles. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
