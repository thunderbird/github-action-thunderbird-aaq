Revisa sin en la configuración de la cuenta en el Thunderbird o la interfaz web de tu servicio de correo (si tiene) tiene la opción de mantener una copia de los correos en el servidor.

Para probar, elimine una de las cuentas pop3 del movil y reenvie un correo a esa cuenta, que tambien tengo en la notebook y el mensaje no llega. Esto estaba funcionando. Las cuatro cuentas que tengo son de dos servidores distintos.   Pienso que tal vez se haya desconfigurado algo en Thunderbird, como por ejemplo el tema de recordar la clave de las cuentas. Quise buscar ese tema en Thunderbird y no lo pude encontrar. Entro en ajustes y no veo la forma de cambiar la clave de cuenta o hacer que el programa la recuerde.

But this is mostly possible with the Cardbook add-on.  Google Contacts can be synced via CardDAV the same way, but you will notice that lists can't be created for that address book.  However, any labels (lists) that are created in Contacts via the browser appear in Cardbook, and any changes made to the list in Cardbook do sync with Contacts, and vice versa.  So, the trick seems to be to create the labels in the browser in Contacts, and then they can be edited in Cardbook. </p>",sfhowes,false,1,0
