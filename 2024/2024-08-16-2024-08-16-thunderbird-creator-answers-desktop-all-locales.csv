Also the DAV connection to Thunderbird works if I use my LAN IP to contact the (local) nextcloud server. </p><p>However, if I want to use the dyn-dns-domain (that works with DAVx5 on my mobile phone), I get error 401. Via e.g. Firefox I can log on to the nextcloud via the dyn-dns-domain as well without issues. Nextcloud is set up as part of a docker service behind a SWAG reverse proxy (that is bypassed when using the LAN IP approach as that goes directly to the Nextcloud docker container), but as the configuration works with the DAVx5 on my mobile phone, I am not sure how Thunderbird would try to get access any different. Is there a way in Thunderbird to see details on the exchange to the server to see where the issue comes from? That might at least provide some more information what could be the difference between DAVx5 and Thunderbird. Thanks for any hint on how I can identify the problem. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",MN
