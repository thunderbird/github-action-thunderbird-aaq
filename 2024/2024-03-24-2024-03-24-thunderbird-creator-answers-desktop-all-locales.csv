I can find it doing a search for it and I see it (and 3 others) under search and  it says it is in sent file, but actually none of the 4 emails on this search now can be found in the sent folder.  And they all did (but the one from tonight) 2 days ago. </p><p>I now wonder if other emails have been lost, and can be accessed only by doing a search.  But I need to have the emails in the serch folder as I go back to many of them a lot and all the time.  Now I will not be able to find them unless I can remember who i sent it to.  And I wonder how many more of them are lost and I just have no idea.  </p><p>Any ideas?  Has there been an update in the last week?? </p><p>What can I do to get these emails (and maybe many others) back? </p><p>And I just copied this message to save and put it in an email to myself and sent it and it is not there.  </p><p>Nancy </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",wildeyes

Átszeretném rendezni a fiókok megjelenési sorrendjét. 2. Több címzettnek szeretnék másolatot küldeni amely lehet rejtett is, de nem kívánok ehhez csoportokat létrehozni.

If I open Thunderbird on a computer that I only use every 2-3 weeks, it becomes a real test of patience. </p><p>Thunderbird updates, indexes and compresses about 50 folders in the background.  </p><p>As a result, Thunderbird is hardly usable for about 30 minutes. For example, if you want to write a new email (the most common case), the mail editor is extremely slow to use - characters entered only appear with a delay of 10-30 seconds, even though the computer is already very powerful with an SSD and a fast CPU. </p><p>Is there a configuration option to run the mailbox update with such a low priority or to assign a high priority to the Mail Editor? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",scoopex
