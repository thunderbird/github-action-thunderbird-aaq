I can find it doing a search for it and I see it (and 3 others) under search and  it says it is in sent file, but actually none of the 4 emails on this search now can be found in the sent folder.  And they all did (but the one from tonight) 2 days ago. </p><p>I now wonder if other emails have been lost, and can be accessed only by doing a search.  But I need to have the emails in the serch folder as I go back to many of them a lot and all the time.  Now I will not be able to find them unless I can remember who i sent it to.  And I wonder how many more of them are lost and I just have no idea.  </p><p>Any ideas?

For example, if you want to write a new email (the most common case), the mail editor is extremely slow to use - characters entered only appear with a delay of 10-30 seconds, even though the computer is already very powerful with an SSD and a fast CPU. </p><p>Is there a configuration option to run the mailbox update with such a low priority or to assign a high priority to the Mail Editor? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1643875;,scoopex

Visualizzo come da immagini allegate un invito a reinserire la password, e quindi un messaggio di errore che comunica l'impossibilità di raggiungere il server SMTP. Il metodo di autenticazione, le impostazioni account (sia IMAP che SMTP) sono corrette e non le ho mai cambiate. Da notare che, via browser, la posta funziona invece normalmente, così come nella versione mobile. Il problema si presenta solo lato PC con Thunderbird.

I've tried numerous times and it either doesn't show up or if it does, it won't  receive or send. I wonder if part of the problem is the settings provided by my ISP.  Thunderbird fills them in automatically, but they're not the ones my ISP wants. Both the server name and the ports are incorrect.  I try to change them manually but then the 'continue' button is greyed out and I'm stuck.  Using the ones Thunderbird wants doesn't work, I can't send or receive.  I need it to be a POP3 account, my ISP gives us very limited server space. </p><p>When I set up my initial e-mail account the automatic settings were correct to what my ISP wanted, so there wasn't a problem.
