So I started setting up filters, and now the problem is worse than before. The attached screen grab image shows an example. I've been on Bud's Art Books mailing list for about two years. When their emails starting going into my Junk folder, I set this ""Not-Junk"" filter up as shown. But now every email I get from Bud's ends up in my Junk folder. This is  happening with dozens of emails I get daily from groups and vendors that I do want to see. I've set up this same ""Not Junk"" filter for all of them, and they all continue to go to Junk. Is there something wrong with the filter settings I'm using? TIA for any help on this. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jim265
