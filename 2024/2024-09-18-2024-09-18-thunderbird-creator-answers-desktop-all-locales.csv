Messages are only deleted by the email service provider if they are deleted in Outlook. </p><p>Thunderbird is also used to access the same accounts with IMAP access to the online accounts.  All of the messages online have been downloaded by Thunderbird. </p><p>I am comparing the .pst Outlook files, and the various Thunderbird data files stored by the PC. </p><p>The Thunderbird data files are much larger than the Outlook files.  For example, the largest Outlook .pst file is 2G.  But there is a Thunderbird data file that is 8G. </p><p>Any reason or problem or cleanup suggestion regarding 20G of Outlook .pst data that appears as 30G of Thunderbird locally stored downloaded IMAP data? </p><p>John </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ffx5

If I have 20 new emails, I get 20 notification alerts and sounds.  Very annoying.  The previous version would have one notification saying I have 20 unread emails.  Much better. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",bobe624

So I started setting up filters, and now the problem is worse than before. The attached screen grab image shows an example. I've been on Bud's Art Books mailing list for about two years. When their emails starting going into my Junk folder, I set this ""Not-Junk"" filter up as shown. But now every email I get from Bud's ends up in my Junk folder. This is  happening with dozens of emails I get daily from groups and vendors that I do want to see. I've set up this same ""Not Junk"" filter for all of them, and they all continue to go to Junk. Is there something wrong with the filter settings I'm using? TIA for any help on this. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jim265
