Messages are only deleted by the email service provider if they are deleted in Outlook. </p><p>Thunderbird is also used to access the same accounts with IMAP access to the online accounts.  All of the messages online have been downloaded by Thunderbird. </p><p>I am comparing the .pst Outlook files, and the various Thunderbird data files stored by the PC. </p><p>The Thunderbird data files are much larger than the Outlook files.  For example, the largest Outlook .pst file is 2G.  But there is a Thunderbird data file that is 8G. </p><p>Any reason or problem or cleanup suggestion regarding 20G of Outlook .pst data that appears as 30G of Thunderbird locally stored downloaded IMAP data? </p><p>John </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ffx5

If I have 20 new emails, I get 20 notification alerts and sounds.  Very annoying.  The previous version would have one notification saying I have 20 unread emails.
