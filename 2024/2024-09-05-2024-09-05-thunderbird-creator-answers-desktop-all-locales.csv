I have contacted my internet provider, Telstra and they advise me it is not a problem with them as I can send emails via their Wed Mail. I have been getting a message saying to check my SMTP settings when I try to send emails via Thunderbird but I am not sure what to expect. My anti virus is with AVG. Hope you can help.

Unfortunately, I did not back up the latest Thunderbird profile, but had to use an earlier profile I had backed up. Now I can receive all emails, but cannot send any emails.  (I am able to send email through Spectrum webmail.) In Spectrum, I have a main account, and 3 subaccounts. In the Outgoing Server SMPT settings in Thunderbird, where it asks User Name, which email account do I use, the main one or one of the subaccounts? I seems the SMPT setting is for both the main and the three subaccounts, not for each separately. Also, is there something else I need to do as I didn’t back up the latest Thunderbird profile? Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jojotom748

Please delete some files and try again.,"<p>I get a message like this every time I start Thunderbird.  The topic came up last year but the conclusion was along the lines of ""...this problem will be fixed in version 128"" but it was never clear whether or not the  User followed Mozilla's support replies or what they had to do to clear the email message from Thunderbird.    .....Well I'm running version 128.1.1esr and the problem still exists. </p><p>My questions: </p><p>1.  What is Thunderbird trying to do?  Compact individual email files?  Compae from ct the whole Thunderbird Profiles folder?  </p><p>2.  Is the problem the size of the Profiles folder or the overall size of the hard drive the Profiles folder resides on?   What is the Hard/solidstate drive is the maximum? </p><p>3.

My preference would be to eliminate the duplication that takes place with the two. I understand that I can not unsubscribe from Sent Mail.

My Sent folder contains more older files which I would like to retain but do not want to ""try"" something that MIGHT eliminate them. I am on a Mac23 with Latest Sonoma.

So I had a work Gmail account on Thunderbird which I no longer use. I have deleted the account from Thunderbird, removed all related contacts in the Address Book as well as all Calendar events related to it, as well as all outbound server settings, etc. But Thunderbird still tries to sync to the account every 15 minutes.
