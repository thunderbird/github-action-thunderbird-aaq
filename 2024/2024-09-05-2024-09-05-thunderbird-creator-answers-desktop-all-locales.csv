I have contacted my internet provider, Telstra and they advise me it is not a problem with them as I can send emails via their Wed Mail. I have been getting a message saying to check my SMTP settings when I try to send emails via Thunderbird but I am not sure what to expect. My anti virus is with AVG. Hope you can help.
