I have contacted my internet provider, Telstra and they advise me it is not a problem with them as I can send emails via their Wed Mail. I have been getting a message saying to check my SMTP settings when I try to send emails via Thunderbird but I am not sure what to expect. My anti virus is with AVG. Hope you can help.

Unfortunately, I did not back up the latest Thunderbird profile, but had to use an earlier profile I had backed up. Now I can receive all emails, but cannot send any emails.  (I am able to send email through Spectrum webmail.) In Spectrum, I have a main account, and 3 subaccounts. In the Outgoing Server SMPT settings in Thunderbird, where it asks User Name, which email account do I use, the main one or one of the subaccounts? I seems the SMPT setting is for both the main and the three subaccounts, not for each separately. Also, is there something else I need to do as I didn’t back up the latest Thunderbird profile? Thanks! </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",jojotom748
