For example, am I better off having individual filters (say from several health providers) that end up saving respective messages into a 'Health' folder OR should I have 1 filter that looks for each provider in turn (OR condition aka 'Match any of...' ) then moves them to the 'Health' folder.   </p><p>Not worried about performance, but more wondering if one method is more efficient than another.   </p><p>Also, I seem to recall seeing in the filter help pages that it is preferable to have local storage for filters as opposed to having the mail server sort them out.
