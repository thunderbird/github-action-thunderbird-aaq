I have approximately 26 folders in gmail and 34 filters that sort messages from my inbox to the appropriate folder on the mail server.  I am planning on rearranging the filters and would like to know if there is a preferred way to optimize them.   For example, am I better off having individual filters (say from several health providers) that end up saving respective messages into a 'Health' folder OR should I have 1 filter that looks for each provider in turn (OR condition aka 'Match any of...' ) then moves them to the 'Health' folder.   </p><p>Not worried about performance, but more wondering if one method is more efficient than another.   </p><p>Also, I seem to recall seeing in the filter help pages that it is preferable to have local storage for filters as opposed to having the mail server sort them out.  Why is that?  </p><p><br> kind regards, Kirby </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",kirbykroon
