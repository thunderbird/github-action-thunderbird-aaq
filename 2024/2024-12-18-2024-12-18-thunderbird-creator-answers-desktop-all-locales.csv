I had to reinstall a perfectly working version due to a security upgrade/new profile at work.  </p><p>The problem is that when adding multiple email accounts, the three accounts that are using the same service provider, i.e. @xfinity.com will install and validate properly, however the account inboxes all copy the Inbox content of the primary account and won't bring up the content from the individual account. I've added the accounts the same way as always (IMAP) and all of the server settings are correct for each individual account. Any idea why they're duplicating the primary account would be very helpful. TIA!

They all failed, the attachments remained. 4) I ended up just creating a new msg, pasting the msg body into that new msg &amp; editting the pdfs using Mozilla pdf built-in editor (Note: THANKS VERY MUCH, MOZ STAFF, FOR IMPLEMENTING PDF EDITOR!!!), then re-attaching the pdfs (always for this prob, as attachment). </p> <ul><li>ideally, what I wanted to do was merely drag the attachment to the desktop, edit it, then redrag &amp; drop the editted pdf back into the t-bird attachment pane, and tbird would recognize this modified file &amp; replace the old unmodified file w/the modified one.
