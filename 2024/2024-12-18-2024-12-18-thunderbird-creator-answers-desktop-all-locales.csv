I had to reinstall a perfectly working version due to a security upgrade/new profile at work.  </p><p>The problem is that when adding multiple email accounts, the three accounts that are using the same service provider, i.e. @xfinity.com will install and validate properly, however the account inboxes all copy the Inbox content of the primary account and won't bring up the content from the individual account. I've added the accounts the same way as always (IMAP) and all of the server settings are correct for each individual account. Any idea why they're duplicating the primary account would be very helpful. TIA! (Install version 128.5.2esr (64-bit)) </p>",thunderbird;accounts;,thunderbird,accounts,en-US,"",skippyzmail

You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent-Personal Account (IMAP)."".  If I then save to the local folder, moving it from there to the IMAP Sent folder fails until I restart Thunderbird. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",pstemari

Okullarda MEB Fatih projesine bağlı internet kullanılıyor ve bu internet ağında beyaz liste mantığıyla, liste dışında bırakılanlar filtreye takılarak açılmıyor. Bilgisayara thunderbird uygulamasını yükledim. Gmail hesabımı kendi telefonumdan bağladığım internetimle açmak istediğimde hiç problemsiz ve elle yapılandırmaya bile ihtiyaç duymadan açıyor. Fakat MEB internetine bağlıyken resimdeki şekilde sunucuya bağlanamama hatası veriyor. Normalde bu maillere tarayıcıdan rahatça girebiliyorum ve filtreye takılmıyor ama uygulama üzerinden açmaya çalıştığımda filtreye takılıyor ve sunucuya bağlanamıyor. Hadi telefonla kurulumu yaptım diyelim, sonrasında mail geldiğinde kendi internetimi bağlayana kadar mailler uygulamaya düşmüyor. İkinci resimde görüldüğü üzere, sistem üzerinden linkin beyaz listeye eklenmesi için talep oluşturabiliyorum fakat uygulama hangi linkler üzerinden sunucuya bağlanmaya çalışıyor ve hangi link filtreye takılıyor bunu bilemiyorum. Eğer bana bu konuda yardımcı olabilirseniz, ben de sisteme başvuru yapabilirim. Eğer açılırsa böylece MEB'e bağlı okullardaki bilgisayarlarda da uygulama kullanılabilir olacaktır. Bu arada bilgisayarımda Pardus işletim sistemi yüklü. Belki sorulacak bir şey varsa, buna göre sorarsınız diye özellikle belirtmek istedim. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,tr,"",30agustosilkokulu
