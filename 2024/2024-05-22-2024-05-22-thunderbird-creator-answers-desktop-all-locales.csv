Compacting doesn't seem to do it - there's no ""Compact now"" button in any case. I don't know what ""when it will save over N MB in total"" means, exactly. Save compared to what? Now 50% off! </p><p>Likewise, if I have Message Synchronizing (Keep messages in all folders etc) turned off, but Disk Space - Synchronize all messages locally regardless of age is still selected, is it going to download copies anyway or no? </p><p>If it will download anyway, or if it already did download, if I change the Synchronizing setting to ""only the last 30 days"" will it remove the older local copies? When? </p><p>The only ""recover disk space"" option deletes both local copies and originals on the remote server. </p><p>There really should be a ""purge local copies"" action available in the client. It may be that it is OK to go out to the OS and remove certain files myself, but maybe it won't be in the future.
