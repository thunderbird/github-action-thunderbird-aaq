Use <a href=""https://www.icloud.com/contacts/"" rel=""nofollow"">iCloud contact</a>'s web UI to create a contact and upload a photo for them. </li><li> Get an app password for the Apple ID. </li><li> Add iCloud contact as a CardDAV address book in TB. Should use <a href=""https://contacts.icloud.com/contacts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://contacts.icloud.com/contacts/</a> as the carddav location.

The photo would not display correctly. </li></ol> <h5 id=""w_my-investigation"">My investigation</h5> <p>Apple's carddav API server returns in its vcard a HTTP URL as its PHOTO field, like: </p> <pre>PHOTO;VALUE=URI:<a href=""https://gateway.icloud.com/contacts/12345678901/ck/card/123"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gateway.icloud.com/contacts/12345678901/ck/card/123</a>  456789abcd12345678abcd1234567 </pre> <p><br> (not a real url; you can export the vcard if you have done the above reproducing steps) However, this URL cannot be directly accessed (would return 401 saying ""Missing X-APPLE-WEBAUTH-USER cookie""; see e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/MauriceConrad/iCloud-API/issues/44"" rel=""nofollow"">this github issue</a>). However, the cookie is not really needed; I can use HTTP basic auth with the same credential for the carddav server (in this case it's the apple app password, <code>yourappleid@apple.com:1234-abcd-5678-dcba</code>). </p> <h5 id=""w_potential-fix"">Potential fix</h5> <p>The <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/releases-comm-central/blob/658d2be2b789b3da8b2db7f5ac0f602b31a60613/mail/components/addrbook/content/aboutAddressBook.js#L3080C8-L3081"" rel=""nofollow"">current implementation</a> directly puts the carddav photo URI into an HTML img tag.
