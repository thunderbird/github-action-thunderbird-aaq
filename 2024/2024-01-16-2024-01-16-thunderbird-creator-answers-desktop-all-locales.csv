The problem is the Windows 10 device, as it displays emails that have not been read in all accounts. The sent folders are empty on all accounts also. </p><p>The other devices do not have this problem as they show all emails.  When a new email arrives, it is visible on all devices including Windows 10.  However, if any device reads the email, and the status changes to ""read"", then about 20 seconds the email disappears on the Windows 10 device. </p><p>Logging into the email account via Firefox Browser, and the emails are all intact. I have ensured View/Threads/All has been selected, and still the problem persists.  (I toggled this on the Win-11 machine and the display toggles the read on &amp; off). </p><p>I deleted an account, and re-added the account, and as it synchronized only the unread emails displayed. I tried Account-Settings/Synchronization &amp; Storage/Advance/Download  to force download all.  The process seemed to work, however, the results were the same, unable to see ""read"" emails. </p><p>My last resort will be to un-install Thunderbird from the Windows 10 device, and re-install, and setting up the emails again. </p><p>Any advice before re-installing would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jimwalker1960

I am using TB 115 on Windows (problem is platform independent). </p> <h5 id=""w_steps-to-reproduce"">Steps to reproduce</h5> <ol><li> Have an Apple ID. Use <a href=""https://www.icloud.com/contacts/"" rel=""nofollow"">iCloud contact</a>'s web UI to create a contact and upload a photo for them. </li><li> Get an app password for the Apple ID. </li><li> Add iCloud contact as a CardDAV address book in TB. Should use <a href=""https://contacts.icloud.com/contacts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://contacts.icloud.com/contacts/</a> as the carddav location. The actual carddav URL I got is something like <a href=""https://p123-contacts.icloud.com/12345678901/carddavhome/card/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://p123-contacts.icloud.com/12345678901/carddavhome/card/</a>. (not a real link) </li><li> Sync the address book. The photo would not display correctly. </li></ol> <h5 id=""w_my-investigation"">My investigation</h5> <p>Apple's carddav API server returns in its vcard a HTTP URL as its PHOTO field, like: </p> <pre>PHOTO;VALUE=URI:<a href=""https://gateway.icloud.com/contacts/12345678901/ck/card/123"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gateway.icloud.com/contacts/12345678901/ck/card/123</a>  456789abcd12345678abcd1234567 </pre> <p><br> (not a real url; you can export the vcard if you have done the above reproducing steps) However, this URL cannot be directly accessed (would return 401 saying ""Missing X-APPLE-WEBAUTH-USER cookie""; see e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/MauriceConrad/iCloud-API/issues/44"" rel=""nofollow"">this github issue</a>). However, the cookie is not really needed; I can use HTTP basic auth with the same credential for the carddav server (in this case it's the apple app password, <code>yourappleid@apple.com:1234-abcd-5678-dcba</code>). </p> <h5 id=""w_potential-fix"">Potential fix</h5> <p>The <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/releases-comm-central/blob/658d2be2b789b3da8b2db7f5ac0f602b31a60613/mail/components/addrbook/content/aboutAddressBook.js#L3080C8-L3081"" rel=""nofollow"">current implementation</a> directly puts the carddav photo URI into an HTML img tag. I think Thunderbird can make an AJAX request to fetch the image with the credentials and then put the result into an img tag. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1630824;1630828;,etaoin.wu
