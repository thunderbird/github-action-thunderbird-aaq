However, the cookie is not really needed; I can use HTTP basic auth with the same credential for the carddav server (in this case it's the apple app password, <code>yourappleid@apple.com:1234-abcd-5678-dcba</code>). </p> <h5 id=""w_potential-fix"">Potential fix</h5> <p>The <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/releases-comm-central/blob/658d2be2b789b3da8b2db7f5ac0f602b31a60613/mail/components/addrbook/content/aboutAddressBook.js#L3080C8-L3081"" rel=""nofollow"">current implementation</a> directly puts the carddav photo URI into an HTML img tag.
