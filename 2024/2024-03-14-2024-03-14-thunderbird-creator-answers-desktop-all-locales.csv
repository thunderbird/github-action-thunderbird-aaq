Az adatok (Név, email cím, jelszó) megadása után kiírja, hogy ""A konfiguráció megtalálható a Mozilla ISP adatbázisában"". Az elérhető konfigurációk közül az IMAP-ot választom, majd a KÉSZ gomb megnyomása és némi várakozás után hibaüzenetet kapok:  ""Nem sikerült bejelentkezni a kiszolgálóra. Valószínűleg rossz a konfiguráció, a felhasználónév vagy a jelszó."" Biztos, hogy a jelszó jó, külön ellenőriztem a belépést a Google fiókomba. Mi lehet a probléma? Nagyon köszönöm, ha valaki tud segíteni! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,hu,"",molnar.gyorgy.m

I click on a message &amp; it shows in the view pane, then I click on a different message in the inbox &amp; the previous message is still in the view pane, fully functional, scrollable, etc.  I have killed &amp; restarted Thunderbird many times this morning and these behaviors still keep occurring. Also also, why does Thunderbird hog my CPU cycles?  Sometimes, for extended periods, it will be using ~50% of my CPU when I not even working in Thunderbird, &amp; I know it's not compacting because I've told it not to. In spite of knowing about issues for a long time (some of which I, and others, have previously reported), the Thunderbird team seems incapable or unwilling to fix these problems.  What's really frustrating is that Thunderbird didn't used to have these issues, they only appeared after an ""upgrade"" which occurred about five months ago. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",geodave50

The ability to place folders and subfolders where I need them is essential for what I do. With the latest Thunderbird ""upgrade"", it was downgraded as the Manually Sort Folders app is no longer useable. Until Mozilla fixes it to where either the app can be used or Thunderbird is improved so that it will let me sort folders itself, I cannot upgrade.  Please either render the Manually Sort Folders app useable again or make Thunderbird so that folder can be sorted.

That's background, as a way of saying that I do not exactly know when my issue first occurred. It quite possibly could have occurred when I first started with Thunderbird, or some time between then and now. </p><p>Now the issue! One of my folders in the folder view, and all its 12 sub-folders, have nothing in them! One of the sub-folders on the folder view indicates there are 17 unread emails, but the folder is empty. That's the issue that I need to rectify. Is there a way to ""re-download"" the contents of a specific folder and all its sub-folders? </p><p>I have right-clicked on the primary folder and selected ""properties"" and tried to ""repair folder"", without success. The Location field on properties is: imap://pgstuder%<a href=""http://40charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">40charter.net</a>@mobile.charter.net/A%20-%20Family/Mary%20%28ID%29 </p><p>That's the only solution I have tried, or which I thought might solve the problem. The only other possible solution I thought might work was to delete the account and reload, but I did not want to go through all the hassle. Please help. </p><p>Questions I thought I might need to answer: Yes, the Charter/Spectrum email server is populated with the emails I'm searching for. So, yes, they are there. I just need to get them downloaded to Thunderbird. Second, the name of the folder is ""Mary (ID)"", without the quotes.  Could the () be causing a problem? Do I need to rename it on the server? And if so, then what's the next step? All of the sub-folders have names with no special characters. </p><p>Appreciate any help you can provide, Pete Studer pgsabfall@yahoo.com popaugen65@gmail.com </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pgsabfall
