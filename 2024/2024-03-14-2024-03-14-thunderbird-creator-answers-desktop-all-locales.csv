The account on that computer is pointing to a server that doesn't exist anymore.    I have a new Thunderbird account on the new computer with that same email address pointing to a new server.   If I use the Import/Export feature and copy over the profile and import the account to the new computer will it mess up the connection to the new server?    I just want to merge the old emails with the new ones so I don't have to look in two different computers to see my old emails.  Otherwise can I rename the account on the old computer before I copy it and import it to the new computer?   </p><p>As an alternative, can I copy over the entire old profile to the new computer and then just ""switch"" profiles when I want to look at the old emails?   If so how would I switch profiles?    </p><p>Please provide some detailed instructions on how to do this. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1642167;,junkmmc

One is for archiving emails from my energy supplier. They were recently taken over by another company, so I changed the name of the sub folder to reflect that. All seemed OK until I had to restart the computer as a result of a Windows update. Now that renamed folder has completely disappeared. I can do a search in Archives for a known email from them, and it is found, but the location just shows as the new name of the sub folder - no clue as to where that sub folder is now hiding  ... </p><p>Any thoughts how to find it and put it back where it belongs, anyone&nbsp;? </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",arfa.daily69

Any of them no matter what folder. Last time it happened I skipped an upgrade and everything worked properly but I only hope the same applies this time. I have used Thunderbird for must be over 20 years so not a newbie. Fedora 39 (64Bit) with all current updates and Thunderbird 115.3.1 (64-bit) after downgrading from 115.8.1. Years ago I contemplated writing my own email client but decided against it. Two things in programming KISS = keep it simple stupid and if it isn't broken DON'T fix it. Thunderbird for me had been rock solid for so many years that I am now very disappointed. Thanks though to all the good programmers of the past </p>,fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",mikebartnz

I had set up an openPGP key for my main address but never used it.

Stupidly with hindsight, I deleted the key.  Now I find that many but not all the messages in my saved folder won't open as TB says, correctly, that the key is not accessible.  However, I never asked TB to encrypt these messages.  I also still can't get an ""Autocrype: addr="" out of the replies using some of the OoO templates I created.  At least for me the openPGP is pretty fundamentally broken and has lost me content and time.  I like TB but this is seriously frustrating.  Perhaps this is a useful warning to others. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",cpsyctc
