Sometimes, for extended periods, it will be using ~50% of my CPU when I not even working in Thunderbird, &amp; I know it's not compacting because I've told it not to. In spite of knowing about issues for a long time (some of which I, and others, have previously reported), the Thunderbird team seems incapable or unwilling to fix these problems.

That's background, as a way of saying that I do not exactly know when my issue first occurred. It quite possibly could have occurred when I first started with Thunderbird, or some time between then and now. </p><p>Now the issue! One of my folders in the folder view, and all its 12 sub-folders, have nothing in them! One of the sub-folders on the folder view indicates there are 17 unread emails, but the folder is empty. That's the issue that I need to rectify. Is there a way to ""re-download"" the contents of a specific folder and all its sub-folders? </p><p>I have right-clicked on the primary folder and selected ""properties"" and tried to ""repair folder"", without success. The Location field on properties is: imap://pgstuder%<a href=""http://40charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">40charter.net</a>@mobile.charter.net/A%20-%20Family/Mary%20%28ID%29 </p><p>That's the only solution I have tried, or which I thought might solve the problem. The only other possible solution I thought might work was to delete the account and reload, but I did not want to go through all the hassle. Please help. </p><p>Questions I thought I might need to answer: Yes, the Charter/Spectrum email server is populated with the emails I'm searching for. So, yes, they are there. I just need to get them downloaded to Thunderbird. Second, the name of the folder is ""Mary (ID)"", without the quotes.  Could the () be causing a problem? Do I need to rename it on the server? And if so, then what's the next step? All of the sub-folders have names with no special characters. </p><p>Appreciate any help you can provide, Pete Studer </p><p>3/19/2024 Update: The Charter email server must have changed its folder naming criteria at some point during my email adventures. I simply removed the ( and ) from the folder name and after closing Thunderbird and starting again, the database populated all the folders correctly. </p><p>Problem Solved. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pgsabfall

On Jan. 29 I left the beta program after several years to return to the release version because of problems with the beta at that time. </p><p>Last year, still in TB Beta, I had switched my two email accounts from POP to IMAP. At that time I moved all my mail folders (except inbox, trash, and other system folders), and about 14 years of archives, to the Local Folders account to avoid the cost of storing them on a mail server. There were no problems. At year end I archived my 2023 emails from my folders in Local Folders to my archive in Local Folders, preserving the folder structure, and everything worked normally. </p><p>When I left TB Beta a month later I tried to replicate my folders, including the archive folder, in the new profile for TB 115. Then I manually moved folders from my TB beta profile to my new profile folder (C:/Users/billf/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/84xm6dz9.default-release/Mail/Local Folders/). The folders showed up within Thunderbird, then some of them disappeared briefly but then reappeared. A few days later about 80% of my folders, including the archive folder, vanished completely and haven't returned. I checked the file system and they were gone. </p><p>Today I tried again, restoring several .sbd folders and .msf files - most importantly the archive - from my HD backup from mid-February when everything had seemed to be working. They're still in the file system - so far - but none of these folders are now visible in TB. The account settings for Local Folders don't mention archiving at all. </p><p>I hope someone can tell me how to get my old folders and especially the archive back, and stable. (As I rebuild my folder structure in TB I'm giving the folders new names so they won't be overwritten if my folders from January come back.) </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",billfalls1
