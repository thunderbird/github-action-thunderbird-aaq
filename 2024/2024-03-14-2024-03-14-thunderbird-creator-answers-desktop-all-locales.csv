The account on that computer is pointing to a server that doesn't exist anymore.    I have a new Thunderbird account on the new computer with that same email address pointing to a new server.   If I use the Import/Export feature and copy over the profile and import the account to the new computer will it mess up the connection to the new server?    I just want to merge the old emails with the new ones so I don't have to look in two different computers to see my old emails.  Otherwise can I rename the account on the old computer before I copy it and import it to the new computer?   </p><p>As an alternative, can I copy over the entire old profile to the new computer and then just ""switch"" profiles when I want to look at the old emails?   If so how would I switch profiles?    </p><p>Please provide some detailed instructions on how to do this. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1642167;,junkmmc

One is for archiving emails from my energy supplier. They were recently taken over by another company, so I changed the name of the sub folder to reflect that. All seemed OK until I had to restart the computer as a result of a Windows update. Now that renamed folder has completely disappeared. I can do a search in Archives for a known email from them, and it is found, but the location just shows as the new name of the sub folder - no clue as to where that sub folder is now hiding  ... </p><p>Any thoughts how to find it and put it back where it belongs, anyone&nbsp;? </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",arfa.daily69
