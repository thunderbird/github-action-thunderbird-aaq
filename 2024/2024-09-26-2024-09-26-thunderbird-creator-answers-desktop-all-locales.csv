Can you tell me how either I can host my own emails or a really reasonable priced email host? I don't want to loose these emails. The ones that mostly got used by the businesses have been dissolved.

The external IMAP logins are passing. Below attached are the login reports. We also checked the IPs used to login to the account and even that is not blocked on our end. Additionally, the error message does not mention Server Error but Parameter Error, and the error looks decoded. </p><p>In this case, an offline email client app also logs data and has certain rules and parameters for configuration apart from the normal IMAP and SMTP settings, just like our password configuration (where some characters will not be compatible with one client but will be compatible with another client). </p><p>Here, there are no server errors logged, and can't see any failures, as I have shared the login logs. Also, the alert/error message is encoded, which can be only decoded by Thunderbird support. Hence, we from the server side will not be able to look at what exactly is causing this issue, until and unless this error is decoded from the Thunderbird side. </p><p>Therefore, we would suggest to contact Thunderbird.

The SENT box problem happened somewhere between the 20th and 28th August 2024 Incidentally the same problem occurs on both the JUNK and DELETED folders but not on the DRAFTS folder which works perfectly. I spent a night researching and reading up about this problem and several posts, including here, recommended ‘right click’ on the problem folder, select ‘Properties’ and click ‘Repair folder’. I tries this on my SENT folder, BIG MISTAKE, this has deleted all the email where the bodies were not displayed, i.e. all my sent email before 17/08/2024 at midnight (23:59) not even showing in the header list now – Agggggg! If you have the same problem of email bodies missing in Thunderbird then DO NOT click ‘Repair folder’! I do have a backup of the ‘profile’ folder but as Thunderbird has been so reliable the last one was a year earlier! The Inbox (which I haven’t touched yet) would have been a better choice to try to repair as I keep two copies of Thunderbird running on two separate PC’s at different addresses so both have identical INBOX, which I did in case one got stolen, broken or the hard disk crashed. Of course this does mean the SENT boxes are not identical as I predominately use the main PC to send emails (the emails I have lost). Both PC’s are very similar spec and running the same software as the spec below except the main PC is running a 32bit version of Thunderbird and the second PC is running the 64bit version of Thunderbird. The second PC has not suffered any of these Thunderbird problems and is still running Thunderbird perfectly. Because I was using both PC’s remotely using TeamViewer during August and Sept it’s only now I’m back in the UK I noticed the problem. I receive about 100 emails a day = about 35,000 a year.  Every year I make a new folder , example INBOX OLD 2023 etc to keep the INBOX with only a years worth of emails in it So I have three problems: 1. The INBOX (and JUNK and DELETED) for my main domain and INBOX and SENT on other domains not showing the bodies of the email – How to get the email to display the bodies again and 2. The SENT for my main domain, which is only now showing headers and bodies after  20 August 2024 – How to get all the email back – This is critical 3. How to get the 16 missing INBOX OLD 2008 to INBOX OLD 2023 yearly folders back – I do have most on the second PC as a last resort (but some are not complete) PC’s Spec Windows 10 64bit latest version 19045.4894 - both Thunderbird 32bit version 115.15.0 in August  both now 128.2.3esr (32bit main PC, 64bit second PC) Kaspersky latest version 21.18.5.438(a) - both The only things I can suggest are: A. There is a difference between Thunderbird running 32bit and 64bit versions. B.  Kaspersky has done something, but why on only one PC - unlikely C. I transferred about 10,000 email from INBOX to INBOX OLD 2023 around the same time, I’ve done this for years to keep the INBOX with only a years’ worth of emails in it. Never had a problem before, D. I have checked the SENT file in my profile folder with notepad and it only has the emails from August 2024 with the header X-Mozilla-Status: 0001  I can’t see any with X-Mozilla-Status: 0009 (= hidden). E. would a file / email recovery program like EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard be worth trying Your help would be very much appreciated. If you need any other data then just ask.

On the Mailfence site, there seems to be no way to find the necessary settings, and every time I try to set it up (whether automatically or manually) the Mailfence account refuses to connect. So I suspect those who say you have to pay are correct. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",stitesww

I use Thunderbird 128.2.0esr (64-bit) on Fedora and Gnome.  I use it as my mail interface and my POP server is Gmail. </p><p>Earlier this week, when I pulled up the list of emails in my inbox, I noticed that emails from GitHub were all ""From"" one apparently random person.  If I click on the email and look at the mail in the preview pane, it too has the incorrect ""From"" value. </p><p>However, if I reply to or forward the email, it will have the correct ""From"" address. </p><p>What's stranger, is I also get emails from Jira and other bots.  They two have the same issue but with another person.  For instance, all of my emails from GitHub now come from ""John Smith"".  All my Jira emails come from ""Elizabeth Doe (Jira)"".  The people they are coming from are people I receive those types of emails from, but not every single email.  I've rebooted, and still the same problem, and still the same wrong people in the From field for GitHub, Jira, and others. </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,1676993;,tsweeney1
