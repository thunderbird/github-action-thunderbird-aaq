I don't store my emails with the current host, they just play middleman, receive the emails and ship them off to my Thunderbird. I store them on my computer and my external harddrive.  Can you tell me how either I can host my own emails or a really reasonable priced email host? I don't want to loose these emails. The ones that mostly got used by the businesses have been dissolved. But the ones we are getting personal emails threw, we want to keep.  Please advise.... thank you for your time and dedication to helping.
