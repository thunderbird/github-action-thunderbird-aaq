From that point on , I have not been able to use my Thunderbird email. It asks for my password that I do not have. I have spent hours trying to reset it. I have tried a clean reinstall, but it recognizes me and asks for my password. I have my email addresses saved and would be happy to do a fresh install, but I have not been able to figure out how to do this. I am very much obliged for any help you may offer. Thanks Tom Adams , tnaa9@comcast.net    616 334 2342  , Grandville MI USA </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tnaa9

I sent an email to a friend.  My friend received this email.  When my friend replied to the email, their reply did not land in my Inbox but rather the Sent items folder.  I'm using <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>.  I've unchecked ""Save a copy in Sent Items"" as I was getting duplicates in my sent folder.  I've disabled Threaded view as I've seen that recommended as a solution. </p><p>I just tried it again and still, their replies end up in my Sent folder vs the Inbox.  Obviously this isn't normal email behavior so I'm stumped. </p><p>If I close Thunderbird and do the same thing using the Outlook web client, replies correctly land in my inbox. </p><p>What am I doing wrong? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",moelassus
