From that point on , I have not been able to use my Thunderbird email. It asks for my password that I do not have. I have spent hours trying to reset it. I have tried a clean reinstall, but it recognizes me and asks for my password. I have my email addresses saved and would be happy to do a fresh install, but I have not been able to figure out how to do this. I am very much obliged for any help you may offer. Thanks Tom Adams , [edited] @comcast.net  [removed email, phone# and location privacy info from public] </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tnaa9

Can someone help me? </p><p>Tbird has a set of preferred data attributes for IMPORT into address books.

This never works for me. I routinely see whole records with multiple ""quoted"", ""fields"" in one column but cannot find a reason why that happens. </p><p>Must I import an exact &amp; complete Tbird CSV? Must column names match exactly in name and in order? May Tbird skip blank/empty columns where my data does not include  info that Tbird wants? </p><p>After all of the above, my contact data is in numerous forms that I convert somehow that I can then obtain a CSV.
