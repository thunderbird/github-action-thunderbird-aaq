From that point on , I have not been able to use my Thunderbird email. It asks for my password that I do not have. I have spent hours trying to reset it. I have tried a clean reinstall, but it recognizes me and asks for my password. I have my email addresses saved and would be happy to do a fresh install, but I have not been able to figure out how to do this. I am very much obliged for any help you may offer. Thanks Tom Adams , tnaa9@comcast.net    616 334 2342  , Grandville MI USA </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tnaa9
