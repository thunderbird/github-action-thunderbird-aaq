From that point on , I have not been able to use my Thunderbird email. It asks for my password that I do not have. I have spent hours trying to reset it. I have tried a clean reinstall, but it recognizes me and asks for my password. I have my email addresses saved and would be happy to do a fresh install, but I have not been able to figure out how to do this. I am very much obliged for any help you may offer. Thanks Tom Adams , [edited] @comcast.net  [removed email, phone# and location privacy info from public] </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1637499;,tnaa9
