So when you gave me new settings I put them in even tho I didn't want a password - anyway I gave it the P/W and that enabled it to Send.  The strange thing is that I changed those settings you gave me on 7/1 and it still didn't work. ''''<em><strong> It's now 7/3 so why the time lapse before it decided to ask for my P/W?

That link you showed was for another person's profile. If you locate your profile at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles\&lt;your-profile-name&gt; You will see the global file. Delete it and restart thunderbird. Browsing the text file, profiles.ini in the thunderbird folder will tell you the name of the specific profile. Do post back if that works. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Now that you know where the profiles are, my approach would be to: - exit thunderbird - copy the above c:\users\smb2\appdata\roaming\thunderbird  elsewhere. That is everything you would need in case of a problem to reconfigure profile - uninstall thunderbird - install thunderbird again  - start thunderbird - if it picks the profile as desired, you're done - if it presents screen to create email account, it somehow didn't see the profile. so, </p><pre>  - exit thunderbird    - copy the backed up thunderbird folder back to where you copied if from. windows will prompt that it will replace files. that's ok </pre> <p>- now restart thunderbird and all should be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If it's a valid email password, then the account settings may be wrong. I still do not understand your specific situation. That is, since you have a password, why do you need to reset it? If you want to remove existing password, click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security and then click 'saved passwords' and then 'show passwords' - and then highlight and right-click to edit, where you can delete it, or highllight rows for the account and delete both.

Yes, there are fancy ways to make accessible from one platform, but it's messy and problem-prone. Here would be my dirt-simple approach:  - if the importexporttools addon is not installed, install on both PCs.  - on the desktop PC, highlight each folder to be saved as archive (such as the POP inbox) - then right-click and use the importexport menu to export as mbox  - repeat for all folders to be shared from the POP account  - on both PCs, in Local Folders, create a new folder for each of the folders you exported.  - now, for each saved folder, highlight one of the new local folders, right-click and select the importexport menu to import mbox and select one of the desired saved folders  - repeat for all folders - you're done. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
