I got it fixed.   2:00 am and I was writing an email not thinking about it not going, and hit SEND and a pop up asked me for a password.  We have never used a Password on outgoing mail, only incoming. So when you gave me new settings I put them in even tho I didn't want a password - anyway I gave it the P/W and that enabled it to Send.  The strange thing is that I changed those settings you gave me on 7/1 and it still didn't work. ''''<em><strong> It's now 7/3 so why the time lapse before it decided to ask for my P/W?  Is that a Spectrum problem or a TB problem?''''</strong></em> </p><p>I've got a problem now in that I can't be putting in passwords every time I send a msg but if I change the settings it could cause things to get messed up again.  I want to have NO AUTHENTICATION. </p><p>I do use a password for incoming and that's not a problem as usually it just wants it once a day and all the msgs come in at once but if it going to be asking me for a P/W each time I send a separate msg it'll be too much.

Just me and my husband here and nobody uses our computers  - but am I wrong in assuming that if I click on saving the p/w it wouldn't be asking me to put it in when I want to Send?  or do u mean it would tell me what my p/w is and then I would click on it and I wouldn't have to type it?

If it's a valid email password, then the account settings may be wrong. I still do not understand your specific situation. That is, since you have a password, why do you need to reset it? If you want to remove existing password, click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security and then click 'saved passwords' and then 'show passwords' - and then highlight and right-click to edit, where you can delete it, or highllight rows for the account and delete both. Then thunderbird will have no password and you can reset it. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Yes, there are fancy ways to make accessible from one platform, but it's messy and problem-prone. Here would be my dirt-simple approach:  - if the importexporttools addon is not installed, install on both PCs.  - on the desktop PC, highlight each folder to be saved as archive (such as the POP inbox) - then right-click and use the importexport menu to export as mbox  - repeat for all folders to be shared from the POP account  - on both PCs, in Local Folders, create a new folder for each of the folders you exported.  - now, for each saved folder, highlight one of the new local folders, right-click and select the importexport menu to import mbox and select one of the desired saved folders  - repeat for all folders - you're done. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
