My guess is you were using version 125.0 or 130.0, neither of which are accessible from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> for download. There are some software distributors, such as Majorgeeks, that offer unsupported versions. My guess is that you got the prior version from such a place. If the default updates did this, there would be tens of thousands of users experiencing it. My suggestion is to install the latest release and, if you receive any compatibility messages, to look for and delete a file called compatibilities.ini </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
