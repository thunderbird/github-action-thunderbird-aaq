Currently I have Thunderbird (TB) v102.15.1 on my Win10 desktop and TBv115 on my Win11 laptop. I upgraded from v102 on my laptop and I think that enabled the modern authentication. (I can’t really remember as I’ve tried so many things recently.) However, I don’t really like v115 at all and I believe the latest version is v128. I am loath to do anything to my main desktop so if I do anything it will have to be tried on my laptop. I have already said that I have Norton disabled mail scanning on both PCs but Norton doesn’t like it, keeps prompting me to enable it again. </p><p>So, I don’t know what to do. I am a bit worried about messing up both of my TB and Norton. Some days now I just don’t feel up to much. Gone are the days when I used to work from the C: prompt and dial-up modems!

But, many of the changes can be modified - the main change to 115* offered more options, so you could choose different visual styles.  The 'Mail Toolbox' was removed and replaced with 'Unified toolbox' which does everything the old Mail Toolbox offered and more. </p><p>Perhaps you could explain what you really do not like and I might be able to offer pointers.  </p> <hr> <p>I have Norton 360. I'm not having any issues and I'm running two versions of Thunderbird on same desktop. I have version 128.3.0  and also a beta version 132.0b1 - I help out with testing reporting bugs etc. </p><p>I have set up both versions as allowed programs in the Norton Firewall. I have set up my Thunderbird profile folder to not be scanned because regardless if Norton found any thing I would not want Norton to fix anything.  Downloaded emails get appended to a text mbox file which has same name as folder you see in Folder Pane. So basically, the 'Inbox' mbox file is just a single text document and emails get appended to it one after the other. If Norton scanned that 'Inbox' mbox file and did not like something and tried to fix it, then I stand a good chance of losing everything in my Inbox. Ant-Virus products do not understand that a file is not just one email, it may contain dozens or more of emails. Scanning of files just because they opened by the computer to append something to a file seriously slows down performance. There is no benefit. </p><p>Norton cannot scan certain things anyway: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v96137879"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v96137879</a> </li></ul> <p><em>Norton email scanning cannot scan emails for your secure (SSL) accounts before they are downloaded to your inbox.</em> </p><p>Only once it is downloaded and saved into the Inbox mbox file can i detect stuff when you open the mail. <em>If someone sends you an email with an infected attachment, the file gets downloaded to your inbox along with the email. When you try to open it, the Auto-Protect feature in Norton detects and removes the infected file.</em> </p><p>Note - removes the infected file - Attachments are part of an email and the email is one of many in a file. </p><p>The risk is really up to you.  </p><p>These days Pop accounts should also be using Connection SEcurity: SSL/TLS Do you use Pop accounts&nbsp;? If yes, then I could help check you are using to most up to date server settings. Just post the following info: </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Scroll down to 'Mail and News Accounts' </li><li> Copy all the data and paste it into this forum question. </li></ul> <p>If you also have 'Norton Safe Email' enabled then scans your incoming emails when you check them using a web browser.  That means when you use a browser to access your webmail account. Not in Thunderbird. </p><p>Norton does a grand job of ensuring things are much safer when using a browser.  This is the main reason why I use it. </p><p>That annoying pop up is not because of Thunderbird. Over the years this has been an on and off issue and not just Norton - the pop up - in your case - is from Norton. It worked before update, norton updated and now it is annoying. Hence I suggest, you uninstall it and reinstall and hopefully this time you get all the updates properly installed. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
