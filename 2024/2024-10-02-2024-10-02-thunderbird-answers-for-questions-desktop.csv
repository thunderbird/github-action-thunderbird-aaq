Per ottenere questo risultato la comunicazione tra un mittente MITT ed un destinatario DEST è mediata dal una società abilitata alla gestione della PEC rispondente a precisi requisiti tecnici [1] (GEST). Nelle intestazioni della PEC avremi quindi riferimenti a MITT, DEST e GEST.  Supponiamo che DEST, ricevuta una PEC da MITT, voglia aggiungere il mittente alla propria rubrica di Thunderbird. A volte capita che al nome di MITT non vanga associato il relativo indirizzo email ma quello dell'intermediario GEST. Il risultato è che da quel momento in poi tutte le PEC ricevute da utenti di GEST appariranno con mittente MIT, talvolta con la dicitura ""per conto di"".
