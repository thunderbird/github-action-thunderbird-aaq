Each group is separated from the others by colons (:)  so i is not valid for that either. </pre> <p>So Are you using a VPN that is doing such a good job of hiding your IP address that is is not even using a valid one.  Looking at the address a check of the first four blocks and the belongs to a router in Singapore owned by a company called Singnet Solutions Pte Ltd </p><p>The last four blocks belong t a company called Lattitude the IP address appears to be in Sydney,  but the company is in Brazil. </p><p>So are you getting these error when you are connected using a VPN?

Probably in the collected addresses when you clicked reply.  Perhaps disable both features, (capture of the address when you reply to someone and using the address book to set the display name in the message lists.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
