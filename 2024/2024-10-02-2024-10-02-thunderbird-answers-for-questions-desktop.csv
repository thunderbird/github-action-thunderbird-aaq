Each group is separated from the others by colons (:)  so i is not valid for that either. </pre> <p>So Are you using a VPN that is doing such a good job of hiding your IP address that is is not even using a valid one.  Looking at the address a check of the first four blocks and the belongs to a router in Singapore owned by a company called Singnet Solutions Pte Ltd </p><p>The last four blocks belong t a company called Lattitude the IP address appears to be in Sydney,  but the company is in Brazil. </p><p>So are you getting these error when you are connected using a VPN?
