1448625,2024-05-29 18:44:48 -0700,2024-05-29 18:44:48 -0700,TB icon in WIN 10 task bar has no blue line under it when TB is minimized.,"<p>I have many programs/apps in my Windows 10 task bar (at the bottom of the screen), and when one of those programs is minimized, the task bar icon for that program has a blue line under the icon, to show that it is still active, but not showing on screen -- that is, except for Thunderbird.  If I'm not writing a message in TB at the time I minimize it, there is no blue line under the icon.  The problem is: when I'm ready to shut down a session and I've been using Thunderbird at some point in the session and have minimized it, I can't tell from the task bar icon whether TB is active or not, without clicking on the icon.  I don't want to have to do that every time I close down the computer, and I don't want to close the session with TB still active. It seems that a simple coding addition would fix the problem, and I can't believe no one else has mentioned the problem.  This is not new with 15.1 -- it's been going on for several versions. The ONLY time the icon appears is when there is more than one page of TB open (like Main &amp; Write). </p><p>Your prompt response is appreciated. Thanks, engrollie </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rehawkpe
