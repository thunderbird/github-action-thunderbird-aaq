If I'm not writing a message in TB at the time I minimize it, there is no blue line under the icon.  The problem is: when I'm ready to shut down a session and I've been using Thunderbird at some point in the session and have minimized it, I can't tell from the task bar icon whether TB is active or not, without clicking on the icon.  I don't want to have to do that every time I close down the computer, and I don't want to close the session with TB still active. It seems that a simple coding addition would fix the problem, and I can't believe no one else has mentioned the problem.  This is not new with 15.1 -- it's been going on for several versions. The ONLY time the icon appears is when there is more than one page of TB open (like Main &amp; Write). </p><p>Your prompt response is appreciated. Thanks, engrollie </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rehawkpe
