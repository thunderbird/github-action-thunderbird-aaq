What is displayed in that column is extracted to an MSF file by completely different code than any that will be searching/ filtering the mail at the time the mail is received.  The filter uses the actual message header so there is no overlap at all.  Search, might use either data sources.  It probably also depends on which search you use as to which data is accessed.  some of the search code is as old as Thunderbird and I doubt anyone has looked at it in decades.

I must assume you are using the Ctrl+Shift+F find to do your searching as I am not aware of a customize option in the other two.   </p><p>In this context you are dealing with string data, not dates.

Thunderbird was installer as 64 bit on the new system but I discovered the problem shortly after I got the new system and reinstalled the 32 bit version.  I have no reason to change quickbooks as all the newer features don't support thunderbird or have features that I don't use or hate.  I can say the same about thunderbird as I only use it for email and ignore the rest. </p>",Multicsfan,false,0,0
