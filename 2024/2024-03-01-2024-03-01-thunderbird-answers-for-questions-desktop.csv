What is displayed in that column is extracted to an MSF file by completely different code than any that will be searching/ filtering the mail at the time the mail is received.  The filter uses the actual message header so there is no overlap at all.  Search, might use either data sources.  It probably also depends on which search you use as to which data is accessed.  some of the search code is as old as Thunderbird and I doubt anyone has looked at it in decades.  Things that work don't see much maintenance usually. </p> <blockquote> That was not the case.

This brings up a search panel and on the search criteria pull-down where there are headers like Subject/Date/To/From there is a Customize item which allows me to add additional headers. I admit that I'm not entirely sure how valid this is, because  it doesn't appear to verify that the new header is a valid Thunderbird message header. I discovered this when I initially misspelled Received as Recieved. So while you didn't seem to be aware of this Customize feature, you may very well be correct that this search on Received is not really searching on what I think it is. I just wanted to be able to construct searches that could take into account the occasion where the date on emails on my ISP's mail server is different than the ""Date"" field in Thunderbird. When I am performing housekeeping on the server to delete older emails in order to avoid me using all of the 5GB storage limit. I should explain that I tell Thunderbird to leave messages on the server until i delete them in Thunderbird. This allows me to be able to read older emails from my phone and my ISP's web server when I'm not at home. </p><p>It sounds like I may have to figure out another way to resolve these conflicts between received date/time and the traditional date/time from emails. </p>",TampaTom,false,0,0

This is the oldest search in Thunderbird which I have always accessed from the Find menu item on the menu bars Edit menu or by left clicking on the entry and using the link on the resulting account page. </p><p>But I really do not understand your comment about conflicts.  I can see the occasional message that is received and dated a minute or three apart,  but nothing significant. Although it is possible if the mail server is having issues getting mail delivered I guess.  But that is rare these days with properly configured hosted mail.  The days of an email taking days to be delivered are really over. </p><p>I am guessing you are using POP, as IMAP always leaves everything on the server. Why not just set the leave messages on the server for a time in days and save yourself a job.  If you are leaving the last 30 days for use on your mobile clients,  just set in in The account settings for at most 30 days, or even 300 days if that manages the space better. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I'm going to address 2 or 3 of your comments: </p><p>First, you are correct that the use of the Received header is not at all reliable due to the factors you mentioned. </p><p>Second, the conflicts between Received time and the time under the Date header that caused me to pursue this solution were a lot more noticeable 2-3 years ago when i began my efforts to delete older emails from the server. I was actually seeing examples from several hours to a day or more. As the emails I'm deleting now are a lot more recent the gaps are more often minutes (as you suggested). I can only guess that my ISP has made some improvements in their infrastructure. </p><p>Last but not least, I'm going to adopt your suggestion of setting a number of days to leave messages on the  server instead of my labor intensive cleanup method. I might set the number of days somewhat higher, but your point was well taken. </p><p>Thanks for your feedback. </p>",TampaTom,false,0,0

All addon extensions are created by other users like you and me and they have to maintain their own addons.  If people like an addon and use it alot then it's hoped they contribute to the maintenance of that addon as writing code etc is time consuming and requires a good deal of knowledge. So, any addon which has not been designed to work with the version you are using will get disabled.  That is expected. Sometimes, it's just a case of finding out if the author has created an updated version and installing it.  But as I  have no idea what addons you use, I cannot advise at this point. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1

When you send encrypted mail to someone you have no certificate for, one of the proton selling points. They get an email with a link to the proton web site to view the email.  Hardly something folk used to mail clients would expect.  Just like those spam filtering services (finally defunct I think) that returned an email to the sender requiring them to click a link on a web page so the mail would be delivered were not a solution to the problem. I don't see Proton as a solution either. They are needing a major shake up to fix their model to become a solution.   </p><p>Personally If I kept getting emails that did not contain the email and I was using a glorified web mail instead of my chosen mail system to read and archive,  I would be looking either for a ""fix"" for something broken,  or a new correspondent.
