Thank you for your time and attention. </blockquote> <p>Regarding the two means of accessing email, I believe you are referencing the two most common ways to access email, those being: </p><p>1. Via a website, ""webmail"", as popularized (for better and worse) by Gmail (although not the only way to access Gmail) 2. Via a dedicated email application </p><p>I agree that support staff could be inclined towards a webmail bias for the simple reason that this gives them one single point of reference to walk people through. This is unfortunate but also very understandable. However ... </p><p>The way that people access email is distinctly different from how it is managed.  </p><p>Whether an email provider presents a webmail interface for customers, allows them to access email from a dedicated email app, or both, is generally irrelevant to how the mail is managed. </p><p>In short, the interface (webmail or app) is separate from the server.  </p><p>Spectrum have documentation that details their server settings. These settings would not be published unless they were allowing people to access the mail server via a dedicated email app. So, the way you want to access your Spectrum mail on their server, via a mail app like Thunderbird, is fully supported by Spectrum. They might not promote it or support it well, but it's a legit use of their service, so you're all good. </p><p>The issues you are experiencing most likely boil down to tweaking some setting within Thunderbird. If possible, whilst I am completely empathetic that this experience is aggravating and Spectrum would ideally be much more helpful by walking you through Thunderbird set up for accessing their services, I reckon you can try to take a few deep, slower breaths and breathe a bit more easily because the problem will be sorted out soon&nbsp;:) </p>",an0n1m0us,false,0,0

As you have not installed an encryption certificate,  you can not encrypt anything,  so you are prevented for trying to by disabling the settings for that. </p><p>When it comes to encrypted incoming email,  anyone can send you mail they have encrypted.  You can not rad it unless you have a relevant decryption certificate installed,  and generally Thunderbird will handle that automatically if it gets an email from a sender including an encryption certificate prior to getting the encrypted mail. </p><p>You can not prevent folk sending stuff encrypted to you, any more than you can prevent someone sending you a parcel in the post in a locked box with no key. </p><p>As for some part of the setting appearing to be selected,  I think that is simply down to a limitation of the selectors used,  one has to be ""on"" or ""selected"" because they are a ""set"".  But it is purely a visual thing as they are disabled.  If they were made invisible you would not be asking the question.

Windows help forums via the internet have tons of complaints going back several years regarding this particular problem and it's never been fixed.

We can access /Sub1/Sub2 because it also has a dedicated folder. </p><p>When we use the ""fileinto: create"" sieve action, it only creates the single folder that we direct, not the tree. That is, the server has directory .Sub1.Sub2, not .Sub1. So while the email client displays /Sub1/Sub2 as a tree structure, there is no /Sub1 folder to contain mail items. </p><p>The ideal solution to this would be for Sieve processors to create each folder if required to lead up to the final folder. This is equivalent to ""mkdir /p /sub1/sub2"" which will create sub1 if it doesn't exist, on its way to sub2. I'll pursue that later but there can never be a guarantee that it will work for any given email account. </p><p>My solution has been to post-fix (pun intended I guess) the folders on the server side: </p><p>- Use cron to run a process every few minutes. - Loop through all email accounts on the server. - Detect the condition where a folder .A1.A2.A3.A4 exists without supporting sub-folders .A1.A2.A3. - Create the subfolder, set ownership (vmail:vmail). - Subscribe (dovecot) the user account to the new folder. - On completion, re-index (dovecot) the entire account so that all mailboxes are available to client apps. </p><p>I have this JavaScript code running on my primary server now. There are no more errors related to missing folders, and now Thunderbird actually completes all scan operations - it doesn't perpetually show the progress icon for server activity. </p><p>I will post the code to my GitHub repo soon and publish the link here. </p><p>For indexing, I'd like to use the '-q' option on the dovecot index command so that the operation is queued rather than done immediately, but it doesn't look like my system is running a queue process to index anyway, so this seems to fix that problem too. If anyone can help with setting that up, I'd appreciate it. </p><p>Does anyone have any more insight on this so that I can get it into the code before publication? Or perhaps a more elegant solution that doesn't rely on cron on the server? </p>",Starbuck,false,0,0
