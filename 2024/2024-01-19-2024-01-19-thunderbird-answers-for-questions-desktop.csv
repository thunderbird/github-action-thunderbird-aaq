I think you are complaining that there things are not on the end of your message header.  <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-01-18-21-21-49-d0f71a.png""> As you can see I have them on Windows 11 using Thunderbird 15.6.1 and I have not heard of anyone else saying they are missing, so that leaves my wondering what I am missing in this request. </p><p>This customize palette that you say is hidden.  What is it?  Are you talking about customizing the unified toolbar (that is the only thing I am aware of you can drag icons and customize.)  Or is that some red herring you are chasing because something you think should be on the toolbar is missing and you can not figure out how to put it back. </p><p>Do these items come back in Troubleshooting mode?  Continue,  not reset anything! </p><p>Perhaps you could invest in explaining exactly what the issues have been that lead to you resetting the toolbars.  I have been around this forum for a longish while and I have never heard of a rest of toolbar not resetting them to factory default as expected, but I have not really heard of folk using the feature unless they already had an issue they were trying to fix.  I would be looking for a bad add-on or a third party software package that is interfering to cause it.  But the result from troubleshooting mode will make a good start. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

I clearly do not understand the language being spoken. </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately you are equating a menuitem tag, wrapping a label tag with a value attribute of `Mark as unread`, with a toolbarbutton tag wrapping a label tag with a value attribute of `Mark as unread`. </p><p>So, yes, you are correct in that you do not seem to understand the interface language Thunderbird is written in, which is seemingly a hybrid of HTML and XUL, perhaps migrating towards mostly HTML from an all XUL history. </p><p>However, thanks for trying to help! Much appreciated. </p><p>If you are interested in the underlying languages used to create Thunderbird, a great tool for poking around is the Developer Toolbox available under the Tools, Developer Tools menuitem (tag, wrapping a label tag with a value attribute of `Developer Toolbox`). Be aware that it's quite the 'meta' perspective at first so may take some time to ingest conceptually. After that, though, it could really help you help others more effectively which would be great for everyone&nbsp;:) </p>",an0n1m0us,false,0,0
