A menu item is not the same as a toolbar button. </p><p>Visually; 'underneath the hood'; they are just not the same thing.

Thank you for your time and attention. </blockquote> <p>Regarding the two means of accessing email, I believe you are referencing the two most common ways to access email, those being: </p><p>1. Via a website, ""webmail"", as popularized (for better and worse) by Gmail (although not the only way to access Gmail) 2. Via a dedicated email application </p><p>I agree that support staff could be inclined towards a webmail bias for the simple reason that this gives them one single point of reference to walk people through. This is unfortunate but also very understandable. However ... </p><p>The way that people access email is distinctly different from how it is managed.  </p><p>Whether an email provider presents a webmail interface for customers, allows them to access email from a dedicated email app, or both, is generally irrelevant to how the mail is managed. </p><p>In short, the interface (webmail or app) is separate from the server.  </p><p>Spectrum have documentation that details their server settings. These settings would not be published unless they were allowing people to access the mail server via a dedicated email app. So, the way you want to access your Spectrum mail on their server, via a mail app like Thunderbird, is fully supported by Spectrum. They might not promote it or support it well, but it's a legit use of their service, so you're all good. </p><p>The issues you are experiencing most likely boil down to tweaking some setting within Thunderbird. If possible, whilst I am completely empathetic that this experience is aggravating and Spectrum would ideally be much more helpful by walking you through Thunderbird set up for accessing their services, I reckon you can try to take a few deep, slower breaths and breathe a bit more easily because the problem will be sorted out soon&nbsp;:) </p>",an0n1m0us,false,0,0

As you have not installed an encryption certificate,  you can not encrypt anything,  so you are prevented for trying to by disabling the settings for that. </p><p>When it comes to encrypted incoming email,  anyone can send you mail they have encrypted.  You can not rad it unless you have a relevant decryption certificate installed,  and generally Thunderbird will handle that automatically if it gets an email from a sender including an encryption certificate prior to getting the encrypted mail. </p><p>You can not prevent folk sending stuff encrypted to you, any more than you can prevent someone sending you a parcel in the post in a locked box with no key. </p><p>As for some part of the setting appearing to be selected,  I think that is simply down to a limitation of the selectors used,  one has to be ""on"" or ""selected"" because they are a ""set"".  But it is purely a visual thing as they are disabled.  If they were made invisible you would not be asking the question.

That is, online Gmail keeps just one copy of each message, using labels to provide multiple indexes to the same message. BUT, to replicate that, Thunderbird creates a separate copy of each message to provide the same appearance as Gmail provides. So, for example, every message in your inbox and sent folders are also in the Allmail folder.
