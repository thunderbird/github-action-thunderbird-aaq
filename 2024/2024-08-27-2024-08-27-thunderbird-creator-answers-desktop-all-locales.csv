From the beginning, Thunderbird hangs every couple of minutes, whether I'm navigating or composing a reply.

It did this when I was in Troubleshoot mode. </p><p>I've seen suggestions to see what happens in Safe Mode.

I don't know what I did but I can no longer see my messages in my inbox and that includes any new messages that come through. I can see the number count of messages that are in there and I can see a number count of the new messages that have come in but no message. No new messages or any of my previous ones. If I do a search on any words in the search box, any messages that match that do come up and I can see them but I don't know what to search for new messages that will come in because I don't know who they may have come from. I do have another email account and that one is working fine. I'm wondering if the messages are sitting invisible somewhere and i have just pushed something I shouldn't have on that account. Also when I click on folders on the affected account like 'sent' etc, the messages in these folders so up absolutely fine. Any ideas?
