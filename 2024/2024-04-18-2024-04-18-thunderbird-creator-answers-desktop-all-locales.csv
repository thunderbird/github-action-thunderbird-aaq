I blame that on the thousands upon thousands of emails that my hotmail and gmail each hold. I don't necessarily want to delete these emails, but I have seldom a reason to have any email older than 2 months in my thunderbird client slowing and crashing the program whenever I want to combine inboxes. </p><p>To this end I went to ""Synchronization &amp; Storage"" and told it to ""Synchronize the most recent 2 months"" but it didn't delete the huge cluster of older emails. The next option is to tell TB to delete these emails in the same menu but as I understand it that would also delete them in the server, which I don't want to do for posteriority. </p><p>What do I do? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1647967;,omega.19994
