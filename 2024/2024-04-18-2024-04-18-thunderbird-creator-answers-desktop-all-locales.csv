Next, I tried to pretend that I'm going to login as a user I've created ON GOOGLE so thunderbird can recognize it as Gmail Account, then logged in with my school credential, and it failed.

And, it seems to be very specific. When i receive e-mails from (especially) 2 friends who both use AOL as their e-mail client, when I receive them, the imaged files (or memes) are always 'converted into attachments, and what shows in the Body Text of the e-mails is empty boxes.  Yet, when I get e-mails from others, including from commercial sources, if there are images within the Body Text, they are present there. This IS very annoying because many times the e-mails I get from these two friends are technical e-mails, with clarifying images as part of the Body Text. When I have mentioned this to them, their responses are that n one else complains, only me, and so the problem MUST BE at my end, but that doesn't make sense, since when I receive e-mails from others (Gmail, etal.) any included images are fully where they belong. ++++++++++++++++++++ Secondly, WHY is it that when there are threaded e-mails in the Sent folder, the ARROW to expand the thread appears at the left side, but in the Delete folder the ARROW appears between the title of the e-mail &amp; the next column?  This IS very annoying!!!! Also, when I'm in the DELETE folder, sometimes only two options appear at the right side: Archive Delete, BUT in other incidences, there's a plethora of alternative options, and the Delete option is positioned in a different place.  More often than not, I click on the option to send it e-mail to the Archive folder, when I really wanted to Delete it permanently.  Another major annoyance!!!!
