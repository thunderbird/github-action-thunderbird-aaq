I blame that on the thousands upon thousands of emails that my hotmail and gmail each hold. I don't necessarily want to delete these emails, but I have seldom a reason to have any email older than 2 months in my thunderbird client slowing and crashing the program whenever I want to combine inboxes. </p><p>To this end I went to ""Synchronization &amp; Storage"" and told it to ""Synchronize the most recent 2 months"" but it didn't delete the huge cluster of older emails. The next option is to tell TB to delete these emails in the same menu but as I understand it that would also delete them in the server, which I don't want to do for posteriority. </p><p>What do I do? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1647967;,omega.19994

It has a unique domain name and Thunderbird does not recognize it as a Gmail account, but I'm sure it is. Here's what I did to solve the problem (yet no luck) First, I tried to setup with manual IMAP configuraiton by following the steps on <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78892?hl=en#zippy=%2Cthunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">LifeWire Article</a>  and Google Support, but it says that credentials that I'm using is wrong. It did detect the Gmail mail server though. Next, I tried to pretend that I'm going to login as a user I've created ON GOOGLE so thunderbird can recognize it as Gmail Account, then logged in with my school credential, and it failed. Probably because I've entered fake Gmail address in the form. It's very inconvenient that I cannot setup mail accounts with OAuth authentication method manually. </p><p>Do you have a walkaround for this? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",iaco.erpt
