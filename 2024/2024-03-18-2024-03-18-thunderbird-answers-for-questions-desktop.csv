It seems the new settings work with Outlook but not Thunderbird? And the old settings still work on other PCs? Please post full specs on the old settings and also the new settings (that aren't working in thunderbird but work in Outlook). Thank you. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0

Quite unfortunately, there is some minor detail that I am missing, since I had followed your instruction with no success.  </p><p>My cat passed away many years ago so I have no issue with a feline obstructing my actions. I know what that means. I miss a cat so much, but my family members suffer from allergy. It's either a cat or them. I've made the worst choice, I know. </p><p>Put up with me while I try to explain myself. </p><p>Old PC; the folder that contains the ""Mail"" folder is ""yze55dbd.default"" and has a different name from the one on the New PC. Hope this does not effect the whole thing. </p><p>When I open the mail folder I find other folders: </p><p>""Local Folders"" ""<a href=""http://pop3s.aruba-2.it"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3s.aruba-2.it</a>"" ""<a href=""http://pop3s.aruba.it"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3s.aruba.it</a>"" ""<a href=""http://pop3s.aruba-1.it"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3s.aruba-1.it</a>"" </p><p>The aruba thinghy it's because I have three accounts so it make sense. Onto the USB I copy the three aruba folders. </p><p>On my new PC I reach for the right folder place and I paste the three above mentioned folders on the ""Local Folders"" folder.  </p><p>When I open Thunderbird, I find the three folders and they have what I presume sub-folders like archive, trash, sent. But there is no trace of email in any of them. Maybe the poor result and the lack of a muffin at that point makes me somewhere between miffed and peeved but can't do anything. Been doing this a few times to no avail.  </p><p>Thank you for your help, if you think you can add some effort with this sad, sad situation, that is getting more and more absurd, thank you in advance. </p><p>Stefano </p>",stme177,false,0,0

If old PC is still available, I suggest starting TB to verify the content and then doing another copy of the folders, being sure to do so ONLY when Thunderbird is not running. If your real intent was to copy the entire profile, then that's a different dance. Let me know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Not unexpected as it should contain many email messages going back many years; I have had email addresses since the 1990s and have kept a vast number of these. </p><p>However the largest folder is ""Local Folders - Copy.sbd"" When I open it I see all my Local folders although if I click on the folder it shows empty. But following the folders are many files, often with an msf extension, which appears to be the actual messsages. I checked by looking at one folder then adding a new email to it; the new email now appears in the file </p><p>I will now run a backup of my D: drive with this new folder. </p>",athegn,false,0,0

But I do suggest you peruse the profile in File Explorer to see if there are any ""xxx-1"" files or any NSTMP files. That is, a compaction or update may have caused a process to not complete properly, leaving detritus in the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You copied just the profiles folder which, from your post has many inactive profiles, so the challenge is in identifying which was the one being used. The other challenge is that, if the folder was copied while Thunderbird was running, the active profile may be corrupt. First, I suggest reviewing the profiles folder on the external media that was copied to verify that the missing folders are actually there. Second, if the original PC is still available, I would browse the ...appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.ini file to see which was the active profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
