Quite unfortunately, there is some minor detail that I am missing, since I had followed your instruction with no success.  </p><p>My cat passed away many years ago so I have no issue with a feline obstructing my actions. I know what that means. I miss a cat so much, but my family members suffer from allergy. It's either a cat or them. I've made the worst choice, I know. </p><p>Put up with me while I try to explain myself. </p><p>Old PC; the folder that contains the ""Mail"" folder is ""yze55dbd.default"" and has a different name from the one on the New PC. Hope this does not effect the whole thing. </p><p>When I open the mail folder I find other folders: </p><p>""Local Folders"" ""<a href=""http://pop3s.aruba-2.it"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3s.aruba-2.it</a>"" ""<a href=""http://pop3s.aruba.it"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3s.aruba.it</a>"" ""<a href=""http://pop3s.aruba-1.it"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3s.aruba-1.it</a>"" </p><p>The aruba thinghy it's because I have three accounts so it make sense. Onto the USB I copy the three aruba folders. </p><p>On my new PC I reach for the right folder place and I paste the three above mentioned folders on the ""Local Folders"" folder.  </p><p>When I open Thunderbird, I find the three folders and they have what I presume sub-folders like archive, trash, sent. But there is no trace of email in any of them. Maybe the poor result and the lack of a muffin at that point makes me somewhere between miffed and peeved but can't do anything. Been doing this a few times to no avail.  </p><p>Thank you for your help, if you think you can add some effort with this sad, sad situation, that is getting more and more absurd, thank you in advance. </p><p>Stefano </p>",stme177,false,0,0

If old PC is still available, I suggest starting TB to verify the content and then doing another copy of the folders, being sure to do so ONLY when Thunderbird is not running.

This time instead a ""compression"" fried one of my 2024 folder and I am trying to copy at least a part of some 200 messages from a backup laptop to the main where the cooking happened. And yes, I believe I did what I was told to do, and the folders once ""pasted"" from the backup to the main are where I believe they are supposed to be. Only,  when I open the folders, they're empty. I presume the ""copy"" is fine because the size of all the files are intact, also the ""paste"" seems to be OK since the size of the files are the same. So apparently no losses during the transportation. But Thunderbird stubbornly refuses to recognize the incoming messages and I can't see them, they're kind of aliens to my main laptop. There must be a detail I forget, some key or index or flag I should modify, change, reverse, adapt, line up. Maybe the profile is involved, the two profiles from both laptops have different names, maybe I should do something. I'll begin with having a beer.

Although it may do nothing, try this:  -install the import-export addon if not already done - highlight Local Folders and right click and select the import-export addon. Click the import mbox option and select one of the folder files, such as inbox (NOT inbox.msf, just inbox) and see how it goes. I did testing on it and it worked fine.

Although it may be TB that's having more issues.    </p><p>I had no telecommunications service of any kind for around 3 weeks after an ice storm in February, while the electrical power in my neighborhood was restored after almost 4 days.     I was house &amp; petting sitting in a  less hard hit &amp; larger town when the ice storm arrived so I can't be sure of the date my landline, wifi et al stopped working, although I'm sure neither was functional when I was able to get to my home &amp; clear out both freezers of any animal protein.    That &amp; some family issues are why it's taken me so long to respond re: your suggestion.    </p><p>I've spent time moving or deleting emails from my inbox, 100+, it's made no difference re: TB automatically placing my view at the end of emails in my inbox, i.e. where new emails are, which TB used to do. </p>",azure,false,0,0
