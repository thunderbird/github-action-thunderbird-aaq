I upgraded in response to a message from Mozilla. It did not involve separate PCs. I did not mention that I am using Windows 10. When I loaded the new version of Tbird, there were no messages in the Inbox i.e. the messages that I had read but not deleted. Also thee was no Address Book. However, there was a message from Mozilla to run a separate program to transfer the data from the old version. I eventually found ""File&gt;Get New Messages&gt;for all accounts"". I believe this should have been on display after I did the upgrade. I had to click on the 3 horizontal bar image on the top right of the screen which brought up a drop down menu, then click ""View"" then ""Toolbars"" then ""Menu bar"". What a convoluted way of getting a menu on display. This fixed my main concern.  All I need now is how to delete the duplicate account for my primary email address.
