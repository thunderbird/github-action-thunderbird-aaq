I upgraded in response to a message from Mozilla. It did not involve separate PCs. I did not mention that I am using Windows 10. When I loaded the new version of Tbird, there were no messages in the Inbox i.e. the messages that I had read but not deleted. Also thee was no Address Book. However, there was a message from Mozilla to run a separate program to transfer the data from the old version. I eventually found ""File&gt;Get New Messages&gt;for all accounts"". I believe this should have been on display after I did the upgrade. I had to click on the 3 horizontal bar image on the top right of the screen which brought up a drop down menu, then click ""View"" then ""Toolbars"" then ""Menu bar"". What a convoluted way of getting a menu on display. This fixed my main concern.  All I need now is how to delete the duplicate account for my primary email address. Currently, the emails are downloading into both accounts. Roger </p>",rclloyd,false,0,0

I have to admit much of the technical detail in Bugzilla is beyond me. </p><p>In the article I quoted I did see your contributions. I noted you said there were only <em>two performance bug reports {URL} that mention Sonoma, and neither are solid Sonoma issues in my mind</em>. </p><p>Not everyone has the inclination or ability to report issues and I wouldn't want the limited number of reports (even with mine now added) to be interpreted as the issue is not ""solid"".  I mean, I can replicate this every time I start TB (video available if needed).  So the issue is a fact, and it would be nice if it were to be investigated and addressed. I'll provide any details I can to assist the good folks with the skills and knowledge who make TB happen. </p><p>I do see you've asked in the referenced discussion and Bugzilla 1831673 whether this issue happens or is gone in Sequoia. Thanks for doing that. </p><p>Clearly a major advantage of TB on the Mac is the ability to utilize the macOS Address Book (Contacts). It's not really a viable ""workaround"" to simply forego that utility. It would be great if this issue were resolved on Senoma. I am not ready to upgrade the macOS  to Sequoia, but it would be nice to know if the issue is resolved or persists with Sequoia. </p><p>(The post you ask that I am referring to is my original post in this thread it is the ""PS"" in my reply to the original question. I put the PS in my now useless reply, before I realized I could edit the original (which is the PS) - but I couldn't delete the reply. Sorry about causing confusion.) </p><p>Many thanks to you and all TB contributors and developers&nbsp;!!! </p>",kensolobrown,false,0,0

When finished, old file is deleted (eg: Inbox) and new file takes the name of deleted file eg: 'Inbox'  and the 'Inbox.msf' file is deleted and recreated based on the updated Inbox mbox file. </p><p>You could switch off the auto compacting. Then manually compact any folders from which you either delete or move emails eg: Inbox, Drafts, and Junk/Spam tend to be the most frequently used folders that come into that category. If using Imap then Inbox can be set up to expunge emails on Exit of Thunderbird - Account SEttings &gt; Server settings under 'Message Storage' </p><p>OR switch on auto compacting but force it to ask you first which means you could delay the action whilst you complete a task etc. </p><p>Advise - never allow any single mbox text file to be larger than a suitable size which a simple text editor program could open. </p><p>Advise - do not click on folders and view emails ect when compacting as it may interupt the process.

Never exit Thunderbird. </p><p>Personally, I prefer to have compacting set to tell me when it's required but I have control over when to use it. Then  I go into Offline mode to stop incoming traffic, I set up to do compacting and walk away and make a cuppa.
