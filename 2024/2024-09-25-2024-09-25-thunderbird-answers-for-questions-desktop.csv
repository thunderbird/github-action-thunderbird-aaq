I upgraded in response to a message from Mozilla. It did not involve separate PCs. I did not mention that I am using Windows 10. When I loaded the new version of Tbird, there were no messages in the Inbox i.e. the messages that I had read but not deleted. Also thee was no Address Book. However, there was a message from Mozilla to run a separate program to transfer the data from the old version. I eventually found ""File&gt;Get New Messages&gt;for all accounts"". I believe this should have been on display after I did the upgrade. I had to click on the 3 horizontal bar image on the top right of the screen which brought up a drop down menu, then click ""View"" then ""Toolbars"" then ""Menu bar"". What a convoluted way of getting a menu on display. This fixed my main concern.  All I need now is how to delete the duplicate account for my primary email address.

I have to admit much of the technical detail in Bugzilla is beyond me. </p><p>In the article I quoted I did see your contributions. I noted you said there were only <em>two performance bug reports {URL} that mention Sonoma, and neither are solid Sonoma issues in my mind</em>. </p><p>Not everyone has the inclination or ability to report issues and I wouldn't want the limited number of reports (even with mine now added) to be interpreted as the issue is not ""solid"".  I mean, I can replicate this every time I start TB (video available if needed).  So the issue is a fact, and it would be nice if it were to be investigated and addressed. I'll provide any details I can to assist the good folks with the skills and knowledge who make TB happen. </p><p>I do see you've asked in the referenced discussion and Bugzilla 1831673 whether this issue happens or is gone in Sequoia. Thanks for doing that. </p><p>Clearly a major advantage of TB on the Mac is the ability to utilize the macOS Address Book (Contacts). It's not really a viable ""workaround"" to simply forego that utility. It would be great if this issue were resolved on Senoma. I am not ready to upgrade the macOS  to Sequoia, but it would be nice to know if the issue is resolved or persists with Sequoia. </p><p>(The post you ask that I am referring to is my original post in this thread it is the ""PS"" in my reply to the original question. I put the PS in my now useless reply, before I realized I could edit the original (which is the PS) - but I couldn't delete the reply. Sorry about causing confusion.) </p><p>Many thanks to you and all TB contributors and developers&nbsp;!!! </p>",kensolobrown,false,1,0

I've come across various issues when profile or parts thereof are on network drive.  </p><p>If file is on network /cloud then that involves a more complex operation as file must be accessed/downloaded first. </p><p>Compacting means opening original file, creating a new file, reading original file, copying each email into the new file providing it does not have any 'marked as deleted' markers - those emails are ignored. When finished, old file is deleted (eg: Inbox) and new file takes the name of deleted file eg: 'Inbox'  and the 'Inbox.msf' file is deleted and recreated based on the updated Inbox mbox file. </p><p>You could switch off the auto compacting. Then manually compact any folders from which you either delete or move emails eg: Inbox, Drafts, and Junk/Spam tend to be the most frequently used folders that come into that category. If using Imap then Inbox can be set up to expunge emails on Exit of Thunderbird - Account SEttings &gt; Server settings under 'Message Storage' </p><p>OR switch on auto compacting but force it to ask you first which means you could delay the action whilst you complete a task etc. </p><p>Advise - never allow any single mbox text file to be larger than a suitable size which a simple text editor program could open. </p><p>Advise - do not click on folders and view emails ect when compacting as it may interupt the process. Trying to access a file when it's being compacted is no adviseable. Never exit Thunderbird. </p><p>Personally, I prefer to have compacting set to tell me when it's required but I have control over when to use it. Then  I go into Offline mode to stop incoming traffic, I set up to do compacting and walk away and make a cuppa.  By the time I get back, all is done and I go back into online mode. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Not been too good of late. </p><p>Anyway, let me try and explain a little better. </p><p>I have a filter on my server, which is hosted by a US company, and the filter works great for everybody except for Thunderbird. </p><p>What the filter does is, if an email address is used which begins with a certain phrase, this email is forwarded to a parent email address of those email addresses. I hope you're with me so far. </p><p>I then, in turn, receive these emails through my email client, Thunderbird, using the parent email address, which come through correctly, ie the from email address shows as the original sender and the to email address shows as the wild card email address that they sent the email to. The received email shows me who the email was originally from, then original sender, and who it's to, which is the email address they original sender sent it to. Note: this is the email address of the wildcard email address and not the parent email address. I might be losing you now. </p><p>When using my email client, Thunderbird, if I click reply it wants to reply to the parent email address of the wildcard email address that the original sender sent the email to, and not to the original sender, as it should be. Likewise, the from field is filled with the original senders email address and not the parent email address as it should be. I know I've lost you now because I've lost myself. </p><p>In my email client, namely Thunderbird, what it should be showing is in the to field, the original sender and the from field, the final recipient i.e the parent email account. </p><p>I hope I've explained it in a way that's more understandable although because it's such a tricky thing to explain, for me anyway, I will read it through again now and hopefully it means what I mean it to mean. And if you followed all of that, you're a better man than I am. </p><p>After reading through several times and making numerous alterations/corrections, i will now send and keep my fingers crossed 🤞.  </p><p><strong>Chris</strong> </p><p><em>Please excuse misspellings and anything that may not make sense or cause offence as the medication I take can have an adverse effect on my mind.</em> </p>",adelphiaUK,false,0,0
