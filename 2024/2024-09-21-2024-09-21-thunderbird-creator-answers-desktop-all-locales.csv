Problem began two weeks ago. At random, my incoming mail is replaced with a formatting style message - reads like garbage. The only consistent feature seems to be a reference to a website called ""futurelearn"", which was associated with Open University short courses. Sometimes, I can see the email when I first open it, but next time I click on it, it is replaced with this garbage script. From the look of it, it is the same script every time. I have decent AV installed and I have run scans, but cannot find any problems in the computer. If I contact the senders and ask for a resend, the message comes through in a readable form, so it cannot be anything connected to them, or to my TT account. It must be something to do with the Thunderbird on my machine.  Note.
