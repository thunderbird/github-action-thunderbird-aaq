What you described usually happens when the copy happens prior to the install, or where the profile was already compromised prior to the copy.

I didn't even run it, when I copied the files. I was actually pretty surprised when I was invited by the new configuration tab. </p> <blockquote>I infer that you are copying from a windows pc to a windows pc, so the profiles.ini file in the thunderbird profile is there in the folder being copied, as that is what thunderbird reads to find the profile.

And I know that copying the data requires either to copy the file itself, or to edit it, so TB will look for the profile name as the folder's name indicates.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the copying didn't work. That's when I created a new profile and I tried to edit, only to discover that the new profile's folder didn't even appear <em><strong>physically</strong></em> in AppData\Roaming location (!!!)

What stops me is that I've been actually doing this recently, like 2 months ago, for different reason, and I really, really don't want to repeat it now. </p>",amon.re89,false,0,0
