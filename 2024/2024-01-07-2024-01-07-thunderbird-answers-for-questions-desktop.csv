Likely because all the eMails are from travel companies/airline and so the Senders aren't in my address book?  And as the eMails aren't visible, I can't add them to my Mozilla address book. I should add... in the screenshot I attached at the start of this thread, there was a number count for eMails held within a folder, but no eMails visible on the screen in the folder. But now, there is no number count for eMails within a folder. Now, the eMails seem to have totally disappeared from Thunderbird. I'm very grateful for your continued help though. Thank you very much.

I've created a new folder with a new title, plus 3 new sub-folders.  Again, on my iPad, I've moved the eMails that are not visible on my PC to the relevant new sub-folders on my iPad. Having established on my iPad that the messages have moved successfully, I opened Thunderbird on my PC, and happily the 'missing' eMails have appeared in the newly created folder/sub-folders in Thunderbird on my PC.  I obviously don't know why the eMails were 'missing' from the original folders. And it concerns me that there may be other eMails that I don't yet know are 'missing', that I wont ever be able to 'see/find' on my PC. But for now, I've found a work-around, a fix. Hurray!

The video was  created with table view for the message list pane.  </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,0,1
