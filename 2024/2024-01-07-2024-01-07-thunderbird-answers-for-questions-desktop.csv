You do not want one of the new accounts Thunderbird can offer you via mailfence.   You do not want a domain of your choosing, subject to availability from gandi.  This provider does not even offer gandi email addresses. So you have already exhausted the options of offer. </p><p>So I must assume you want something free that you are pointed to because you dislike search engines, otherwise you would already have explored the dozen or so free options google offers when queried. </p><p>Perhaps try <a href=""http://GMX.com"" rel=""nofollow"">GMX.com</a>  That is simple. OR even <a href=""http://email.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">email.fr</a> or <a href=""http://mail.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.fr</a> or <a href=""http://mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.com</a> also simple.  Then there is <a href=""http://AOL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">AOL.com</a>  another quite simple and well known provider.  I am sure there are others,  but a t-bird. anything address is not something that Thunderbird provides </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

What you described usually happens when the copy happens prior to the install, or where the profile was already compromised prior to the copy. I infer that you are copying from a windows pc to a windows pc, so the profiles.ini file in the thunderbird profile is there in the folder being copied, as that is what thunderbird reads to find the profile. That is, the thunderbird profile being copied must contain the profiles.ini file and the profiles folder with the profile intact. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If not, please download from there and restart. I suggest an uninstall of the current thunderbird first, and removal of the c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming]thunderbird folder also to ensure no residual data. I have no idea what happened in the install. I tried to reconfigure Thunderbird to mirror your screen, hoping to find a few keystrokes to bring it to life, but failed. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
