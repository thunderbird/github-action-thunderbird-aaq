You do not want one of the new accounts Thunderbird can offer you via mailfence.   You do not want a domain of your choosing, subject to availability from gandi.  This provider does not even offer gandi email addresses. So you have already exhausted the options of offer. </p><p>So I must assume you want something free that you are pointed to because you dislike search engines, otherwise you would already have explored the dozen or so free options google offers when queried. </p><p>Perhaps try <a href=""http://GMX.com"" rel=""nofollow"">GMX.com</a>  That is simple. OR even <a href=""http://email.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">email.fr</a> or <a href=""http://mail.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.fr</a> or <a href=""http://mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.com</a> also simple.  Then there is <a href=""http://AOL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">AOL.com</a>  another quite simple and well known provider.  I am sure there are others,  but a t-bird. anything address is not something that Thunderbird provides </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
