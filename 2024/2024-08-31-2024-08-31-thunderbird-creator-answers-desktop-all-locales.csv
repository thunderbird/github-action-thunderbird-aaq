I'm downloading the messages every few days only on my POP account. When I click on Get Messages the download starts and shows 47 message to be downloaded. Then about 35-40 actually get downloaded and the process stops. I have to click on Get Messages again and the same happens again and again until all messages really hae been downloaded. How to fix it so tht I don't have to do it in small batches? Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1671913;,mr108
