I have not changed anything in my Account Settings. </p><p>Coinciding with this, Thunderbird has lost all my emails in the Sent and Drafts folders (except for recent ones from December).  Oddly enough both folders show data is in them, even though no emails appear.  The Sent folder has 119 mb and the Drafts folder has 62 mb shown. </p><p>In the account settings for ""Copies &amp; Folder,"" I have ""Place a copy in Sent folder"" checked.  The same goes for the Drafts checkbox.  I do not see anything out of the ordinary.  I have also run a repair on the folders, but that did not help. </p><p>So:  How can I recover my emails from August to early November? How can I prevent the emails in my Sent and Draft folders from disappearing? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Carol76
