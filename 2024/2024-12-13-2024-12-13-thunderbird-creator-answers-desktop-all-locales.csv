My usage model is to keep all (saved) email locally (20 yrs archive), access via POP.  Unfortunately, the evolution of HTML, iso character sets, etc has been forcing me to move on. I tried TB about 2 yrs ago and abandoned the project for lack of time and urgency. I'm trying again, but now very serious. Anyway, I set up an install and did basic tests - all ok.  But I can't seem to find config options to customize. I found some option to set my mail store to a folder of my choice (away from the system root -- C:\ - i use windows 10-11.) to something like E:\docs\tb.  It created inbox, trash etc. right there.  My previous install attempt (2 yrs ago) created these in a subfolder named for the email account (eudora calls 'personalities').   I do want to use multiple accounts each in their own 'garden', not in the same inbox, outbox, etc.. I can't find where to configure this - I can't even find how to configure my earlier choice to store them on E:.   What am I missing? On some settings for copies and folders, it offers (eg) Sent folder on &lt;email account&gt;. I presume this is particular to IMAP and not relevant to my current setup. </p><p>That's enough to get me started, but I would like to eventually migrate my Eudora archives  to TB, so a pointer to docs on this would be appreciated. </p><p>Tnx, Tom </p>",tdaly;MattAuSupport;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",4,0,0,,,

One of the bellsouth emails is VERY slow, reading and deleting, but the other two emails run very good, no problems at all with reading or deleting. I have read through many many similar but not quite the same questions in the forum and I have tried every one of the suggested things to try to fix this but it is still a problem. Any new suggestions? </p>",janet59521;MattAuSupport;wsmwk;keith40;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/131.0.0.0",4,0,0,,,
