I have not changed anything in my Account Settings. </p><p>Coinciding with this, Thunderbird has lost all my emails in the Sent and Drafts folders (except for recent ones from December).  Oddly enough both folders show data is in them, even though no emails appear.  The Sent folder has 119 mb and the Drafts folder has 62 mb shown. </p><p>In the account settings for ""Copies &amp; Folder,"" I have ""Place a copy in Sent folder"" checked.  The same goes for the Drafts checkbox.  I do not see anything out of the ordinary.  I have also run a repair on the folders, but that did not help. </p><p>So:  How can I recover my emails from August to early November? How can I prevent the emails in my Sent and Draft folders from disappearing? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",Carol76

For example, a 200x200 pixels image to be 400x400 or more.  I select Actual Size, and Thunderbird says the dimensions are 200x200, but what I see is obviously much larger. </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",whoson1st1

My usage model is to keep all (saved) email locally (20 yrs archive), access via POP.  Unfortunately, the evolution of HTML, iso character sets, etc has been forcing me to move on. I tried TB about 2 yrs ago and abandoned the project for lack of time and urgency. I'm trying again, but now very serious. Anyway, I set up an install and did basic tests - all ok.  But I can't seem to find config options to customize. I found some option to set my mail store to a folder of my choice (away from the system root -- C:\ - i use windows 10-11.) to something like E:\docs\tb.  It created inbox, trash etc. right there.  My previous install attempt (2 yrs ago) created these in a subfolder named for the email account (eudora calls 'personalities').   I do want to use multiple accounts each in their own 'garden', not in the same inbox, outbox, etc.. I can't find where to configure this - I can't even find how to configure my earlier choice to store them on E:.   What am I missing? On some settings for copies and folders, it offers (eg) Sent folder on &lt;email account&gt;. I presume this is particular to IMAP and not relevant to my current setup. </p><p>That's enough to get me started, but I would like to eventually migrate my Eudora archives  to TB, so a pointer to docs on this would be appreciated. </p><p>Tnx, Tom </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tdaly
