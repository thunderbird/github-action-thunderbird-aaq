The sub folders that I want to list are within the Thunderbird email inbox, not available via explorer, at least I have not been able to view the directories of Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>Thunderbird mimics it's internal structure in the file system,  with a few oddities. I tried to describe it here about 10 years ago. <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html</a>  </p><p>But before you do anything.  open the profile folder (there is a link in the troubleshooting information on the help menu.) Close Thunderbird and delete the file foldertree.json from the profile. </p><p>That is essentially a cache used to populate the folder pane and when it is corrupted the folders displayed do not exactly reflect reality. Making sure it is based on the disk image is probably a very good idea if you have things where you think they should not be. </p><p>If you use the unified folder view (which is now the default I understand)  While you are cleaning house open the mail folder in your profile and delete the folder ""smart folders""  that contains an abstraction layer that is used to build the unified folders which are actually ""virtual"" based on the folders shown in the all folder view.   </p><p>When Thunderbird restarts it will be recreated,  but it will reset the unified folders to their default configuration.  There have been lots of issues folk have had since V115 was released with unified folders,  and forcing a rebuild by deleting the underlying folders will clear any of those issues you may have and I feel make your recovery position better. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
