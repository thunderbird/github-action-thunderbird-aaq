That is, if you are reading a message in account xxx and click 'new message', thunderbird assumes you want to send from your xxx account. If you're not lighting any particular message and click 'new message', then thunderbird uses default. So, the default only works when thunderbird cannot sense your preferred account. When you're in another account, it assumes that is the one to use. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Seeing that all the time simplifies finding elements of Thunderbird.  - Second, experiment with view&gt;layout to see how you prefer to display the main elements - Third, don't UNtick any features until you  have some awareness of what they do, as some elements have additional menu choices - Fourth, click 'settings' and review all settings under 'General' and 'Composition' and 'Privacy&amp;Security'  - Fifth, click 'account settings' and review all options for your account  MANY users ignore the fourth an fifth suggestions to their peril.  </p><p>Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

This works but IMV it's really awkward that you cannot add a password without going through the transaction. </p><p>Once this was sorted I was able to discover the reason that we were blocked in the first place.
