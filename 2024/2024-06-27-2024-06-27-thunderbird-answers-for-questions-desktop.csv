That is, if you are reading a message in account xxx and click 'new message', thunderbird assumes you want to send from your xxx account. If you're not lighting any particular message and click 'new message', then thunderbird uses default. So, the default only works when thunderbird cannot sense your preferred account. When you're in another account, it assumes that is the one to use. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I suggest exiting thunderbird, using File Explorer to copy all of that in Local Folders from one PC to the other and then start thunderbird on the other pc and see if it works. It's worth a try and just takes a couple of minutes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Seeing that all the time simplifies finding elements of Thunderbird.  - Second, experiment with view&gt;layout to see how you prefer to display the main elements - Third, don't UNtick any features until you  have some awareness of what they do, as some elements have additional menu choices - Fourth, click 'settings' and review all settings under 'General' and 'Composition' and 'Privacy&amp;Security'  - Fifth, click 'account settings' and review all options for your account  MANY users ignore the fourth an fifth suggestions to their peril.  </p><p>Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
