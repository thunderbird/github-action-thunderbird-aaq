That is, if you are reading a message in account xxx and click 'new message', thunderbird assumes you want to send from your xxx account. If you're not lighting any particular message and click 'new message', then thunderbird uses default. So, the default only works when thunderbird cannot sense your preferred account. When you're in another account, it assumes that is the one to use. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I suggest exiting thunderbird, using File Explorer to copy all of that in Local Folders from one PC to the other and then start thunderbird on the other pc and see if it works. It's worth a try and just takes a couple of minutes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
