I've created some mailboxes for the personal address and the same mailboxes appear in the work email, but without any emails in them. I tried renaming the work mailboxes, but then they disappeared.

I can do that with roundcube but Thunderbird does not give me access and to be honest I am a bit frustrated. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",RadostinaVatova

I am baffled by the number of email erasure/disposal options I was suddenly presented with, namely: 1. A ""Trash"" folder, with trash bin icon; 2. A ""Junk"" folder with a flame icon; 3. A ""Junk"" folder with no icon; 4. A ""Junk E-mail"" folder with no icon. Confusingly, some of these folders are not provided with an ""Empty deleted/junk"" option! Can I completely delete folders 3 and 4 (the one without an icon)? And finally, how can I set things up so that the deleted and junk folders are automatically emptied at set intervals? </p><p>Many thanks in advance for any assistance! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",stathatos1
