I am baffled by the number of email erasure/disposal options I was suddenly presented with, namely: 1. A ""Trash"" folder, with trash bin icon; 2. A ""Junk"" folder with a flame icon; 3. A ""Junk"" folder with no icon; 4. A ""Junk E-mail"" folder with no icon. Confusingly, some of these folders are not provided with an ""Empty deleted/junk"" option! Can I completely delete folders 3 and 4 (the one without an icon)? And finally, how can I set things up so that the deleted and junk folders are automatically emptied at set intervals? </p><p>Many thanks in advance for any assistance! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1653420;,stathatos1
