The file changes every time a message is received. And your ant-virus software will scan your 1.5GB Inbox file every single time. In doing so it blocks Thunderbird to access it, and eventually corrupts it in the process to quarantine a supposedly harmful message. Other mail files may not frequently being being scanned by anti-virus software and hence are less likely to become corrupted. </p> <blockquote> Also, I wonder what changed in Nebula that surfaced this problem. </blockquote> <p>The problem is primarily anti-virus software, not Thunderbird.

It is non intrusive, comes with the operating system and avoids the alarmist messages I am used to seeing from the third party market.  Something to consider is that these products entire marketing strategy is fear.  Fear of being hacked,  fear of loosing money and data, fear of the unknown.  This is exacerbated by most folk not really understanding the whole ""infection"" thing as to what it really means. </p><p>It is to me noteworthy that email scanning is not something that Defender does.   When I put the question as to what email scanning does to representatives of antivirus vendors the best they could offer was ""another line of defense"".  The French learned in 1939 just how lines of defense work.  The German army just went around the end of the Maginot Line.  I see email scanning in the same light.  Why send an infected email when you can send a link in an email that will achieve the same result, only better as web browser routinely allow scripting and drive by downloads of data packets. </p><p>An email can not hurt your system.  It is a plain text file.  What can hurt your system is what your email program does with that plain text file when it displays it.  In the case of Thunderbird I see it as fundamentally safe.  I am sure there is some risk,  just as there is some risk in breathing.  But when using Thunderbird no script in the message body will be run, no remote images will be shown (unless you have changed the default).  This makes it very different to almost all desktop mail clients.  Outlook and Outlook express ran everything and started the urban myths that surround email and what to be cautious about and when to avoid and above all do no open suspicious emails.  I open suspicious email all the time in Thunderbird.  It does not matter if the email body has some malicious script embedded in it,  because Thunderbird will ignore the script.  Even the HTML that is used in the email is sanitized by Thunderbird.  Not all HTML tokens are implemented in email bodies.  Things like iframes just don't work for example.  It is why the links folk try and post in email for YouTube videos are very dodgy in their display in Thunderbird, let alone implementation.  They use an embedded iframe always and sanitizing the HTML in an iframe is just to hard,  so we don't allow them. </p><p>Attachments,  the primary source of infections in email in recent years simply do not exist in the emai source. At least until you try and save or open them.  Until then they are encoded in the only way they can be included in email,  as plain text.  In transmission all attachments are encoded using MIME to make them text as email is a text based protocol.   </p><p>You see a word attachment in the email but it really does not exist as such.  Looking to the message source there is no binary file,  only some MIME text that is defined to be an attachment.  You select to open the file or save the file and Thunderbird has to decode the text and convert it back into it's original format.  At this point the file will appear in the systems memory, or the system temp folder and any antivirus worth having will spot the virus if it contains one and prevent the data being executed.  It really is that simple and the primary reason Defender does not scan mail in my opinion.  It will detect the threat another way when it actually becomes a thread instead of quarantining your last 10 years of mail in your inbox because you have received a latent threat. </p><p>There are other volunteers here that use Norton. Toad-Hall being one. Personally I just don't have the time or patience to be treated like an idiot by software that is not entirely truthful about what it is doing and when.  Over the last 20 years I have cycled trough Nortons (they did not disable when they said they did), AVG (Which kept flashing annoying icons on the task bar because I disabled the email scanner, McAfee (It came with a Dell computer and was just the pits.  But I had already seen it here in lights since 2012 so I had little patience. I think a week.) </p><p>Then I was with Nod32 for a number of years until I purchased this machine a couple of years ago.  By then the 5 license Nod package from ESET had become quite expensive each years and I no longer had the Windows server it was specifically purchased to protect. Added to that ESET had released more consumer oriented product with the usual alarmist messages.  SO I decided life was not long enough to put up with the new ESET </p><p>When this machine was new I read some reviews and defender stacked up pretty well in the primary task is blocking malware.  So I bit the bullet, as there was little on the new machine that would be lost if defender turned out a dud, and I went with the Microsoft package.   Sure it does not shred my deleted files,  it does not tell me my passwords are safe in some vault and then merrily offer out of date passwords until your account is blocked because it messed you changing the password.  IT does not ask you to allow it to be an encryption certificate issuer as it does its scanning locally.  Most importantly to me it does not get in my face unless there is actually a real tangible problem. </p><p>So I will not recommend anything in particular to you,  sure reinstall Norton.  Once you know it fails dismally occasionally on POP mail retrieval resulting the the same mails being downloaded over and over,  tends to block new versions of Thunderbird getting mail and it's other foibles like requiring you to add a self signed certificate to Thunderbird certificate store to allow it to hack your encrypted communitcations.  It is relatively easy to live with.  The regular maintenance is really no a major issue,  once you know what it is and what to do.  Personally I would just rather not. </p><p>While doing your research have a look at this link <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues</a> </p><p>Some of those issues are more than 10 years old and the page gets few updates because in reality all products are basically as bad or good as the next.   Many even come from the same parent company,  for example  Gen Digital  Brands: Norton; Avast; LifeLock; Avira; AVG; ReputationDefender; CCleaner </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So far ""no problems"". </p><pre> So, I'm gonna leave it.  I'm not sure but I think I was seduced by another of those Norton ""safety prompts"" </pre> <p>to add something or other (probably a ""plug-in"" of some type/for some purpose).  I've been leaving those off and so far everything is working the same as it was before. </p><pre> Thanks again.

That is, they contained both headers and contents of all emails from all accounts.  In spite of this, I could determine why TB was only displaying the headers and not the contents. </p><p>Since I seemed to have run out of ideas, I simply opened each mailbox file (inbox, sent, etc.) and any associated .msf file, in Postbox, by using Notepad.  For each mailbox file, I copied the contents of each Postbox file.  I then opened the same mailbox file in TB, deleted the old contents and pasted in the copied contents from Postbox.  I did this for each mailbox and .msf file in each account.  After the copying was completed, I opened TB and  everything was now displayed. </p><p>As I said, I do not know why this worked.  The files imported by Thunderbird from Postbox were identical in size right down to the byte, so should have been identical in contents, but there was something that manually copying the contents provided that the TB import utility did not. </p><p>I'm now going to sit in the closet for awhile. </p>",rreinbold,false,0,0
