Now I understand the logic behind and I can stop searching for the correct setting. Still, I think the 'Show as Conversations' mode in Outlook is more productive and easier to manage since it relates the thread topic to the newest and not to the oldest message.  But I did not know about the possibility to 'Open Message in Conversation'. Thanks a lot for that hint! This allows me to turn off the threaded view in the main tab to avoid overlooking a message, but follow the thread in an extra tab. After selecting the ""Unthreaded"" sorting option, even the conversation tab is ordered as descending. This solution allows me to keep going without major limitations, thank you! The only thing which would even improve it: A marker if a message is related to other messages at all, when ""Unthreaded"" is selected. </p>",haRrY014,false,0,0

But I SWEAR that before I posted my message on this Forum, I had pressed F8 until I was cross-eyed and NOTHING CHANGED except the # of message headers displayed.  The bottom of my large (32"") moniter was blank where in Classic View the content of the highlighted message would appear. </p><p>However, after laboriously reading and responding to my Emails using what I choose to call ""Stoopid View"", I realized I hadn't tried closing Tbird and re-opening it again (without a full Windows restart).  Lo and behold, although Stoopid View was still there when I opened Tbird up, this time F8  FINALLY was working again as you describe (screenshot attached). </p><p>I was just about to post a reply to my own message in case this solution would help others, when I saw your message in my Inbox. </p><p>But I'm still puzzled as to what caused this change in the first place.  (The same way I'm puzzled as to why from time to time, Windows 11 turns off wiFi even though as best I can tell I have done nothing to indicate I want that to happen.  I can manually start it up again with no problem, but it's still a baffling annoyance.)  </p><p>My personal speculation is that these days so much programming effort is being wasted on AS (artificial stupidity) that there's nobody left to do the much more challenging, but less glamorous task of keeping the components that normal human beans RELY ON working properly.  </p><p>Research in the 1960's pretty much proved that it's impossible to 100% debug any moderately complex program  -- because the changes made to fix Bug #1  very often create Bug #2.   Since current-day programs are a jillion times more complex, every change to add some ""cool"" new feature (many of which most users don't really need or want) tends to muck up some features that they really need.  To add to the fun, 21st-century corporations have introduced barriers that prevent user reports of these problems getting through to the technical folks who could actually UNDERSTAND what the problems are and thus MIGHT actually be able to fix them.   </p><p>I know you can't do anything to solve that larger problem, but typing that rant made this old lady feel much better.

Upgrade to 102.0.1 and then upgrade to 102.12 and stabilize for awhile. I also suggest doing a full backup of profile prior to updates, as upgrades seem more prone to issues than routine updates. Whenever you decide to upgrade further, go to 115.0.1 and then to 115.15.0esr. There have been LOTS of changes since 91 and the fact that you stayed with 91 indicates that stability is important. Just my two cents. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
