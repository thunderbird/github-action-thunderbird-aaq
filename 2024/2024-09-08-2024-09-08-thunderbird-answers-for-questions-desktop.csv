Note: If using an imap mail account, you have to import the backuped mbox files into 'Local Folders' mail account. Ideally, just leave them there as you will still see emails. But otherwise, highlight small batches of imported mail seen in Local Folders and use the right click on highlighted mail &gt; Copy to &gt; choose imap folder. This will gradually upload emails back onto the server. Please note this may take a while because most server have a daily limit on how much you can upload back onto the server via imap. </p><p>Whatever you do - do not compact anything at this point.

Still, I think the 'Show as Conversations' mode in Outlook is more productive and easier to manage since it relates the thread topic to the newest and not to the oldest message.  But I did not know about the possibility to 'Open Message in Conversation'. Thanks a lot for that hint! This allows me to turn off the threaded view in the main tab to avoid overlooking a message, but follow the thread in an extra tab. After selecting the ""Unthreaded"" sorting option, even the conversation tab is ordered as descending. This solution allows me to keep going without major limitations, thank you! The only thing which would even improve it: A marker if a message is related to other messages at all, when ""Unthreaded"" is selected. </p>",haRrY014,false,1,0

We are transitioning from Outlook to Thunderbird here at our office, and so far thumbs up except for this sticking point with threaded messages showing the oldest first. Everyone coming from Outlook is used to it having the most recent message in a thread at the top and the oldest at the bottom.

This is usually asked for by people who use Sort by &gt; Descending because they have newest mail at the top of the Message List.  However, a conversation has always had newest comments appended to the conversation. </p><p>So a Sort by &gt; Descending and Date means sorting on the List by Date with newest on top, but if you enable 'Threading', the 'Sort by' &gt; 'Descending' is applied to the oldest thread in conversation not the newest and all appended conversations are listed in date order from oldest at top to newest at bottom. This may seem odd to some people. This has been the prefered method in Thunderbird because a 'Reply' to a particular section of that conversation may create a split in the conversation. This may not be noticed in a simple back and forth reply conversation between 2 people, but may be seen if a group is responding to various sections of that thread.  </p><p>This is a hyperthetical example, but you can end up with something like this: </p><p>&gt; Oldest original email mentions two problems. &gt;&gt; 1st reply Discussing first problem &gt;&gt;&gt; 4th Reply &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6th Reply &gt;&gt;2nd Reply Discussing 2nd problem &gt;&gt;&gt; 3rd Reply &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5th Reply &gt;&gt; 7th Reply discussing both problems </p><p>Using current format this is a simple design structure.  Now, if you put that into reverse where newest is at the top you start to have a problem and that issue is partly why it has not been implemented. It's not that simple in certain circumstances. </p><p>There is  bug report which you can follow: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=479969"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=479969</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,2,0

The first thing I did when I first noticed search wasn't working (probably soon after installing, and it was possibly STILL INDEXING at that time), was go to the help pages where I read the common repair for search issues is to delete that sqlite database file to force a reindex. So let's say I did that, I almost certainly would have done.  </p><p>Next - I have just learned I have some issue with indexing. I deleted that global file again recently and I think it was you (possibly read online) that you can view the ACTIVITY. I did that, and saw that it was indexing. I left it alone for an hour or two, came back, it was STILL indexing, and it was still at the exact same position (think it said something like 'indexing 124 in Sent Items' or something like that.  </p><p>Several hours later, it was still on that same point. So maybe a bad bit of data somewhere? Anyway, several DAYS ago it was stuck, but yesterday I noticed global search was working again. I didn't think (until just now) to check that activity monitor, and hey presto, it isn't indexing any more.  </p><p>(I don't know if it worked its way through the bad data, or maybe failed and skipped over, if it can do that) </p><p>So my thinking is... MAYBE I have deleted that file and noticed the search issues whlie it was indexing and stuck on that bad message for days. This is all assuming there is a bad email/data somewhere, and i am no techie so wouldn't know how to check that. But the  PATTERN of all of this seems to fit my overall experience, which as you know from my frustrations (and yours!) above, has been something like... </p><p>Search works.  Search doesn't work.  Days/Weeks later search works again </p><p>But the missing piece of the puzzle MAY have been my occasional deletion of the global sqlite file to try to 'repair' stuff!  </p><p><br> Does this sound feasible? </p>",mozilla516,false,0,0

You can choose a colour for a category. You can create a category via Settings &gt; Calendar; scroll down to 'Categories'; click on 'New' or select a category and click on 'Edit'.  This means those categories are available to all events. You can a create new 'category on the fly' which is unique for a specific event. </p><p>I found some online info on the Nextcloud calendar you mention. I noticed there is a similar approach to gmail. Basically, Nextcloud is not just one calendar, it encourages the use of separate calendars as if they were  'categories' eg:  Personal, Appointments, Birthdays etc. <a href=""https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/groupware/calendar.html#managing-your-calendars"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/groupware/calendar.html#managing-your-calendars</a> Those different calendars can be assigned a colour.

I suggest you use this method as it is will imitate the methodused by NextCloud. </p> <ul><li> Right click on calendar and select 'Properties' </li><li> Choose colour which matches closest to the specific Nextcloud calendar and click on OK. </li></ul> <p>I cannot see from the information at that link anything that suggests an Event can have a colour that is not based on the calendar to which it is assigned.

A preview implies seeing something before it's opened, but that's not possible. </p><p>When you select a specific email, that email will be opened and displayed in the prefered location. That may be the 'Message Pane' - if it's enabled or in a new tab. </p><p>The Message Pane can only display the contents of that selected email. Each email has it's own headers and html css code. They cannot be merged as if one email. The only time you see additional sections of a previous email is when someone 'Replies' to a received email and sends both copies back to sender. In this instance, the full headers of original email are removed and the html cs code code is applied to entire email. It is contructed as one mail. </p><p>When you select/highlight more than one email, it states the number of selected emails with a small amount of additional info such as the Subject. The header at the top will say the number of highlighted conversation. Selecting more than one email means you are wanting to perform an action with the selected mail - not open and read email. It is assumed that you know what emails you are selecting (otherwise there is no reason to select them) and you know what you want to do with those selected emails. Such as 'Archive' or 'Delete' the selected emails. OR maybe right click on highlighted mail and use 'Copy to' or 'Move to' etc options.  </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:Can I get Thunderbird to show me the correct and full preview somehow</strong> Yes, but not if you highlight more than one email. Maybe not quite what you were looking for but please read because I'm including some information for a process I use that helps in the situation as you are describing. </p><p>The following will make life easier when you want to select a batch of mail and know you have selected the correct emails. </p><p>Open an email and read it in Message Pane. If you think that email is one you want to eg: move to a specific folder You can use either tags or a star to help mark them. Why do this? Because it will help you to remember which ones you want to move. It also means you can use a quick method to sort and select those previously viewed emails. </p><p>Example: If you want to include it then either use the star as a quick id method or set a tag (I use this method). I have a tag which I created and it is used when I select a specific set of emails that I want to move to same location. First I created a new tag and called the tag 'Batch' Do that in Settings &gt; General - scroll to the 'Tags' section and click on 'New' Follow instructions to create the new 'Batch' tag. </p><p>Open email and read in Message Pane. If that email is one you want to move to a specific folder set the tag called 'Batch'. If you have read a load of emails and some have the 'Batch' tag. You can either manually reselect each email as you do now (not so bad if they are close to each other)  OR use the Quick Filter bar - click on the icon 'Show only messages with tags on them' - this removes all the clutter. Then if you have more than one tag displaying click on the relevant tag displayed in the 'Any of' section eg: 'Batch'. This filters the list to just those you tagged with a specific 'Batch' tag. Use 'Ctrl+A' to auto select/highlight all of them and they get displayed in the X conversations list. Then perform whatever action you desire. </p><p>So in two clicks and CTRl+A you have all the 'Batch' tagged emails selected/highlighted. </p><p>Once they have been moved you can remove the 'Batch' tag from each email. </p><p>Then remove the Quick Filter bar filter  click on the  'Show only messages with tags on them' icon and the blue bar is now greyed out and filter not selected. All back to normal. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That's less work than setting a tag. </p><p>I'm just used to using Outlook, which let's me Shift-arrow through them, showing me each one in its entirety in the message pane as I add it to the selection (it just swaps in the latest one selected in the batch).

Normally, people set up Thunderbird to remember the app generated password, so you are not forced to enter it every time you start Thunderbird. You mention you choose not to allow this, but I'm not sure why. </p><p>After all, it's not the same as a normal password, so even if it was copied, it could not be used to access the actual webmail account. The app generated pasword is only designed to be used by Thunderbird to send and download mail. In  latest Thunderbird 128* it does not auto allow auto access to view saved passwords. To access that you would need to enter the computer User Account login password - the one you enter after booting up computer to gain access to Desktop - it's a new additional security step which can be disabled if prefered. </p><p>Does that mean you do not Exit Thunderbird in order to keep the session going, so password remains in cache for session?  </p><p>The info you provide on all the current settings for the account will help to see if something needs selecting etc. </p><p>However.....the following needs to be ruled out as the cause, so please try it out and report back on results. To see if this is caused by the Password please report back on what happens if you choose 'Remember password' option when you login with app password. This will store the password in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security - in 'Saved Passwords' You can always remove it later. But first - save the password and run for a day and report back on whether Thunderbird now auto downloads the emails. We have to rule out whether this issue is related to the app specific password and it not being stored OR something else. </p><p><br> For anyone reading this - here is a useful link: <a href=""https://yandex.com/support/id/en/authorization/app-passwords.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yandex.com/support/id/en/authorization/app-passwords.html</a> </p><p>Setting up in Thunderbird useful link: <a href=""https://yandex.com/support/mail/mail-clients/mozilla-thunderbird.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yandex.com/support/mail/mail-clients/mozilla-thunderbird.html</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Whenever you decide to upgrade further, go to 115.0.1 and then to 115.15.0esr. There have been LOTS of changes since 91 and the fact that you stayed with 91 indicates that stability is important.
