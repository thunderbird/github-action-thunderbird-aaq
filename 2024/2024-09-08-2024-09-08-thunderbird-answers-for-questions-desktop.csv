Now I understand the logic behind and I can stop searching for the correct setting. Still, I think the 'Show as Conversations' mode in Outlook is more productive and easier to manage since it relates the thread topic to the newest and not to the oldest message.  But I did not know about the possibility to 'Open Message in Conversation'. Thanks a lot for that hint! This allows me to turn off the threaded view in the main tab to avoid overlooking a message, but follow the thread in an extra tab. After selecting the ""Unthreaded"" sorting option, even the conversation tab is ordered as descending. This solution allows me to keep going without major limitations, thank you! The only thing which would even improve it: A marker if a message is related to other messages at all, when ""Unthreaded"" is selected. </p>",haRrY014,false,0,0

But I SWEAR that before I posted my message on this Forum, I had pressed F8 until I was cross-eyed and NOTHING CHANGED except the # of message headers displayed.  The bottom of my large (32"") moniter was blank where in Classic View the content of the highlighted message would appear. </p><p>However, after laboriously reading and responding to my Emails using what I choose to call ""Stoopid View"", I realized I hadn't tried closing Tbird and re-opening it again (without a full Windows restart).

I can manually start it up again with no problem, but it's still a baffling annoyance.)  </p><p>My personal speculation is that these days so much programming effort is being wasted on AS (artificial stupidity) that there's nobody left to do the much more challenging, but less glamorous task of keeping the components that normal human beans RELY ON working properly.  </p><p>Research in the 1960's pretty much proved that it's impossible to 100% debug any moderately complex program  -- because the changes made to fix Bug #1  very often create Bug #2.   Since current-day programs are a jillion times more complex, every change to add some ""cool"" new feature (many of which most users don't really need or want) tends to muck up some features that they really need.  To add to the fun, 21st-century corporations have introduced barriers that prevent user reports of these problems getting through to the technical folks who could actually UNDERSTAND what the problems are and thus MIGHT actually be able to fix them.   </p><p>I know you can't do anything to solve that larger problem, but typing that rant made this old lady feel much better.

A preview implies seeing something before it's opened, but that's not possible. </p><p>When you select a specific email, that email will be opened and displayed in the prefered location. That may be the 'Message Pane' - if it's enabled or in a new tab. </p><p>The Message Pane can only display the contents of that selected email. Each email has it's own headers and html css code. They cannot be merged as if one email. The only time you see additional sections of a previous email is when someone 'Replies' to a received email and sends both copies back to sender. In this instance, the full headers of original email are removed and the html cs code code is applied to entire email. It is contructed as one mail. </p><p>When you select/highlight more than one email, it states the number of selected emails with a small amount of additional info such as the Subject. The header at the top will say the number of highlighted conversation. Selecting more than one email means you are wanting to perform an action with the selected mail - not open and read email. It is assumed that you know what emails you are selecting (otherwise there is no reason to select them) and you know what you want to do with those selected emails. Such as 'Archive' or 'Delete' the selected emails. OR maybe right click on highlighted mail and use 'Copy to' or 'Move to' etc options.  </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:Can I get Thunderbird to show me the correct and full preview somehow</strong> Yes, but not if you highlight more than one email. Maybe not quite what you were looking for but please read because I'm including some information for a process I use that helps in the situation as you are describing. </p><p>The following will make life easier when you want to select a batch of mail and know you have selected the correct emails. </p><p>Open an email and read it in Message Pane. If you think that email is one you want to eg: move to a specific folder You can use either tags or a star to help mark them. Why do this? Because it will help you to remember which ones you want to move. It also means you can use a quick method to sort and select those previously viewed emails. </p><p>Example: If you want to include it then either use the star as a quick id method or set a tag (I use this method). I have a tag which I created and it is used when I select a specific set of emails that I want to move to same location. First I created a new tag and called the tag 'Batch' Do that in Settings &gt; General - scroll to the 'Tags' section and click on 'New' Follow instructions to create the new 'Batch' tag. </p><p>Open email and read in Message Pane. If that email is one you want to move to a specific folder set the tag called 'Batch'. If you have read a load of emails and some have the 'Batch' tag. You can either manually reselect each email as you do now (not so bad if they are close to each other)  OR use the Quick Filter bar - click on the icon 'Show only messages with tags on them' - this removes all the clutter. Then if you have more than one tag displaying click on the relevant tag displayed in the 'Any of' section eg: 'Batch'. This filters the list to just those you tagged with a specific 'Batch' tag. Use 'Ctrl+A' to auto select/highlight all of them and they get displayed in the X conversations list. Then perform whatever action you desire. </p><p>So in two clicks and CTRl+A you have all the 'Batch' tagged emails selected/highlighted. </p><p>Once they have been moved you can remove the 'Batch' tag from each email. </p><p>Then remove the Quick Filter bar filter  click on the  'Show only messages with tags on them' icon and the blue bar is now greyed out and filter not selected. All back to normal. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

This will store the password in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security - in 'Saved Passwords' You can always remove it later. But first - save the password and run for a day and report back on whether Thunderbird now auto downloads the emails.

Upgrade to 102.0.1 and then upgrade to 102.12 and stabilize for awhile. I also suggest doing a full backup of profile prior to updates, as upgrades seem more prone to issues than routine updates. Whenever you decide to upgrade further, go to 115.0.1 and then to 115.15.0esr. There have been LOTS of changes since 91 and the fact that you stayed with 91 indicates that stability is important. Just my two cents. </p>",davidsk,false,2,0
