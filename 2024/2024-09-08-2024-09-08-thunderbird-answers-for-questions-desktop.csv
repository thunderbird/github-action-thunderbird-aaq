Note: If using an imap mail account, you have to import the backuped mbox files into 'Local Folders' mail account. Ideally, just leave them there as you will still see emails. But otherwise, highlight small batches of imported mail seen in Local Folders and use the right click on highlighted mail &gt; Copy to &gt; choose imap folder. This will gradually upload emails back onto the server. Please note this may take a while because most server have a daily limit on how much you can upload back onto the server via imap. </p><p>Whatever you do - do not compact anything at this point. You could try to recover emails - easier if a pop account, but still possible if imap. </p><p>Worth a try to see if there are still traces of marked as deleted and hidden emails.

I'm not sure what folder the deleted/lost message was originally in, but there will be an mbox file for that folder name.  </p> <ul><li> Open the no extension mbox file using Notepad++ </li></ul> <p>Emails are written to the file one after the other, so oldest will be at the top and newest at the bottom.
