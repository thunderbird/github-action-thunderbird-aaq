The problem is the forwarding filter works just fine and I need to stop it, but I don't know where to find it or how to stop it.  I do use a global password, so that might have some impact. </p>",moremail2trash,false,0,0

Also, check your sent folder to verify that you're forwarding them and not from somewhere else. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I looked at all of them associated with the email provider in question and found that each one had the 2 lines I noted above, so i don't see how the msgfilterrules.dat files are doing anything.   </p><p>I also tried searching in ""C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\&lt;profile name&gt;"" for any files containing the name of the target account that is receiving forwarded emails.  That produced a list of all the message files that contained messages, but I didn't see anything that looked like a rule.  I am currently trying again with the sender name that is in the rule because there should be many fewer instances of that, but I doubt the outcome will be much different. </p><p><br> It looks to me like the rules are being stored someplace else, but I am not finding where.  Would be nice if one of the developers would jump in with some info. </p>",moremail2trash,false,0,0

You can control POP by setting to not download and always just clicking specific accounts to check, but IMAP tends to keep bringing in mail. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
