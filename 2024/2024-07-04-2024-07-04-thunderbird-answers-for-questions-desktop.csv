The time stamp on the forwarded email corresponds with when I open TBird, even though the original email was sent by the originator in the middle of the night.

The problem is that the account the email is being forwarded to should no long get the email.  </p><p>After many google searches, everything I have read about the filters makes it sound like msgFilterRules.dat contains all of the filter information.

Only 1% of users donate and many those are the type who donate $10 once in a lifetime and think they're being generous. You can switch to Posbox with only minor conversion options an only for a lifetime subscription.

When you delete a message, it disappears from your PC and also from the Comcast server. If you want to keep copies of what you delete, you need to first COPY the messages to a local storage folder first. Since you run a business, I encourage frequent backups. I would not trust any proprietary backup software unless you do a thorough test to prove that it works. I see many posts here from users where their fee-paid backup did not work. That may be happening because a backup done while thunderbird is running will usually be corrupt. My personal preference is to do these two steps:  - exit thunderbird  - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media   Then should you ever need a restore, or to move to a new computer, you just need to '\ - install thunderbird and exit  - copy the backed up thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the initial default. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

For your friend, I encourage using a more general tool so the individual can get text-to-speech on email and websites and documents. For example, here is one that states it handles email and documents and websites. Something such as this would provide a consistent tool for the individual.
