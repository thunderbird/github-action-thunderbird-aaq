When you delete a message, it disappears from your PC and also from the Comcast server. If you want to keep copies of what you delete, you need to first COPY the messages to a local storage folder first. Since you run a business, I encourage frequent backups. I would not trust any proprietary backup software unless you do a thorough test to prove that it works. I see many posts here from users where their fee-paid backup did not work. That may be happening because a backup done while thunderbird is running will usually be corrupt. My personal preference is to do these two steps:  - exit thunderbird  - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media   Then should you ever need a restore, or to move to a new computer, you just need to '\ - install thunderbird and exit  - copy the backed up thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the initial default. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

After I copy them there, will they look like they did in Thunderbird? Will the environment be different, in the event I go searching for a particular email?  Do I come back into Thunderbird and just delete all my email and rely on what is now in a folder somewhere on my computer?  Sorry for sounding so ignorant.

It is a local ""view"" of mail stored on the server for whatever account it is.  In this instance you mention a comcast server. </p><p>A POP account is a fully local copy of mail downloaded from the mail server and is in no way linked to what is on that server going forward. </p><p>Despite any backup of the Thunderbird profile that may be made,  if the mail is removed from the IMAP server,  or the account is closed say then restoring the backup will see the backup mail simply syncronised to oblivion as the server copy is considered at all time to be canonical.   </p><p>Perhaps the most obvious reflection on this is the Thunderbird built in export facility does not export IMAP mail data.  At all.  Nor does the import profile function.  Thunderbird relies on this mail being downloaded over again from the server post restore. </p><p>So before you can consider you have a""local copy"" to backup.  You need to break the link to the server.  Personally I just use a pop account and download the inbox locally and remove the mail from the server as it is downloaded.  But for IMAP it is more difficult.  First the mail has to by moved to a non account linked location,  like local folders. </p><p>There is a profile backup in the import export tools addon.  It does, or used to, do a complete backup of your entire profile including IMAP data but it is slow.  So really it needs to run overnight.

That makes you responsible for not losing it, but doing regular backups can easily manage that. If you have a reason for IMAP, you could create a second account in POP. If you do that, you would want to set it to 'leave on server' BEFORE entering password the first time to ensure that no messages were lost. In that way, you would have all the mail physically on your PC, never deleting anything, and still have the IMAP account for your access from possibly multiple devices. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I can't think what could be interfering with only that Keyboard shortcut and only in Thunderbird. It all worked fine on my last machine running Windows 10. Any ideas? Even a different set of keystrokes would be better than having to reach for the mouse every time I wanted Bold text. </p><p>If there's other software intercepting the shortcut keystrokes then it's not apparent as nothing else seems to happen when I try to use those keystrokes. </p>",jmj9,false,0,0

If the missing accounts are POP, then you could try rightclicking each message folder, clicking properties and then clicking repair. That sometimes works if the index is corrupt. If IMAP, sometimes closing and restarting Thunderbird works, as IMAP accounts are designed to self-populate. I have had success by exiting TB, deleting the inbox, inbox.msf within the account, restarting TB and seeing the account populated. That issue is not one where I have much experience, as it seldom surfaces. You mentioned this is a business. Be sure to backup  regularly. Here's how:  - exit TB - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media. Do this on a regular schedule. I do it at least weekly.  - then, if you  ever need to restore, just  - install thunderbird and exit (if needed)  - copy the backed up thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the existing thunderbird folder  - restart tb. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
