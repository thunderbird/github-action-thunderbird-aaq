I looked at all of them associated with the email provider in question and found that each one had the 2 lines I noted above, so i don't see how the msgfilterrules.dat files are doing anything.   </p><p>I also tried searching in ""C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\&lt;profile name&gt;"" for any files containing the name of the target account that is receiving forwarded emails.  That produced a list of all the message files that contained messages, but I didn't see anything that looked like a rule.  I am currently trying again with the sender name that is in the rule because there should be many fewer instances of that, but I doubt the outcome will be much different. </p><p><br> It looks to me like the rules are being stored someplace else, but I am not finding where.

The time stamp on the forwarded email corresponds with when I open TBird, even though the original email was sent by the originator in the middle of the night.  To be clear: the delay is expected and not the problem.  The problem is that the account the email is being forwarded to should no long get the email.  </p><p>After many google searches, everything I have read about the filters makes it sound like msgFilterRules.dat contains all of the filter information. IT DOES NOT! Nor does Tools&gt;Message Filters provide anyway to Edit filters.....even though that is what the documentation says.  This is the type of misleading info I expect from MS and why I switched to Mozilla in the fist place.  If someone from Mozilla doesn't step in with accurate info, my next step is probably going to be evaluating other email clients. </p>",moremail2trash,false,0,0

When you delete a message, it disappears from your PC and also from the Comcast server. If you want to keep copies of what you delete, you need to first COPY the messages to a local storage folder first. Since you run a business, I encourage frequent backups. I would not trust any proprietary backup software unless you do a thorough test to prove that it works. I see many posts here from users where their fee-paid backup did not work. That may be happening because a backup done while thunderbird is running will usually be corrupt. My personal preference is to do these two steps:  - exit thunderbird  - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to external media   Then should you ever need a restore, or to move to a new computer, you just need to '\ - install thunderbird and exit  - copy the backed up thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming to overwrite the initial default. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
