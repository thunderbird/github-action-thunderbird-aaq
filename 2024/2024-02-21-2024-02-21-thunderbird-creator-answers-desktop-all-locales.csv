The time to hesitate is when the annual major release is offered around June/July. Wait a few months for the major bugs to be fixed, or run two versions side-by-side.</em> </p><p>I continued to update to further 115 releases but, because of the many apparent user issues, I stopped updating at version 115.5.1.

The actual deletion process that follows can take some time depending on how many emails I've selected to delete. </p><p>BUT - I then find that not all were deleted; I can see this easily when I look at the inbox counter.
