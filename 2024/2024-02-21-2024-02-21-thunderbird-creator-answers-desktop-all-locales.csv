The 2nd account synchronizes the mails and all remote subfolders in the local interface.  To me, the 1st account is working weirdly. But I can't understand the reason of that.

I received the following answer from sfhowes: <em>If you're already on 115, you shouldn't have any issues with further updates to the 115 branch, as some, but not all, problems are fixed with each 115 release. The time to hesitate is when the annual major release is offered around June/July. Wait a few months for the major bugs to be fixed, or run two versions side-by-side.</em> </p><p>I continued to update to further 115 releases but, because of the many apparent user issues, I stopped updating at version 115.5.1. The latest release is now 115.8.0. Can anyone guarantee 'no issues' if I now permit this release to be installed ... I have no problems using 115.5.1 but perhaps this is now a security risk? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1637627;,RonSH

Typically a screen like the one in screenshot 1 would appear. Entering my email address would only take me to the box in screenshot 2.These screens now appear whenever Thunderbird is re-started. Note the 'Holidays in United Kingdom is requesting your username and password' - no idea what this relates to. I have deleted and reinstalled one yahoo account which now operates ok. All other accounts are deleted. When I try to re-install one, e.g. yahoo I get a box like that in screenshot 3 and Thunderbird continues 'Checking password' until it eventually gives a failure message. Trying to add a gmail account results in boxes similar to screenshots 1 and 2. My default browser is Firefox and cookies are enabled, tracking protection set to standard. I've uninstalled and reinstalled Thunderbird. Any help would be very welcome, thanks for reading. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",johngherrett1
