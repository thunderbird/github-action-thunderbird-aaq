Shouldn't Thunderbird do the SAME? </p><p>People WRITE in their mail clients with a subset of the abilities in a full word processor. THIS is certainly an attraction OF Microsoft (though I hate to even TYPE the word!). </p><p>My thought is that INTEGRATION with a subset of LibreOffice would be IDEAL for Thunderbird. </p><p>For me, the lack of WORD WRAP is a constant irritation. </p><p>Of course, one can compose in LO and SAVE to PDF and ATTACH the result, but this is ungainly for ordinary communications. </p><p>My FAVORITE wordprocessor ever was the earlier WordPerfect that could display (and EDIT) ALL CONTROL CODES in the text (MUCH easier - and FAR less TYPING - than trying to learn HTML!). </p><p>I have been thinking of the LibreOffice integration for YEARS - ever since I began to USE LO (which, like Thunderbird, I send support to!) </p><p>THIS entry box HAS word wrap - WHY not Thunderbird?????? Don't any Thunderbird DEVELOPERS ever - WRITE? </p><p>It is being recognized that handwriting benefits the BRAIN - I suppose we may actually need to go back there again... </p><p>I abandoned MS for Linux then gave up on Linux for MacOS, because hardware vendors don't support their products fully under Linux (like Dymo address label software). And, of course, MacOS IS genuine UNIX, thanks to Steve Jobs! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",phubert28

I have had a IMAP connection to Comcast for years, now it will not connect.  I have made sure I am using the correct password.  When I start thunderbird, a secondary window pops up with the error message unable to connect.  WEnt thru lots of posts but no results.  One interesting said to disable IPV6 security option, but the way they described the fix was to access thry the EDIT menu then Preferences, but my system does not have Preferences under Edit. </p><p>Rich Dolan Richard.dolan@gmail.com </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",richard.dolan
