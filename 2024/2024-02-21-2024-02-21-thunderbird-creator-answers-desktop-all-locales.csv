Shouldn't Thunderbird do the SAME? </p><p>People WRITE in their mail clients with a subset of the abilities in a full word processor. THIS is certainly an attraction OF Microsoft (though I hate to even TYPE the word!). </p><p>My thought is that INTEGRATION with a subset of LibreOffice would be IDEAL for Thunderbird. </p><p>For me, the lack of WORD WRAP is a constant irritation. </p><p>Of course, one can compose in LO and SAVE to PDF and ATTACH the result, but this is ungainly for ordinary communications. </p><p>My FAVORITE wordprocessor ever was the earlier WordPerfect that could display (and EDIT) ALL CONTROL CODES in the text (MUCH easier - and FAR less TYPING - than trying to learn HTML!). </p><p>I have been thinking of the LibreOffice integration for YEARS - ever since I began to USE LO (which, like Thunderbird, I send support to!) </p><p>THIS entry box HAS word wrap - WHY not Thunderbird?????? Don't any Thunderbird DEVELOPERS ever - WRITE? </p><p>It is being recognized that handwriting benefits the BRAIN - I suppose we may actually need to go back there again... </p><p>I abandoned MS for Linux then gave up on Linux for MacOS, because hardware vendors don't support their products fully under Linux (like Dymo address label software). And, of course, MacOS IS genuine UNIX, thanks to Steve Jobs! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",phubert28

I have had a IMAP connection to Comcast for years, now it will not connect.  I have made sure I am using the correct password.  When I start thunderbird, a secondary window pops up with the error message unable to connect.  WEnt thru lots of posts but no results.  One interesting said to disable IPV6 security option, but the way they described the fix was to access thry the EDIT menu then Preferences, but my system does not have Preferences under Edit. </p><p>Rich Dolan Richard.dolan@gmail.com </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",richard.dolan

The 1st account works as pop protocol: that means that messages are loaded locally, deleted from the server&nbsp;; and no mail subfolders are present in the Thunderbird interface.  The 2nd account synchronizes the mails and all remote subfolders in the local interface.  To me, the 1st account is working weirdly. But I can't understand the reason of that.  Have you some idea about that?  with the best regards,  Bernard (from France, sorry for the bad language&nbsp;;-)) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Bernye00

I received the following answer from sfhowes: <em>If you're already on 115, you shouldn't have any issues with further updates to the 115 branch, as some, but not all, problems are fixed with each 115 release. The time to hesitate is when the annual major release is offered around June/July. Wait a few months for the major bugs to be fixed, or run two versions side-by-side.</em> </p><p>I continued to update to further 115 releases but, because of the many apparent user issues, I stopped updating at version 115.5.1. The latest release is now 115.8.0. Can anyone guarantee 'no issues' if I now permit this release to be installed ... I have no problems using 115.5.1 but perhaps this is now a security risk? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",RonSH
