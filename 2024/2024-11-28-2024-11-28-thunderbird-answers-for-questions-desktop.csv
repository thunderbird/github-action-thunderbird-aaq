Thunderbird suggested that I might be able to get the normal view if I entered the IMAP server directory in Advanced Server Settings. They didn’t know what that was for this email address but for gmail it is [Gmail]. (I get the normal view for both gmail and <a href=""http://phonecoop.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">phonecoop.coop</a> without supplying a value in this field.) The email address was supplied by QMN at quaker.app but they said that this was beyond their knowledge of Thunderbird, and that all their emails were hosted by <a href=""http://Krystal.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Krystal.uk</a>. They gave a link to a Krystal Knowledgebase article which might be helpful. This stopped short of mentioning Advanced Server Settings so I tried to access Krystal online to explain my problem. I found that I couldn’t without logging on, but I don’t have an account. I requested technical help by email from my personal email address but was told they couldn’t deal with it as it was not sent from an email address that was associated with an account with them. They went on to suggest that as Quaker Meetings Network LLP appeared to be a reseller using their services, as such they would be expected to provide direct support and they would recommend discussing the issue with them. </p><p>So I have now completed the circle. It seems that these three organisations either do not know what the correct IMAP server directory is for this email address, or are unwilling to tell me. I don’t know whether the sub-folder problem would be solved even if I knew what the correct value was and entered it in Advanced Server Settings. </p><p>Who has the answer and is going to resolve this? </p>",msturdy77,false,0,0
