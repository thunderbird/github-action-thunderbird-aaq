But manually selecting multiple messages older than x days in multiple IMAP folders and selecting ""Archive"" is a chore too far. </p><p>Thunderbird should natively have the ability to (optionally) iterate across all IMAP folders and ""Archive"" any message older than x days, according to the Message Archives setting in Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders. The Disk Space setting in Account Settings could be an ideal place to add an ""Archive messages more than x days old"" option, since it already has a ""Delete messages more than x days old"" option. </p><p>Note: I know about the AutoarchiveReloaded add-on, but for something as important as shifting emails around with the possible breakage that could occur, and the possibility of the add-on being discontinued, native support would be very much welcome.  </p><p>Another note: this has of course been raised on bugzilla,[1] but it's a 15 year old bug and seemingly unlikely to come to fruition. </p><p>[1] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536169"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536169</a> </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",triatic1
