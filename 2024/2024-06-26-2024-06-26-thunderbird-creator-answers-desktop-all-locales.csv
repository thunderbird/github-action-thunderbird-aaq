Suddenly, all the buttons in the ""Message"" tab, except for ""Create,"" became disabled. Additionally, the ""Send"" related buttons in the message creation window have disappeared. </p><p>I attempted to restore these buttons using Alt -&gt; Toolbox, as suggested by similar questions. While the buttons do reappear in the toolbox view, they vanish again once I exit that view. All outgoing servers are configured correctly, and this setup has worked for several years without any problems. It seems that something is now blocking the ability to send emails. </p><p>We also tried updating and reinstalling the Thunderbird client, but nothing has resolved the issue. </p><p>Attached, you will find images of the disabled menus and proof of the correctly configured outgoing servers. Apologies for the software being in Russian; I hope it's still clear which buttons are disabled since the interface layout is the same. </p><p>Any suggestions would be highly appreciated!

But manually selecting multiple messages older than x days in multiple IMAP folders and selecting ""Archive"" is a chore too far. </p><p>Thunderbird should natively have the ability to (optionally) iterate across all IMAP folders and ""Archive"" any message older than x days, according to the Message Archives setting in Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders. The Disk Space setting in Account Settings could be an ideal place to add an ""Archive messages more than x days old"" option, since it already has a ""Delete messages more than x days old"" option. </p><p>Note: I know about the AutoarchiveReloaded add-on, but for something as important as shifting emails around with the possible breakage that could occur, and the possibility of the add-on being discontinued, native support would be very much welcome.  </p><p>Another note: this has of course been raised on bugzilla,[1] but it's a 15 year old bug and seemingly unlikely to come to fruition. </p><p>[1] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536169"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536169</a> </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",triatic1
