But manually selecting multiple messages older than x days in multiple IMAP folders and selecting ""Archive"" is a chore too far. </p><p>Thunderbird should natively have the ability to (optionally) iterate across all IMAP folders and ""Archive"" any message older than x days, according to the Message Archives setting in Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders. The Disk Space setting in Account Settings could be an ideal place to add an ""Archive messages more than x days old"" option, since it already has a ""Delete messages more than x days old"" option. </p><p>Note: I know about the AutoarchiveReloaded add-on, but for something as important as shifting emails around with the possible breakage that could occur, and the possibility of the add-on being discontinued, native support would be very much welcome.  </p><p>Another note: this has of course been raised on bugzilla,[1] but it's a 15 year old bug and seemingly unlikely to come to fruition. </p><p>[1] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536169"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536169</a> </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1659483;1659499;,user130953890299920595695291845349334830050

However, <em>after restarting Thunderbird</em>, only the common name/certificate name appears in the interface, and I cannot use S/MIME to sign messages (see <em>Broken Settings.png</em>). When I attempt to do so, I receive the following error message: </p><p><strong>Send Message Error</strong> Sending of the message failed. You specified that this message should be digitally signed, but the application either failed to find the signing certificate specified in your Mail &amp; Newsgroup Account Settings, or the certificate has expired. </p><p>To be clear, Thunderbird has no problem finding and using the certificate right after I set it—the problem only appears when I restart Thunderbird and the appearance of the certificate in the settings changes. The certificate does not expire until April 2025, so this is not the issue. The issue also occurs with another account using a different certificate that is also unexpired. </p><p>I am using Thunderbird 115.12.2 (64-bit ESR) on MacOS with Apple Silicon. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1659472;1660495;1660657;1660664;1660795;,bnzelnick
