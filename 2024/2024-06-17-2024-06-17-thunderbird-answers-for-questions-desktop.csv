Firs up a cold restart of your computer and any modems or routers is a good idea. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So, unless you MOVED the messages, the messages are still available, my guess is they are where the default profile is. click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' in left column and click 'open folder'. you are now in the profile. Imap messages would be in the Imapmail folder and POP mail would be in the Mail folder and mail stored to Local Folders would be in Mail\Local Folders.  </p><p>If you want an account on drive D, a simple way is to exit thunderbird, then COPY the account from the profile to drive D, restart thunderbird, and click the 'server settings' pane and change the 'Local Directory' pointer to point to the new location on D. Thunderbird will probably restart and it will use drive D. at this time, the account data in the mail profile may be deleted. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
