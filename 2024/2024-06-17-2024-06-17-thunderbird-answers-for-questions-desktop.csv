The most common culprit is an Anti-Virus which maybe doing any of the following&nbsp;: scanning various files in the profile when they open or scanning any emails which may be attempting to get downloaded etc. </p><p>Do this: Access Anti-Virus product and make the Thunderbird profile folder exempt from scanning. Also temporarilly stop Anti-Virus from scanning any emails or files that get downloaded. Then start Thunderbird to see the effects. </p><p>The proper method of testing whether you have a program or Anti-Virus etc causing the issue is to do the following: </p> <ul><li> Exit all programs. </li><li> Restart Computer in 'Safe Mode with Networking' mode. If you use a wireless connection then you may need to use an ethernet cable to connect computer to router whilst testing. </li><li> Then start up Thunderbird. </li></ul>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0
