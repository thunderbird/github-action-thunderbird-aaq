I often use emojis to punctuate and illustrate my text. However, whenever I use an emoji, the subsequent text will be reduced in size, which is irritating, looks bad, and needs to be fixed. I am sure I know why this is, I assume that emojis are in the default font size, so the editor changes my font size to whatever the emoji was, until I change it back again to the size I wish to use. This slows me down and is surely something I can fix myself, and if I could figure out how to change the default emoji size to match my font size this would stop happening. </p><p>So how would everybody fix this?
