I often use emojis to punctuate and illustrate my text. However, whenever I use an emoji, the subsequent text will be reduced in size, which is irritating, looks bad, and needs to be fixed. I am sure I know why this is, I assume that emojis are in the default font size, so the editor changes my font size to whatever the emoji was, until I change it back again to the size I wish to use. This slows me down and is surely something I can fix myself, and if I could figure out how to change the default emoji size to match my font size this would stop happening. </p><p>So how would everybody fix this?

I have been using Source Sans 3 font as the default message font for at least five yeasr. This font is selected as the default font for composition as well as html style. Unfortunately Source Sans 3 is shown as ""not installed"" in the font list for about six months. Whenever I reinstall it to Windows 11 everything starts to work perfectly until I restart my PC then Thunderbird starts to show Source Sans 3 as ""not installed"". I am able to use this font with the Libreoffice. I tried the same procedure with Source Code with identical results.
