My configuration file is messed up and I would like to clean it up without losing everything.  I have many accounts on different platforms.  My unified inbox no longer works. It was working for my gmail accounts, but now nothing shows up in it. When looking through some accounts, there were multiple copies of emails in the archive file, and I never put them there. </p><p>Is there some way to preserve things like signature files and personalities and sever configurations, and set up thunderbird like a new install preserving the above and my contacts?  It is a real mess now.  I think there are multiple configuration files and I would like to delete some of them, but am afraid to. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",patnsandy

In other words, the the most recent email is out of view and the top one showing is #2.  Hope that makes sense.  Using latest version. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",betweenrows
