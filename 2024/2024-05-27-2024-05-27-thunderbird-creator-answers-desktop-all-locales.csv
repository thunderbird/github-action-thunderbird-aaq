My configuration file is messed up and I would like to clean it up without losing everything.  I have many accounts on different platforms.  My unified inbox no longer works. It was working for my gmail accounts, but now nothing shows up in it. When looking through some accounts, there were multiple copies of emails in the archive file, and I never put them there. </p><p>Is there some way to preserve things like signature files and personalities and sever configurations, and set up thunderbird like a new install preserving the above and my contacts?  It is a real mess now.  I think there are multiple configuration files and I would like to delete some of them, but am afraid to. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1654687;,patnsandy

Multiple email accounts, some gmail, others like sfr, lol and free. All accounts use POP. All working before weekend, shut down the PC. Monday morning, opened Windows, all seems there except TB which has a screen with an Account Setup tab inviting me to set up an existing email address. Close that tab and the attached screen image appears, open tabs blank, no accounts pane on the left, no emails, no local folders. Nuffin. Restart TB and Windows, twice, still Nuffin. Look in Profiles, yes, under Mail all profiles appear to be present and the correct size. Going to gmail’s on line email system shews account open and receiving email normally. I had a problem a month ago after a TB update when all accounts were present but no emails were displayed. I changed the password to 0auth and recovered my emails. That took three days to resolve and I lost a business client through the delay in responding. Today I must file several court documents or I shall be in deep poo. Any suggestions how to recover the left hand accounts pane and see the accounts and folders will earn my undying gratitude. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1654652;1654661;1654665;1654668;1654698;,jfdi
