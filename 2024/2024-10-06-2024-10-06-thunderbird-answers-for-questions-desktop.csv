IMAP syncs to the server and if that pc goes online, the first thing thunderbird will do is DELETE the downloaded messages. Instead, I suggest using windows file explorer to copy the account's message folders (such as inbox, sent, others) and copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder of a different thunderbird setup to ensure no possibility of logging to the account. I don't know if those message folders just have headers or full content, but you will find out after the move.  To be specific:  </p> <ol><li> on second computer, with Thunderbird not running </li><li> access the profile, probably at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.  if there are more than one profile in that profiles folder, the profiles.ini file at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\ will identify the right one.  </li><li> in profile, look for the imapmail\accountname folder for the message folders </li><li> copy them and place in a Mail\Local Folders folder of a profie in a DIFFERENT thunderbird setup  </li><li> start that thunderbird and verify that the messages are there.  </li></ol> <p>You may wish to upload the messages now to the online account. That can be problematic, since IMAP wasn't designed for large-volume uploads. If necessary, do in small batches and check periodically to ensure you're uploading headers and content. Another possibility is to create a manual filter to do the upload, as that slows the process a bit. Regardless, check results after doing this.  </p><p>I wrote this quickly and hope I got the basics down. Very upsetting that Hostgator has no backup.
