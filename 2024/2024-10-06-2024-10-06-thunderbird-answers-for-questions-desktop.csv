The search only searches on Title, but does not search on Location, Description, URL. All of these are being handled in one go by the person assigned. That's why all those bugs have been lumped into one. </p><p>The 'All Events' was recently reintroduced, but not exactly the same because now it includes all instances of any repeat event which means it can apear to freeze and fail to search on anything. This was reported as a separate bug. This is a different situation - the current work around is to limit the number of repeats eg: if creating birthday on set date and repeat annually 'forever' then you end up with one hundred 100 reoccurring events. So if you had repeat events on a weekly, daily, yearly etc basis, then put a limit because you could end up with hundreds and thousands of repeat events and this causes the 'All Events' to freeze - fail to work. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

IMAP syncs to the server and if that pc goes online, the first thing thunderbird will do is DELETE the downloaded messages. Instead, I suggest using windows file explorer to copy the account's message folders (such as inbox, sent, others) and copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder of a different thunderbird setup to ensure no possibility of logging to the account. I don't know if those message folders just have headers or full content, but you will find out after the move.  To be specific:  </p> <ol><li> on second computer, with Thunderbird not running </li><li> access the profile, probably at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.  if there are more than one profile in that profiles folder, the profiles.ini file at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\ will identify the right one.  </li><li> in profile, look for the imapmail\accountname folder for the message folders </li><li> copy them and place in a Mail\Local Folders folder of a profie in a DIFFERENT thunderbird setup  </li><li> start that thunderbird and verify that the messages are there.  </li></ol> <p>You may wish to upload the messages now to the online account. That can be problematic, since IMAP wasn't designed for large-volume uploads. If necessary, do in small batches and check periodically to ensure you're uploading headers and content. Another possibility is to create a manual filter to do the upload, as that slows the process a bit. Regardless, check results after doing this.  </p><p>I wrote this quickly and hope I got the basics down. Very upsetting that Hostgator has no backup.

The following is worth a try. </p> <ul><li> Create a folder on Desktop and call it 'TBird-EML' </li><li> Exit Thunderbird. </li><li> Access that 'Documents.mozmsgs' folder. </li><li> <strong>Copy</strong> all the contents and paste them into the 'TBirdEML' folder. </li></ul> <p>In 'TBirdEML' folder: Now you need to rename all those extensions - <strong>.wdseml</strong> files as <strong>.eml</strong> Yes, you can do one at a time, but there's a quicker way. </p> <ul><li> Right click anywhere in folder and select 'New' &gt; 'Text Document' </li><li> Call it 'ds.txt' </li><li> Open 'ds.txt' using Notepad </li></ul> <p>You want to convert any email (denoted by the *) from <strong>.</strong>wdseml  extension (note it does have a dot before the text) into extension .eml I've added an image below which you can use as guide. </p> <ul><li> Type the following: <strong>ren *.wdseml *.eml</strong> </li></ul> <p>Note: there is a space after ren and after *.wdseml </p> <ul><li> Save the file. </li><li> Close the file. </li><li> Rename the 'ds.txt' file - you need to change the extension - ds.bat </li><li> You will get a windows prompt saying are you sure....the answer is yes. </li><li> Then double click on the 'ds.bat' file and it will run. </li></ul> <p>All the files should get changed to .eml </p><p>Now they are in a format which can be imported back into Thunderbird. </p><p>Then in Thunderbird You need to install this addon 'ImportExportTools NG' <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/</a> </p><p>How to install addon: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird</a> </p><p>Once addon is installed... </p> <ul><li> In 'Local Folders' mail account </li><li> Create a new folder called something like 'ImportEML' </li><li> Right click on folder and select: </li><li> 'ImportExportTools NG &gt; Import EML messages &gt; All EML from a Directory </li><li> Then locate the Desktop and select 'TBirdEML' folder </li><li> So at bottom it says -  Folder: TBirdEML </li><li> click on 'Select Folder' button </li></ul> <p>Import should occur.

It did delete the account even though it popped up a message saying that it couldn't delete it because there was another account with the same name. But below that message was another one that said the account was successfully remove. Thanks again. </p>,BigAlBat,false,0,0
