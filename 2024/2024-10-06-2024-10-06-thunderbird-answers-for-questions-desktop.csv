The search only searches on Title, but does not search on Location, Description, URL. All of these are being handled in one go by the person assigned. That's why all those bugs have been lumped into one. </p><p>The 'All Events' was recently reintroduced, but not exactly the same because now it includes all instances of any repeat event which means it can apear to freeze and fail to search on anything. This was reported as a separate bug. This is a different situation - the current work around is to limit the number of repeats eg: if creating birthday on set date and repeat annually 'forever' then you end up with one hundred 100 reoccurring events. So if you had repeat events on a weekly, daily, yearly etc basis, then put a limit because you could end up with hundreds and thousands of repeat events and this causes the 'All Events' to freeze - fail to work. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

IMAP syncs to the server and if that pc goes online, the first thing thunderbird will do is DELETE the downloaded messages. Instead, I suggest using windows file explorer to copy the account's message folders (such as inbox, sent, others) and copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder of a different thunderbird setup to ensure no possibility of logging to the account. I don't know if those message folders just have headers or full content, but you will find out after the move.  To be specific:  </p> <ol><li> on second computer, with Thunderbird not running </li><li> access the profile, probably at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.  if there are more than one profile in that profiles folder, the profiles.ini file at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\ will identify the right one.  </li><li> in profile, look for the imapmail\accountname folder for the message folders </li><li> copy them and place in a Mail\Local Folders folder of a profie in a DIFFERENT thunderbird setup  </li><li> start that thunderbird and verify that the messages are there.  </li></ol> <p>You may wish to upload the messages now to the online account. That can be problematic, since IMAP wasn't designed for large-volume uploads. If necessary, do in small batches and check periodically to ensure you're uploading headers and content. Another possibility is to create a manual filter to do the upload, as that slows the process a bit. Regardless, check results after doing this.  </p><p>I wrote this quickly and hope I got the basics down. Very upsetting that Hostgator has no backup.
