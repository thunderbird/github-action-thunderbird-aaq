The email alert of your reply doesn't contain a link to the thread which is strange (and annoying!). I found it again though. </p><p>Before I try to improve my knowledge to understand the latter part of your reply, I should point out I am using OSX Mojave (pretty old now) so maybe I still have mbox files? I remember finding those years ago to move from one mac system to another. Not sure how to confirm, but will see if I can find out. Would be nice if Mojave still used those instead of the packages you mentioned.  </p><p>Thanks again, really hope I can do this somehow.  PS If you know of any conversions tools that work, I'd be grateful for a recommendation to see how much it will cost </p>",mozilla516,false,0,0

It does work sometimes by clearing a logjam in the antivirus product. </p><p>Fundamentally I do not think your folders are damaged.  They are not displaying the lists,  but that does not indicate damage to the message store.  Sure the store for the folder could be damanaged,  but a compact would have cleared that up.

My plan, based on what you wrote earlier, was to uninstall TB, check to be sure there is nothing in ""C:\Users\dksmi\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird"" and then reload TB, starting from scratch.  Are you saying that at this point (without trying to reuse anything from the old TB) the subject column is likely to be empty for incoming emails?  Thanks. </p>",dksmiley,false,0,0
