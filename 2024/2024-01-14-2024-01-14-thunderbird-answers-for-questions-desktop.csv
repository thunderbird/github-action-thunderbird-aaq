But go ahead remove and reinstall and when it returns exactly as it is now,  we can talk again.  I am prepared to be shocked by a 1 in a million win.  It does work sometimes by clearing a logjam in the antivirus product. </p><p>Fundamentally I do not think your folders are damaged.  They are not displaying the lists,  but that does not indicate damage to the message store.  Sure the store for the folder could be damanaged,  but a compact would have cleared that up.  Unless the process was prevented from completion by an antivirus scanning or something like that. </p><p>I would suggest deleting the MSF file for the folder in question.

The 2 folders I had “repaired” were completely empty in the subject column and those I hadn’t repaired were empty from a few days ago.  The emails were present but not showing in the column.  Basically, nothing changed; it appears the same as prior to removing the MSF files. </p><p>You say that if I uninstall TB and reinstall, it is ""unlikely to do anything"".  My plan, based on what you wrote earlier, was to uninstall TB, check to be sure there is nothing in ""C:\Users\dksmi\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird"" and then reload TB, starting from scratch.  Are you saying that at this point (without trying to reuse anything from the old TB) the subject column is likely to be empty for incoming emails?  Thanks. </p>",dksmiley,false,0,0
