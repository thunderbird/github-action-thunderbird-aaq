It could be your session.json.file that might need a refresh or suffered a crash today. Apparently this clearly presents itself as a crashed topic at the moment where use of these tabs via Thunderbird is used by them and is ultimately written normally to the session.json files, which in turn is a clear problem when used with its Firefox software. another process name is where it is the sessionstore.js. This is simply written away and not at the last moment of use, as with the Thunderbird software. </p><p><br> Greetings Firefox volunteer </p>",Googlethunderbird,false,0,0
