It could be your session.json.file that might need a refresh or suffered a crash today.

Many ""security"" products routinely disable them. </p><p>To go back to the last of your images I can actually read. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2024-05-15-09-41-32-2a3e85.jpg""> </p><p>That shows the connection security as STARTTLS.
