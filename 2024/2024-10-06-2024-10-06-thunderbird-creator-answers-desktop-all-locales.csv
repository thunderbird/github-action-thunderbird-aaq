I've always put most of the information in the description field, and I use the calendar primarily as a diary record of my life and things I need to keep track of, so this is a major downgrade in terms of usability for me.

PS: I am not an IT professional, just a small business owner that needs to transfer emails from the last couple of years to a new PC because the old one is obsolete.
