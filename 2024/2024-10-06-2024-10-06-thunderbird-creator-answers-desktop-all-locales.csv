For example, if I searched for ""dental"" it would find events titled ""Dental appointment"" and also events with ""dental"" somewhere in the description field. Now it only seems to search the title. I've always put most of the information in the description field, and I use the calendar primarily as a diary record of my life and things I need to keep track of, so this is a major downgrade in terms of usability for me. Is there any way to still search the description field? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ElizabethPS

None of them were archived; they're all in my Inbox.  </p><p>If no such duplicates exist anywhere off the server, can I create a secondary Thunderbird account to run on both my primary and secondary computers to send/receive along side the previous account, which can in some way be prevented to communicating with the host?
