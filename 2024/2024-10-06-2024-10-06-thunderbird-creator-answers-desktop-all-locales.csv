I see others have the same issue, all recently uploaded as I am doing now, so something must have happened. None of the suggested fixes have helped. Has anyone come up with a strategy that works?

For example, if I searched for ""dental"" it would find events titled ""Dental appointment"" and also events with ""dental"" somewhere in the description field. Now it only seems to search the title. I've always put most of the information in the description field, and I use the calendar primarily as a diary record of my life and things I need to keep track of, so this is a major downgrade in terms of usability for me. Is there any way to still search the description field? </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",ElizabethPS
