I mentioned primary password because, although flawed, setting it does address the very issue that concerns you. I agree that it is 'half a loaf', but addresses the issue of not being able to see passwords.   Second, as a courtesy, I filed a bug report at  <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891512"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891512</a> so it is at least on file.

If you make that config change, close TB and reopen, you will see the setting is as you set it. Then, if you click to show passwords, the setting is then reset. It is the request to show passwords that causes the reset. At this time, you have a partial solution. Not the one you want, but the only one that is available.
