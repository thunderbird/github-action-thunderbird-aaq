My understanding is there is something you need to do with Cox to accept the transference.  But as a non Cox customer living about as far from Atlanta as it is possible to be and still be on the same planet,  it is only an understanding. </p><p>Is you  current cox account IMAP or POP?

She couldn't figure out how to connect us since Thunderbird is not showing as one of the options to import. She suggested we contact Yahoo, which my husband had already tried, waited an hour to get an agent, and then the agent didn't help him. We've already been transferred out of our Cox account and there is no Account Settings button on the Yahoo page. </p>",jauerbach855,false,0,0

Alcune mail (ma non tutte) vengono visualizzate mostrando del codice come mostrato nell'immagine allegata. E' come se Thunderbird non fosse in grado di mostrarne il contenuto e facendo vedere il contenuto in modo testo non codificato. Inoltre, anche se Thunderbird non è in grado di visualizzarla correttamente, se la apro (successivamente) in google mail essa viene visualizzata correttamente. </p>",ToninoScaffidi,false,0,0
