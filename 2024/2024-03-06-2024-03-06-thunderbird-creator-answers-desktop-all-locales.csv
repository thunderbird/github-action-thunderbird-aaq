Tengo dos tipos de correo de salida. Tengo un correo@x.com y otro correo@y.com - Cada vez que quiero enviar un correo con uno o con el otro, debo estar cambiando la configuración de salida ya que si estoy usando uno, no me deja enviar correos con el otro. Así mismo, se cambia el correo predeterminado solo, sin que yo haga ningún cambio. Me gustaría saber si se pueden tener dos servidores de salida y cómo hacer para configurarlos para no estar cambiando el servidor y el predeterminado cada vez que voy a enviar un email.
