The backstory is that about three months ago my email suddenly went from archived to my active email file as being unread and available to review.  It was difficult to work around at first but that is what I have done...just worked around it.  About one week ago I lost access to my Thunderbird emails.  I had been working to remove files from my hard drive to free up storage space.  [in the end I obtained additional storage capacity] and may have inadvertently deleted Thunderbird.   </p><p>Currently: I began to reinstall thunderbird.  The ""Account Set Up"" icon it asks for credentials--I had to create a new password (which could be the problem).  The next question is for me to choose IMAP or POP3; selected POP3.   I get the message ""available configuration"" but then when it is done searching I get an error message that says it cannot login to server and ""can't login to server ""possibly wrong configuration, username or password.""  I do not know how to get this straightened out.  Any suggestions are appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",walkingpearl2

1468393,2024-10-09 21:54:12 -0700,2024-10-09 21:54:12 -0700,Double counting of new e-mails on Thunderbird icon.,"<p>Hi. &nbsp;:-) For quite a long time now, I have seen this error (that was not before in some instance): When I receive an e-mail the program is setup to give a notification that there is a new e-mail, plus on the Thunderbird icon in the taskbar (is that the name for it), there is a continuous count of unread messages. So far so good. But then if you don't read the message(s) right away, after a little time the notification (for the same e-mail(s)) comes again and the count of unread e-mails goes up - even though there is no new e-mails other then the one(s) that came before. </p><p>So if you leave the computer unatended for some time and you come back, the Thunderbird icon says that you have 40 unread messages (for example) and you think ""oh no, so many"" - but when you open the e-mail program, there is only half of that. See attached images. This test I made by sending e-mails to my self. My e-mail is setup to receive e-mails every 5 minutes and I think the second notification and count-up might come at that 5 minute point - when it is time for the software to look for new messages. </p><p>It only does this with the main e-mail account. I also have the e-mail program setup to receive e-mails from another e-mail adress - but this count stays true on the Thunderbird icon and does not give extra notification and double count of unread messages. </p><p>How to fix that - or is it a general issue that needs to be fixed in the Thunderbird code? It have been like this for a quite long time, but I have not known how / where to ask about it. </p><p>Kind regards Master of Science in Engineering Thorvald Johannes Pedersen Denmark </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",tjp25
