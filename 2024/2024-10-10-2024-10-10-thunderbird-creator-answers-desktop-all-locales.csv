So far so good. But then if you don't read the message(s) right away, after a little time the notification (for the same e-mail(s)) comes again and the count of unread e-mails goes up - even though there is no new e-mails other then the one(s) that came before. </p><p>So if you leave the computer unatended for some time and you come back, the Thunderbird icon says that you have 40 unread messages (for example) and you think ""oh no, so many"" - but when you open the e-mail program, there is only half of that. See attached images. This test I made by sending e-mails to my self. My e-mail is setup to receive e-mails every 5 minutes and I think the second notification and count-up might come at that 5 minute point - when it is time for the software to look for new messages. </p><p>It only does this with the main e-mail account. I also have the e-mail program setup to receive e-mails from another e-mail adress - but this count stays true on the Thunderbird icon and does not give extra notification and double count of unread messages. </p><p>How to fix that - or is it a general issue that needs to be fixed in the Thunderbird code? It have been like this for a quite long time, but I have not known how / where to ask about it. </p><p>Kind regards Master of Science in Engineering Thorvald Johannes Pedersen Denmark </p>",tjp25;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/129.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",0,0,0,,,
