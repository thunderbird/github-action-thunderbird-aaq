The number of emails displayed in (Bigpond) inbox keeps reducing, now to 25.  This regardless of deletions made.  Installed M. Thunderbird in Acer laptop a few months ago and that device currently shows 675 unread messages.  How can I get HP machine to display all 675 that must be in Bigpond mailbox if they are accessible in Acer device.  Also have folders on left side of HP device that I can't install in Acer device.

The backstory is that about three months ago my email suddenly went from archived to my active email file as being unread and available to review.  It was difficult to work around at first but that is what I have done...just worked around it.  About one week ago I lost access to my Thunderbird emails.  I had been working to remove files from my hard drive to free up storage space.  [in the end I obtained additional storage capacity] and may have inadvertently deleted Thunderbird.   </p><p>Currently: I began to reinstall thunderbird.  The ""Account Set Up"" icon it asks for credentials--I had to create a new password (which could be the problem).  The next question is for me to choose IMAP or POP3; selected POP3.   I get the message ""available configuration"" but then when it is done searching I get an error message that says it cannot login to server and ""can't login to server ""possibly wrong configuration, username or password.""  I do not know how to get this straightened out.  Any suggestions are appreciated. </p>",thunderbird;installation-and-updates;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",walkingpearl2
