Going backwards sometimes works, but only with compatibility.ini file deleted. Thunderbird's rejection of current profile doesn't mean a problem; it just sometimes starts fresh. That can be frustrating because it leaves user wondering about lost messages and contact list. My preference is to restore the old profile, after first verifying that it is complete.

I also wonder whether you should have two outgoing servers or if your two gmail accounts should use the same outgoing server. These are things that I wonder. I do not know the answers. </p><p>Your photos remind me that your ""old"" gmail account uses a custom domain. I am no expert on DNS records used for e-mail (though I have my own domain and have had to mess with DNS records a few times in the last 25 years), but I read that it's possible to use DNS records to forward e-mail messages to a specific address. Is it possible that you are doing that? I don't know if a failure from that process would cause a Google server to give you an error message. </p><p>So I am grasping at straws, whatever that means, but maybe the idea of DNS records provokes a useful memory or thought in your brain. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
