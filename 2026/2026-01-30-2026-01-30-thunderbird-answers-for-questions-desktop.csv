What I am suggesting is that you post the details that can be evaluated, such as screenshots of your incoming and outgoing server settings panes for the account, plus screenshots of the error messages seen. Volunteers need to see exactly what thunderbird has to give potentially useful suggestions.

There is the sneaky system used by spammers as well as ""legitimate"" senders that embed a link in an HTML-formatted message to an external image, often just one invisible pixel. Retrieving this image, sometimes called a ""web beacon"" will alert a monitoring server somewhere that can tell the sender that the recipient has opened the email... *IF* the recipient is set up to automatically display external images. The average sender wouldn't usually have a way to monitor this - it requires access to a web server.  </p><p>Thunderbird (and virtually all other) email clients have a setting to disable auto image display, and I would encourage everyone to do so. You can enable auto-download for trusted senders if you want, but I would still discourage it. Safer to do it manually. </p><p>In other words, yes, there is at least that method, but it's easily defeated, which pretty much makes it uselessly unreliable. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

But I can not see there ever being a need to allow the user to enter a password there. </p><p>So you are looking for something that has really never existed.  Thunderbird will ask you for a password if it needs one and offer to save it.   </p><p>However just setting the authentication method to password does not guarantee you will be asked if you have other software on your system that consumes the connection attempt so the server never requests a password. Common causes of failures to request passwords are things like antivirus products and in your case they are also blocking access to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost"" rel=""nofollow"">localhost </a> and the odd proxy type port numbers that Proton uses. </p><p>Port 1143 appears to be registered for use by informix to exchange data. See <a href=""https://www.infomatrix.ro/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.infomatrix.ro/</a> and <a href=""https://isc.sans.edu/data/port/1143"" rel=""nofollow"">https://isc.sans.edu/data/port/1143</a>    Port 1025 is often used as an alternative SMTP port,  but it has a past in the Windows RPC and the associated vulnerabilities and patches over the years so a problematic choice on most occasions. See <a href=""https://www.pentestpad.com/port-exploit/port-1025-microsoft-rpc-microsoft-remote-procedure-call"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pentestpad.com/port-exploit/port-1025-microsoft-rpc-microsoft-remote-procedure-call</a> </p> <blockquote> I have two gmail accounts which are working but I also have a Protonmail account which has stopped working. The Protonmail Bridge show the following details for entry in the Thunderbird client's account settings:  <strong>IMAP</strong>: Hostname (127.0.0.1), Port(1143), Username(withheld), Password(withheld), Security (STARTTLS)  <strong>SMTP</strong>: Hostname (127.0.0.1), Port(1025), Username(withheld), Password(withheld), Security (STARTTLS)  I can enter the following:  Hostname, (127.0.0.1), Port(1025), Username(withheld), Connection Security(STARTTLS) &amp; Authentication method (normal password) but nowhere to enter the actual password! </blockquote> <p>You enter it when you are asked for it.  Always have.  Thunderbird does ask you to enter it when you are first creating an account,  simply to reduce the number of password requests as there may be many attempts to connect to the mail server in the setup process attempting to detect the servers settings. </p> <blockquote> How do I do this and where in the docs is this described, please  Thanks </blockquote> <p>As you appear to be using Linux in one of the X11 version I will guess it is probably a Ubuntu derived distribution and will be using SNAP packages with their special sandbox built in.  How that works with  those ports,  I have no idea.  But many folk have issues with the SNAP versions and permissions and have reverted to DEB packages which just work. </p><p>Ubuntu derived distributions will also most likely have the Ports 1025 and 1143 closed. While the definition of localhost says that the transmission should never go to a physical adaptor,  I could see it being bundled with the general software firewall rules.  So have you checked your software firewall?  Have you checked your installed version of Thunderbird has access to those ports through the snap sandbox.  </p><p>Do you have development environments or server software like Apache installed that may by consuming port 1025 connections or even things like mailpit or mailcatcher? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Also as I said you were asked for it and if it is needed again, or if the saved password is unsuccessful in making a connection, you will be asked for it again.  After that it is saved and you can access that from the password manager. </p><p>Why are you using encrypted communications on your own hardware?  the data travels nowhere,  but you are adding the overhead of encrypting the communications between two software items on your local machine.  I am sure an argument can be made that it makes the interception of the communication harder,  but in all honesty Thunderbird stores your mail as plain text,  so it is some weird transitory level of security.  However you will need to add an exception to the certificate in the certificate manager is you want to use it,  or use a trusted certificate issuing authority to sign your certificates. </p><p>But you are at point 4 or 5 in the Proton setup  <a href=""https://proton.me/support/protonmail-bridge-clients-windows-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://proton.me/support/protonmail-bridge-clients-windows-thunderbird</a>  </p><p>The dialog is different but the root cause is largely the same.

Moreover, Thunderbird is a local email application, meaning it installs and runs as a client on your device. It does not provide email addresses, nor the service to transmit emails. But Thunderbird can be used with your existing email address and service provider to send, receive, sort and search your email messages. </p><p>Wrt your concern about Gmail and AI, this is completely unrelated to the email client you use to access your Gmail account. It is of course up to you not to use Gmail as your email provider if you feel uncomfortable about what they are doing.  For standard, free users, Google maintains that they do not train Gemini or other large language models on your email content. Features like Smart Compose or Automatic Tab Sorting do ""read"" your emails to work, but Google clarified that these are localized processes. Turning them on does not grant Google the right to use your emails for AI training. If you explicitly use Gemini Extensions (where you ask the AI to ""find the receipt in my Gmail""), the specific prompts you type and the resulting interactions may be used to improve the service, but the rest of your inbox remains private. </p><p>Note, every email provider is scanning your messages for malware, a.k.a. they are all 'reading' your email anyway. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
