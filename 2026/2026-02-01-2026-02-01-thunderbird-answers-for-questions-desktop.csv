It may help to post a screenshot of the SMTP server pane so readers here see exactly what thunderbird sees. My guess (and it's only that), is that authentication needs to be other than 'no authentication.' Try 'normal password.'  Also, be sure to use the full email address, not just the prefix. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If so, you could copy and paste into the active profile after closing thunderbird. OR, there is an addon, Mail extractor, that can search you message folder and extract email addresses from prior contacts and create a csv file that can be imported to the addressbook. this wouldn't solve all your concerns, but would rebuild somewhat.
