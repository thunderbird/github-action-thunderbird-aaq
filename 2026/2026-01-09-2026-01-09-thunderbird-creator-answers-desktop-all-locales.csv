Example message test: bbbbbbbbbbbbsssssssss ggggggggggggg***234*5678,56 *&lt;==============*  The written numbers and the arrow were colored red. No asterisks were written in the message sent. When writing, colors appeared correctly in messages with no asterisks on screen. However, no colors appear and asterisks are added in recorded messages sent and received on the PC. The Lenovo PC works OK in general, so it must be a Thunderbird configuration/function problem on my PC as the message is correctly received with colors without asterisks on my mobile phone. Can you help me correct this PC anomaly?

You’d need to carefully choose the right format and ensure nothing is missed, which can be risky if you’re not tech-savvy. </p><p>For a faster and more reliable solution, I recommend using Systool IMAP Backup Tool. It can automatically back up all your Zimbra emails to formats like PST, EML, or MBOX without any data loss, supporting full or selective backup options. This way, you can keep a safe, accessible copy of all your important emails without worrying about manual errors or missing data. </p>",rahul.pcvita01;,false,true,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",0,0,0,,,
