Example message test: bbbbbbbbbbbbsssssssss ggggggggggggg***234*5678,56 *&lt;==============*  The written numbers and the arrow were colored red. No asterisks were written in the message sent. When writing, colors appeared correctly in messages with no asterisks on screen. However, no colors appear and asterisks are added in recorded messages sent and received on the PC. The Lenovo PC works OK in general, so it must be a Thunderbird configuration/function problem on my PC as the message is correctly received with colors without asterisks on my mobile phone. Can you help me correct this PC anomaly? Many thanks </p>",andrewjholford;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0;os:Windows 11 sur Lenovo 17"" Idealpad PC",0,0,0,,,
