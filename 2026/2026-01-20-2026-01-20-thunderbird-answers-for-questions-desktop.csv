Have you looked where your browser is set to save downloaded files? </p><p>Of course, there will be a message about downloading each time a person downloads. The download site doesn't know what you have done in the past. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

(What are you calling ""main""?) Exactly what steps do you take? What makes you think that files get corrupted? What formatting is convoluted in local folders but straightforward in ""main""? </p><p>""Moves some, sometimes, then won't move, or will move some but not all,"" — Some files and folders get moved in the file system but others don't? You copy and paste them or you click and drag them, and some move but some don't? </p><p>Some context for these operations would be helpful too. Why are you moving files and folders from local folders to ""main""? Is your e-mail account an IMAP or a POP account? Why do you move files and folders in the file system instead of moving folders and messages in Thunderbird? </p><p>With more information, someone may be able to help. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

If you open a message in a new window, turn off all toolbars, and maximize that window, you'll come kinda close, but you will still see the header bar. I don't know what your motivation is, but for me, with all the steps you have to go through, it wouldn't be worth the bother. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
