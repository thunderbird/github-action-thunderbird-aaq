Have you looked where your browser is set to save downloaded files? </p><p>Of course, there will be a message about downloading each time a person downloads.

(What are you calling ""main""?) Exactly what steps do you take? What makes you think that files get corrupted? What formatting is convoluted in local folders but straightforward in ""main""? </p><p>""Moves some, sometimes, then won't move, or will move some but not all,"" — Some files and folders get moved in the file system but others don't? You copy and paste them or you click and drag them, and some move but some don't? </p><p>Some context for these operations would be helpful too. Why are you moving files and folders from local folders to ""main""? Is your e-mail account an IMAP or a POP account? Why do you move files and folders in the file system instead of moving folders and messages in Thunderbird? </p><p>With more information, someone may be able to help. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

If you open a message in a new window, turn off all toolbars, and maximize that window, you'll come kinda close, but you will still see the header bar. I don't know what your motivation is, but for me, with all the steps you have to go through, it wouldn't be worth the bother. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
