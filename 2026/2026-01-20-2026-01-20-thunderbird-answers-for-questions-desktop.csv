I use a number of email addresses depending on whether business, personal or other. I fill in the correct from address if it is wrong. After I send it the email shows in the wrong send folder and Thunderbird has changed the from to a different email.  A search shows this can be fixed by setting the default. That no longer works, I can't change it.  I have started using Gmail, which I hate but it works as expected.   This has worked correctly for many years but this problem has cropped up due to a recent patch. It has caused some explaining since people who should not have the company email now have it.
