So I'm only addressing that part of the issue first. Sorry for the verbose bit that follows&nbsp;:) </p><p>Gmail stores all is emails in the 'All Mail' folder. Gmail understands this is not good for organising or locating emails, so they invented 'Labels'.  That means the 'Label' is like a tag put on the email stored in 'All Mail'. That email can now display a virtual view in any Label (aka folder in Thunderbird) mentioned against that email in 'All Mail'. Although in Thunderbird, it's a real copy because Thunderbird does not use labels like gmail. </p><p>If you delete an email from eg: 'gAMES', you are sending a message to gmail to delete that email. Gmail puts it in server Trash - removes all labels from email and then deletes it from the 'All Mail' folder. That means it's no longer displays in both labels - gAMES and Games. As imap folders synchronise with server folder/label to show what is on server, they simultaneously stop showing same email. The 'All MAil' folder also gets updated to remove the deleted email. So no matter how many copies you have - they all disappear at once because you sent the instruction to delete the email in 'All Mail'. </p><p><strong>So, I hear you ask, how do I only delete an email from gAMES but not from Games&nbsp;?</strong> You have to use the following technique.  </p> <ul><li> select email and hold down 'Shift' key whilst pressing on 'del' key. </li></ul> <p>This has the effect of deleting and by-passing the Trash. Beware there is no 'Undo' for this. What does it do? From your point of view, it removes the email only from the gAMES folder. From Gmail point of view - you sent instruction to remove the 'gAMES' label from that email stored in 'All Mail'. So email still exists in 'All Mail' with the 'Games' label meaning it still displays in the Games label/folder. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

However, as you also subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder, that folder contains a copy of every email - incoming and outgoing and archived (stored in All Mail with no labels) - the lot. So your gmail account already has a double of everything.  </p><p>I tend to advise people not to subscribe to the 'All MAil' folder because if you delete anything from that 'All Mail' folder you will be deleting that email from any other folder it resides in. Also, if your Anti-Virus product is allowed to scan folders and it attempts to fix something in that 'All Mail' folder, you stand a good chance of losing all your emails.  It's adviseable to not allow any scanning of your Thunderbird profile because even if it finds something, you do not want it trying to fix anything. AV's have no understanding that one mbox file may contain a lot of emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

You should be able to remove/delete the incorrect Draft folder off the server because it's not the default on server. </p><p>In Thunderbird the incorrect Draft folder has been set a 'Draft' flag which means it cannot be deleted.

I use a number of email addresses depending on whether business, personal or other. I fill in the correct from address if it is wrong. After I send it the email shows in the wrong send folder and Thunderbird has changed the from to a different email.  A search shows this can be fixed by setting the default. That no longer works, I can't change it.  I have started using Gmail, which I hate but it works as expected.   This has worked correctly for many years but this problem has cropped up due to a recent patch. It has caused some explaining since people who should not have the company email now have it.  Embarrassing. </p>",russ.nes,false,0,0
