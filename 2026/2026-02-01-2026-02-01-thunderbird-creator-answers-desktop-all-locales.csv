At the very top of the message (as with all messages) is a button marked ""Junk"", which in this case is ""greyed out"" and so won't work, although this button is not greyed out for messages that are not thought to be Junk!. This seems counter intuitive to me. Thunderbird is allowing some messages into the Inbox which it thinks are Junk, but disables the button that allows me to confirm it!
