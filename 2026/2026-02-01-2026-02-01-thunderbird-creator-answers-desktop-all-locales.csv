I have to shut down some apps and sometimes restart the computer in order to be able to get and send messages on my google account. Also, I can't get to the yahoo account and I get a new window to enter my username and password for yahoo but when I enter them, I get a ""Something went wrong"" notification and suggestion to try from a diffrent device. Everything was allways fine. What went wrong lately? </p><p>Thanks a lot, Mickey </p>",liormic;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:Windows 10",0,0,0,,,

This mail has a yellow banner at the top stating ""Thunderbird thinks this message is Junk mail"". Also on this banner is a button marked ""Not Junk"", that allows me to tell Thunderbird that it is not Junk. At the very top of the message (as with all messages) is a button marked ""Junk"", which in this case is ""greyed out"" and so won't work, although this button is not greyed out for messages that are not thought to be Junk!. This seems counter intuitive to me. Thunderbird is allowing some messages into the Inbox which it thinks are Junk, but disables the button that allows me to confirm it! I know that I can still mark the message as Junk by using the individual menu for the message (3 vertical dots), but why disallow the obvious ""quick action"" button? </p>",chipmess;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:140.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/140.7.0;os:LMDE 6 Faye,0,0,0,,,
