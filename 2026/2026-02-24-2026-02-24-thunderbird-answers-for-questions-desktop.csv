If the time to write the message is longer than the time to save a draft, thunderbird saves it again. If you take  longer time to write the message, thunderbird continues periodically to save more drafts. when the message is finally sent, thunderbird issues the command to delete the draft, but can cause the other drafts to remain. You have to manually delete those. OR, you can set the drafts folder to be local, in which case this situation never materializes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
