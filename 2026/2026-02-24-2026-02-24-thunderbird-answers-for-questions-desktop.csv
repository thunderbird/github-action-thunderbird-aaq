If the time to write the message is longer than the time to save a draft, thunderbird saves it again. If you take  longer time to write the message, thunderbird continues periodically to save more drafts. when the message is finally sent, thunderbird issues the command to delete the draft, but can cause the other drafts to remain. You have to manually delete those. OR, you can set the drafts folder to be local, in which case this situation never materializes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You should not be needing to alter anything.  </p><p>Possible reasons for a setting not being recognised. You have a program on your computer that cleans up temp files, session files, cache etc. Products such as CCleaner or WiseCleaner or even some Anti-Virus products can 'clean up' files. It means something could be messing about in places where they should not be allowed and it can cause a nuisance. If you have installed such a program then you need to access it and make an exception to not have access to your Thunderbird profile. That includes any Anti-Virus.  Anti-Virus can cause problems because if allowed to scan and auto fix files, they could cause major data loss. AV's have no concept that one simple text file may contain more than one email. So a fix may mean delete the contents of file. If you have had Thunderbird for a while then it's likely the <strong>Thunderbird</strong> folder that needs being make exempt from scanning is here: </p> <ul><li> C:Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> </li></ul> <p><br> The 'Sent' folder does not display items because the index file does not match the real contents in the mbox file.  </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Sent' folder and select 'Properties' </li><li> Click on 'Repair Folder' </li><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
