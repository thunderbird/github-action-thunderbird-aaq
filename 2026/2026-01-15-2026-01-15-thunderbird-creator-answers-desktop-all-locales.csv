The lost emails were duly recovered but only after having to change my Google password. However one of our Thunderbird Gmail account will not download any new messages coming in. Ultimately we deleted that account from Thunderbird, intending to reinstall it. We deleted the account by pressing the Red button in account settings. We confirmed that messages are received to  Gmail's Web page Inbox Now when I attempt to reinstall the account and press Add Account, I get the UNABLE TO LOG IN AT SERVER MESSAGE shown below. The ""Your Full Name"" I am putting in is the name on the Google account deleted from Thunderbird, and the password I have tried is my new Google password. I have tried the process of not adding in the password until requested to do so but this did not work either.
