La password è corretta (test positivo di accesso tramite webmail e app android). Le impostazioni dell'account sono conformi ai settaggi consigliati da Infomaniak. Il test disponibile in Thunderbird per verificare la corretta comunicazione del server IMAP e SMTP risponde correttamente e non evidenzia alcun problema (img1.jpg). Ogni volta che inserisco la password il programma procede con la connessione con <a href=""http://mail.infomaniak.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.infomaniak.com</a>:993 senza problemi ma al momento della connessione accade qualcosa durante il ""Controllo della funzionalità del server di posta..."" (img2.jpg). La password non viene accettata e si ripresenta continuamente la finestra con la richiesta di Inserire una nuova password. Ho quindi provato in modo empirico a facilitare il più possibile le cose e ad eliminare possibili difficoltà, tra cui: 1) eliminare l'account infomaniak presente in Thunderbird e ricrearlo da zero; 2) disabilitare il firewall locale (ESET); 3) rimuovere l'autenticazione a due fattori; 4) ricambiare e semplificare la password dell'account; 5) creare una password specifica per Thunderbird tramite la funzione infomaniak ""Password app""; 6) provare a collegarmi connettendomi ad una WAN diversa da quella attraverso la quale il problema si verifica; 7) rimozione delle credenziali salvate in Impostazioni -&gt; Privacy e Sicurezza -&gt; passwords e reinserimento da zero; Purtroppo nessuno di questi passaggi ha sortito alcun effetto risolutivo ed attuamente non mi è più possibile accedere al mio account infomaniak tramite Thunderbird come ho fatto senza alcun problema, da anni. Non nascondo che questo rappresenta un grosso problema.  </p><p>Il problema è conosciuto? Ci sono metodi di risoluzione (ad es. cancellazione delle cache, file di storage delle psw)?

I already try to: 1) delete the local account and reconfigure it in Thunderbird as new account; 2) suspend local firewall protection (ESET); 3) remove two-factor authentication (MFA); 4) simplify the password; 5) create a new and different password exclusively for for Thunderbird in the function ""Password app""; 6) try to use a different internet connection; 7) remove and re-creation of record password storage by Thunderbird in Settings -&gt; Privacy and Security -&gt; passwords.  No one of that step solve and actually I can access to my mailbox from Mozilla Thunderbird. It appear as a big problem. Can you help me?
