I understand how I can edit them individually and handle new filters, however I have several hundred accumulated filters created over the years and doing so individually will be very time consuming.  Is there a method I can use to change all existing spam filter's destination folder in a single step.  I know a bit about using Config Editor, Chrome css, probably just enough to get my self in trouble.
