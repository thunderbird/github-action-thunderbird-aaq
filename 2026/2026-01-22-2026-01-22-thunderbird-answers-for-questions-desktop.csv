The folders of mail are associated with account numbers in your preferences so a plain copy it not the answer.  Generally Time Machine is not the answer. </p> <blockquote> I have deleted an email account from Thunderbird and I did not tick Delete Data so the emails are still there in my Profile but they no longer show up in the tree in Thunderbird on my Mac ( OS 14.8 Sonoma). I had a lot of subfolders into which I had put incoming and sent emails on particular topics. For example I had a folder called Family, and inside that I had a subfolder called Birthdays as well as many other family related topics.  My last Time Machine back up is about a month ago but that would be good enough to restore from.  I tried ‘Import’ in Thunderbird but it only imported the main folders and the emails within but not the subfolders.  I have another email address besides the deleted one and if I overwrite the whole Profile with the older one from Time Machine it will lose a lot of new stuff accumulated since that backup.  Any help most appreciated </blockquote> <p>Can you just add the add the account back into Thunderbird?  Once you have an account you can point the account to the correct folder which you say explicitly that you did not opt to delete when you removed the account.  Problem solved without extra tools or trying to merge data that has not been removed back in somehow.  The can be done in account settings &gt; Server settings by changing the account directory to the correct one. </p><p>I assume you have now realized that all of an account data hangs off the account so removing it removes the agility to access the data for the account.  As you point out it does not remove the data, just you ability to access it. Sometimes I wish these folder trees still had the joining lines on them so folk would realize that the stuff is connected and where. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
