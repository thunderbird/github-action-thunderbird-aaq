The folders of mail are associated with account numbers in your preferences so a plain copy it not the answer.  Generally Time Machine is not the answer. </p> <blockquote> I have deleted an email account from Thunderbird and I did not tick Delete Data so the emails are still there in my Profile but they no longer show up in the tree in Thunderbird on my Mac ( OS 14.8 Sonoma). I had a lot of subfolders into which I had put incoming and sent emails on particular topics. For example I had a folder called Family, and inside that I had a subfolder called Birthdays as well as many other family related topics.  My last Time Machine back up is about a month ago but that would be good enough to restore from.  I tried ‘Import’ in Thunderbird but it only imported the main folders and the emails within but not the subfolders.  I have another email address besides the deleted one and if I overwrite the whole Profile with the older one from Time Machine it will lose a lot of new stuff accumulated since that backup.  Any help most appreciated </blockquote> <p>Can you just add the add the account back into Thunderbird?  Once you have an account you can point the account to the correct folder which you say explicitly that you did not opt to delete when you removed the account.  Problem solved without extra tools or trying to merge data that has not been removed back in somehow.  The can be done in account settings &gt; Server settings by changing the account directory to the correct one. </p><p>I assume you have now realized that all of an account data hangs off the account so removing it removes the agility to access the data for the account.  As you point out it does not remove the data, just you ability to access it. Sometimes I wish these folder trees still had the joining lines on them so folk would realize that the stuff is connected and where. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In the profile folder open the folder Mail, identify and open the ""pop.xxx.yy"" account folder which should still contain the messages of your deleted POP account. Copy the mailbox files (without suffixe) such as Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Archives  ... to <strong>Local Folders</strong> which are also located in the Mail folder. If you see file folders such as Inbox.sbd, Archives.sbd, ... also copy them to Local Folders. You may have created personal folders in the old POP account such as Business, Vacations, Family, ... Copy them to Local Folders, too.  Don't bother about the .msf files. When you restart TB you should see folders and messages of your deleted account in Local Folders in the folder pane. </p> <em><p>Ruth Nicholls <a href=""#answer-1795447"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> Maybe I will have to use the whole Profile from the last Time Machine backup.

Then it would be easier to follow Matt's proposal to add the account back in Thunderbird and point it to the corresponding old account folder in Mail. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

Having followed your instructions, I think I have retrieved all the folders and subfolders. They are all now in Local Folders. Not sure that all the emails are there, but I will have to trust that they are. I cannot thank you enough as I was getting in a panic about it. However, all is not quite sorted yet without a bit more help. Because, before I asked my original question, I had asked a local IT chap who knows about Macs to have a go at retrieval. Turns out he didn't know about Thunderbird, although he did get his head around it, sort of.  He decided to add another account, a duplicate of my gmail account but as IMAP. The original gmail account is POP. He then made the IMAP account download everything. It was very slow and limited to a certain amount of data per 24hrs.  While this was happening, I asked my original question on this forum, which you have solved for me. But I have now ended up with a mess, and many duplicated folders, many of which are not complete, do not have all/any of the emails or the subfolders. I think the best way to show you is for me to do some screenshots.  So there are 5, in sequence, showing the whole left-hand column in TB from top to bottom , with a small amount of overlap for continuity. If you have the time to look at this you will see what a mess and how much duplication there is. If for example, you look at all the Inboxes, you will see that each one has a different number of unread files, which implies to me that not all emails are in all the inboxes, ie the inboxes are not all identical. </p><pre>So I need to be able to compare them, side by side on the same screen, to cross check. I hope you understand. So, my question is, what can I do about this other than to compare one folder with the same one froma different bit of the tree? I can get two TB folders to open together in two adjacent windows, and make comparisons, and then am I right that if I delete from one side the other side will not be changed? not be deleted? </pre> <p>Is there a better way to do this?  Eventually, when I get rid of the duplication I want to also remove one of the gmail accounts, as they are the same email address and all incoming emails go to both. So is it better to try to preserve the original POP account, or go with the IMAP one? I think I have to make this decision before starting to remove duplicates. I confess I don't know what the difference is and which is better. (I have an iPhone and gmail works well on that with the app and through Apple Mail). </p><p>I'm sorry this is such a marathon post......  Thankyou if you're prepared to go on helping me. I'll attach the screenshots now. </p>",ruthnichollsphotos,false,0,0

You know what they contain and where they belong in the folder hierarchy. No helper in this forum can do this for without sitting before your screen, opening all folders and subfolders to verify their contents and to compare with other folders or sub-folders having the same name but perhaps not the same message contents.  </p> <em><p>Ruth Nicholls <a href=""#answer-1797443"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> So I need to be able to compare them, side by side on the same screen, to cross check.

And you can copy selected messages from one folder to the other (see image). I'd prefer ""copy"" to ""move"" to avoid moving to wrong folders and then missing them in the original folder.

Some people get better along with POP accounts than with IMAP, often because they began emailing with with POP accounts. Eventually, when both your gmail POP account and your gmail IMAP account have the same folders with the same messages contents, you could delete one of them. But since you also use this gmail address on your iPhone with Apple Mail it might be better to keep the IMAP account in Thunderbird in order to synchronise messages between Thunderbird and iPhone. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

Other accounts (server accounts, e.g., gmail) store messages both on a server and on the computer. IMAP keeps them in sync. You want 1) to ensure that all the messages in your server account are downloaded from the server to the computer, then 2) copy them to folders in the local folders account. Then those messages wil be on the computer no matter what happens to the server account (gmail). </p><p>To do 1, which you asked about: Go to account settings &gt; synchronization &amp; storage and check ""Keep messages in all folders for this account..."" Then click ""Advanced"" and select all folders. I don't know if that second step is redundant. </p><p>This next step may also be redundant, but I would check the settings just to be sure: For each folder with messages that you want to preserve, right click on the folder, select ""Properties"", go to the ""General information"" tab and check ""when getting messages for this account ..."", then to go the ""Synchronization"" tab, and check ""Select this folder for offline use"", then ""download now"". </p><p>To do 2: After that, copying folders from a server account to the local folders account is easy. All the folders that you want can even be copied in one step. You can shift-click or control-click or command-click to select multilple folders. Then right click on them, select ""copy to"", and copy them to the local folders account. Copying is quick. I tested this process earlier today and copied 2,000 messages in a few seconds. </p><p>You should back up your profile before you do anything and after you do everything. </p><p>If you copy folders now while the gmail account is still active, you will have to decide what to do about new messages arriving in your gmail account that are not in your local folders. One approach would be to create a message filter to copy them automatically to a local folder. Then your local folders will be current at all times. Oh, you would also have to create a filter to copy sent messages. Or you could wait until right before the gmail account is disabled before copying your folders to the local folders account. </p><p>Allmail: you may know that it holds all messages, including those in trash. Your messages have other gmail labels that show up in Thunderbird as folders. If you subscribe to allmail, you will have duplicates of all your messages. A common recommendation ion the forum is not to subscribe to allmail in Thunderbird because of the duplicates. </p><p>I don't use gmail and I am not an expert on it, but I believe that those statements are true and helpful. </p><p>Keep asking. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
