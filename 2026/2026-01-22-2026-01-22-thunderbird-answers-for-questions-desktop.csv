The folders of mail are associated with account numbers in your preferences so a plain copy it not the answer.  Generally Time Machine is not the answer. </p> <blockquote> I have deleted an email account from Thunderbird and I did not tick Delete Data so the emails are still there in my Profile but they no longer show up in the tree in Thunderbird on my Mac ( OS 14.8 Sonoma). I had a lot of subfolders into which I had put incoming and sent emails on particular topics. For example I had a folder called Family, and inside that I had a subfolder called Birthdays as well as many other family related topics.  My last Time Machine back up is about a month ago but that would be good enough to restore from.  I tried ‘Import’ in Thunderbird but it only imported the main folders and the emails within but not the subfolders.  I have another email address besides the deleted one and if I overwrite the whole Profile with the older one from Time Machine it will lose a lot of new stuff accumulated since that backup.  Any help most appreciated </blockquote> <p>Can you just add the add the account back into Thunderbird?  Once you have an account you can point the account to the correct folder which you say explicitly that you did not opt to delete when you removed the account.  Problem solved without extra tools or trying to merge data that has not been removed back in somehow.  The can be done in account settings &gt; Server settings by changing the account directory to the correct one. </p><p>I assume you have now realized that all of an account data hangs off the account so removing it removes the agility to access the data for the account.  As you point out it does not remove the data, just you ability to access it. Sometimes I wish these folder trees still had the joining lines on them so folk would realize that the stuff is connected and where. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In the profile folder open the folder Mail, identify and open the ""pop.xxx.yy"" account folder which should still contain the messages of your deleted POP account. Copy the mailbox files (without suffixe) such as Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Archives  ... to <strong>Local Folders</strong> which are also located in the Mail folder. If you see file folders such as Inbox.sbd, Archives.sbd, ... also copy them to Local Folders. You may have created personal folders in the old POP account such as Business, Vacations, Family, ... Copy them to Local Folders, too.  Don't bother about the .msf files. When you restart TB you should see folders and messages of your deleted account in Local Folders in the folder pane. </p> <em><p>Ruth Nicholls <a href=""#answer-1795447"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> Maybe I will have to use the whole Profile from the last Time Machine backup.

Then it would be easier to follow Matt's proposal to add the account back in Thunderbird and point it to the corresponding old account folder in Mail. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

Other accounts (server accounts, e.g., gmail) store messages both on a server and on the computer. IMAP keeps them in sync. You want 1) to ensure that all the messages in your server account are downloaded from the server to the computer, then 2) copy them to folders in the local folders account. Then those messages wil be on the computer no matter what happens to the server account (gmail). </p><p>To do 1, which you asked about: Go to account settings &gt; synchronization &amp; storage and check ""Keep messages in all folders for this account..."" Then click ""Advanced"" and select all folders. I don't know if that second step is redundant. </p><p>This next step may also be redundant, but I would check the settings just to be sure: For each folder with messages that you want to preserve, right click on the folder, select ""Properties"", go to the ""General information"" tab and check ""when getting messages for this account ..."", then to go the ""Synchronization"" tab, and check ""Select this folder for offline use"", then ""download now"". </p><p>To do 2: After that, copying folders from a server account to the local folders account is easy. All the folders that you want can even be copied in one step. You can shift-click or control-click or command-click to select multilple folders. Then right click on them, select ""copy to"", and copy them to the local folders account. Copying is quick. I tested this process earlier today and copied 2,000 messages in a few seconds. </p><p>You should back up your profile before you do anything and after you do everything. </p><p>If you copy folders now while the gmail account is still active, you will have to decide what to do about new messages arriving in your gmail account that are not in your local folders. One approach would be to create a message filter to copy them automatically to a local folder. Then your local folders will be current at all times. Oh, you would also have to create a filter to copy sent messages. Or you could wait until right before the gmail account is disabled before copying your folders to the local folders account. </p><p>Allmail: you may know that it holds all messages, including those in trash. Your messages have other gmail labels that show up in Thunderbird as folders. If you subscribe to allmail, you will have duplicates of all your messages. A common recommendation ion the forum is not to subscribe to allmail in Thunderbird because of the duplicates. </p><p>I don't use gmail and I am not an expert on it, but I believe that those statements are true and helpful. </p><p>Keep asking. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
