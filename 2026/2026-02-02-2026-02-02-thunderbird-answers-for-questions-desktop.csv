On your issue, I think I understand now. You are wanting the INSERT button on the unified toolbar, but that is not where it needs to be. Please see the two attached screenshots:   - one shows the panel for 'account settings' and 'composition &amp; addressing.' On that screen is a text box to check for HTML. Do that. Doing this sets the appropriate menus in the compose panel to show the insert button. - the second screenshot shows the composition panel. The two arrows show two places where you can click when you want to insert an image.  Let me know. I want this to work for you.  david </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
