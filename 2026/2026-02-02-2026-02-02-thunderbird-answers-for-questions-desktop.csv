On your issue, I think I understand now. You are wanting the INSERT button on the unified toolbar, but that is not where it needs to be. Please see the two attached screenshots:   - one shows the panel for 'account settings' and 'composition &amp; addressing.' On that screen is a text box to check for HTML. Do that. Doing this sets the appropriate menus in the compose panel to show the insert button. - the second screenshot shows the composition panel. The two arrows show two places where you can click when you want to insert an image.  Let me know. I want this to work for you.  david </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It is not and should never be the same password as you would use for a mail account or computer user account. </p><p>It's very useful if you share your computer with other people AND you allow them access to your computer user account so they already know that password BUT you do not want those people viewing your saved email passwords in your profile. It does not stop those people accessing your emails.

Maybe you updated Authentication Method but did not set up all the other requirements to enable it to work? Maybe you were using Pop and it stopped downloading in which case any of the following may have been applied by gmail themseleves - auto switched off the Pop enabled option - too many emails on server and they wanted you to delete them - a logjam occured with one email on server preventing download. Maye you had a VPN enabled - gmail does not like VPN as it hides IP address so they think you are a hacker and block.
