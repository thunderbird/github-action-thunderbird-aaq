On your issue, I think I understand now. You are wanting the INSERT button on the unified toolbar, but that is not where it needs to be. Please see the two attached screenshots:   - one shows the panel for 'account settings' and 'composition &amp; addressing.' On that screen is a text box to check for HTML. Do that. Doing this sets the appropriate menus in the compose panel to show the insert button. - the second screenshot shows the composition panel. The two arrows show two places where you can click when you want to insert an image.  Let me know. I want this to work for you.  david </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Port 25 is not the standard port for a secure (SSL) connection to an SMTP server. The default port is usually 465.

I think you should first try setting the port to 465 with SSL/TLS or STARTTLS (try both.) If that doesn't work, try port 25 with no security (this is just for a test, not recommended to keep.) If one of those works, let us know. </p><p>(I also found an old post suggesting port 587 ""with or without security"", so if the above doesn't work, try this.) </p><p>This is you email service's problem, not Thunderbird's.
