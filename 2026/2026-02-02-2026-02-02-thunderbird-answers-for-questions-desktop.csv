On your issue, I think I understand now. You are wanting the INSERT button on the unified toolbar, but that is not where it needs to be. Please see the two attached screenshots:   - one shows the panel for 'account settings' and 'composition &amp; addressing.' On that screen is a text box to check for HTML. Do that. Doing this sets the appropriate menus in the compose panel to show the insert button. - the second screenshot shows the composition panel. The two arrows show two places where you can click when you want to insert an image.  Let me know. I want this to work for you.  david </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It does not stop those people accessing your emails. If the above situation does not apply to you then the Master/Primary Password is only stopping you from easy access. </p><p>If you create a Master/Primary Password, then when you start up Thunderbird you would get a prompt to enter that Master/Primary Password at the start of the session.

Maybe you updated Authentication Method but did not set up all the other requirements to enable it to work? Maybe you were using Pop and it stopped downloading in which case any of the following may have been applied by gmail themseleves - auto switched off the Pop enabled option - too many emails on server and they wanted you to delete them - a logjam occured with one email on server preventing download. Maye you had a VPN enabled - gmail does not like VPN as it hides IP address so they think you are a hacker and block. I could keep guessing various reasons, but gmail does work perfectly OK for both Pop and IMAP. </p><p>If you want to set it up again then I can offer full instructions and what to check etc. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:.

But the biggest issue is if they are allowed to scan files for 'bad stuff' and perform an auto fix.  This can cause data loss. This is because they have no knowledge that a single mbox text file can store more than one email. If they attempt to 'fix' an mbox file, it could result in the the loss of everything in that file eg: Inbox and if any empty file synchronises with server, it can also delete emails off the server.

Some Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and I have come across some peopl who did not realise one had been enabled. Switch off VPN (or create  split tunnelling and set it up for Thunderbird to use).  Gmail does not like VPN as it atempts to hide your IP address, so gmail decides you might be hacker so it auto blocks access. </p> <ul><li> Confirm VPN is switched off </li></ul> <p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Do you have anything using the localhost? People who manage websites may typically use eg: Apache Xampp. You need to switch of any program using the localhost whilst setting up gmail. You can enable it again afterwards. I had to switch off Apache Xampp. </p> <ul><li> Confirm nothing is using localhost.  </li></ul> <p>In Thunderbird do these checks: </p> <ul><li>     Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li>     Web Content </li><li>     Select 'Accept cookies from sites' </li><li>     Click on 'Exceptions' button </li><li>     Enter this&nbsp;: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> </li><li>     Click on 'Allow </li><li>     Click on 'Save Changes'  </li></ul> <p>Whilst in that area - scroll to Passwords section - I'm suggesting you clear everything so forcing a new token. </p> <ul><li>     click on 'Saved Passwords' </li><li>     If you see any mention of the gmail account username = gmail email address - select the relevant lines and click on 'Remove' </li><li>     Click on Close  </li></ul> <p>IF you are <strong>not</strong> going to remove and recreate the GMAIL account: Exit Thunderbird - wait a few moments and then restart. </p><p>If you<strong> intend to recreate the removed gmail account</strong> then... I would switch off the following as it's still experimental. </p> <ul><li>     Settings &gt; General </li><li>     Account Hub </li><li>     uncheck this checkbox: 'Create accounts in the new Account Hub'  </li></ul> <p>IF you removed the account now create the mail account </p> <ul><li>     Menu app &gt; New Account &gt; Email </li><li>     Enter name </li><li>     Enter gmail email address </li><li>     Enter password - same one you use to access webmail </li><li>     Select checkbox to remember password. </li><li>     Click on 'Continue'  </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird by default will look for the IMAP server settings. They should be: </p> <ul><li>     Server name: <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> </li><li>     Port: 993 </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2 </li><li>     Username = full gmail email address </li><li>     Password is the same one you use to access webmail  </li></ul> <p>Outgoing SMTP: </p> <ul><li>     Server name: <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> </li><li>     Port: 465 </li><li>     Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li>     Authentication Method: OAuth2 </li><li>     Username = full gmail email address </li><li>     Password is the same one you use to access webmail  </li></ul> <p>Assuming all is ok click on 'Done' </p><p>Whether recreating he account or just checking settings and removed password.... </p><p>You should then get the gmail pop up browser type window. It will ask you to confirm you really are you and the then ask if you want to allow Thunderbird access to server. Obviously you want to allow it. </p><p>Then an OAuth token gets created and stored in the same place as all other passwords. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
