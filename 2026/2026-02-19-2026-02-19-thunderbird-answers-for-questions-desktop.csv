I just went through the entire process again as per your instructions (entering appropriate information) and still get the same error message:  ""Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account.""

'Cept I have not deleted them from server, 'cause, entire old server will soon be deleted... and good thing, 'cause I just had to recreate the IMAP account to the older server... and when I did, the Local Folders for that account re-appeared in the interface.  Perhaps the folders were only removed from the UI. </p><p>2nd try: Recreated account to old server.  Copied .thunderbird/profile/mail/localfolders to a location outside .thunderbird. Edited LocalFolders location, restart Thunderbird. Make sure all messages copied to LocalFolders. Delete IMAP account (and delete messages).  THIS worked as expected:  the local folders are still there. </p><p>My point is that the default behavior, if not dangerous, is certainly scary, as the messages are gone after Deleting IMAP &amp; Data, because my view is that Delete IMAP-Account &amp; DATA should ONLY effect the IMAP Account. </p>",shawn..,false,0,0
