Access Firewall and make sure Thunderbird is set up as an allowed program. It's important to have Thunderbird as an allowed program to ensure nothing is blocking ports etc. Please confirm you have set this up. </p><p><strong>VPN:</strong> Please check computer to see if a VPN has been auto enabled. Many servers do not like VPN as it hides your IP address and server thinks you might be a hacker, hence a block. Some Anti-Virus now provide a VPN and in some cases will auto enabled it. Confirm any VPN is switched off. </p><p><strong>Server Setting for the account in Thunderbird</strong> According to Greenby, you should not need to alter Server Settings, but it would be useful to know what server settings are currently set up for the account.

Those Server Settings do not look correct and error messages imply account name is wrong and so is username, so even if password was correct it would not match.  Nothing is secure. Account name looks wrong as usually they end with .com or .uk or similar and yours displays nothing. I do not know of any domain which has no dot something. I know <a href=""http://epkit.ai"" rel=""nofollow"">epkit.ai</a> and <a href=""http://epkit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">epkit.com</a> are domains already taken, but whether that's you or not I have no idea. Username is usually full email address OR the part before the @ but yours is part of the server name and not full email address. So something is amiss. Info from Plusnet etc says nothing can be sent without authentication after end of 2025. So assume Greenby will also use those settings as they claim nothing would be changing. </p><p>I would expected you to have been using the following secure and standard plusnet settings which Greenby say they should still work. In Account Settings for the account, I suggest you try the following. </p><p>Pop accounts server settings on the plusnet server used the following: <strong>Pop incoming:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Server name: <a href=""http://mail.plus.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.plus.net</a> </li><li> Port: 995 </li><li> Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> Username: full email address </li></ul> <p><strong>SMTP</strong> </p> <ul><li> Outgoing server : <a href=""http://relay.plus.net"" rel=""nofollow"">relay.plus.net</a> </li><li> Port : 587 </li><li> Connection Security: STARTTLS </li><li> Authentication Method: Normal Password </li><li> Username: full email address </li></ul> <p>When you have altered those settings, Exit Thunderbird, wait a few moments for background processes to complete and then restart Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
