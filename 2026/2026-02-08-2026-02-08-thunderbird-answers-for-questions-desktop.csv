If gmail is ignoring you, there is a problem somewhere in your account settings, not settings that you do, but settings that the server administrator (bluehost) does. And, server admin stuff is over my head. Maybe, someone here with that knowledge will add more info. I believe it relates to DKIM and SPF settings but, again, I am not familar with that. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
