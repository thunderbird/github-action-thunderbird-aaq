Your diagnosis of the issue— Surfshark blocking outgoing SMTP ports (587/465/25) to prevent spam—is a well-documented issue with this VPN provider.  Here is a breakdown of why this happened and how to resolve it permanently. Why Your Settings ""Magically"" Changed Automatic Detection: When Surfshark is on, it routes traffic through a different server. Outlook often tries to ""repair"" or ""reconfigure"" settings based on this new network, causing the SMTP server to change to <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>. </p><pre>Modern Auth Requirement: As of late 2024, Microsoft deprecated basic authentication for outlook.com, pushing accounts to use Microsoft 365 Exchange protocols, which often override user-set IMAP/SMTP configurations. </pre> <p>Use Port 465 + SSL (Confirmed Solution): As you noted, Surfshark blocks port 587 (typically used with STARTTLS). They specifically allow Port 465 combined with SSL/TLS encryption. Settings: Outgoing Server: <a href=""http://smtp-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp-mail.outlook.com</a> | Port: 465 | Encryption: SSL/TLS. </p><pre>Use Surfshark's ""Split Tunneling"": This is the best long-term solution. You can tell Surfshark to ignore your Outlook application, allowing it to use your regular, unprotected internet connection, while your browser remains protected by the VPN. </pre> <p>Action: Open Surfshark - Settings - VPN Settings - Bypassing (Split Tunneling) - Add Outlook to the list. Switch Protocol in Surfshark: Sometimes simply changing the VPN protocol from WireGuard to OpenVPN (UDP or TCP) allows SMTP traffic to pass through. </p><pre>Use Webmail with VPN: If you only need the VPN for browsing, use outlook.office.com in your browser while the VPN is on, and only use the Outlook App when the VPN is off.  </pre> <p>Summary Checklist: </p><pre>   VPN On: Use Port 465 + SSL, or use Split Tunneling for Outlook.    VPN Off: Ensure port is set to 587 + STARTTLS (standard for Outlook </pre>",Miran.H,false,0,0

The second one is the gold: in the Mail folder there are two folders: ""Local Folders"" and ""<a href=""http://pop.chebucto.ns.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.chebucto.ns.ca</a>"".  The first of these contains all the emails accumulated over years, divided into the  folders in my TB install, and the second looks to be the contents of the inbox at the time when my system went south.

You posted many words, but we do best in assisting when you give as much detail on the files and folders. Maybe it will help if you list the various profiles and what you want from each. thank you.

What is not clear to me is how to do this.  Tell me whether these images help.  The first one is the files under Home/David/.Thunderbird. The bt2p7ny9.default-release-2 folder is what is currently being used by TB as its profile.  The five other xxxxxxxxx.default release folders consist of 2 containing Mail folders, (with recent emails), and 3 which do not. (I do not know what these folders do, and have not asked.)   Now you will note on this first screen also, a folder named ""Profiles"". Moving to this folder, (so we are now down at Home/David/.Thunderbird/Profiles),  we get the second image.  The oot4skth.default folder has no Mail folder in it.  But the r0ozv5yg.default-esr has a number of folders, including one labelled Mail. (Third image). Within this folder there are two folders: Local Folders and <a href=""http://pop.chebucto.ns.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.chebucto.ns.ca</a>. (Fourth image). The Local Folders contains all the old emails, divided by the folder structure within the T-B program, (the menu which displays down the left side of the screen) (the 5'th image)(Is there any point in asking why some of these are folders, and others simple files...?); the other one is named after my email provider, and looks to hold the contents of the Inbox at the time the connection got broken. Have I provided you with what you need to direct me as to  what I need to do, to get T-B hitched back up to my email as it was before I rolled things back? As I say, I do not understand the workings of T-B, but it would seem to me that T-B simply has a pointer to its currently active profile, and what I need to do is simply update that pointer to the r0ozv5yg.default-esr, rather than its current bt2p7ny9.default-release-2.  But it appears that my innocent analysis is much more simplistic than the actuality.  If I were to copy the entire contents of r0ozv5yg.default-esr, and simply paste them onto bt2p7ny9.default-release-2, would that resolve my issue??  Or what should I be doing?  (And I am sorry if I come across as excessively wordy.  Are  the screen shots of File structure any better?  Some other format?  Any other things I can do?   It is frustrating: I can see the old messages in raw form in the files, but I cannot get at them using T-B, (which holds the means of displaying them).  But I am most grateful to you for your patient guidance, even if I am not explaining myself properly. </p>",dmaxwell1,false,0,0

You mentioned one you recovered with Cronopete as having five years of mail. Does that contain most of what is lost? If so, what is lost? if a profile has names you recognize and the names do not appear in other profiles, then those are folders to recover. write down their names and addresses for later. if you see names you recognize, but they appear in multiple profiles, compare dates of last updates and write their names and locations as well. The 57g.default appears as a possible profile to use.  </p><p>In thunderbird, you could click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll to 'profiles' click 'about:profiles' and then click the 'launch' button on the 57g.default to see if it works.

It is not clear to me what you are referring to when you talk of ""the 57G.default"", but your direction to the ""about:profiles"" in T-B proved to be the missing bit. I followed this, and brought up a number of profiles including the r0ozv5yg.default-esr, which I had previously identified as holding all the old mails.  Turned out that it had also been accumulating mails since the rollback, so I have a full and complete record in this one folder.  Now I stumbled on where I was going wrong:  I clicked on the ""launch"" button, and found that this brought up all the records.  Then I clicked on the ""Set as Default"" button for this profile.  This brought up a new button, labelled something like ""Save as New Profile"".  No!  Doing this only creates yet another profile, on top of the 6 I had already accumulated.  Don't Save anything; simply close T-B.  When you re-open it, it will open in the profile you were using, with no change in file name or structure, and everything is back to the way it was before the whole sequence began.  The trick is simply in knowing that you need to close and restart T-B after making changes.  Bingo!  All is back as it should be.  I am deeply grateful to you for getting me through this.

Microsoft consider all email addresses as alias. Microsoft now say you would need same password used to access Microsoft account for the email addresses. Whatever email address has been set up as 'primary' is the only email address you can use to send emails via a third party email client such as Thunderbird. So if you had two email addresses eg: <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> and <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, if <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> was the 'primary' then both <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> and <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> email address can only send - smtp - using <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email address.  To ensure you get emails coming back to the correct email address, you would need to set up the Hotmail account  'Reply-to Address' as the hotmail email address. If you only have the one 'hotmail' address then I presume it's also primary, so smtp should be ok. </p><p><br> <strong>Check this on computer:</strong> </p><p><strong>Firewall:</strong> Access Firewalll which might be the defaul on computer or controlled by an Antri-Virus you installed. Make sure Thunderbird program has been set up as an allowed program to ensure nothing is blocked. </p><p><strong>VPN:</strong> Check computer for a VPN. Some AV programs do offer a VPN option and in some cases I've discovered it gets enabled utomatically. Many servers do not like VPN and think you are a hacker as it hides the IP address. Switch off VPN or create a slpit tunnelling and set up Thunderbird to use it. </p><p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Check computer to see if something is using the localhost. Typically, those who manage websites will use eg: Apache Xampp - it uses localhost.

If gmail is ignoring you, there is a problem somewhere in your account settings, not settings that you do, but settings that the server administrator (bluehost) does. And, server admin stuff is over my head. Maybe, someone here with that knowledge will add more info. I believe it relates to DKIM and SPF settings but, again, I am not familar with that. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Using the Bluehost(Titan) webmail app, I can send email to myself and to my gmail account in Thunderbird. From Thunderbird, I can send email to myself using the new email account, but I can't send email from using my new email account from Thunderbird  to my gmail account. </p><p>I've checked Gmail's webmail browser to make sure and they are not arriving there either. </p><p>So I'm stuck. It works from the Webmail app on Bluehost, but not from Thunderbird. Why might that be? </p><p>Thanks </p>",johnk311y2020,false,0,0

Webmail is its own world and has nothing to do with mail sent from your PC. Receiving email servers generally compare the domain name (it is not <a href=""http://bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bluehost.com</a>) with the server itself (which IS <a href=""http://bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bluehost.com</a>) and then checks to see if that is a scam. Finding no integrity check that the bluehost server is legit for your domain, it rejects the message. Ok, my explanation isn't technical, but that's what is happening. This problem is not uncommon when setting up email accounts on web hosting sites Thunderbird is not the problem. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Have you read them? </p><p>Google uses DMARC, SPF and DKIM  you only talk of two  DNS entries you had to add,   have you got all three  they are all required by Google.  Additionally you have to keep your SPAM flagged mail to under .3% is you are sending marketing email. </p><p>What is the domain you moved.  clearly it is not titan.email as they are an emailing service provider and that presents another raft of possible points of failure,  such as is they are mentioned in your domains MX record.  EMail for <a href=""mailto:Bill@Google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Bill@Google.com</a> will fail if the source server is titan.email and that server is not mentioned in the DNS MX record for the email addresses domain.   Unfortunately everyone thinks this web stuff is a cottage industry and you can get by.  It is in reality big business and paying a professional to set up your web properties is a very good idea if you are in any way dependent on having functional web services, like a payment portal or ordering or in this case email. Take yourself over to this website <a href=""https://intodns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intodns.com/</a> plug in your domain and see what they have to say about how it is configured.  I would have looked,  but you have gone to lengths of withhold the domain information, so do it yourself. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

The dnschecker showed many issues that both my Doman hosting service and email hosting service thought were not really issues. In the end, I tested and tested it, recruiting help from both services to try and find the culprit, and then suddenly it started working. </p><p>My best guess is the DNSchecker is not 100% accurate and there was still some propagation left to do that took many days, or possibly many reloads to fully propagate until finally it worked. 5 days since I switched email hosts, and the last significant changes were made 4 days ago. </p><p>All's well that ends well I suppose.
