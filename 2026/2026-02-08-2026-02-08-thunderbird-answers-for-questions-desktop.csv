Webmail is its own world and has nothing to do with mail sent from your PC. Receiving email servers generally compare the domain name (it is not <a href=""http://bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bluehost.com</a>) with the server itself (which IS <a href=""http://bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bluehost.com</a>) and then checks to see if that is a scam. Finding no integrity check that the bluehost server is legit for your domain, it rejects the message. Ok, my explanation isn't technical, but that's what is happening.

Have you read them? </p><p>Google uses DMARC, SPF and DKIM  you only talk of two  DNS entries you had to add,   have you got all three  they are all required by Google.  Additionally you have to keep your SPAM flagged mail to under .3% is you are sending marketing email. </p><p>What is the domain you moved.  clearly it is not titan.email as they are an emailing service provider and that presents another raft of possible points of failure,  such as is they are mentioned in your domains MX record.  EMail for Bill@Google.com will fail if the source server is titan.email and that server is not mentioned in the DNS MX record for the email addresses domain.   Unfortunately everyone thinks this web stuff is a cottage industry and you can get by.  It is in reality big business and paying a professional to set up your web properties is a very good idea if you are in any way dependent on having functional web services, like a payment portal or ordering or in this case email. Take yourself over to this website <a href=""https://intodns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intodns.com/</a> plug in your domain and see what they have to say about how it is configured.

You might however find you antivirus has some undocumented limit, or your provider has a low message size limit.  That image will be around 30% larger when it is included in the email, either as an attachment or inline and using IMAP the draft would be saved server side so subject to the providers message size limit, whatever that might be.  Some ISPs still have limits around 5Mb (as did everyone 25years ago) others like Google opt for to the other extreme. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

There, the size of the attachment cannot exceed 25 MB. What could the antivirus have to do with it (in your opinion)? It keeps an eye on me so that no unwanted things get through... There is no option to limit the size of files sent - you can only limit the size of files during the antivirus scan (e.g. files larger than 1 GB will be excluded from the scan). </p>",nandit1958,false,0,0

Windows does an appalling job managing the content of that. Actually is does nothing automatically.  So antivirus starts messing with the files as they are written and then anything can happen.  Thunderbird will then write another temp file to hold the message before it is saved to drafts (usually every 5 minutes) or send again the antivirus comes into the picture making it's usual mess like a bull in a china shop really.  Then the email hits the wire and you guessed it,  the antivirus wants another go,  so it decrypts the encrypted communication does whatever it is that is does, puts it all back together again (usually correctly) and puts it back on the wire. This is despite the in memory process also being monitored.  So what does the antivirus have to do with it.  Everything really as nothing writing to disk or writing to the wire or memory is exempt from it's microscopic examination. Really nothing on your system gets to function without it's oversight and in many cases interference.  SO if something crashes, or a disk write fails, or any other intermittent or odd event occurs is far more likely to be the antivirus glitching than the malware it purports to protect us from. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
