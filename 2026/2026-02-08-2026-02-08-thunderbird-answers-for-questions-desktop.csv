If gmail is ignoring you, there is a problem somewhere in your account settings, not settings that you do, but settings that the server administrator (bluehost) does.

Webmail is its own world and has nothing to do with mail sent from your PC. Receiving email servers generally compare the domain name (it is not <a href=""http://bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bluehost.com</a>) with the server itself (which IS <a href=""http://bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bluehost.com</a>) and then checks to see if that is a scam. Finding no integrity check that the bluehost server is legit for your domain, it rejects the message. Ok, my explanation isn't technical, but that's what is happening. This problem is not uncommon when setting up email accounts on web hosting sites Thunderbird is not the problem. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Bluehost doesn't seem to know for sure, but they are more than willing to give me records to try out. Seeing as how the functionality has increased incrementally since I started tinkering with them, this does seem like the right track. Just not there yet. </p>",johnk311y2020,false,0,0
