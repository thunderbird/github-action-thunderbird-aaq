A possibility that exists with all web-hosted email accounts is that the appropriate security settings, such as DKIM and SPF, may not be properly configured, causing the email to be rejected. If messages to yourself are not being received, I encourage you to contact Bluehost tech support to investigate. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The bluehost online webmail works perfectly, so I assumed it was not their settings that needed adjusting. From my perspective, only Thunderbird is having an issue, so I assumed it must be a setting in Thunderbird that needs attention. </p><p>Was that a wrong assumption? </p><p>Thank you for the suggestion though. I will follow up with Bluehost in the meantime to see if they have any insight as well. </p>",johnk311y2020,false,0,0

With POP, received mail will appear on all three only if you do not delete until all three receive it. then, when you delete from one, it's still on the other two. A real mess. IMAP automatically sync's all of them. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
