But one day, either I logged out myself, or the system threw me out of that mail. I'm trying to recover my mail by trying on the correct password and email, but I don't remember my full name and most likely because of this I can't log back in. </p><p>Will any of the moderators be able to contact me via another rambler email so that I can provide the email I'm having problems with? This mail is important to me now. I don't know exactly what happened to the mail, I just can't log in to it. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",borjastepanovsb7871

Two are working exactly the same.  However the third email is removing messages from the inbox - no idea where they are going,  there is not an archive folder, they are not going to trash.  On the other lap top, they stay in the inbox.  They are IMAP not POP.  What can we do to fix this? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",1johnnyvanzanten
