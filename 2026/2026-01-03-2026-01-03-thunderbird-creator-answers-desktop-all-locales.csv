But one day, either I logged out myself, or the system threw me out of that mail. I'm trying to recover my mail by trying on the correct password and email, but I don't remember my full name and most likely because of this I can't log back in. </p><p>Will any of the moderators be able to contact me via another rambler email so that I can provide the email I'm having problems with? This mail is important to me now. I don't know exactly what happened to the mail, I just can't log in to it. </p>",thunderbird;passwords-and-sign-in;,thunderbird,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",borjastepanovsb7871

Two are working exactly the same.  However the third email is removing messages from the inbox - no idea where they are going,  there is not an archive folder, they are not going to trash.  On the other lap top, they stay in the inbox.  They are IMAP not POP.  What can we do to fix this? </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",1johnnyvanzanten

In the last couple of days I've discovered that I'm unable to send emails. I've checked my IMAP settings are they are all correct. My email provider is Telstra Australia. When I send an email I get a reply back ""An error occured while sending email. Outgoing server SMTP error. The server responded; Connection refused - OB119 .103.224.52.151 is  blacklisted in Abusix Mail Intelligence and then two lines of text prefixed by https;/lookup.abusix and further text. I checked with Telstra and after much checking they could find nothing their end. I'm not that computer literate and freely admit that this problem has bamboozled me. I hope somebody can help with this problem. Many thanks. Cheers, Chris </p>",thunderbird;send-and-receive-email;,thunderbird,send-and-receive-email,en-US,"",woftam02

But, two days later a message from the same sender comes into my mail.  This used to work very well but not now.  I am using SpamAssassin.  Items that match a manual add stay in my IN folder but are marked in the text as suspected spam - they are not moved automatically until I open them up.  Spam filtering is broken. </p>",thunderbird;junk-mail-and-spam;,thunderbird,junk-mail-and-spam,en-US,"",radiowhiz
