You might however find you antivirus has some undocumented limit, or your provider has a low message size limit.  That image will be around 30% larger when it is included in the email, either as an attachment or inline and using IMAP the draft would be saved server side so subject to the providers message size limit, whatever that might be.

Windows does an appalling job managing the content of that. Actually is does nothing automatically.  So antivirus starts messing with the files as they are written and then anything can happen.  Thunderbird will then write another temp file to hold the message before it is saved to drafts (usually every 5 minutes) or send again the antivirus comes into the picture making it's usual mess like a bull in a china shop really.  Then the email hits the wire and you guessed it,  the antivirus wants another go,  so it decrypts the encrypted communication does whatever it is that is does, puts it all back together again (usually correctly) and puts it back on the wire. This is despite the in memory process also being monitored.  So what does the antivirus have to do with it.  Everything really as nothing writing to disk or writing to the wire or memory is exempt from it's microscopic examination. Really nothing on your system gets to function without it's oversight and in many cases interference.  SO if something crashes, or a disk write fails, or any other intermittent or odd event occurs is far more likely to be the antivirus glitching than the malware it purports to protect us from. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I then deleted the compatibility file and opened Thunderbird. </p><p>The screwed up 100+ folders with dates added to the live e-mail interfaces disappeared, but the in the local folders, the situation is still messed up.  The local folders trash still has 6 folders in it, and when I tell it to empty trash nothing happens.   </p><p>The local folders below the outbox (under the trash folder) still have no directories (not all of them should, but the ones that should still don't have it available), and the same ones are empty, or missing large numbers of e-mails.   </p><p>So looks like deleting the compatibility file fixed those live e-mail interface issues, but something else is still messing with the local folders.   I don't get how that's possible if we're doing a complete replacement.  Any ideas? </p><p>Also, for the sake of completeness, I did NOT update the old machine to the 140.7.2esr 32-bit release since you said you thought that would not make much of a difference. </p><p>Sat here looking at the Local Folders on the new machine and comparing it to the old, and it looks like to me that something in local folders is not getting replaced.  On the old machine, there is a ""draft"" folder (looks like a paper with writing on it), 0 messages, 0KB size.  That is not in the new machine local folders.    </p><p>On the old machines, after that, is junk, trash (empty), outbox, then the folders start.  On the new machine there is junk, trash (with 6 folders in it, that can't be emptied), then outbox, then the folders begin (without trees).  So if the Trash in the new machine still has the same junk in it, whatever we are replacing is not over-riding whereever the program is pulling Local Files from.  Does that make sense.  Is there some way the new install could be looking somewhere else for the folders under the Outbox?   </p><p>Ok, so I went into the Local folder on the old machine (appdata- local - thunderbird - profiles) and copied all the files in the primary profile folder.   Then I removed all the existing files in that same location in the new machine and copied the materials from the old machine into that primary profile folder.  Restarted the new install and everything was still the same.  The live e-mail accounts correct, but everything in the Local Folders section messed up and unchanged.  The same un-emptied folders in the trash folder that can't be deleted, missing directory trees, etc....  I don't get it (but I'm not a software guy).  I'm thinking the only thing to try at this point is to remove Thunderbird on the new machine and do a completely new install of the program on the new machine, then swap both the local and roaming profile data in and see if that cleans it up.

Try to rebuild the global database. Or the security software is blocking activities to recieve. You already checked these synchronisation options , oke. </p><p><br> 1.deleting the <em>global-messages-db.sqlite</em> files are good to do for reindexing your emails. Close Thunderbird Open thunderbird profile map on that pc. Search for : <em>global-messages-db.sqlite </em> and remove / delete it. Restart Thunderbird . The program is reindexing the files ,It might take a while . </p><p>2. For the security software on that pc try to disable and re-enable that security and anti virus software. It means to do that same disabling and enabling also for the firewalls. And check the inbox for better connection now or take a test mail to that inbox. Leave it disabled for a while. Does it work again , then make that exception in the security software for Thunderbird. </p><p>3. To solve and configure this issue further is to check for outdated add-ons you can with our <em>troubleshoot mode </em>start these tools and configure for outdated or broken add-ons that can disturb the process. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird</a> </p><p>4. Situations can be there that normal internet and the communication to the Thunderbird software that Is blocked by the normal communication somehow between them , you might check. </p><p>5. Check for updates for Thunderbird or if this issue is still there after these fixes it can be a server sided problem or port issue try to change the old port number into to other numbers instead port 25 change that port number into 587.Take the latest release from us <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> if the Thunderbird versions are old. </p><p>6. Using these deleting option s for the msf.files from the program if thunderbird is closed l go from there and i do go on to that profile map&gt; Imap map &gt;or mail map ,it is good for the not readable inbox emails to delete these msf.files and then they bring back these normal inbox function s again by starting up thunderbird to see inbox. </p><p>Both the use of deleting the 'global-messages-db.sqlite files are oke to use and the other methods of deleting msf.files are there to get used to ,i think that deleting 'global-messages-db.sqlite is almost just as good as deleting these msf.file at this disturbing moment but let s stay at the first solving fix first before using everything and mix up all of it. If other ways didn't t help you to go that far to solve it go for a new reinstallation of these Thunderbird accounts. If you think it might be good to solve it with these above explanations, that sounds good and do it. </p><p>7. Telephone software does use other protocols and security certifications that are lighter than on the desktop environment. All three providers are having the same issue. It s good to check the antivirus software if it had a new update settings can be changed after that update.disable the connection with that antivirus software as mentioned above in the text to see if thunderbird needs that exception from it. </p><p>Smtp settings for thunderbird has to be good and be sure of using for each account that email adres at the smtp server settings before sending the new emails for those 3 providers one at a time. And your security and provider protocols has to get checked and likes to have up to date configuration.(ssl/tls). </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cannot-send-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cannot-send-messages</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cannot-receive-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cannot-receive-messages</a> </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
