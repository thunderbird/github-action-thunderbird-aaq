Then, after a successful copy, change the filter to 'delete' and run again. Doing the archive process this way ensures the messages are free from the account and the space used within the account is freed. Otherwise, if you just MOVE the messages, you are not achieving the objective of creating a separate folder from the account.  Be sure to do backups, as the archives are on your PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you set up plus addresses as aliases in gmail, you can send and receive it. So, a message from a person using 'emailaddress+joe@gmail.com, can be readily replied to as emailaddress+joe@gmail.com.  What am I not understanding here?  I do not see a bug here. the plus addressing was defined by an email provider and that email provider administers these aliases, just as other email providers administer their aliases. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

To function properly, aliases need to be defined in 'managed identities.' Try that and see if that fixes the issue. This is not a bug, and I want to help you get through the issue. thank you </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
