And are you OK with losing all those messages forever? </p><p>If so, simply select them all (click on one, then press CTRL+A to select all) and then press the Delete key. They will then go into your Trash folder. You can then right-click on the Trash folder and choose Empty Trash. </p><p>If this is not what you're trying to do, please clarify and give us more details.  </p><p>By the way, the Unified Folders feature will show all similar folders for multiple email accounts as one virtual folder. For example, all Inbox messages together, all Trash folders together, etc. Some people (not me) find this to be a cleaner presentation. But it's not necessary to use the feature to delete messages. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
