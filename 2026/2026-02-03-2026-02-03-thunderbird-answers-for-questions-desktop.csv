Archiving mail is a complex task.  Really one that should be left to an expert in the industry.  I am not one.  I know enough to know I don't know enough.  Unfortunately most of those trying to archive mail do not know even that much so instead of a robust archive they loose their mail entirely. </p><p>You are using a google account so you have to respect their limits on your use of the mail system.  That includes a daily bandwidth limit. The Google limits are shown here <a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en</a>   </p><p>Thunderbird is not some magic bullet that allows you to archive your mail because otherwise you will need to pay for online space.  Using POP as you are you will only download what is in the inbox.   not any other labels.  Are you sure POP is your best option,  or would using google takeout to get all of your mail in one go be a more reasonable option.  You get your mail in a zip file that you can import to Thunderbird if you want to (the underlying file is a Thunderbird native mbox file.  I have used the service several times now and it is painless,  if a little slow.  Sometimes days pass before you get the notice the download is ready. </p><p>Archiving usually means that you want the mail to disappear from the server to free space.  Have you corrected the google settings in gmail so that happens?  As a default they ignore delete requests from mail clients preferring to strip the labels from the mail and retain it in all mail folder assuming you really want oyu mail online.  Outlook do something similar. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
