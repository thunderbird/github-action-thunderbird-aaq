Thunderbird cannot have folders that are hidden from Windows. You are stating that if you go to appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles that there is only one profile.

My Local Folders were not stored in the Profile, but in a different folder, as shown in the screenshot ""Print Screen_Solution"". Right-clicking on Local Folders/Settings displays the path.
