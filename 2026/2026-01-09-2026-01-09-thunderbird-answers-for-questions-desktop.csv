It had 3 files in it and 2 other things. The files were Crash Reports 624kB, Pending Pings (empty) and Profile which was 1.60GB.    When I searched 'C' drive I could not find these. Only some install exe and files from 2023,2020. </pre> <pre>  Did what you suggested but it did the same as when I went to install Thunderbird again and wanted my e-mail and password, thought I better not incase it wiped out my previous set up.    Went through with it this time, downloaded all new e-mails but I do not have any old e-mails or sent e-mails or contacts or any of the set up I did have. </pre> <pre>   What happened was I went to upgrade to 150??? or something and it said to restart, so I closed Thunderbird and then started it up again but the short cut on the task bar when I clicked it said along the lines of this short cut no longer works.     So I thought maybe I should have restarted the computer, I did that and the same thing happened, short cut does not work or it is in a different place, something like that.     So that is when I tried to install Thunderbird 78.3.1 exe again. The original I got and it did the same thing I described above, wanted new set up (e-mail,password) done. </pre> <pre>   So anyway do not not know if any of that was relevant but any suggestions how to retrieve my old e-mails and contacts etc?   Any suggestions much appreciated. </pre> <pre>    Terry </pre>",terry691,false,0,0

Would you please do another screenshot of Local Folders that includes the path all the way from C prompt. The one shown just says Mail\Local Folders. If those other folders are there, my assumption is that we're not seeing the right Local Folders. That doesn't resolve the issue, of course. Did you check other profiles, per my earlier suggestion?

Thunderbird cannot have folders that are hidden from Windows. You are stating that if you go to appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles that there is only one profile. And the profile does not show the Local Folders that are displayed in Thunderbird. It just doesn't add up to me. Maybe someone else will see the discrepancy. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My Local Folders were not stored in the Profile, but in a different folder, as shown in the screenshot ""Print Screen_Solution"". Right-clicking on Local Folders/Settings displays the path. After a recent Windows update, for some unknown reason, my original folders were rearranged, and I lost the path to my old emails. The Windows ""search"" option helped me find my old ""Local Folders"", and I was able to copy them back to the correct location. </p><p>It seems simple now, but it took me a few days to figure out what had happened.
