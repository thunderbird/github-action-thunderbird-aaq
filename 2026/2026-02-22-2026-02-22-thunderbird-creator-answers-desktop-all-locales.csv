I have a <a href=""http://twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twc.com</a> account operating  with Outlook 2007 on an old Dell Win7 laptop.  It works great but too many websites refuse to recognize the Win7 machine, so I had to ""upgrade"". I just got a new Dell Win11 laptop and installed Spectrum email to access <a href=""http://twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twc.com</a>.  So far, so good.

Can't export them to <a href=""http://Spectrum.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Spectrum.net</a> as .pst because only Outlook recognizes that file extension. I do not want Office 365, so I tried installing Office 2024. But it's bundled with Office 365.  I even installed an old version of Office 2010.

Eg: </p><p>I a sub folder structure like so: </p><p>Trips - -Asia 2025 - - - -Hotels - - - -Flights - - - - - -International - - - - - -Domestic - - - -Parks - - - - - -Park 1 - - - - - -Park 2 - - - - - -Park 3 - -Europe 2025 - - - -Parks - - - - - -Park 1 - - - - - -Park 2 </p><p>I'd like to be able to be able to select a top level folder (such as Asia 2025) and see all the messages in it and all it's subfolders.  Effectively ALL the emails relating to the trip.  Is there a way to achieve this? </p><p>Second issue: I have a saved search folder called Flagged.  Right now I have to edit the properties of the saved search, then click ""Choose"" and manually tick each folder / sub folder I wish to show flagged messages for.  I know I can select the first, select the last, press spacebar to toggle those folders. But it doesn't expand subfolders, and it means that when I add more folders (which I do very very often), I have to remember to manually update the list of selected folders (on 2 machines too as i have this account set up in 2 places).    Is there a way to just select a parent folder (in my case i'd like to just select the account itself) and have it automatically include everything below that.  Then I don;t need to update or change it as my folders change. </p><p>Surely both of these suggestions are sensible and would increase the usability of Thunderbird. </p><p>Also,  how can I find out what folder a message is stored in from the message in cards view, the message detail panel itself or the right click menu of the message card? </p><p>Thanks, Neil </p>",me343;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/145.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;tb_version:148 b6;os:MacOS 26.3",0,0,0,,,me343
