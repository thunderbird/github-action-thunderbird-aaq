However, since two days this has stopped working for me. When i open the expansion tab, i get a message that ""the browser version is not supported. Please download the desktop app"". </p><p>Is anybody experiencing the same problem? Is there some kind of incompatibility between the versions that i am not aware of (both expansion and thunderbird are on the latest release version)? </p><p>If anybody knows a solution it would be really good.
