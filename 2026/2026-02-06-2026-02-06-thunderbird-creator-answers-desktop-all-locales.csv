I accidentally deleted an entire year's worth of emails.  I was in the process of archiving them, and mistakenly thought that the originals had been left in the inbox.  I thought I needed to re-archive them, so I deleted the copies from the archive folder, and then - this is the stupid part - emptied the trash in the archive folder.  When I went back to the inbox to re-archive the emails, I realized they were no longer there.  I have not compacted the folder.

I was very happy until now, as Thunderbird has a lot of nice functions that are easy to use. One of them is the integration of Teams via the Microsoft Teams Quick Access expansion. However, since two days this has stopped working for me. When i open the expansion tab, i get a message that ""the browser version is not supported. Please download the desktop app"". </p><p>Is anybody experiencing the same problem? Is there some kind of incompatibility between the versions that i am not aware of (both expansion and thunderbird are on the latest release version)? </p><p>If anybody knows a solution it would be really good.
