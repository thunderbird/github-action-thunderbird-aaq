I accidentally deleted an entire year's worth of emails.  I was in the process of archiving them, and mistakenly thought that the originals had been left in the inbox.  I thought I needed to re-archive them, so I deleted the copies from the archive folder, and then - this is the stupid part - emptied the trash in the archive folder.  When I went back to the inbox to re-archive the emails, I realized they were no longer there.  I have not compacted the folder.  Is there any way to recover the deleted emails? </p>",jimheard1;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:Windows 11;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/archived-messages""]",0,0,0,,,
