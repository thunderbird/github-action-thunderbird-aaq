Now, this doesn´t work any more. I get timeouts in the setup process. I tried both, adding through the account hub and without it, it just does not work.

Sulle impostazioni appare il serve corretto (quello ""nuovo""), ma quando spedisce spedisce con quello precedente col risultato che le email sembrano partite ma non arrivano, oppure finiscono nello spam dei destinatari, oppure tornano indietro (ed è dal report di queste che ritengo che venga utilizzato ancora il server SMPT precedente). Anche l'assistenza del provider mi ha segnalato la stessa cosa (ovvero l'uso del server precedente), e loro dovrebbero saperne un po' più di me, anche se comunque è naturale e generalizzato cercare di scaricare le colpe sugli altri.

I have a bit of a long story but hopefully this won't take too much of your time.  I have a windows 11 pc that came with a realtively small ssd.   I installed thunderbird and used it for many months.  then i cloned this ssd to a new higher capacity ssd and installed the new ssd into my pc.  i continued with thunderbird and my new ssd for roughtly 3 months but i found that the new ssd was glitching and was giving me problems.   </p><p>about two weeks ago i removed the cloned high-capacity ssd which had the three months of new emails and i reinstalled the old original ssd into my pc and have continued with thunderbird.  i also installed the glitchy high-capacity ssd into a docking station and i have it connected to my pc as an external drive.   So my problem is that while my pc has all my original thunderbird emails, it is missing the three months of emails that are on the cloned high-capacity ssd.   And to further complicate things, i have been using my reinstalled old ssd for  two weeks and have accumulated new thunderbird emails. </p><p>how can i copy or import the three months of thunderbird emails that are on my high capacity ssd that is attached to the computer now as an external drive.   Remember that not only does that high capacity drive have three months of emails that I need, it also has all my original thunderbird emails that it obtained through the cloning process.   so my concern is that whatever import process i might do, it is either going to cause a lot of duplication of the old emails or it is going to wipe out or disturb the most recent activity (my last two weeks) when one profile is replaced entire replaces another. </p><p>MY QUESTION: is there a way to selectively import just the last three months of my thunderbird emails from the high capacity ssd that is connected currently as an external drive?

So, here it is. I have one yahoo account in thunderbird under windows 11 home. At first, when I set this account and followed instructions, it worked, or so it seemed. But suddenly, it asked for a password when try to send message. I searched and found on the net to set authentication method to normal password. Did that and it worked. But now it starts again asking for password but not accepting it. For a while it worked with a password generated on yahoo site for thunderbird, but after some time it start working with the yahoo ccount password and now I can only get messages but not send. What is going oon with yahoo, is there a way to make it work and make it stay that way&nbsp;?
