I have three email accounts. </p><p>(1) Business, hosted through godaddy on an outlook/office365 platform (2) private on <a href=""http://mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.com</a> (3) private on <a href=""http://web.de"" rel=""nofollow"">web.de</a> </p><p>Initially, i set up three. Accounts 2 and 3 were fully functional (imap) from the get go. Account one had issues sending emails. </p><p>Yesterday I sat down to finally try to solve the issue. In my ""turn everything off and on"" mindset, i completely reset (or so i though) TB, deleted all three accounts, uninstalled TB, reinstalled TB and set up the accounts again, starting with account 1. </p><p>When i finally got it running i realized the issue was a checkmark regarding smtp authentification (also a known problem with office365 running on client software apparently) on the microsoft backend, and not on my computer. </p><p>After that was set up, i tried adding my other two accounts. Now, this doesn´t work any more. I get timeouts in the setup process. I tried both, adding through the account hub and without it, it just does not work. All the credentials are obviously correct, so is the imap/server data input. So i think at least.  </p><p>Thanks for any suggestion in advance. </p>",geo.kar;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0;os:Linux Mint,0,0,0,,,
