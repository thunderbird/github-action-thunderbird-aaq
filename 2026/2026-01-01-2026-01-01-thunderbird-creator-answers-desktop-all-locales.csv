I followed up with the add-on developer who claimed it was Thunderbird is erroneously rejecting the add-on.  They said ""Thunderbird itself checks the compatiblity on add-on installation at AMO, where the add-on version 10.0.8 is marked as compatible up to 144 at the moment."" I don't understand what the ""AMO"" term means. The developer sent me a modified version of their update, but closed the issue with ""Not an Add-on Issue. Compatibility check on AMO failed."" </p><p>It looks like the same problem is happening again. Can you please tell me if this is a problem with Thunderbird checking, or is it with the add-on? When will this type of issue be solved? </p><p>(I was also told by the developer that I might have changed some feature of Thunderbird from standard, but that is not true) </p>",thunderbird;extensions;,thunderbird,extensions,en-US,1790644;,itdcmy
