They said ""Thunderbird itself checks the compatiblity on add-on installation at AMO, where the add-on version 10.0.8 is marked as compatible up to 144 at the moment."" I don't understand what the ""AMO"" term means. The developer sent me a modified version of their update, but closed the issue with ""Not an Add-on Issue.
