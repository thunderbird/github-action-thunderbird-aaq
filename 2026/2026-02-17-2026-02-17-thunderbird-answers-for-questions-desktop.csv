If you are able to see the missing folders from another client, then resetting with Thunderbird should simply be to resubscribe. That global database just contains an index, but not the messages themselves. My suggestion: log onto your online account and verify that the folders are there. then, highlight account in folder pane, right-click and then select 'subscribe' and look for the folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
