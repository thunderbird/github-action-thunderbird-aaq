As I said, I have used the 'move to' method for over 30 years, with no problem until now. I'm an old fart (retired from the Air Force 37 years ago) and make no claims to being an expert on this or anything else, but to me this would seem to indicate that something has changed within the program. This is a disaster for me. I now have over 6,000 supposedly moved or deleted emails mixed throughout my inbox. And as I mentioned they are all grayed out like I had read them. But I cannot just attempt to delete all the greyed-out messages (assuming that somebody can shed some light on why my 'deleted' emails also came back) because there are also a good number of emails that I have read but did not attempt to move or delete them. I would not want to arbitrarily delete them also. I hope this is making sense.

Sorry. And I really appreciate you trying to locate someone with more IMAP expertise. I'm not sure what you mean when you say that I should log onto my 'online account' to see what is there. All I know is that I click on the desktop Thunderbird icon and it takes me online to TB. Yeah, I are dum. As far as my steps, well, I sorted all my emails by Correspondents, then looked thru them to determine which ones I wanted to send to local folders and which ones I wanted to delete. I selected the ones to send to a local folder (clicked on the first one, held down shift and clicked on the last one) and if there were any within that batch that I didn't want to include I held down Ctrl and deselected them, then right clicked on the batch and selected 'Move to' and clicked on Local Folders, after which I selected and clicked on the folder I wanted. When I did this the selected emails disappeared from my inbox and the total number of emails decreased accordingly. As far as deleting emails, I used the method above to select the emails, then hit 'delete' on my keyboard. With the same results. When I opened TB this morning all of the deleted and moved emails had returned and the total had returned to the number of emails I had had prior to deleting and moving anything, grayed out <em>but with a line thru them</em>. When I stopped screaming and crying I decided to close and reopen TB, in the vain hope that everything would be as it should. BAD move, the deleted and moved emails were still there, still grayed out <em>but no longer had a line thru them</em>. If I had not restarted TB it would have simplified knowing which ones to delete (though probably trying to delete them again would not have worked any better the second time around). I did check a number of the local folders to see if they did contain the emails I tried to move there and as far as I could tell they had been moved there. Or more accurately, for whatever reason they were copied there. I hope this explains everything well enuf, if not please let me know what further information is needed. </p>",hellnbak,false,0,0
