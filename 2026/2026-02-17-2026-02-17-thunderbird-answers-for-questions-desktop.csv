The idea of copying the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder might be a good idea.

Unfortunately, that does not work out with our network structure where we have split right to particular network folders based on the user and sharing those with the private accounts is not possible while using the private accounts would prevent the people from their actual work... </p><p>Thank you again!

Maybe in your case Thunderbird, depending on your settings for compacting folders, has done the compacting silently without asking you to confirm.

If you are able to see the missing folders from another client, then resetting with Thunderbird should simply be to resubscribe. That global database just contains an index, but not the messages themselves. My suggestion: log onto your online account and verify that the folders are there. then, highlight account in folder pane, right-click and then select 'subscribe' and look for the folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
