Personally unless you have the latest and greatest from Microsoft it will make something of a hash of your CSV files because in is only in the last few releases Microsoft have finally started treating unicode text as real text (it was the default in Windows XP).  Older Excel ""imported"" and ""exported"" it and made a mess in the process.  LibreOffice which is free has always been able to do this without the mess  part.

By that statement, you have already passed judgment that Thunderbird developers are corrupt. You make that statement, yet also ask for support. Seriously, if that is your belief, I honestly suggest you investigate TheBat, as it is not American-made and it's a fine client. There is also eM Client and Mailbird, two satisfactory and successful email clients, but they're not free if you have several accounts. Making such judgmental statements such as yours makes for few friends. This is a volunteer-supported site, no decision-makers, no coders. Just volunteers. As for helping Outlook users, I've done a lot of that in past year or more,  and biggest issue for many is transferring their PST files. As far as management decisions, Mozilla is unique in that they have millions of users, and only 3% contribute. With that, there is no immediate revenue with new users, only development effort.

Making it hard to transfer address books is at the heart of this discussion.

When my Google password changes it is always tricky to get Thunderbird to talk to Gmail.  But I don't ever remember being asked for a primary password again.

""The imap server <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> does not support the selected authentication method.  Please change the authentication method.""  I am using OAuth2 as my authentication method.  I tried entering my Google password early Saturday and it started receiving mail again.  I was ecstatic.  But it didn't last!  It broke down again.  Please help.  I've donated a lot of money to Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>Your donations are not in anyway relevant to support, undoubtedly appreciated by the development arm of things. But my efforts are freely given.  I am a volunteer and so is almost everyone that puts in an appearance in this forum. </p><p>There is essentially only one authentication method that can be used for Gmail,  that is oAuth  Your confusion regarding browsers and such is somewhat understandable as oauth is really a browser authentication method that Google have forced into use everywhere.  Fortunately Thunderbird is built on the same foundation as Firefox, so like a chameleon when required it can run with the need to be a browser and display browser pages,  which it does for the google oauth authentication flow. </p><p>For the Authentication process to work,  you must have cookies enabled in Thunderbird (yes it is a thing and is enabled by default)  the process also requires JavaScript to be enabled in Thunderbird.  This is all discussed here  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20</a> </p><p>When you use oAuth authentication Thunderbird never actually knows your password,  nor does it know the two factor authentication key that you may also be asked to insert that was texted or email to you.  Those pages are webpages served by Google and the posted responses go back to them. Only at the end does Thunderbird get a token from google which it uses to authenticate going forward.  While the token is stored in Thunderbird password manager,  you will never be asked for it.  This is an entirely automated process and storing the token in an encrypted form as if it was a passord lread to it being stored as one. </p><p>Most folk have issues with Gmail authentication because of their choices regarding passwords and security software.  The use of VPNs is becoming widespread,  but nothing is more likely to see your authentication with gmail requiring a reset that the VPN.  At a very simple level Google know where you phone is (I am sure their hacking detection algorithm is actually very complex, not simple.  But for this discussion simple will suffice).  Then you start connecting Thunderbird from somewhere else entirely.  That raises a red flag about you being hacked, your token is revoked and Thunderbird asks for a re-authentication. </p><p>Changing you password in Google should not affect Thunderbird as it is not using your google password.  Google might ask for a re-authentication by revoking Thunderbird token,  but there should be nothing inherently tricky about it.  Unless you have an antivirus that is blocking aspects of the process.  Unfortunately the only windows antivirus I am aware of that is not subject to regular issue is Microsoft/Windows  Defender. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
