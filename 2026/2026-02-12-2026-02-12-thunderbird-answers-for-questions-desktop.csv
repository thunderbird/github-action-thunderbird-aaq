You don't need ""pop-ups to see images in your emails""... My understanding is that you want to tell us ""why do my emails are displayed in a <strong>new window</strong> when I double-click them in order to open and read them""... and what you call pop-ups in reality are secondary Thunderbird windows. </p><p>Let's go back to your screen shot: what I see is a Thunderbird main window in the background and an email opened in a second window in the foreground. The Thunderbird main window has the ""Classic View"" layout (see my image), but it has no message pane. By some unfortunate operation the message pane must have been hidden. When the message pane is hidden the thread pane takes all the place on the right and you have to double-click on a message in the thread pane to open it either in a new tab or a new window.  I can also see that you activated the Quick Filter toolbar and that you made a search for ""suppor"" but I don't think that the Quick Filter toolbar is your first concern.  </p><p>I still think that before this issue occurred you used to open your emails by a simple left click and you read them in the message pane, which is no longer visible as the lower right pane in the main window in your screen shot. So I can only repeat my advise from yesterday: Verify that the <strong>Thunderbird main window is in the foreground </strong>(or in focus) and hit the F8 key or go to menu View &gt; Layout and select Message Pane (image) </p><p>Or is it possible that I followed a bad trail from the beginning and that you really only want to to <strong>view images you received in emails</strong>? </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

This probably won't make a difference, but it won't hurt. </p><p>- Exclude your Profile directory from your anti-virus, if possible.  </p><p>- Do a non-destructive check on your physical hard disk.

Using the full email address should be tried. I also suggest changing port 110 to 995 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - also, your other screenshot indicates you have four email accounts with the provider. It is possible that you have the wrong SMTP server set for the accounts. You did not create a screenshot of the SMTP server setting. You can check that with these steps: - click ';account settiings' - highlight the account name in question in left sidebar - now, on lower right side of screen is a button 'edit SMTP server'  click that - it should show the email address associated with that particular account. My guess is that it does not. I suggest also putting the full email address in the DESCRIPTION field for documentation, set port to 465 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - I also suggest repeating this for all four accounts. Each SMTP server pane must reflect the email address of the account, and your post indicated you are receiving message that it is set wrong.  </p><p>After change, please post back with any error messages and screenshot of SMTP server settings pane for the account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
