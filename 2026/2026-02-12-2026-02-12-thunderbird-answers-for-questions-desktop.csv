It is advisable to logon to your webmail account periodically to properly delete emails that have no label from the 'All Mail' folder and then empty the server Trash.

In this case I haven't added attendees, and wanted to send the message to someone who was not originally participating. Logic might dictate that I would add them as an attendee first, then message them. However, in our family we are informal about such things, so simply texting any changes in plans, and then sending the calendar detail as needed is more appropriate and friendly. I was simply pointing out that in other contexts (from the Events sidebar in mail, and from the calendar itself), the context menu allows sending an event as an email message - so logic also might dictate that the application provide a contextual menu with this option anywhere an event is displayed, including the detail view. As for opening vs. right-clicking an event - it is a natural action, at least for me and I am sure many others, to first open a calendar event to see the full details, and then do something with it. I discovered the ""Convert to ... message"" feature by attempting to copy the event as text, then paste in a message I would compose separately. I got side-tracked in this mission to copy the event by this super-handy feature. As it happens to be, if I had attempted to copy the event and paste into a message I would have been disappointed, though not terribly surprised, to find that I had obtained a vcalendar entry not the event converted to text!

You don't need ""pop-ups to see images in your emails""... My understanding is that you want to tell us ""why do my emails are displayed in a <strong>new window</strong> when I double-click them in order to open and read them""... and what you call pop-ups in reality are secondary Thunderbird windows. </p><p>Let's go back to your screen shot: what I see is a Thunderbird main window in the background and an email opened in a second window in the foreground. The Thunderbird main window has the ""Classic View"" layout (see my image), but it has no message pane. By some unfortunate operation the message pane must have been hidden. When the message pane is hidden the thread pane takes all the place on the right and you have to double-click on a message in the thread pane to open it either in a new tab or a new window.  I can also see that you activated the Quick Filter toolbar and that you made a search for ""suppor"" but I don't think that the Quick Filter toolbar is your first concern.  </p><p>I still think that before this issue occurred you used to open your emails by a simple left click and you read them in the message pane, which is no longer visible as the lower right pane in the main window in your screen shot. So I can only repeat my advise from yesterday: Verify that the <strong>Thunderbird main window is in the foreground </strong>(or in focus) and hit the F8 key or go to menu View &gt; Layout and select Message Pane (image) </p><p>Or is it possible that I followed a bad trail from the beginning and that you really only want to to <strong>view images you received in emails</strong>? </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

All I can say is that everything on Thunderbird had been perfect--regardless of whether I used the quick filter or not, and I never, ever, had to double click anything to read my messages and the images that came with my emails were always there.  </p><p>Also the F8 key you suggested I use to bring the Thunderbird main window in the foreground kept bringing me to the Apple Music app!   ' So maybe my keyboard setup is different than yours is.  </p><p>All I can add is that I continue to have this new and aggravating situation that I have never had for at least some 15 or more years now! I never changed anything, so that is why I feel the newest update, which I've been allowing automatically, has done some real damage to my Tbird email server.  </p><p>And yes, the main thing I wish to see is the images in my emails and that the email opens without requiring that second window. When, via wishful thinking, I try to see if my emails will now open w/o the need of the second window, it never works. Also, now when I choose to create a pdf from an email I received, the created pdf includes all these nonsensical technical details at the top of the page (not there in the original email) and shrinks down all  the images to fit that nonsense.  </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to add some more info, and if you can come up with any other ideas for me to try, I'll try again. If not, well, I'm sort of at wit's end to not give up and just switch to my iMac's Mail, which I never preferred when compared with Thunderbird. </p>",carolannemi,false,0,0

I am trying to help you at my best but you constantly misunderstand or don't follow my explanations. No, I did NOT tell you to hit the F8 key to bring the Thunderbird window in the foreground.

How can you verify that the Thunderbird main window is in the foreground?  Thunderbird is in the foreground when the Thunderbird menu bar (Thunderbird  - File  - Edit - View - Go - Message - Events and Tasks - Tools ... etc ) is displayed at the top of your screen, as you can easily see in my second screen shot. But these are basics and I do not know how to express my instructions in a more convenient language.

Using the full email address should be tried. I also suggest changing port 110 to 995 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - also, your other screenshot indicates you have four email accounts with the provider. It is possible that you have the wrong SMTP server set for the accounts. You did not create a screenshot of the SMTP server setting. You can check that with these steps: - click ';account settiings' - highlight the account name in question in left sidebar - now, on lower right side of screen is a button 'edit SMTP server'  click that - it should show the email address associated with that particular account. My guess is that it does not. I suggest also putting the full email address in the DESCRIPTION field for documentation, set port to 465 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - I also suggest repeating this for all four accounts. Each SMTP server pane must reflect the email address of the account, and your post indicated you are receiving message that it is set wrong.  </p><p>After change, please post back with any error messages and screenshot of SMTP server settings pane for the account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
