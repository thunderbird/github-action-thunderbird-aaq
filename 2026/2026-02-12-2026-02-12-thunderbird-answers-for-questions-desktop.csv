If it's their problem, it might be worth a call to them to see if there is a service outage. </p><p>You should also check with their tech support or help web page to confirm that your server settings are correct. Many ISPs are outsourcing their email service to other companies like Yahoo, and I am noticing that they sometimes don't bother to tell their existing customers! </p><p>If you tell us who is your email provider and your server settings (screen shots would be OK,) we might be able to advise you further. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

Hardware acceleration can sometimes cause display anomalies, and I find it makes little performance difference. </p><p>- Clear Thunderbird's cache ( Settings |  General | Network &amp; Disk Space | Disk Space, click ""Clear Now"" button.) This probably won't make a difference, but it won't hurt. </p><p>- Exclude your Profile directory from your anti-virus, if possible.  </p><p>- Do a non-destructive check on your physical hard disk. Sometimes excessive slowness can be in indication of a failing hard disc. ( Windows Start button | Computer | right-click on the C: drive, choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check now, UN-tick ""automatically fix file system errors, click Start.

Using the full email address should be tried. I also suggest changing port 110 to 995 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - also, your other screenshot indicates you have four email accounts with the provider. It is possible that you have the wrong SMTP server set for the accounts. You did not create a screenshot of the SMTP server setting. You can check that with these steps: - click ';account settiings' - highlight the account name in question in left sidebar - now, on lower right side of screen is a button 'edit SMTP server'  click that - it should show the email address associated with that particular account. My guess is that it does not. I suggest also putting the full email address in the DESCRIPTION field for documentation, set port to 465 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - I also suggest repeating this for all four accounts. Each SMTP server pane must reflect the email address of the account, and your post indicated you are receiving message that it is set wrong.  </p><p>After change, please post back with any error messages and screenshot of SMTP server settings pane for the account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
