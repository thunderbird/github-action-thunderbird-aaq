Using the full email address should be tried. I also suggest changing port 110 to 995 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - also, your other screenshot indicates you have four email accounts with the provider. It is possible that you have the wrong SMTP server set for the accounts. You did not create a screenshot of the SMTP server setting. You can check that with these steps: - click ';account settiings' - highlight the account name in question in left sidebar - now, on lower right side of screen is a button 'edit SMTP server'  click that - it should show the email address associated with that particular account. My guess is that it does not. I suggest also putting the full email address in the DESCRIPTION field for documentation, set port to 465 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - I also suggest repeating this for all four accounts. Each SMTP server pane must reflect the email address of the account, and your post indicated you are receiving message that it is set wrong.  </p><p>After change, please post back with any error messages and screenshot of SMTP server settings pane for the account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It prompted me to check my SMTP settings, where I could see that my full email was indeed being used. However, nothing was set under 'Authentication method', which I switched to 'Normal password'. This seems to have solved the issue! Very strange that it previously worked, and then became a problem. Very satisfying to have fixed though, so thanks again. </p>",tom239,false,0,0
