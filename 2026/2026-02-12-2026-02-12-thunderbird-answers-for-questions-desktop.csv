If it's their problem, it might be worth a call to them to see if there is a service outage. </p><p>You should also check with their tech support or help web page to confirm that your server settings are correct. Many ISPs are outsourcing their email service to other companies like Yahoo, and I am noticing that they sometimes don't bother to tell their existing customers! </p><p>If you tell us who is your email provider and your server settings (screen shots would be OK,) we might be able to advise you further. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

Try this: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder' - you are now in windows file explorer, click the back arrow once - you should now be looking at the appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles folder - open the profiles folder  - now, open each of the profiles there, looking for a file named abook.sqlite that has a recently used date. note the folder where you found it.  - now, in thunderbird, click tools&gt;import&gt;import from a file  - follow the prompts for addressbook until you reach the menu where 'sqlite' is an option.   - click the sqlite option and then locate/select the abook.sqlite file you discovered  - repeat the tppls&gt;import steps to also import a file named history.sqlite from the same folder as the one in which you found the abook.sqlite file </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Using the full email address should be tried. I also suggest changing port 110 to 995 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - also, your other screenshot indicates you have four email accounts with the provider. It is possible that you have the wrong SMTP server set for the accounts. You did not create a screenshot of the SMTP server setting. You can check that with these steps: - click ';account settiings' - highlight the account name in question in left sidebar - now, on lower right side of screen is a button 'edit SMTP server'  click that - it should show the email address associated with that particular account. My guess is that it does not. I suggest also putting the full email address in the DESCRIPTION field for documentation, set port to 465 and authentication to SSL/TLS.  - I also suggest repeating this for all four accounts. Each SMTP server pane must reflect the email address of the account, and your post indicated you are receiving message that it is set wrong.  </p><p>After change, please post back with any error messages and screenshot of SMTP server settings pane for the account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It prompted me to check my SMTP settings, where I could see that my full email was indeed being used. However, nothing was set under 'Authentication method', which I switched to 'Normal password'. This seems to have solved the issue! Very strange that it previously worked, and then became a problem. Very satisfying to have fixed though, so thanks again. </p>",tom239,false,0,0
