All files should be visible in Windows File Explorer as long as it is set to show hidden files. </p><p>My first thought is that you have deleted many messages in but have not compacted the folders within Thunderbird. You may or may not be aware that when you delete a message, it is marked as ""deleted"" and removed from view, but it still exists within the folder file, taking up space. It's only when you Compact the folder that the message is physically and permanently removed, and the file size will be reduced accordingly.  </p><p>A factor that some people don't consider is that Sent emails with attachments are stored with copies of their attachments. That could take up a lot of disk space. </p><p>Normally, Thunderbird comes out of the box set to prompt you to compact its folders when they reach a certain size. You can change that setting to compact without asking, or to not prompt you at all, in which case the folders will keep growing unchecked until you take action. Those settings can be found in &lt;Tools | Settings | General | Disk Space&gt;. So, have you compacted your folders lately? </p><p>As a precaution, I would make a backup copy of my Profile before compacting folders that are extremely unusually large, just in case something went wrong. The backup copy can be deleted afterward. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
