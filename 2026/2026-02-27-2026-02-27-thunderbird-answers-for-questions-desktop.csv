Setting the `mail.openpgp.load_untested_gpgme_version` setting to `45` worked for me a few weeks ago, though it seems like that is no longer necessary on beta builds at least (that is, external smartcard operations still work with the setting empty). Peeking at the code, beta builds appear to add the 45 version as a permutation to try out-of-the-box.

There you have the choice for messages classified as spam/junk to be moved to the Junk folder or automatically Deleted. Similar setting per account are found in &lt;Tools | Account Settings | Junk Settings | Destination and Retention&gt;. </p><p>Another thing to consider is that your email provider may be flagging the message as spam before Thunderbird ever sees it. If possible, when you are expecting to receive one of those messages, close Thunderbird and check your webmail and see if the message ever appears there in its Spam folder. I usually disable my providers spam detector, if possible, and let Thunderbird handle it. </p><p>I have many times been expecting those kinds of confirmation emails but the took several hours or more to arrive... if ever.
