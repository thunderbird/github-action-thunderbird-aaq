And need to get my emails that disappear  in transit . is there a spam folder on Thunderbird ? If so, how do I find it!! </blockquote> <p>You need to understand clearly that IMAP mail is a syncronised service to the mail server. You see nothing in Thunderbird that is not on the server either folders or emails,  so any idea you do not use your yahoo account is utter nonsense.  A breeding ground for false assumptions and incorrect ideas. </p><p>Yahoo mail has not SPAM folder, they call is something else.  In their web interface they call it a spam folder,  in their IMAP interface they call the same thing a bulk or bulk mail folder.  So Thunderbird for Yahoo has a spam folder called Bulk or Bulk Mail depending on how Yahoo are naming things this week.  But Thunderbird has that folder by virtue of what the yahoo server has, not independently. </p><p>Thunderbird does do POP mail and this is entirely independent from the mail server and in those circumstances it has a junk folder (although there are moves afoot from some well meaning folks to rename that as SPAM but so far all they have done is make an awful mess of folder names.)  However as Yahoo does not offer any mail they consider as spam to a POP mail client the junk/SPAM folder for that account is somewhat mute in this discussion. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

All files should be visible in Windows File Explorer as long as it is set to show hidden files. </p><p>My first thought is that you have deleted many messages in but have not compacted the folders within Thunderbird. You may or may not be aware that when you delete a message, it is marked as ""deleted"" and removed from view, but it still exists within the folder file, taking up space. It's only when you Compact the folder that the message is physically and permanently removed, and the file size will be reduced accordingly.  </p><p>A factor that some people don't consider is that Sent emails with attachments are stored with copies of their attachments. That could take up a lot of disk space. </p><p>Normally, Thunderbird comes out of the box set to prompt you to compact its folders when they reach a certain size. You can change that setting to compact without asking, or to not prompt you at all, in which case the folders will keep growing unchecked until you take action. Those settings can be found in &lt;Tools | Settings | General | Disk Space&gt;.

This folder, for some reason, was set as ""read only"" so I am assuming that this Windows setting over-rode the auto-compact settings in TB (my compacting was set for auto for many years).   </p><p>Somewhat alarmingly when I tried to turn this off, it would say ""read only"" was disabled on this folder, but when I checked it again, it was still active.  After experimenting and reviewing the permissions etc..., I was able to use a combination of turning off the read only attribute and, before hitting apply, also going in to the advanced tab and making a change there.  Once those two changes were selected, I hit apply, and the read only marker disappeared.   </p><p>Then, the applying attributes windows box appeared, and said it would take ""about 10 hours"" to apply that attributes to that folder (it was 331 gig).
