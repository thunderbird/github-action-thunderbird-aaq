It can only be fixed by your email provider - you can't do anything about it on your end except to contact them and report the problem. </p><p>The error message itself is misleading. The server's disc has probably either filled up, crashed, or otherwise gone offline. It almost certainly has nothing to do with too many recipients. </p>",rednoise,false,1,0

Bordernet was bought out by Skymesh some time ago, but this problem has only just arisen for me. All good now, and hopefully this might help others with the same problem. Thanks again.
