Outlook si je vede po svém, Thunderbird po svém a při synchronizaci se nepřekládají. „Opravit složku“ to jen dorazí, protože si složku znovu postaví z metadat na serveru, kde ty příznaky nejsou v odpovídajícím tvaru. </p><p><strong>Co je příčina</strong> Exchange ukládá metadata o odpovědi/přeposlání jako MAPI/PR_* flagy, případně v ExtendedProperties (tzv. PR_LAST_VERB_*). IMAP má zase svůj \Answered a \Forwarded. OAuth2 konektor v TB 145–146 nepřekládá MAPI → IMAP a zpět. Výsledek je, že TB při čtení nevidí flagy a při zápisu je neuloží do schématu, které Outlook umí přečíst. Kopírování zprávy v TB zachová interní flag, ale ten není uložen na serveru ve tvaru, který by Outlook poznal. </p><p><strong>Stav 2026</strong> Zatím není implementováno plné mapování MAPI „verb flags“. Na bugzille existují otevřené reporty pro „exchange verbs“ a „last verb executed“. Chování „Opravit složku“ (Rebuild) je konzistentní: přepíše lokální flagy daty ze serveru, takže všechno zmizí. </p><p><strong>Jak řešit bod 1 a 2 (prakticky dnes)</strong> Realisticky jsou jen tři funkční varianty: </p><p>1. psát/dokončovat vlákna v TB (145+) a nikdy nepoužívat „Opravit složku“ u projektových složek, aby zůstaly lokální flagy; 2. psát/dokončovat vlákna výhradně v Outlooku (desktop), čímž se flagy ukládají serverově a TB je zatím ignoruje, ale Outlook je vidí; 3. přejít na EAS/EWS bridge (DavMail, grommunio-ews apod.), který umí mapovat „last verb“ → IMAP flags. </p><p><strong>Bod 3 – kopie se symbolem jen v TB</strong> To je lokální flag TB. Outlook se dívá na MAPI a tam nic není, takže nezobrazí. </p><p><strong>Co s bodem 4</strong> To odpovídá variantě (1): nově odeslané přes TB se zapíší tak, aby TB viděl flag. Outlook to stále nečte plně. </p><p><strong>Co lze očekávat do budoucna</strong> Dokud nebude implementace Exchange connectoru doplněna o mapování „LastVerbExecuted“ a „LastVerbExecutionTime“ do/ze serveru, budou flagy mezi Outlook ↔ TB asynchronní. Vývoj TB v roadmapě uvedl, že „verbs“ jsou v backlogu, ale zatím bez termínu. </p><p><strong>Doporučení pro tvoji situaci (komunikační projekty + vlákna)</strong> Pokud jsou pro tebe klíčové symboly v obou klientech, nejméně bolestivé je: A) dokončovat vlákna v Outlooku a kontrolovat v Outlooku; TB používat jen jako čtení/reakce s vědomím, že symboly v TB neznamenají nic serverově; B) nebo přes EWS bridge (např. DavMail), kde se používaly EWS „verbs“ a flagy se uchovaly lépe než v čistém OAuth2 konektoru. </p><p><strong>Co by pomohlo vývojářům</strong> Aby byl bug uzavřen, TB musí implementovat: </p> <ul><li> čtení MAPI PR_LAST_VERB_EXECUTED; </li><li> mapování na \Answered/\Forwarded; </li><li> zápis zpět při odeslání (SMTP+MAPI update); </li><li> potlačení destruktivního rebuildu pro tyto flagy. </li></ul> <p><strong>Závěr</strong> Pro bod 1–3 dnes neexistuje čisté nastavení v TB, protože chybí mapování „verb flags“ Exchange ↔ IMAP. Výsledek, který chceš (symbole v obou klientech, beze ztráty při „Opravit složku“) vyžaduje změnu v TB. Do té doby je nutné volit workflow (TB-only, Outlook-only, nebo EWS bridge). </p>",poljos-moz,false,0,0

I reinstalled Thunderbird to solve a different problem. But before reinstalling, I created the backup profile using Thunderbird's export function. I did not delete my profile, and when I reinstalled Thunderbird my existing profile mostly loaded, but only about a third of my Inbox emails appeared. To correct this issue I tried to import the backup profile I had made, but it was too big to load. So I manually unzipped the backup profile file. </pre> <p>After unzipping the backup profile, I had an Inbox. file and an Inbox.msf file along with many other files. I could find no way to import these two files via Thunderbird, so instead I copied the Inbox. and inbox.msf file into the Local Folders mail subfolder and rename them 'Backup'. I restarted Thunderbird, and it created a folder called Backup that contained 38 emails. Since the Inbox file (renamed 'Backup') is 6.3 GB, it appears almost none of the emails are loading into the new folder.   </p><p>So I think I've figured out a way to import some of the Inbox file, but it is only partially working. If you have a second method, please  let me know. Thanks! </p>",Shawn,false,0,0

For some reason, Thunderbird suddenly was unable to log into my email server despite having the correct settings. The test connection in 'Server Settings' worked, but Thunderbird could not connect to the server. I knew the server was fine as I could log in using Outlook or the server's online login. So one suggested solution was to reinstall Thunderbird, which, incidentally, has not solved the issue. So now I have Thunderbird not connecting and lost email -  a real success on my part. </p><p>Anyway, I already tried the Repair folder tactic, but it did not produce any more email messages. I think the Inbox file was corrupted.  I'm going to try the ImportExportToolsNG option as a last resort. Thanks for al your help! </p>",Shawn,false,0,0
