The diagonal red-stripe in a circle icon appears when I try. And since it is directly under Local Folders like all the other years, I would be concerned to avoid putting 2024 within another year like 2022 if I *could* drag it. </p>",ronks1,false,0,0

When you say ""The Inbox on my Thunderbird emails shows 224 messages but do not open"" do you mean that clicking on a message does not display it? 2. When you say ""I have tried ... deleting but to no avail."" do you mean that clicking on a message and hitting the delete key has no effect? 3. Did starting in Troubleshoot Mode help? 4. What is your version number shown at Help &gt; About? </p>",wsmwk,false,0,0
