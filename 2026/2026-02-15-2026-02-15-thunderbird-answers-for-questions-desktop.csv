The diagonal red-stripe in a circle icon appears when I try. And since it is directly under Local Folders like all the other years, I would be concerned to avoid putting 2024 within another year like 2022 if I *could* drag it. </p>",ronks1,false,0,0

I have no idea why that is happening, but I am sure it is being done by Gmail, not Thunderbird. I suggest checking Gmail online to see if it is placing those messages elsewhere, such as the Important folder. And, just a reminder, the email will always be in Allmail.The question is to find why it is not also in the inbox, but elsewhere. My hope is that you will find the message online in a different folder and that may help you in resolving this. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thank you in advance.</em> </p><p>These kind of issues are and can be the fault of broken msf.files or outdated or broken add ons or extensions during the use of the Thunderbird program. </p><p>Try to walk along with these fixes to find out if this issue is really that and good to solve. What other email-programs are there? Can i ask? </p><p><br> 1. Security software on that pc can be restarted or reseted to find out more if it was blocking something there after just recent updates . </p><p>2. Go for the repair folder option in thunderbird. Go and click right on that inbox with issues and choose and go for the repair folder option. -right click on the inbox menu -choose properties -general information tab , click the repair folder buttons. -click on oke. </p><p>3. if the repair folder did not work that well there , then you can consider to use the option to delete the msf.files from the thunderbird map that is stored in and configured in the profile map ,going there deleting all these inbox msf.files and look carefully for more because there are more then one msf.files of them it rebuilds all of them by deleting them and restarting thunderbird and after to see if the inbox issue has finished now. </p><p>4.  Other option are to use <strong>the trouble shoot mode</strong> for the search of outdated or broken add ons and to delete or update them if found&nbsp;: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-mode-thunderbird</a> </p><p>5, There are filters that can be used that only show 'unread' messages, making the rest seem invisible on the software program&nbsp;: Press Ctrl &gt;shift &gt;K to delete certain filters in the quick filter bar.for windows.
