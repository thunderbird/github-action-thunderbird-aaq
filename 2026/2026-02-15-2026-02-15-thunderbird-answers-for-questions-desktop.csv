To eliminate the possibility the issue is caused by a simple factor such as an incorrect setting or an interfering external app.  Is your current profile one that has been used in many earlier versions of TB?  Sometimes the presence of an obsolete file can cause passwords to malfunction.  Adding the account to a new profile is one way to test. </p>,sfhowes,false,0,0

The upgraded programming of each new version is supposed to take care of that, or the programmers will have a lot of problems.  The fact is, I've never run across such a thing, and, in any case, it does not appear to have anything to do with my described situation.  The passwords are not malfunctioning; rather it appears that the program is.  It seems to not know that there is no password present, and so attempting to connect without recognizing that fact is an indication of a serious problem. </p><p>Oh, wait a minute, that clearly indicates a bug.

You would use that instead of the password that gets access to webmail. So whilst at this point you cannot enter it - you do need to create it. </p><p>At this point, I do not see that you have posted an image showing your current server settings.
