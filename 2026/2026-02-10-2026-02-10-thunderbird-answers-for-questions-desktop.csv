Yet regarding the screenshot with the Thunderbird folder pane I still wonder which of your accounts displays <strong>only</strong> ""Sent and Deleted Folders"" as you stated in your first message. I do see the @Oakdene account which indeed displays only the Inbox, Deleted and Spam folders. If this is the newly created account and if it is a POP account it is normal that in the beginning only Inbox and Deleted will be displayed. That's the default behaviour with new POP accounts in Thunderbird. A Sent folder will be created when you send your first message from this account, the Spam folder is created when you activate the Spam filter in Account Settings, the Drafts folder when you save a message as a draft, the Archives folder when you archive a message, ....etc  </p><p>Your second image seems to show the same account set up on your smartphone, and probably it is set up using the IMAP protocol.  Now the question is: did you really set up this account in Thunderbird using the IMAP or the POP protocol? If you used POP there will be no automatic synchronisation with the same account on the smartphone. If you used IMAP you'll have to open the ""Subscribe"" popup - as david already proposed in his first reply - and select the folders to be displayed. You said that you tried but to no avail ...
