Also, the donation request is a standing request, as your copy of Thunderbird is unaware of your donation. To keep Thunderbird active and supported, donations are needed on a regular basis, so the request is always realistic. That is, although your donation is much appreciated, we hope you will do this periodically. To remove the donation request, you can click to settings&gt;general and untick the startup page. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
