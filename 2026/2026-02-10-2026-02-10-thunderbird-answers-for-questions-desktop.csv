When I create a new filter, and select 'Date' and 'is' (to 'Match all of the following'), and then specify '2023', it insists on the date being '01/01/1970' or insists on that format.

Then, after a successful copy, change the filter to 'delete' and run again. Doing the archive process this way ensures the messages are free from the account and the space used within the account is freed. Otherwise, if you just MOVE the messages, you are not achieving the objective of creating a separate folder from the account.  Be sure to do backups, as the archives are on your PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Even if you see them on your laptop, they may not be subscribed for syncing with other devices. Here are the basic steps to fix this: Check folder subscriptions (IMAP) If you're using Outlook on a laptop, new folders may be created locally but not subscribed for IMAP syncing: Right-click your email account (or Inbox) in your desktop version of Outlook. Select IMAP Folders... Click the Query button to refresh the list. Find the new folders in the list, select them, and click Subscribe. Click OK and wait for syncing to complete. Mobile App Features Depending on your app, folders may simply be hidden by the interface: Outlook Mobile: Click your profile icon in the upper left corner. If there's no expand arrow next to your Inbox, try clicking the folder icon at the bottom of the menu or adding the folder to Favorites on your computer—this will ensure it appears in the mobile app. Apple Mail (iPhone): Sometimes folders don't open when you click their name. Try clicking the small blue arrow (&gt;) to the right of the parent folder name. Gmail (Android): Make sure global sync is enabled in your account settings (Settings &gt; Account &gt; Use Gmail sync). Resetting an account on your phone If folders are subscribed and visible in the web interface (for example, in a browser), but not on your phone, try forcing a connection refresh: In the Outlook app on your phone, go to Settings, select your account, and click Reset Account. If that doesn't work, remove the account from your phone and re-add it. This will force the app to redownload all the folder structures from the server. What email app do you use on your phone (Outlook, Apple Mail, Gmail) and what type of email do you have (Gmail, <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, corporate email)? This will help us provide more precise instructions. </p><p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!  <strong>Best regards,Henry.M</strong> </p>",Miran.H,false,0,0
