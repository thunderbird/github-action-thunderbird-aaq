Have been using Firefox/Tbird many years. Stopped being able to access old email address of 25 years a couple days ago. When opened Tbird would always got to old email and say ""couldn't log in"" or something. Would cancel out of that twice, click on new address and collect new address email. Old email was always there, used it as reference during transition. At settings chose new as default and deleted old address. Looks like the boxes checked would not have deleted old email but it's gone. 3500+ of them. No warning, message, choice, nothing. took zero time. Cannot change in Mozilla login to new email address. Tried Tbird import tool, could seem to figure it out. Also need to update email in Mozilla. Help.
