They are completely different things and to be honest I feel any attempt to manually menage spam with filters is destined to complete failure but will consume inordinate amounts of time. </p><p>Each mail account maintains a msgfiltersrules.dat file within it account folders in your profile  With careful editing these text files can be bulk updated using a basic text editor (not a word processor)   The first criteria is Thunderbird must not be running in any way when you are meddling in the profile folder.  Bad things hempen if it is.  The second thing is make plenty of backups because as I said careful editing,  that means there is lots that can go wrong.  But if you change one and save it and copy the change in a find and replace you should get the outcome you seek.  But remember find and replace will replace every instance it sees of that text string.  SO backup so you can recover if it does not work how you expect. </p><p>A full profile backup might be germane,  as messing up filters can mess up stored mail in a folder you apply it against. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In my attached screen image, if you point your mouse pointer directly at the horizontal line separating the list of messages from the ""message preview pane"", (this specific point is indicated on the attached screen image with a red circle located between the two red arrows) then your mouse pointer should transform from a normal pointer arrow into a double arrow.  While your mouse pointer is a double arrow, you can then click and drag up or down, thereby enlarging or shrinking the size of the preview pane.  If you drag all the way down, then the preview pane will be entirely removed, but can be restored by pointing at the same line and dragging upwards.   </p><p>If you have a relatively small screen, or if your display resolution is set to be relatively small (smaller resolution results in everything being drawn larger on the screen) then you may find that use of the preview pane is not practical, as you may need to use all available space for simply navigating through the list of messages.  In this case, you may find it to be more useful to view a message in a new tab or new window rather than viewing the message in the preview pane. </p><p>To view a message in a new tab or window, in the list of messages, simply click on the message entry once so as to highlight that particular message entry, and then press the ""enter"" key on the keyboard.  Alternatively, right-click on a given message entry which will pop up a contextual menu from which you may elect to ""open message in new tab"" or ""open message in new window.""  </p><p>If you do open messages in new tabs, you should take care to close each tab when done, otherwise, you will end up with multiple tabs open all at once, which can be confusing, and can make it difficult to find your main ""All Folders"" folder tree from which you select your inbox, sent, trash, etc, as after all, the main folder tree itself also occupies a tab.  When too many tabs are open at the same time, it becomes difficult to find a particular tab. </p><p>As mentioned above, when you press the keyboard's ""enter"" key after highlight a given messages in the list of messages, that message will then be displayed in a new tab, or conversely, in a new window.  If you have a preference for a new tab or a new window, you may configure that preference in the ""Reading &amp; Display"" sub-section of the ""General"" section of the Thunderbird settings. </p><p>I hope this helps! </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

So do not complain when you have exactly the same introductory information shoved your way,  or someone assume you know a lot more than you do and start assuming you know how things work when you do not. </p><p>How sub folders are downloaded depends a lot on the server implementation of IMAP.  This is especially true of those using the Microsoft version and the google version,  neither of which actually work as anything more than some sort of emulation of IMAP with special quirks for each implementation.  I seem to recall something about Bugs in Exchange meaning only top level IMAP folder get synced or the top two levels for exchange/office360/ Hotmail etc.   Google actually have server side settings for IMAP that can get in the way when you want full copie0 have you checked those if relevant? Then there is the Yahoo implementation that just stops working when the number of mails in the account exceeds 10,000.   I suggest you offer explicit details of the provider, how long you have had the account in Thunderbird,  the number of other accounts you have, how frequently you have Thunderbird checking mail for each account.  Some folk invite disaster by setting this to one or two minutes and then seek support because it takes so long to complete it never actually does before it starts again. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In theory this might help disable the encryption, because after all, encryption to the recipient in this case is not possible because Thunderbird does not have a PGP key for this recipient.  However, no joy, upon testing with these new settings, Thunderbird is still encrypting the message, somehow. </p><p>Also, it should be noted, although the message is encrypted, it can't be decrypted, presumably because there was no valid key against which to encrypted it in the first place.

It turns out that I was confused by Mozilla's awful user interface design which misled me into believing that opening the template would actually open the template, but instead it turns out that opening the template actually opens a portal to some alternate dimension in which opening the template actually instantiates a new e-mail object from the template...   </p><p>It turns out that when I choose the menu option for ""Edit Template"" I then discover that the template has the ""Encrypt"" button selected, and the ""Encrypt"" button can not be deselected.

The correct value depends a lot of the video driver installed on the system and the capability of the video card installed on that device.  Generally you turn it off if things get blurry or render in an odd manner but otherwise on makes video and some other functions happen faster.  I lost the argument for it to be defaulted to off some 10 years ago.  The argument is they (firefox) don't test the off default only the on one and as it is a Firefox feature Thunderbird developers really do nothing except set the initial default value. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
