In looking at this again, I think the most likely reason you can't create a new folder will be that Thunderbird is unable to log into your e-mail account.  For example, perhaps your username or password is not entered correctly in the Thunderbird settings.  Further explanation follows: </p><p>It would help narrow down the problem if you can check if this problem is limited to creating new folders in your e-mail account, or if you are also unable to create new folders in your ""local folders."" </p><p>In the Thunderbird ""folder tree"" in which you are presented with your various folders, (Inbox, Drafts, Sent, etc) you should have an entry named ""Local Folders"" and also an entry whose name is your e-mail account address.  These entries represent the ""root level"", respectively, of your local folders and your e-mail account folders. </p><p>If you right-click on the ""Local Folders"" root entry then you should be able to create a new folder within the ""Local Folders,"" and likewise, right-clicking on the e-mail account root entry should allow you to create a new folder within the e-mail account. </p><p>If you are not able to create a new folder within ""Local Folders"", then perhaps your computer has run out of disk space, or, perhaps there is some other weird problem happening with your Thunderbird installation. </p><p>If you ARE able to create a new folder within ""Local Folders"", but you are NOT able to create a new folder within your e-mail account, then perhaps your e-mail account has run out of storage space, or perhaps your e-mail account is simply configured to deny you permission to create a new folder, or, perhaps there is a configuration problem whereby your e-mail account login settings (POP or IMAP settings, port numbers, username/password, etc) are not all set correctly per the instructions published by your e-mail account provider. </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

They are completely different things and to be honest I feel any attempt to manually menage spam with filters is destined to complete failure but will consume inordinate amounts of time. </p><p>Each mail account maintains a msgfiltersrules.dat file within it account folders in your profile  With careful editing these text files can be bulk updated using a basic text editor (not a word processor)   The first criteria is Thunderbird must not be running in any way when you are meddling in the profile folder.  Bad things hempen if it is.  The second thing is make plenty of backups because as I said careful editing,  that means there is lots that can go wrong.  But if you change one and save it and copy the change in a find and replace you should get the outcome you seek.  But remember find and replace will replace every instance it sees of that text string.  SO backup so you can recover if it does not work how you expect. </p><p>A full profile backup might be germane,  as messing up filters can mess up stored mail in a folder you apply it against. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In my attached screen image, if you point your mouse pointer directly at the horizontal line separating the list of messages from the ""message preview pane"", (this specific point is indicated on the attached screen image with a red circle located between the two red arrows) then your mouse pointer should transform from a normal pointer arrow into a double arrow.  While your mouse pointer is a double arrow, you can then click and drag up or down, thereby enlarging or shrinking the size of the preview pane.  If you drag all the way down, then the preview pane will be entirely removed, but can be restored by pointing at the same line and dragging upwards.   </p><p>If you have a relatively small screen, or if your display resolution is set to be relatively small (smaller resolution results in everything being drawn larger on the screen) then you may find that use of the preview pane is not practical, as you may need to use all available space for simply navigating through the list of messages.  In this case, you may find it to be more useful to view a message in a new tab or new window rather than viewing the message in the preview pane. </p><p>To view a message in a new tab or window, in the list of messages, simply click on the message entry once so as to highlight that particular message entry, and then press the ""enter"" key on the keyboard.  Alternatively, right-click on a given message entry which will pop up a contextual menu from which you may elect to ""open message in new tab"" or ""open message in new window.""  </p><p>If you do open messages in new tabs, you should take care to close each tab when done, otherwise, you will end up with multiple tabs open all at once, which can be confusing, and can make it difficult to find your main ""All Folders"" folder tree from which you select your inbox, sent, trash, etc, as after all, the main folder tree itself also occupies a tab.  When too many tabs are open at the same time, it becomes difficult to find a particular tab. </p><p>As mentioned above, when you press the keyboard's ""enter"" key after highlight a given messages in the list of messages, that message will then be displayed in a new tab, or conversely, in a new window.  If you have a preference for a new tab or a new window, you may configure that preference in the ""Reading &amp; Display"" sub-section of the ""General"" section of the Thunderbird settings. </p><p>I hope this helps! </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

So do not complain when you have exactly the same introductory information shoved your way,  or someone assume you know a lot more than you do and start assuming you know how things work when you do not. </p><p>How sub folders are downloaded depends a lot on the server implementation of IMAP.  This is especially true of those using the Microsoft version and the google version,  neither of which actually work as anything more than some sort of emulation of IMAP with special quirks for each implementation.  I seem to recall something about Bugs in Exchange meaning only top level IMAP folder get synced or the top two levels for exchange/office360/ Hotmail etc.   Google actually have server side settings for IMAP that can get in the way when you want full copie0 have you checked those if relevant? Then there is the Yahoo implementation that just stops working when the number of mails in the account exceeds 10,000.   I suggest you offer explicit details of the provider, how long you have had the account in Thunderbird,  the number of other accounts you have, how frequently you have Thunderbird checking mail for each account.

In theory this might help disable the encryption, because after all, encryption to the recipient in this case is not possible because Thunderbird does not have a PGP key for this recipient.  However, no joy, upon testing with these new settings, Thunderbird is still encrypting the message, somehow. </p><p>Also, it should be noted, although the message is encrypted, it can't be decrypted, presumably because there was no valid key against which to encrypted it in the first place.

Your diagnosis of the issue— Surfshark blocking outgoing SMTP ports (587/465/25) to prevent spam—is a well-documented issue with this VPN provider.  Here is a breakdown of why this happened and how to resolve it permanently. Why Your Settings ""Magically"" Changed Automatic Detection: When Surfshark is on, it routes traffic through a different server. Outlook often tries to ""repair"" or ""reconfigure"" settings based on this new network, causing the SMTP server to change to <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>. </p><pre>Modern Auth Requirement: As of late 2024, Microsoft deprecated basic authentication for <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, pushing accounts to use Microsoft 365 Exchange protocols, which often override user-set IMAP/SMTP configurations. </pre> <p>Use Port 465 + SSL (Confirmed Solution): As you noted, Surfshark blocks port 587 (typically used with STARTTLS). They specifically allow Port 465 combined with SSL/TLS encryption. Settings: Outgoing Server: <a href=""http://smtp-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp-mail.outlook.com</a> | Port: 465 | Encryption: SSL/TLS. </p><pre>Use Surfshark's ""Split Tunneling"": This is the best long-term solution. You can tell Surfshark to ignore your Outlook application, allowing it to use your regular, unprotected internet connection, while your browser remains protected by the VPN. </pre> <p>Action: Open Surfshark - Settings - VPN Settings - Bypassing (Split Tunneling) - Add Outlook to the list. Switch Protocol in Surfshark: Sometimes simply changing the VPN protocol from WireGuard to OpenVPN (UDP or TCP) allows SMTP traffic to pass through. </p><pre>Use Webmail with VPN: If you only need the VPN for browsing, use <a href=""http://outlook.office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office.com</a> in your browser while the VPN is on, and only use the Outlook App when the VPN is off.  </pre> <p>Summary Checklist: </p><pre>   VPN On: Use Port 465 + SSL, or use Split Tunneling for Outlook.    VPN Off: Ensure port is set to 587 + STARTTLS (standard for Outlook </pre>",Miran.H,false,0,0

What is not clear to me is how to do this.  Tell me whether these images help.  The first one is the files under Home/David/.Thunderbird. The bt2p7ny9.default-release-2 folder is what is currently being used by TB as its profile.  The five other xxxxxxxxx.default release folders consist of 2 containing Mail folders, (with recent emails), and 3 which do not. (I do not know what these folders do, and have not asked.)   Now you will note on this first screen also, a folder named ""Profiles"". Moving to this folder, (so we are now down at Home/David/.Thunderbird/Profiles),  we get the second image.  The oot4skth.default folder has no Mail folder in it.  But the r0ozv5yg.default-esr has a number of folders, including one labelled Mail. (Third image). Within this folder there are two folders: Local Folders and <a href=""http://pop.chebucto.ns.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.chebucto.ns.ca</a>. (Fourth image). The Local Folders contains all the old emails, divided by the folder structure within the T-B program, (the menu which displays down the left side of the screen) (the 5'th image)(Is there any point in asking why some of these are folders, and others simple files...?); the other one is named after my email provider, and looks to hold the contents of the Inbox at the time the connection got broken. Have I provided you with what you need to direct me as to  what I need to do, to get T-B hitched back up to my email as it was before I rolled things back? As I say, I do not understand the workings of T-B, but it would seem to me that T-B simply has a pointer to its currently active profile, and what I need to do is simply update that pointer to the r0ozv5yg.default-esr, rather than its current bt2p7ny9.default-release-2.  But it appears that my innocent analysis is much more simplistic than the actuality.  If I were to copy the entire contents of r0ozv5yg.default-esr, and simply paste them onto bt2p7ny9.default-release-2, would that resolve my issue??  Or what should I be doing?  (And I am sorry if I come across as excessively wordy.  Are  the screen shots of File structure any better?  Some other format?  Any other things I can do?   It is frustrating: I can see the old messages in raw form in the files, but I cannot get at them using T-B, (which holds the means of displaying them).

You mentioned one you recovered with Cronopete as having five years of mail. Does that contain most of what is lost? If so, what is lost? if a profile has names you recognize and the names do not appear in other profiles, then those are folders to recover. write down their names and addresses for later. if you see names you recognize, but they appear in multiple profiles, compare dates of last updates and write their names and locations as well. The 57g.default appears as a possible profile to use.  </p><p>In thunderbird, you could click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll to 'profiles' click 'about:profiles' and then click the 'launch' button on the 57g.default to see if it works.

It is not clear to me what you are referring to when you talk of ""the 57G.default"", but your direction to the ""about:profiles"" in T-B proved to be the missing bit. I followed this, and brought up a number of profiles including the r0ozv5yg.default-esr, which I had previously identified as holding all the old mails.  Turned out that it had also been accumulating mails since the rollback, so I have a full and complete record in this one folder.  Now I stumbled on where I was going wrong:  I clicked on the ""launch"" button, and found that this brought up all the records.  Then I clicked on the ""Set as Default"" button for this profile.  This brought up a new button, labelled something like ""Save as New Profile"".  No!  Doing this only creates yet another profile, on top of the 6 I had already accumulated.  Don't Save anything; simply close T-B.  When you re-open it, it will open in the profile you were using, with no change in file name or structure, and everything is back to the way it was before the whole sequence began.  The trick is simply in knowing that you need to close and restart T-B after making changes.  Bingo!  All is back as it should be.  I am deeply grateful to you for getting me through this.

Microsoft consider all email addresses as alias. Microsoft now say you would need same password used to access Microsoft account for the email addresses. Whatever email address has been set up as 'primary' is the only email address you can use to send emails via a third party email client such as Thunderbird. So if you had two email addresses eg: <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> and <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a>, if <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> was the 'primary' then both <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> and <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> email address can only send - smtp - using <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email address.  To ensure you get emails coming back to the correct email address, you would need to set up the Hotmail account  'Reply-to Address' as the hotmail email address. If you only have the one 'hotmail' address then I presume it's also primary, so smtp should be ok. </p><p><br> <strong>Check this on computer:</strong> </p><p><strong>Firewall:</strong> Access Firewalll which might be the defaul on computer or controlled by an Antri-Virus you installed. Make sure Thunderbird program has been set up as an allowed program to ensure nothing is blocked. </p><p><strong>VPN:</strong> Check computer for a VPN. Some AV programs do offer a VPN option and in some cases I've discovered it gets enabled utomatically. Many servers do not like VPN and think you are a hacker as it hides the IP address. Switch off VPN or create a slpit tunnelling and set up Thunderbird to use it. </p><p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Check computer to see if something is using the localhost. Typically, those who manage websites will use eg: Apache Xampp - it uses localhost.
