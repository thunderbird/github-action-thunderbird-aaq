I understand that it could be annoying or concerning to have an extra account ID# listed in the ""back end"" but it could be that it is not actually going to cause any problems, whereas, I would worry that it could potentially cause a problem to try to make any changes in the ""back end"" ""Config Editor"" AKA ""Advanced Preferences"".  </p><p>Under the ""Account Settings"" for a given account, if I change the ""Email Address"" for that account, for example, if I change <a href=""mailto:example@gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">example@gmail.com</a> to example@gmail.commeow, then I do find that this change is immediately reflected in the ""useremail"" list in the ""Config Editor"" AKA ""Advanced Preferences"". (Using two different proper names for the same user interface device -- brilliant as always, Mozilla) </p><p>So to reiterate, via the so-called front-end ""Account Settings"" for the account in question, you could temporarily change the e-mail address of the account, and see if that change then propagates to only one of the ""duplicate"" entries in the ""useremail"" list. </p><p>Even if you are able to determine that only one of the ID#s is correlated with your gmail account, I would still recommend against deleting anything in the ""Config Editor"" AKA ""Advanced Preferences"" that is associated with the other ID# that is not correlated.  If you do make any such changes, I would recommend first backing up your entire mail folder, and, I would recommend being sure that you have a viable recovery process whereby you are able to recover from your backup, if needed.  However, I would also recommend against messing around with backup copies of your mail folder, as this can get incredibly messy and confusing, and could potentially damage both mail folders, i.e. while testing out a recovery procedure you could end up downloading new e-mails to the backup copy of the mail folder, so then the original copy of the mail folder is missing those new e-mails...   So I guess, any testing of backup and recovery procedures should be performed with mail folders and mail accounts that are used only for test purposes, such testing should not be performed with production folders and accounts... </p>",antifascist,false,1,0

In looking at this again, I think the most likely reason you can't create a new folder will be that Thunderbird is unable to log into your e-mail account.  For example, perhaps your username or password is not entered correctly in the Thunderbird settings.  Further explanation follows: </p><p>It would help narrow down the problem if you can check if this problem is limited to creating new folders in your e-mail account, or if you are also unable to create new folders in your ""local folders."" </p><p>In the Thunderbird ""folder tree"" in which you are presented with your various folders, (Inbox, Drafts, Sent, etc) you should have an entry named ""Local Folders"" and also an entry whose name is your e-mail account address.  These entries represent the ""root level"", respectively, of your local folders and your e-mail account folders. </p><p>If you right-click on the ""Local Folders"" root entry then you should be able to create a new folder within the ""Local Folders,"" and likewise, right-clicking on the e-mail account root entry should allow you to create a new folder within the e-mail account. </p><p>If you are not able to create a new folder within ""Local Folders"", then perhaps your computer has run out of disk space, or, perhaps there is some other weird problem happening with your Thunderbird installation. </p><p>If you ARE able to create a new folder within ""Local Folders"", but you are NOT able to create a new folder within your e-mail account, then perhaps your e-mail account has run out of storage space, or perhaps your e-mail account is simply configured to deny you permission to create a new folder, or, perhaps there is a configuration problem whereby your e-mail account login settings (POP or IMAP settings, port numbers, username/password, etc) are not all set correctly per the instructions published by your e-mail account provider. </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

Bad things hempen if it is.  The second thing is make plenty of backups because as I said careful editing,  that means there is lots that can go wrong.  But if you change one and save it and copy the change in a find and replace you should get the outcome you seek.  But remember find and replace will replace every instance it sees of that text string.

In my attached screen image, if you point your mouse pointer directly at the horizontal line separating the list of messages from the ""message preview pane"", (this specific point is indicated on the attached screen image with a red circle located between the two red arrows) then your mouse pointer should transform from a normal pointer arrow into a double arrow.  While your mouse pointer is a double arrow, you can then click and drag up or down, thereby enlarging or shrinking the size of the preview pane.  If you drag all the way down, then the preview pane will be entirely removed, but can be restored by pointing at the same line and dragging upwards.   </p><p>If you have a relatively small screen, or if your display resolution is set to be relatively small (smaller resolution results in everything being drawn larger on the screen) then you may find that use of the preview pane is not practical, as you may need to use all available space for simply navigating through the list of messages.  In this case, you may find it to be more useful to view a message in a new tab or new window rather than viewing the message in the preview pane. </p><p>To view a message in a new tab or window, in the list of messages, simply click on the message entry once so as to highlight that particular message entry, and then press the ""enter"" key on the keyboard.  Alternatively, right-click on a given message entry which will pop up a contextual menu from which you may elect to ""open message in new tab"" or ""open message in new window.""  </p><p>If you do open messages in new tabs, you should take care to close each tab when done, otherwise, you will end up with multiple tabs open all at once, which can be confusing, and can make it difficult to find your main ""All Folders"" folder tree from which you select your inbox, sent, trash, etc, as after all, the main folder tree itself also occupies a tab.  When too many tabs are open at the same time, it becomes difficult to find a particular tab. </p><p>As mentioned above, when you press the keyboard's ""enter"" key after highlight a given messages in the list of messages, that message will then be displayed in a new tab, or conversely, in a new window.  If you have a preference for a new tab or a new window, you may configure that preference in the ""Reading &amp; Display"" sub-section of the ""General"" section of the Thunderbird settings. </p><p>I hope this helps! </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

This will allow for the correct functioning of the ""Reply with Template"" function of the Message Filter Filter Rules, in other words, the ""Reply with Template"" function will send unencrypted reply messages to recipients who do not employ encryption.  If at any point in time you need to edit your Template, you would need to first drag and drop the Template over to a mail account that does not use encryption, perform and save the edits, and then drag it back to the encryption-using mail account in which the Template is actually used. </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

The correct value depends a lot of the video driver installed on the system and the capability of the video card installed on that device.  Generally you turn it off if things get blurry or render in an odd manner but otherwise on makes video and some other functions happen faster.  I lost the argument for it to be defaulted to off some 10 years ago.  The argument is they (firefox) don't test the off default only the on one and as it is a Firefox feature Thunderbird developers really do nothing except set the initial default value. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
