It appears that your e-mail address ending in <a href=""http://dccnet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dccnet.com</a> is most likely being managed by Delta Cable Communication (EastLink).  I found that EastLink publishes the following instructions regarding e-mail settings: </p><p><a href=""https://help.eastlink.ca/internet-wifi/configuring-your-eastlink-email-address/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.eastlink.ca/internet-wifi/configuring-your-eastlink-email-address/</a> </p><p>It appears that you should be using port 993. </p><p>If you are not able to resolve the problem on your own, you might want to try calling EastLink on the phone using their contact information which they provide at this page: </p><p><a href=""https://help.eastlink.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.eastlink.ca/</a>  </p><p>By the way, after you do get it working, you might want to change the ""check for new messages every x minutes"" setting.  You currently have this set at every 1 minutes, which does create a bit of extra workload for the mail server.  Personally, just to be kind to the mail server, I set this to 10 minutes, and whenever I am in a hurry to receive an e-mail that I am expecting, then I will use the ""File"" menu's ""Get New Message"" function to manually initiate a mail check.  </p><p>I hope this helps! </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

I understand that it could be annoying or concerning to have an extra account ID# listed in the ""back end"" but it could be that it is not actually going to cause any problems, whereas, I would worry that it could potentially cause a problem to try to make any changes in the ""back end"" ""Config Editor"" AKA ""Advanced Preferences"".  </p><p>Under the ""Account Settings"" for a given account, if I change the ""Email Address"" for that account, for example, if I change example@gmail.com to example@gmail.commeow, then I do find that this change is immediately reflected in the ""useremail"" list in the ""Config Editor"" AKA ""Advanced Preferences"". (Using two different proper names for the same user interface device -- brilliant as always, Mozilla) </p><p>So to reiterate, via the so-called front-end ""Account Settings"" for the account in question, you could temporarily change the e-mail address of the account, and see if that change then propagates to only one of the ""duplicate"" entries in the ""useremail"" list. </p><p>Even if you are able to determine that only one of the ID#s is correlated with your gmail account, I would still recommend against deleting anything in the ""Config Editor"" AKA ""Advanced Preferences"" that is associated with the other ID# that is not correlated.  If you do make any such changes, I would recommend first backing up your entire mail folder, and, I would recommend being sure that you have a viable recovery process whereby you are able to recover from your backup, if needed.  However, I would also recommend against messing around with backup copies of your mail folder, as this can get incredibly messy and confusing, and could potentially damage both mail folders, i.e. while testing out a recovery procedure you could end up downloading new e-mails to the backup copy of the mail folder, so then the original copy of the mail folder is missing those new e-mails...   So I guess, any testing of backup and recovery procedures should be performed with mail folders and mail accounts that are used only for test purposes, such testing should not be performed with production folders and accounts... </p>",antifascist,false,1,0
