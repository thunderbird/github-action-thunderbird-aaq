Given the device is a Dell and they traditionally provide McAfee with their product preinstalled my guess is it will be that long term mail dysfunction causer that is the root of your issue  All those folders you see in Thunderbird are caused by file contention and that is usually the antivirus locking up files when Thunderbird is trying to use them.  You can start by deleting all of them. All this inbox folder all the nstmp folders and all of the compact backup folders. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You currently have this set at every 1 minutes, which does create a bit of extra workload for the mail server.  Personally, just to be kind to the mail server, I set this to 10 minutes, and whenever I am in a hurry to receive an e-mail that I am expecting, then I will use the ""File"" menu's ""Get New Message"" function to manually initiate a mail check.  </p><p>I hope this helps! </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

Some of you have offered to date and thank you so much for your time. Unfortunately, none of the suggestions have come to a fruition as far as bringing back her ability to send messages. I would like to blame Spectrum entirely but considering lisa has a different provider yet is experiencing the same thing as I am it has to be something glitchy with Thunderbird. is there anyone else that can think outside the box with some alternative suggestions?
