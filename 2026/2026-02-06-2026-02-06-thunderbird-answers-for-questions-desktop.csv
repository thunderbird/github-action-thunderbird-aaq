It appears that your e-mail address ending in <a href=""http://dccnet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dccnet.com</a> is most likely being managed by Delta Cable Communication (EastLink).  I found that EastLink publishes the following instructions regarding e-mail settings: </p><p><a href=""https://help.eastlink.ca/internet-wifi/configuring-your-eastlink-email-address/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.eastlink.ca/internet-wifi/configuring-your-eastlink-email-address/</a> </p><p>It appears that you should be using port 993. </p><p>If you are not able to resolve the problem on your own, you might want to try calling EastLink on the phone using their contact information which they provide at this page: </p><p><a href=""https://help.eastlink.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.eastlink.ca/</a>  </p><p>By the way, after you do get it working, you might want to change the ""check for new messages every x minutes"" setting.  You currently have this set at every 1 minutes, which does create a bit of extra workload for the mail server.  Personally, just to be kind to the mail server, I set this to 10 minutes, and whenever I am in a hurry to receive an e-mail that I am expecting, then I will use the ""File"" menu's ""Get New Message"" function to manually initiate a mail check.  </p><p>I hope this helps! </p>",antifascist,false,0,0
