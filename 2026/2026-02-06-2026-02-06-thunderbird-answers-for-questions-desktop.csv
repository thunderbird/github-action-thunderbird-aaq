It appears that your e-mail address ending in <a href=""http://dccnet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dccnet.com</a> is most likely being managed by Delta Cable Communication (EastLink).  I found that EastLink publishes the following instructions regarding e-mail settings: </p><p><a href=""https://help.eastlink.ca/internet-wifi/configuring-your-eastlink-email-address/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.eastlink.ca/internet-wifi/configuring-your-eastlink-email-address/</a> </p><p>It appears that you should be using port 993. </p><p>If you are not able to resolve the problem on your own, you might want to try calling EastLink on the phone using their contact information which they provide at this page: </p><p><a href=""https://help.eastlink.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.eastlink.ca/</a>  </p><p>By the way, after you do get it working, you might want to change the ""check for new messages every x minutes"" setting.  You currently have this set at every 1 minutes, which does create a bit of extra workload for the mail server.  Personally, just to be kind to the mail server, I set this to 10 minutes, and whenever I am in a hurry to receive an e-mail that I am expecting, then I will use the ""File"" menu's ""Get New Message"" function to manually initiate a mail check.  </p><p>I hope this helps! </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

The active profile was identified in the file, profiles.ini. You can verify that by then opening that profile where you should see your accounts and recent dates for update. That is the profile folder to which I was referring in my earlier response. By just replacing the profile folder, you excuse yourself from figuring out how thunderbird is ordering things. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
