You can then right-click on the selection and use the &lt;Move To&gt; pop-up menu to move them to the top level of your Local Folders. The selection can also be drag-and-dropped to the top level of Local Folders. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

I've had Thunderbird for a long time and this 'failed to log in to server' is a recurring problem, the solution for which seems to be different every time. This time it's got me stumped. If this and other issues seem to be common and constantly occurring, why doesn't Mozilla fix them? </p>",whenangelscry,false,0,0

The other is via <a href=""http://mail.optusnet.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.optusnet.com.au</a> and has stopped responding. The only differences are the port number and the fact that the Optus one has no option for OAuth2. I can only set it to Normal Password. Please help!! </p>",whenangelscry,false,0,0
