Unfortunately, after correcting the typo (using search &amp; replace to make sure I got them all) i still get the same error message. ""Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account."" Oddly, I tried the same settings with Office 2010 (including the typo, as far as I can determine) and was able to connect with the old Office 2007 on my Win7 machine on the first try. But for various reasons I prefer to stick to the Spectrum email. </p>",drwin,false,0,0
