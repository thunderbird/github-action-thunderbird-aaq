I had a friend recently have issues with his new shiny Dell laptop and it turned out to be dodgy printer drivers used by Windows.  He needed to download and install driver from brother. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Unfortunately, after correcting the typo (using search &amp; replace to make sure I got them all) i still get the same error message. ""Thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account."" Oddly, I tried the same settings with Office 2010 (including the typo, as far as I can determine) and was able to connect with the old Office 2007 on my Win7 machine on the first try. But for various reasons I prefer to stick to the Spectrum email. </p>",drwin,false,0,0

Msg received in New Zealand from England (13 hours behind NZ at this time of year). The local displayed time for the msg in TB currently sits at 20.57, yet I had replied to that msg 4 hours earlier!  </p><p>Raw data (Ctrl-U) shows From as Feb 21 13.54. Would that be my local time of receipt? If so then that is the correct time for the msg. I replied to it at 16.14, yet as already mentioned TB displays the time as 20.57.  </p><p>In the raw data the Received and X-Received time/date are PST. Not sure why that should be and not either GMT or NZDST. Possibly the arrival time on the Gmail server?  </p><p>Any further ideas to correct this annoyance would be most welcome. Thanks again for your help. </p>",newamalfi,false,0,0

The important question is, does it contain a Date line? </p><p>I believe that when you create a message, the current date and time are stamped in the Date header. Each server it passes through on its way to the destination stamps that current date/time in a Received line, oldest toward the bottom of the header block, newest toward the top. </p><p>A quick experiment with Thunderbird seems to indicate that if the originating/creation Date line is missing or malformed, Tbird considers the time received to be the sending time, which, of course, can be wildly wrong. The date shown is not actually found in the header, so I think it must be stored in the index. Furthermore, if I move one of those messages to another folder, it will now show that date it was moved as the sending time! </p><p>I'm not sure exactly what this all means, but I have a feeling that it's related to your issue of dates that seem to change unpredictably. </p><p>I might try creating a new folder, copying all messages in the errant folder into it, and examine the new folder to see it it appears more stable. If so, delete the old folder. You may need to adjust any filters that reference the old folder. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
