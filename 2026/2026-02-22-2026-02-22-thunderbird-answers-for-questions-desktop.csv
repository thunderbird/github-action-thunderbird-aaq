The important question is, does it contain a Date line? </p><p>I believe that when you create a message, the current date and time are stamped in the Date header. Each server it passes through on its way to the destination stamps that current date/time in a Received line, oldest toward the bottom of the header block, newest toward the top. </p><p>A quick experiment with Thunderbird seems to indicate that if the originating/creation Date line is missing or malformed, Tbird considers the time received to be the sending time, which, of course, can be wildly wrong. The date shown is not actually found in the header, so I think it must be stored in the index. Furthermore, if I move one of those messages to another folder, it will now show that date it was moved as the sending time! </p><p>I'm not sure exactly what this all means, but I have a feeling that it's related to your issue of dates that seem to change unpredictably. </p><p>I might try creating a new folder, copying all messages in the errant folder into it, and examine the new folder to see it it appears more stable. If so, delete the old folder. You may need to adjust any filters that reference the old folder. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
