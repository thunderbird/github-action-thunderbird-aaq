Using repair on both MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Pro failed so I am now just doing an uninstall and reinstall on every other program to save time.

Given the backup disc was not only empty but massively slowing down the computer this may take some time.

In this case I haven't added attendees, and wanted to send the message to someone who was not originally participating. Logic might dictate that I would add them as an attendee first, then message them. However, in our family we are informal about such things, so simply texting any changes in plans, and then sending the calendar detail as needed is more appropriate and friendly. I was simply pointing out that in other contexts (from the Events sidebar in mail, and from the calendar itself), the context menu allows sending an event as an email message - so logic also might dictate that the application provide a contextual menu with this option anywhere an event is displayed, including the detail view. As for opening vs. right-clicking an event - it is a natural action, at least for me and I am sure many others, to first open a calendar event to see the full details, and then do something with it. I discovered the ""Convert to ... message"" feature by attempting to copy the event as text, then paste in a message I would compose separately. I got side-tracked in this mission to copy the event by this super-handy feature. As it happens to be, if I had attempted to copy the event and paste into a message I would have been disappointed, though not terribly surprised, to find that I had obtained a vcalendar entry not the event converted to text!
