It was in your posted error that I was able to deduce part of the problem. You are receiving an error that there is an error in the SMTP configuration, yet you refuse to share exactly what it is. I see one of your attempts to fix this was changing password. All I can suggest is to experiment with different SMTP settings, such as SSL/TLS and port 465, STARTTLS and port 587, normal password. If no combination works, you may have a password problem. You can select settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, click savedpasswords and then showpasswords.

In this case I haven't added attendees, and wanted to send the message to someone who was not originally participating. Logic might dictate that I would add them as an attendee first, then message them. However, in our family we are informal about such things, so simply texting any changes in plans, and then sending the calendar detail as needed is more appropriate and friendly. I was simply pointing out that in other contexts (from the Events sidebar in mail, and from the calendar itself), the context menu allows sending an event as an email message - so logic also might dictate that the application provide a contextual menu with this option anywhere an event is displayed, including the detail view. As for opening vs. right-clicking an event - it is a natural action, at least for me and I am sure many others, to first open a calendar event to see the full details, and then do something with it. I discovered the ""Convert to ... message"" feature by attempting to copy the event as text, then paste in a message I would compose separately. I got side-tracked in this mission to copy the event by this super-handy feature. As it happens to be, if I had attempted to copy the event and paste into a message I would have been disappointed, though not terribly surprised, to find that I had obtained a vcalendar entry not the event converted to text!
