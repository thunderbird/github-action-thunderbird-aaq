Yet regarding the screenshot with the Thunderbird folder pane I still wonder which of your accounts displays <strong>only</strong> ""Sent and Deleted Folders"" as you stated in your first message. I do see the @Oakdene account which indeed displays only the Inbox, Deleted and Spam folders. If this is the newly created account and if it is a POP account it is normal that in the beginning only Inbox and Deleted will be displayed. That's the default behaviour with new POP accounts in Thunderbird. A Sent folder will be created when you send your first message from this account, the Spam folder is created when you activate the Spam filter in Account Settings, the Drafts folder when you save a message as a draft, the Archives folder when you archive a message, ....etc  </p><p>Your second image seems to show the same account set up on your smartphone, and probably it is set up using the IMAP protocol.  Now the question is: did you really set up this account in Thunderbird using the IMAP or the POP protocol? If you used POP there will be no automatic synchronisation with the same account on the smartphone. If you used IMAP you'll have to open the ""Subscribe"" popup - as david already proposed in his first reply - and select the folders to be displayed. You said that you tried but to no avail ...

The timing depends on the platform used: Microsoft Outlook / Exchange (Office 365) If you use Microsoft 365 work or school email, the policy is processed by a process called the Managed Folder Assistant (MFA). Frequency: In Exchange Online, this process runs automatically every 7 days. How to speed it up: Administrators can force this process for a specific mailbox using the Start-ManagedFolderAssistant PowerShell command. Mozilla Thunderbird In Thunderbird, message limits are configured in the folder properties on the ""Retention Policy"" tab. Frequency: Deletion typically occurs when the folder is opened or during the folder compaction process.

That is why it is important to share exactly what thunderbird is seeing. Screenshots do that. Otherwise, people here have no idea of the problem. It was in your posted error that I was able to deduce part of the problem. You are receiving an error that there is an error in the SMTP configuration, yet you refuse to share exactly what it is. I see one of your attempts to fix this was changing password. All I can suggest is to experiment with different SMTP settings, such as SSL/TLS and port 465, STARTTLS and port 587, normal password. If no combination works, you may have a password problem. You can select settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, click savedpasswords and then showpasswords. That lets you see whatever password thunderbird is attempting to use. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
