Thanks, that def ""fixed"" it.  </p><p>Not sure when that was clicked, and unless you know the program (and actually USE the filters) then a user might not know the filter could result in that happening ... While it was def user error, Thunderbird might want to make it more clear when the filter is clicked and there are zero results (i.e. instead of a blank screen, a message that says, ""no results. check the filters above."" ... or default to regular filters when the program restarts ... or even REINSTALLS) </p>",djmozilla123,false,0,0
