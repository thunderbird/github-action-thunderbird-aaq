I have random failures when trying to move individual files or folders from LOCAL FOLDERS back to MAIN emails.  Moves some, sometimes, then won't move, or will move some but not all, and often  corrupts the files back into Main folder. I only use one email under T-Bird.  This has happened for years, but I have been judicious about moving files and lived with it.  But it's still a problem that I would have thought something like this would have been fixed long ago?  .The formatting of LOCAL FOLDERS &amp; FILES in LOCAL FOLDERS seems different &amp; convoluted vs. a straightforward formatting in MAIN where I can easily move withing Microsoft file management.  But trying to reconfigure and COPY or MOVE Files or Folders from LOCAL is very problematic. </p>",steve.fritts;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:147.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/147.0;os:win-10 64-bit but the problems have occurred from WIN-7,0,0,0,,,
