Downloaded and Installed thunderbird version 144.0.01. No problems.  Did updates and started to encounter issue with sending mail.  Last updated version was 147.0.  Had to go back to version 144 to get a properly working Thunderbird. </p><p>Is there a bug with version 147 for Apple Mac Sequoia that means you cannot send more than one email at a time from pop3 accounts?  I send an email, and then have to quit Thunderbird and re-open if I want to send another email.  I have done a lot of testing and checking over the last few weeks to try and get Thunderbird to work properly, but nothing worked.  Plus a date edit bug / feature for tasks? </p><p>I have several accounts, all pop3 apart from 1 Gmail account.  No matter which account I start from, if I want to send subsequent emails from a pop3 account, I have to quite Thunderbird.  No matter how long I wait to send the email.  I tried saving the email as draft, and send later.  Does not work.  I did not make a note, but I think in my testing I may have been able to send more than one GMAIL email - it is IMAP.  I know I did send 1 email from my gmail account, and then tried one of the pop3, but was not successful.  At all times fetching mail has not been a problem. </p><p>I did all the standard checks which did not make any difference:  the server settings; addons disabled; virus checker disabled.  Removed an account and re-added; deleted SMTP server settings and re-added.  Proxy settings; and so on. </p><p>On my old mac running version 128.14 no problems at all.  I compared settings.  Could not see any differences. </p><p>On the new mac, created a new user, and new thunderbird profile.  Added 1 pop3 account only.  The problem was exactly the same.  So it was not a profile issue. </p><p>Decided to revert back to older version 144.  PLEASE could Mozilla add a facility to Thunderbird to allow you to use existing profile rather than going through the operating system to get it to use my existing profile.  I did get the old 144 version to use my 147 profile.  After testing yesterday and today it all appears ok.  I can send more than email at a time both from the same account, and from different accounts.  What I do notice is it does seem to be slow on making the connection on some accounts.  Most of the accounts are from the same host but the connection speed for sending is variable across the accounts from the same provider.  My email is purely the words testing and testing in the body so not large.  Is that to do with the space I have assigned to email mailbox at the provider side? </p><p>One other issue with 147, and do not know if it is connected or a new feature of 147 and that is not being able to directly amend dates in tasks? In the newer versions of Thunderbird I found that I can only amend the date of a task by using a popup calendar and choose the date.  In version 144 I can now amend the date of tasks by typing in the date field.  Is it a feature / setting of 147 or a bug? </p>",lgeneral1426;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:147.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/147.0;os:Sequoia 15.7.3,0,0,0,,,

When I try to set up my email, everything works fine, Thunderbird detects the settings. When I try to log in I get the error message ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password"". If I go though the settings the authentication method is ""normal password"" when it should be ""oauth2"" but that option is missing. The pop-up to log in to my Google Account to authorize the app does NOT appear no matter what. </p><p>I've had this issue multiple times in the past (as I change schools) and I was able to solve it once. In my Windows install I changed some flag in the Config Editor (and I forgot which) and the following time I tried to add the account the Google authentication pop up appeared. Do note that the outlook app (new one and classic) sets up the account just fine without me having to configure or change anything. </p><p>So right now I have Thunderbird able to access that account on Windows, but I can't get my install in Nobara (Fedora based) to do so because (I think) the Google authentication pop up doesn't open so that I can go to the account and allow the specific Thunderbird install to use the email. </p><p>I've also tried 4 or 5 other email clients available in Flatpost and none are able to trigger the Google pop up thing.
