If everything in the second profile is identical, the filters should work. Fortunately, the file is a simple text file that can be manipulated with a text editor, such as Notepad. I don't mean to oversimplify the process; some setups with complex filters need careful tweaks to work properly. The SAFE way is to copy the complete profile, not just the filters.  Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
