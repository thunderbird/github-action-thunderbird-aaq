I have deleted an email account from Thunderbird and I did not tick Delete Data so the emails are still there in my Profile but they no longer show up in the tree in Thunderbird on my Mac ( OS 14.8 Sonoma). I had a lot of subfolders into which I had put incoming and sent emails on particular topics. For example I had a folder called Family, and inside that I had a subfolder called Birthdays as well as many other family related topics.  My last Time Machine back up is about a month ago but that would be good enough to restore from.  I tried ‘Import’ in Thunderbird but it only imported the main folders and the emails within but not the subfolders.  I have another email address besides the deleted one and if I overwrite the whole Profile with the older one from Time Machine it will lose a lot of new stuff accumulated since that backup.  Any help most appreciated </p>",ruthnichollsphotos;MattAuSupport;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 26_0_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/144.0.7559.85 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1;os:Mac OS Sonoma 14.8.1",1,0,0,,,
