I had a problem after changing my BT password. Originally, I had a password to access the actual account and another password for the email webmail account. Updating them failed. This did not work for email. I had to make sure both the BT account (where you look for bills etc) had to have the same password as the email - webmail account. So, check you have that set up first. </p><p>Then in Thunderbird, make sure both incoming and outgoing have same password as used above. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> scroll to Passwords section. </li><li> click on 'Saved Passwords' </li><li> click on 'Show Passwords' </li></ul> <p>You should have two lines - one for incoming and one for outgoing.

So if profile stuff is here&nbsp;: C://Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> In Anti-Virus - Create an exception to not scan that 'Thunderbird' folder. </p><p>AV's have a habit of checking every file that gets opened and scanning stuff. When you download, a file gets opened to write to the file, when you send a file gets opened to save the sent email etc and also there is communication downloading uploading to server.  That can have a performance issue - hence why testing a restart in 'Safe Mode with Networking' to see if it really is interfering. </p><p>So, either create the exception to not scan profile OR do the restart test. </p><p>Please note - if you just stop Malware Bytes then the Windows 11 Anti-Virus will kick in - hence the ideal is to test in 'Safe Mode with Networking'. </p><p>Whilst you are at it ... Firewall - it might be controlled by Windows or by an Anti-virus. Access Firewall and make sure Thunderbird program has been set up as allowed. </p><p>Also check computer for a VPN which may have been enabled by you or by an Anti-Virus product. Switch it off. </p><p>Then restart Thunderbird </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
