So now I have the comcast email with all folders in Thunderbird and my goal is next to add gmail to Thunderbird and then merge the comcast into the gmail.  The goal is to have all the old comcast emails and folders integrated into gmail so the comcast can be cancelled as Xfinity  phases out the comcast email. Does that sound doable to you?

Once you have the gmail account setup, you can COPY (not move) the messages from comcast account to gmail account. Since you will be copying messages from one server to another, there can be interruptions in the network, so I suggest copying in small groups. There is no one perfect approach; you could attempt to copy a complete folder and that may go smoothly. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
