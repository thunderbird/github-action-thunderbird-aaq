This requires the addon, ""Import ExportTools NG"" ( <a href=""https://github.com/thunderbird/import-export-tools-ng/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thunderbird/import-export-tools-ng/releases</a> ). </p><p>- Extract the file from your backup that represents the folder that contains the messages you want to recover into a temporary folder in a convenient place (Desktop?). It might be a pair of files called ""Trash"" and ""Trash.msf"". </p><p>- Create a temporary Local Folder in Thunderbird. Right-click on it and choose &lt;ImportExportTools NG | Import mbox files | Individual mbox files&gt; from the context menu. Navigate to the temporary folder that has your extracted files, select those files and click ""Open"". </p><p>- This will import all messages from the archived folder to your local folder. You can now delete everything you DON'T want, or copy or move the missing messages to their final destination. </p><p>- Delete the temporary local Thunderbird folder when you're done. </p>",rednoise,false,1,0

Now Thunderbird cannot import, not because files are missing, but because there is no zip file to import. </p><p>Is the .default thing a file or a folder? It is probably a folder with a profile. I ask only because you called it a file. Do its contents look like my attached image? </p><p>Are the ""30 or so"" things messages or folders? If they are messages, are they in one folder (which?) or many? </p><p>Your answers will determine what you should do next. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

One is that there is the mail server has a problem that has resulted in there actually being insufficient system storage. You can't do anything about this except to contact your email host for confirmation. They have to fix it. </p><p>The other part of the error message, about ""exceeding the allowed number of recipients"" is misleading. Another user in this forum was getting the same error message and discovered that the email host had changed the outgoing server address, but neglected to tell their users. Once the new SMTP address was learned and updated within Thunderbird, all was well again.

It was not being in the US that was important, it was connecting to the internet using their service.  Historically I think they had a mobile server that cell phones were supposed to use that did not implement the constraint.  I have no idea if it still exists. or if it works.  Being in Australia I don't even get to access most of their servers to look up solutions because they are so xenophobic. (At least I think they are) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I though that was a poor showing of what you see is what you get.  What I found was Excel only put the basic table and data on the clipboard as HTML it put everything on the clipboard in RTF.  Thunderbird defaults to picking plain text or HTML.  I would not put it past Thunderbird to also leave out the styling.   Personally I do not use grids in emails unless I am desperate as they generally present particularly poorly on phone screens.  Lots and lots of left and right scrolling as the screen is so much smaller that the desktop. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I do have three email recipients who use crappy email clients that don't show HTML quotations properly. When I'm sending quotations to these people I put them in single-cell tables with nice borders, that way everyone is happy. Instead of setting up a table from scratch for each quotation I want to keep a table in my templates folder and just paste it into the emails I'm writing. I set the table border colour in Thunderbird with HTML, so the bird's lack of facility with RTF shouldn't be an issue. </p>",Alan37,false,0,0
