This requires the addon, ""Import ExportTools NG"" ( <a href=""https://github.com/thunderbird/import-export-tools-ng/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thunderbird/import-export-tools-ng/releases</a> ). </p><p>- Extract the file from your backup that represents the folder that contains the messages you want to recover into a temporary folder in a convenient place (Desktop?). It might be a pair of files called ""Trash"" and ""Trash.msf"". </p><p>- Create a temporary Local Folder in Thunderbird. Right-click on it and choose &lt;ImportExportTools NG | Import mbox files | Individual mbox files&gt; from the context menu. Navigate to the temporary folder that has your extracted files, select those files and click ""Open"". </p><p>- This will import all messages from the archived folder to your local folder. You can now delete everything you DON'T want, or copy or move the missing messages to their final destination. </p><p>- Delete the temporary local Thunderbird folder when you're done. </p>",rednoise,false,1,0

Now Thunderbird cannot import, not because files are missing, but because there is no zip file to import. </p><p>Is the .default thing a file or a folder? It is probably a folder with a profile. I ask only because you called it a file. Do its contents look like my attached image? </p><p>Are the ""30 or so"" things messages or folders? If they are messages, are they in one folder (which?) or many? </p><p>Your answers will determine what you should do next. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

I actually use this add-in already for other things. </p><p>I stumbled at first because I couldn't see the ""Import mbox files"" option in Import ExportTools NG. Then I re-read your advice and realised I'd missed that the new folder was *Local*. Then the option appeared. </p><p>Thanks for the speed and accuracy of this suggestion!! </p>",agabb,false,1,0

One is that there is the mail server has a problem that has resulted in there actually being insufficient system storage. You can't do anything about this except to contact your email host for confirmation. They have to fix it. </p><p>The other part of the error message, about ""exceeding the allowed number of recipients"" is misleading. Another user in this forum was getting the same error message and discovered that the email host had changed the outgoing server address, but neglected to tell their users. Once the new SMTP address was learned and updated within Thunderbird, all was well again.

Having problem only with the Thunderbird email agent. 2. Had a chat session with Charter, was recommended to use a US VPN. Would this work with Thunderbird? </p>",sundar3,false,0,0
