I though that was a poor showing of what you see is what you get.  What I found was Excel only put the basic table and data on the clipboard as HTML it put everything on the clipboard in RTF.  Thunderbird defaults to picking plain text or HTML.  I would not put it past Thunderbird to also leave out the styling.

POP has no concept of an inbox even, let alone phishing or spam folders  it has a maildrop where all mail received for the address is to be found.  Some providers do not follow the standard and hive off spam from what is offered for download in POP.  I spent time with a very frustrated individual yesterday because their provider did not offer spam so they were forever messing around in webmail to get false positives into their mail client by marking mail as not spam.  For him IMAP was really the only choice as that downloaded all the server side folders,  but it would have been a far superior solution if the provider had just offer the maildrop content without imposing their own non standard take on email.

Because I am sure things like Windows 10 Mail or Outlook show the timestamp when you recieve them , which is why I was thinking something was wrong , and since Windows 10 Mail quit working/was discontinued , I had to get a new email  , and have struggled with some of the , or lack of , features with Thunderbird  , like attachements and overall functionality and looks , compared to Windows 10 Mail , which I actually liked (though I liked Outlook Express much more , and can't stand the new Outlook because it is Web Based instead of on my PC where I want my email to be , and of all the options , Thunderbird was the most useable , though far from what I was hoping it would be) .....
