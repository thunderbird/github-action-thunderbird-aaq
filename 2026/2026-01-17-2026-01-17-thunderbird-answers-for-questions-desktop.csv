It might be a pair of files called ""Trash"" and ""Trash.msf"". </p><p>- Create a temporary Local Folder in Thunderbird. Right-click on it and choose &lt;ImportExportTools NG | Import mbox files | Individual mbox files&gt; from the context menu. Navigate to the temporary folder that has your extracted files, select those files and click ""Open"". </p><p>- This will import all messages from the archived folder to your local folder. You can now delete everything you DON'T want, or copy or move the missing messages to their final destination. </p><p>- Delete the temporary local Thunderbird folder when you're done. </p>",rednoise,false,1,0

I though that was a poor showing of what you see is what you get.  What I found was Excel only put the basic table and data on the clipboard as HTML it put everything on the clipboard in RTF.  Thunderbird defaults to picking plain text or HTML.  I would not put it past Thunderbird to also leave out the styling.   Personally I do not use grids in emails unless I am desperate as they generally present particularly poorly on phone screens.  Lots and lots of left and right scrolling as the screen is so much smaller that the desktop. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I do have three email recipients who use crappy email clients that don't show HTML quotations properly. When I'm sending quotations to these people I put them in single-cell tables with nice borders, that way everyone is happy. Instead of setting up a table from scratch for each quotation I want to keep a table in my templates folder and just paste it into the emails I'm writing. I set the table border colour in Thunderbird with HTML, so the bird's lack of facility with RTF shouldn't be an issue. </p>",Alan37,false,0,0
