Seriously.  if you are downloading mail using Thunderbird with the IMAP protocol you are not making something that could be considered a long term archive in any way shape or form.  The sever is considered canonical in the IMAP protocol  so our local copy is only as good as the server one. </p><p>Using POP will generally download an immutable copy of mail in the inbox.  But no other folders.  It will also not remove mail from the server by default.  You have to manually set that in account settings. </p><p>You could also copy mails into the ""Local Folders"" special account as that is truly a local store with no links to the server.  But after you verify the copy.  You still need to delete the emails.  It is possible move will work for you,  but the more mail being processed the higher the risk of mail simply not moving. </p><p>Mostly I see folk with an unsatisfactory archive arrangement with their hosting provider trying to bend local mail clients into archival tools they were never intended to be.  They can perform that function,  but it is not natural for them and considerable oversight is usually required fro when issues occur. </p><p>Some folk use filters to move mail from IMAP folders to local folders storage with varying levels of success.  Basically it is another instance of trying to bend the tool to the function rather than use an archiving tool.  Some will tell you it works like a charm.  Others will say it has problems and et others will say it has lots of problems don't touch it.  One thing is apparent, the larger your individual emails the higher the risk that the filters will timeout while in processing  the mail and will not be removed, will be copied multiple times or just plain lost from the server or other anomalous issues surface.  There is no real automated guaranteed solution. </p><p>The best solution is to archive on the server and periodically make backup of the contents of the archived folders in Thunderbird using the importexport tool and then delete the mails from the archive folders. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>I recommend mbox backup files that you name for the time they represent say June2025 and july2025. That way you can use the same tool to reimport the files into Thunderbird local folders should you want to access the mail in a mail client without any issues at all. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
