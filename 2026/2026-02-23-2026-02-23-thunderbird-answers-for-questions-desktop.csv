On your question, the profile only reflect the size of its content; there is no default size. To check sizes of files, do this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - if you have IMAP mail, open the imapmail folder to view contents. You should normally recognize everything, such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc. If you see folders you don't recognize or duplicate folders, do a screenshot and post here.  - do the same for the Mail folder if you have POP accounts and for the Mail\Local Folders folder. </p><p>II any folders have not been compressed, doing that often reduces size. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

And Thunderbird is not the problem. This is usually either incorrect settings in thunderibird if emails to everyone are being rejected, but more likely in server settings by ISP if only to specific hosts. Here is some info on that: </p><p>Understanding SMTP Error 550 5.7.1 SMTP error 550 5.7.1 indicates that your email was rejected by the recipient's mail server. This typically happens due to security or policy-related issues. The server may see your email as spam, or it may not meet the necessary authentication criteria. <strong>Common Causes</strong> <u>Authentication Issues</u> </p><pre>   SPF, DKIM, DMARC Failures: If your email lacks proper authentication records, it may be flagged as unauthorized.    Misconfigured Mail Server: Incorrect settings can prevent your emails from being delivered. </pre> <p><u>IP Address Problems</u> </p><pre>   Blacklisting: If your sending IP address is on a blacklist, the recipient's server may block your email.    Reputation Issues: A poor reputation for your IP can lead to delivery failures. </pre> <p><strong>Troubleshooting Steps</strong> <u>Check Email Configuration</u> </p><pre>   Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Records: Ensure these records are correctly set up for your domain.    Inspect Mail Server Settings: Make sure your server is configured to send emails properly. </pre> <p><u>Check for Blacklisting</u> </p><pre>   Use Online Tools: Check if your IP address is listed on any blacklists.  </pre> <p><u>Contact Support</u> </p><pre>   Reach Out to Your ISP: If issues persist, contact your Internet Service Provider for assistance. </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0
