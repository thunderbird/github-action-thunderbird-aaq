I am still a veteran Thunderbird user and have been staying with the <strong>table</strong> view.  So I didn't imagine the blue subject line in new messages (and that's why I had profoundly modified my initial reply which concerned table view). The blue font colour plus the orange rhomb before the subject is the default display (or design) for new messages. As soon as you click on a new message the colour changes to black and font-weight to normal.  If you don't click on new messages - leaving them unread - and restart Thunderbird (or change folders) those messages change status and become simple unread messages, identifiable by the green dot and bold black font. (first image) Back to your question to extend the blue highlight of the subject line to other messages: I don't know such a built-in feature.  The only feature Thunderbird provides to distinguish or categorise messages are the message tags (important, work, personal, ......) . Yet in cards view those tags are very discreet, unlike tags in table view. </p><p>If you're going to use tag colours in cards view and want very apparent colours, you could do this using certain CSS codes in a userChrome.css file to be created in the profile folder.

Set up Thunderbird program as 'allowed' so nothing gets blocked. Confirm Thunderbird is set up as allowed program. </p><p><strong>VPN:</strong> Check computer for a VPN. Some Anti-Virus products now offer a VPN and I have come across some peopl who did not realise one had been enabled. Switch off VPN (or create  split tunnelling and set it up for Thunderbird to use).  Gmail does not like VPN as it atempts to hide your IP address, so gmail decides you might be hacker so it auto blocks access. Confirm VPN is switched off </p><p><strong>Localhost:</strong> Do you have anything using the localhost? People who manage websites may typically use eg: Apache Xampp. You need to switch of any program using the localhost whilst setting up gmail. You can enable it again afterwards.
