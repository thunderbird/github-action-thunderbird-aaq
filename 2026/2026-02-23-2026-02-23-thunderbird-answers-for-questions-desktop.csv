On your question, the profile only reflect the size of its content; there is no default size. To check sizes of files, do this:  - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - if you have IMAP mail, open the imapmail folder to view contents. You should normally recognize everything, such as inbox, inbox.msf, sent, sent.msf, etc. If you see folders you don't recognize or duplicate folders, do a screenshot and post here.  - do the same for the Mail folder if you have POP accounts and for the Mail\Local Folders folder. </p><p>II any folders have not been compressed, doing that often reduces size. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
