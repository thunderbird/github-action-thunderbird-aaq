It's been about 2 days since no more downloads have occurred. Ive got no way of knowing if it's a temporary pause or what the issue is.  </p><p>I installed Thunderbird to archive my emails as I intend to delete some older emails from google work space to clear up space, but I want to still have an offline archive of these email. </p>",milton19;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:windows 11",0,0,0,,,

My apologies. </p><p>I looked at the helps and found the answer to my issue BUT it didn't work. </p><p>The issue - I want to copy information from one address book to another book. The help told me to use CTRL then click and drag to copy.  I tried but it didn't work.  When I click on an address to move or copy it, as soon as I move the cursor a red circle with a diagonal line through it shows and it doesn't move it to the new address book. I am using windows 11 and Tbird 140.7.1.  I've done this in the past - years ago - but now I can't figure out how to do it. Earlier in this session I was able to move an address by doing click and drag but I can't even do that now.  I also rebooted my computer and tried again with the same results. I'm sure it's OPERATOR ERROR but I don't know what I did or what to do now. </p><p>I don't want to manually copy each entry. What do I do? </p><p>Thank you for all that you do with this program and all of MOZILLA! I've been using it for years and have only this issue with Tbird and some site don't work well or at all with FIREFOX so I go to Chrome for that specific </p>",jguynn;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:147.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/147.0;os:windows 11,0,0,0,,,
