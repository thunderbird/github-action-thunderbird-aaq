I've been using Thunderbird in Windows for a while now, and decided recently to switch on Android from BlueMail to Thunderbird for Android.  </p><p>In Thunderbird for Windows, I am able to use unified folders for all common folders (Spam, Sent, Trash, etc.). On Thunderbird for Android, however, only the Inbox is presented as a unified folder. I have discovered that this limitation is really problematic for me for two reasons.  </p><p>First, if I am in the unified Inbox and accidentally delete a message, I have to check several different Trash folders to find the lost message, selecting each account and then that account's Trash. I anticipate responses asking why or how I could delete a message and not know what it was. With the avalanche of incoming mail the days, I often would use swipe to delete on the unified Inbox for items that are clearly not important-- but occasionally, a real message appears on the face to be junk and isn't. This is a real hassle, and forced me to turn off the swipe to delete a message interaction altogether, because it was too easy to lose messages.  </p><p>Second, I have several different email addresses, and several different email providers, each of whom applies spam and trash rules differently. Two in particular frequently divert legitimate email into Spam, and I had been in the habit of scanning Spam for errant valid messages from these two providers. Being able to do this for all Spam in one location made this process much simpler.  </p><p>Can anyone tell me: </p> <ul><li> whether there is some underlying reason for this different behavior on Android,  </li><li> whether there are plans to implement such a change, or  </li><li> whether there are alternatives (like BetterBird, which does not have an Android port) that I could use? </li></ul>",sunfish62;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:Android",0,0,0,,,
