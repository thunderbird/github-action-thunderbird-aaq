Thunderbird doesn't have a problem with large profiles, and it doesn't load all messages in all folders at startup. However, the no. of messages in a single folder can be more problematic. So you may have a problem with very large folders, and with a large no. of messages in the Local Folders account. It would be better to split an archive in multiple smaller folders with less messages in them, e.g. on a yearly basis. </p><p>Also, you may want to create an exception in your anti-virus software for the Thunderbird profile folder, so that the anti-virus real-time scanner will not scan it. At best, anti-virus software can slow down Thunderbird. At worst, it can corrupt mail files and cause data loss. </p><p>Wrt the high memory usage, some quick items: </p> <ul><li> Try Help &gt; Troubleshoot Mode. </li><li> Do you have any folders where you've seen problems? </li><li> Do you have many newsgroup or rss accounts, or virtual folders?  </li></ul> <p>For a longer list, see <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems</a> </p>",christ1,false,0,0
