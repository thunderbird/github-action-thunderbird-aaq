Thunderbird doesn't have a problem with large profiles, and it doesn't load all messages in all folders at startup. However, the no. of messages in a single folder can be more problematic. So you may have a problem with very large folders, and with a large no. of messages in the Local Folders account. It would be better to split an archive in multiple smaller folders with less messages in them, e.g. on a yearly basis. </p><p>Also, you may want to create an exception in your anti-virus software for the Thunderbird profile folder, so that the anti-virus real-time scanner will not scan it.
