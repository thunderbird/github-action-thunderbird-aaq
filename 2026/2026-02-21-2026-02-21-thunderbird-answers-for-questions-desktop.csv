If it provided it to you, then it could provide to anyone. This is no joke. To reset your PC, do these steps:  </p> <ol><li> Choose Tools &gt; Developer Tools &gt; Error Console </li><li> Paste the expression:  </li></ol> <pre>  <strong>openDialog(""chrome://pippki/content/resetpassword.xhtml"")  </strong>    </pre> <ol><li> then, press the Evaluate button. That will open a dialog asking you if you want to reset your password. If Evaluate is not seen, press enter key.  </li><li> When prompted, press the Reset button.  </li></ol> <p>This removes all account passwords, which must then be reentered. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
