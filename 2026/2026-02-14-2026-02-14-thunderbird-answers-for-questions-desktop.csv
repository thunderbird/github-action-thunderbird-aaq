If you have a backup of the profile, I can assist in doing an install. The error is in the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder. for a 'fresh install', delete the appdata\local\thunderbird folder and the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder and then reinstall from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a>. start thunderbird once and then exit.  At this point, I can assist in the transfer. Is your baclup of just the profile, or of the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder? </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Tried the Folder Repair but that hasn't solved my problem. Old emails are again being restored after deletion (both in Thunderbird Inbox &amp; Deleted folders and then again in Gmail Bin via Firefox). Thanks for the thought but the problem seems to be more difficult to solve. Simon. </p>,sjguillemin17,false,0,0
