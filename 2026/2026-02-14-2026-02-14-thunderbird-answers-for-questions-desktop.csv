My inference is that the account is working properly, but the messages appear under the account name and not under Local Folders? Please clarify in detail, if possible. What you describe is normal for IMAP. I suggest you click 'account settings', highlight the 'server settings' in left sidebar for the account and see what is written in upper part of right side of screen. I think it will say 'IMAP Mail Server.' Please verify and respond. Are you wanting the messages to appear in your PC when offline? Or after you close the account? Please be specific, as some suggestions could delete what you want to keep. For example, with an IMAP account, messages are on the PC, but ONLY as long as you have them on the server account.

Keep in mind that when Gmail ""deletes"" a message, it goes into the Trash folder and will still be included when you look at Thunderbird's ""All Mail"" folder until Trash is emptied.
