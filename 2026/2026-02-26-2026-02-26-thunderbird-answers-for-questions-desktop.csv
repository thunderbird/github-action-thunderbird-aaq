Or it could be that on pc, you send sent messages to a local folder. I can only suggest checking account on both devices. Also, Outlook automatically places a copy in sent folder, so it may be that you are creating two copies, one on server (done automatically) and one on pc. I suggest that you investigate both accounts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
