Emails show correctly on the Yahoo site and on my iPhone. I tried to point the last one that is duplicating to the seemly unused yahoo.com-1 but it made no difference. I put it back .. I can see nowhere in the t@cox settings to duplicate it anywhere.   I also even deleted the bd@c email account in TB—rebooted and added again using the TB defaults and it again pointed to the same yahoo.com-4 duplicating yahoo.com-3 and not the message on that email on the Yahoo server.   Attached also is a screenshot of the inbox of bd@c displaying the incorrect t@c messages.  Any other suggestions ?  Hope I did not confuse you as it did me..I tried to explain the best I could. Please delete any images that you feel expose personal information that could be comprimised.. </p>",oldbob2,false,0,0

But you can make recovery easier by backing up the filter files. Actually, you should consider making regular backups of you entire Thunderbird Profile, but if you're just interested in the filters, they are in files called ""msgFilterRules.dat"", one file in each account folder. For example, in Windows, with an IMAP account, the filter rules file would be found in: </p><p>C:\Users\&lt;your logon name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\&lt;your Thunderbird profile&gt;\ImapMail\&lt;email account name&gt;\msgFilterRules.dat </p><p>Make a copy of those files to a safe location and restore them when necessary, while Thunderbird is closed. </p><p>One thing occurs to me - could your antivirus be falsely flagging and quarantining them as virus/malware? </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
