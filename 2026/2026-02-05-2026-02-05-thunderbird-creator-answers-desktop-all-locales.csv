In thunderbird, when I click to download them, I see a message saying something like ""downlaoding 10 emails"".  After that only 2 or 3 of them have been downloaded, the rest deleted.  Help!  This started happening a couple of weeks ago.  I have tried downloading and re-installing Thunderbird, to no avail.  Should I change my account settings? </p>",ellisboal;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:147.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/147.0;os:windows,0,0,0,,,

Problems seldom come singly and I now find that i cant get into my wife's Thunderbird account on the new Mac Mini. But on the laptop I have no problems. Both accounts have the same addresses yet the email address on the new computer will not accept the password. Any thoughts anyone? </p>,Redland;davidsk;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:Mac Mini M4 Sequoia 15.3.1",1,0,0,,,
