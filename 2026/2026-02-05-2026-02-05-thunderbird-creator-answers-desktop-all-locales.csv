They all have different names--probably because I really don't understand how Thunderbird organizes things in regard to the rest of the internet. Several people in our household share calendars, to keep track of events, tasks due, and medications.  </p><p>So how do I consolidate all the entries in all of these calendars?  I have tried syncing, but that doesn't seem to work. How can I know that when I enter a soccer schedule on (one of) my calendars, it will end up on the calendar that my wife uses to print out our family weekly schedule? </p>",rgathercoal;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:Windows11",0,0,0,,,
