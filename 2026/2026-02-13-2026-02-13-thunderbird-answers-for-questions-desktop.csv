By default, Thunderbird does not display remote content for privacy and security reasons. </p><p>General info on Remote Content. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remote-content-in-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remote-content-in-messages</a> </p><p>Thunderbird can display eg: images that are inline; included in email, but if those images are not inline and only displayed if they can link to an external server - they contain remote content. </p><p>That is not the same as plain text - if remote content is blocked then it's using HTML. 'Plain Text' is a view mode option where all formatting has been stripped. Images are appended to email as attachments. There is an option to display image attachments. So if you are using&nbsp;: View &gt; Message body as &gt; Plain Text and you want to see image attachments displayed then use&nbsp;: View &gt; Display attachments inline. </p><p>All images that contain remote content usually display as a black outline box shape containing a broken link icon in top left corner.  </p><p>Are you seeing black outline box shapes containing the broken link icon&nbsp;? IF no: Then you are not talking about remote content being blocked. Check you are using 'View' &gt; 'Message Body as &gt;'Original HTML' </p><p>IF yes: Is the yellow banner displaying the Options button missing? It sounds like that banner is missing - that used to be a issue some time ago and I've not come across it recently. </p><p>What OS are you using&nbsp;? Windows 11, MAC, Linux etc What version of Thunderbird are using&nbsp;? </p><p>In SEttings &gt; Privacy &amp;Security Is this selected or not: 'Allow remote content in messages' If it's selected: You are seeing the remote content images; they are being allowed so you not see the  yellow banner with the Options button. </p><p>Advice: Do not select the checkbox 'Allow remote content in messages' </p><p>Please confirm it is not selected. Suggest you check what you have already permited. click on the 'Exceptions' buttons Advise you remove everything and click on 'Save Changes'  It's too easy to forget what has been permittted and advisable to perform a reset periodically by cleaning it all up. </p><p>Then exit Thunderbird, wait a few moments for background processes to complete - Restart Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The simplest way to move the sub-folder *04 from *03 back to its ancient position is a drag &amp; drop action on the  Local Folders name (see image). After the drop on Local Folders the folder *04 will automatically be inserted between folders *03 and *05. It works for me whether I do this drag &amp; drop operation in All Folders or Unified Folders view.  One can also try to drag folder *03 directly to its ancient position but this is a very tedious operation with a high failure rate. </p>,Mapenzi,false,0,0
