The simplest way to move the sub-folder *04 from *03 back to its ancient position is a drag &amp; drop action on the  Local Folders name (see image). After the drop on Local Folders the folder *04 will automatically be inserted between folders *03 and *05. It works for me whether I do this drag &amp; drop operation in All Folders or Unified Folders view.  One can also try to drag folder *03 directly to its ancient position but this is a very tedious operation with a high failure rate. </p>,Mapenzi,false,0,0

This is a simple text file. If  very careful, you can edit the file in Notepad if you know what changes are needed and then copy to the IMAP account (with thunderbird not running) and the restart thunderbird. It's a bit tricky, but doable and worth the effort if there are many filters.  Good luck to you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
