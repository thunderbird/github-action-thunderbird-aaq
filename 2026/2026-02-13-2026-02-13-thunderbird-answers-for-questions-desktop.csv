The simplest way to move the sub-folder *04 from *03 back to its ancient position is a drag &amp; drop action on the  Local Folders name (see image). After the drop on Local Folders the folder *04 will automatically be inserted between folders *03 and *05. It works for me whether I do this drag &amp; drop operation in All Folders or Unified Folders view.  One can also try to drag folder *03 directly to its ancient position but this is a very tedious operation with a high failure rate. </p>,Mapenzi,false,0,0
