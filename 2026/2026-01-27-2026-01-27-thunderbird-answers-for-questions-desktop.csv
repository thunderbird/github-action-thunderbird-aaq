As a visual reminder, what is happening is that, when you step 2 and step 8, you will have both Thunderbird open and Windows File Explorer open. By exiting thunderbird, all you will be left with is file explorer. In going through the steps, it becomes obvious.  The profile copes everything, absolutely everything.
