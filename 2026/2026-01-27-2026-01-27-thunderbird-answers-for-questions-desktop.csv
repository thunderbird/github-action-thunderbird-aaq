You are to exit thunderbird to ensure that thunderbird has released control of all the files. Otherwise, you might find the copied profile is incomplete. Yes, as I state in step 8, exit thunderbird prior to pasting the new profile. As a visual reminder, what is happening is that, when you step 2 and step 8, you will have both Thunderbird open and Windows File Explorer open. By exiting thunderbird, all you will be left with is file explorer. In going through the steps, it becomes obvious.  The profile copes everything, absolutely everything.

That is because the thunderbird startup profile expects the same name as the last time. Just leave alone. The best you can do is to not have an unworkable system.
