Then would the whole Thunderbird open under the transferred profile(s)? Your comment about 'external media' may involve using a thumb drive, not a CD, to export the profile?  Why in steps 3 and 8, would I exit Thunderbird before I copy or paste the profile info?  </p><p>Yes, the old PC is a POP account. Would I do things differently then? There are files like 'family' and specific organizations that have emails saved under them, and I would like to save the whole files if possible.  So there is the question: once my profile is open in a new PC, will those files be available in the new profile? Or do I need to download them from the old PC? </p><p>Thank you for your help!

On your issue, Thunderbird is more complex, but it offers more options than all other email clients. One key feature is that you can set the font for your preference, yet not force recipients to see your font instead of their own preference.

It's more steps, but it works.  - create a single email address in the addressbook, populated with all the fields that you would normally use.  - then, export that addressbook to csv - now, open in a spreadsheet and review the top row for column names.  - next, load your outlook csv in spreadsheet and adjust to match the sample that you downloaded. - save as csv with comma-delimited.  - this csv should now import with the column names that work.  </p><p>Question: important, really. When you import the csv, do you see a prompt that shows the columns available and how to match? Please see attached screenshot.
