If you wish, you can go to <a href=""http://connect.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">connect.mozilla.org</a>, and click to the IDEAS section for Thunderbird and record your recommendation there. On your issue, Thunderbird is more complex, but it offers more options than all other email clients. One key feature is that you can set the font for your preference, yet not force recipients to see your font instead of their own preference. I did a summary of steps in a prior post, so I am including a link here to it. It may be useful. Let me know if any issues.  </p><pre>  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1462509"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1462509</a> </pre>",davidsk,false,1,0
