I tried to do that by - Clicking on Message List Display Options at upper right - Selecting Sort by - Date But the messages are not in date order regardless of whether I select Ascending or Descending. </p><p>For example recent emails displayed in this order: 1/2/2026 1/1/2026 1/3/2026 (Date not displayed because it's today) 12/24/2026 1/3/2026 (Date not displayed because it's today) I'm using - PC with Windows 11 - Thunderbird release 146.01 (64 bit) which at least now is the latest release. </p><p>I welcome and appreciate any suggestions. Thanks, Marc </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,"",Marcgee

One says ""Sent"", one says and one says ""Sent Items"". </p><pre>We need to have one eliminated. One never shows ANY sent messages, one will show a sent email, but has ""lost"" most of the ones from earlier. </pre> <p>This is more than annoying. We got a nice response earlier from one the community helpers, but it did not work at all. Anyone else care to give it a go. We have version 146.0.1 Again, many thanks </p>",thunderbird;email-and-messaging;,thunderbird,email-and-messaging,en-US,"",charles116
