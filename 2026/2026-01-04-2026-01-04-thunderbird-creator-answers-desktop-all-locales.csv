I tried to do that by - Clicking on Message List Display Options at upper right - Selecting Sort by - Date But the messages are not in date order regardless of whether I select Ascending or Descending. </p><p>For example recent emails displayed in this order: 1/2/2026 1/1/2026 1/3/2026 (Date not displayed because it's today) 12/24/2026 1/3/2026 (Date not displayed because it's today) I'm using - PC with Windows 11 - Thunderbird release 146.01 (64 bit) which at least now is the latest release. </p><p>I welcome and appreciate any suggestions. Thanks, Marc </p>",thunderbird;customization;,thunderbird,customization,en-US,1791316;,Marcgee

We got a nice response earlier from one the community helpers, but it did not work at all. Anyone else care to give it a go.

I wish to transfer all my Thunderbird data to a machine running Linux Mint 21.3 which has Thunderbird 128.12.0esr. I have not been successful after many tries. Could this be because the Thunderbird revisions are different? If so, can I get 115.18.0 to install on my Mint machine? If not how should I proceed? I have already tried creating a new .thunderbird directory with ********.default directory from the other machine.
