Thunderbird opens the profiles.ini file to get the name of the profile folder. the named folder has been removed or renamed and thunderbird then shuts down.

As Matt wonders, is anti-virus software causing the slowness? </p><p>You could use saved search folders, one for each sender. That should segregate messages by sender quickly, but it would not move messages physically out of the inbox. </p><p>Some e-mail service providers allow users to download messages through a browser instead of in the e-mail client. That might be faster. But then you would want to import those messages into local folders and work with them from there. May not be the workflow that you want. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
