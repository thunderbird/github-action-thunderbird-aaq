My guess is there is a difference in version numbers and there may be a compatibility.ini file that could be deleted.

I simply want TB to do a fresh start on a new profile.    </p><p>I haven't used it for email on this instance for several years. (I do use it on my Win 11 instance.)  And the POP and IMAP folders in the default profile would need to be dropped or changed radically anyway since <a href=""http://cox.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cox.net</a> was rerouted to yahoo last year.  So a clean start would be fine.  I had uninstalled TB when the problem first arose, and now moved the default profile elsewhere.

It seems to be some undesirable interaction between Google Calendar, Google Contacts, and Thunderbird. Calendar notifications can be turned off in Thunderbird, but that takes away much of the utility of the calendar in the first place.  As far as I know there is no definitive explanation, and no real solution. But if somebody has one, I'm all ears. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
