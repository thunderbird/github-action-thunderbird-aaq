These do have some tendency to time out what large quantities of mail are involved,  but you can just run them again tomorrow and get the ""next batch""  it is also a really good idea to only have windows defender active while moving large quantities of IMAP mail.

As Matt wonders, is anti-virus software causing the slowness? </p><p>You could use saved search folders, one for each sender. That should segregate messages by sender quickly, but it would not move messages physically out of the inbox. </p><p>Some e-mail service providers allow users to download messages through a browser instead of in the e-mail client. That might be faster. But then you would want to import those messages into local folders and work with them from there. May not be the workflow that you want. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
