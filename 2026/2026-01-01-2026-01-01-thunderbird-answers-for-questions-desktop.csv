In general, Thunderbird does not support or debug addons; that is the developer role. Also, by using the latest release, you are more likely to encounter addon issues, as developers must be continually involved with latest updates. it is routine for users to post that an addon isn't working properly with the latest release. If reliable results from addons is a priority, my personal recommendation is to stick with the ESR release. My opinion - and it's nothing more than that - is that the developer has direct contact with the appropriate persons and could probably work through this issue better.

The XPI file has a manifest.json file which shows  ""strict_max_version"": ""145.*"" even though the developer documentation shows compatibility up to 147. I think that puts it in the developer's court.  </p><p>I even tried to edit the json file to change the number to 147, filed it and re-zipped it up.

I have been frustrated beyond belief and this has ""almost"" restored my sanity! </p><p>That setting must be fairly new.

Here goes a CUT/PASTE I hope works!&nbsp;:-) </p><p>I suspect the font and any character colors will be altered, but I have to try. </p> <h6 id=""w_"">=====================================================================================</h6> <p>Early in my career as an entrepreneur of IT ventures, I coined a phrase by which I have lived ever since, and I believe to be true to this day - almost 50 years later: </p><p>""Friendship is the currency of life,"" and I spend it freely.  </p><p>My returns have been exponential, which is why I believe it to be true; and it all stems from a simple premise:  Whether I meet you for the first time via this media, a phone call or in person ... when I ask you to be my friend, two circumstances arise, immediately.  </p><p>You can say ""No,"" and I have lost nothing. We weren't friends prior; so nothing changes.  (Although you have lost an opportunity for a great, long lasting friendship.) </p><p>Or you can say ""Yes,"" and a world of possibilities begins!  It becomes even easier, if you can adopt my perspective:  I look at you as a lifelong friend; but we both have an ""amnesia of sorts"" ... because we lack the natural history that would have been ours had we been boyhood pals.  Thus, from this day forward, we have every opportunity to enjoy life as friends and/or colleagues ... building our ""new memories"" and natural history.  </p><p>The reward?  Not only a great friendship; but - for those who can ""handle it"" - and they are truly few and unique to be sure - an immediate opportunity to be candid, frank and honest about all we have to say to one another ... rather than searching for the politically or socially correct language. </p><p>A freedom of expression found only among GOOD &amp; BEST FRIENDS. (I love that freedom!) </p><p>I found the page below from an article written in 2009 - long after the events in my life, circa 1976, which gave me the above insights ... and I feel it states my thoughts VERY well. Sadly, I didn't capture the author's name for attribution. </p> <h6 id=""w__2"">=====================================================================================</h6> <p>FRIENDSHIP AND THE ""SERVICE"" IT REQUIRES </p><p>Friendships are not - or should not be - considered casual, insignificant events in life. Those are called Acquaintances.  </p><p>Friendship implies a bond between two or more people that represents an enduring quality - founded on similar interests, mutual enjoyment of one another and those interests, and above all, TRUST. </p><p>Would you give your TRUST to just anyone?  If the answer is ""Yes,"" you do not understand the principles described herein.  (This is the only precept with which I disagree ... given the caveat that ""it is not trusting someone with my life!""  I believe you should trust everyone ... until they prove unworthy.  Those people usually show their 'true colors' before long - intended or otherwise.  There is far too much distrust or suspicion in the world today, IMHO.) </p><p>Good friends enjoy all of the above. A best friend, and there can truly be only ONE, not many, also enjoys a confidence that is founded on that TRUST - all of which relies on complete and total HONESTY!  </p><p>That is why - when good and best friends have been apart for any length of time, they can resume as if no gap in time existed. For those too shy - or even too foolish - to recognize it, it is all based on LOVE. For oneself and those to whom we ENTRUST our friendship. </p><p>That is why a FRIENDSHIP is NOT a casual event.  It matters greatly and should be dealt with accordingly.  </p><p>Friendship is not work; but it does and should require service.  It's called PARTICIPATION and it has to come from both parties; but no judgment as to the ""amount"" of participation should ever be assessed.  (Those, who have visited our home as dinner guests, have all heard me say this: ""Thank you for your participation!"") </p><p>It's called doing the best you can!  </p><p>There will always be dissimilar schedules and other life-events that keep friends apart - but those are NOT lapses in friendship; rather (almost painful) separation from a dear friend!  These periods of separation should never be off-putting. Disappointing, even sad, but never a feeling that the bond has been broken. </p><p>Only by verbal, face to face encounters should friendships be ended ... with reason(s); never by assumption. </p><p>Thus, if I am unable to fulfill an expectation or seem to be ever-unavailable, it is OK to ask ""Why?!"" If the answer is unacceptable, then a solution needs to be worked out. If it means the end of the friendship, the bond was not what you thought, hoped for - or wanted. </p><p>Termination occurs. That is why finding and keeping GOOD friends and a BEST friend is so important.  (And not being shy about telling those you care about ... that you do!  Too often, and often too soon, that opportunity is taken away from all of us!) </p><p>If you understand, as I do, that events can keep friends apart - often for long periods of time - but their hearts remain committed to one another ... then all is well ... and will resume again, as noted above.  </p><p>Never be fearful of Friendship ... just learn to notice - and accept - the difference between it and an Acquaintance. The former will always endure. Embrace its continuum - few things in life are as good.&nbsp;:-) </p> <h6 id=""w__3"">=====================================================================================</h6> <p>Needless to say, I am delighted this worked, albeit with some ""emphasis from color"" omitted. </p><p>""Thank you, again, Rick"" for being my man among men for 2026! </p>",tkg1cpmg,false,0,0
