The changes don't work at all, only the ones I make to the servers in Account Settings &gt; Outgoing Server:{pick one of the saved configurations} &gt; ""Edit outgoing server..."". That is, changes done to the configuration of the selected Outgoing Server are saved. However, as soon as I switch to another section (e.g. Server Settings), this field reverts back to ""Outgoing Server: Use Default Server"". Thus, I can only really use the Default Server as outgoing server. I also can't create new configurations for new outgoing servers, only the ones that were already saved are there, there are no buttons to create a new outgoing server config. </p><p>Also, if I change the color, or the account name, or try to delete the account, nothing changes, even before restarting Thunderbird. That's why I think none of the changes on the Account Settings page I screenshot are saved, but the ones in subpages (like Server Settings and Spam Settings) seem to be working, though I haven't tried altering them for fear of breaking them. </p><p>In regard to Thunderbird not shutting down: <strong>I did find multiple prefs.js files inside my profile folder</strong>, prefs.js, prefs-2.js, prefs-3.js, prefs-4.js.

Those two issues are the cause of many problems posted here. the fact that you have multiple prefs files is proof that thunderbird is not shutting down properly. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0
