On the second computer, the only solution I have found to force thunderbird to let me choose which calendar to use is to make the new calendar I just added read only. If this is the case, I can choose among my other calendars. I also tried selecting the calendar I want the invitation to go to in the left pane of the calendar tab before accepting the invitation, but if the new calendar is not read-only, invitations still go to that calendar regardless.

If I do this once, I can then associate the new calendar with my work email again and the option to select calendars still appears when I accept an invitation.

If this happened to me, and the workarounds were unsatisfactory, I'd be inclined to create a new test profile (Help/Troubleshooting Info, about:profiles), add the accounts and calendars, making sure each is read/write capable, and associated with the correct email account.  Then, see if they work properly with invitations.  This might be a lot faster and more effective than trying to debug the current profile. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

After rebooting, it seems like it goes back to automatically saving to the wrong calendar. For the time being I am using the workaround of making the calendar read-only unless I specifically need to add an event to that calendar. Not particularly efficient, but a workable solution.

The changes don't work at all, only the ones I make to the servers in Account Settings &gt; Outgoing Server:{pick one of the saved configurations} &gt; ""Edit outgoing server..."". That is, changes done to the configuration of the selected Outgoing Server are saved. However, as soon as I switch to another section (e.g. Server Settings), this field reverts back to ""Outgoing Server: Use Default Server"". Thus, I can only really use the Default Server as outgoing server. I also can't create new configurations for new outgoing servers, only the ones that were already saved are there, there are no buttons to create a new outgoing server config. </p><p>Also, if I change the color, or the account name, or try to delete the account, nothing changes, even before restarting Thunderbird. That's why I think none of the changes on the Account Settings page I screenshot are saved, but the ones in subpages (like Server Settings and Spam Settings) seem to be working, though I haven't tried altering them for fear of breaking them. </p><p>In regard to Thunderbird not shutting down: <strong>I did find multiple prefs.js files inside my profile folder</strong>, prefs.js, prefs-2.js, prefs-3.js, prefs-4.js.
