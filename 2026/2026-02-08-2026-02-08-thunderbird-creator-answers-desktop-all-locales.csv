I had a problem with my printer connection, and tried to solve it by rolling back my Linux O/S, (using Timeshift) to a date prior to the printer not connecting.  (It didn't help.)  But what it *did* do was to screw up my TB, which when I tried to open it, after the roll-back, complained that the TB profile was ""newer"", and I needed to create a new one.  I did this, but then found that all my old emails had disappeared and it had started a complete new collection of emails, and all the mail folders had disappeared .  I went back to the data backups from prior to the rollback, (using Cronopete), and was able to find the TB profile (and 5 years' worth of old emails) in the .Thunderbird folder in the Home directory.  And I have pursued the profile manager in TB, and located the profile from before my roll-back.  But I can't figure out how to recover this old one.  I have a button ""Set as Default"", (I hesitated to commit to this - should I?), and another for ""Launch Profile"".  But when I click on this last, it drops right back into the requirement to create a new profile.  I already have one new profile, (which was created when I tried to sign on to TB after the roll-back.)  I can't see much point in making yet another one.  And I don't really understand how the data are stored in the profile in any case.  (emails seem to be in a Mail folder, but are scattered about in a whole series of sub-folders and files within the Mail folder).  And some of the numbered ""profiles"" seem to refer to things other than Thuderbird, (they lack any folder named ""Mail"".) </p>",dmaxwell1;davidsk;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0;os:Linux Mint;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles""];solver_id:5977441",7,0,0,,,
