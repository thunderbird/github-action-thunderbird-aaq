I am aware that there is a valid argument against PGP/inline and a workaround for using it regardless [1]. However, there are also some use cases, which apparently led to it being implemented for Android [2].  My use case are PGP/inline signatures for (unencrypted) newsgroup posts. In this context, the advantages of MIME are less pronounced and some disadvantages show. PGP is less supported by newsreaders, which in the worst case leads to illegible messages in the case of MIME. In some groups, multipart messages are prohibited by the charter. Similarly, for discussion based groups, attachments are seldom (or prohibited) and messages often monolithic, thus ensuring integrity even with PGP/inline. Also, privacy (unencrypted metadata) is not really a concern on a public message board. While PGP/MIME is a good default, newsgroups are an example where it would be desirable to have an option to switch to PGP/inline on a message-by-message basis or even as an account default. There are already PGP specific options in both, the account settings and the message settings. Extending that by another checkbox seems like a good solution to me. </p><p>[1] <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1446050"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1446050</a> [2] <a href=""https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/issues/1974"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/issues/1974</a> </p>",zwergziege;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:147.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/147.0;os:Linux;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq""]",0,0,0,,,

Even using the ""Restore Default Set"" option fails to bring the essential navigation buttons back. While I can eventually fix these issues as a power user, these constant, breaking UI changes are a major problem for average users. For instance, my 65-year-old mother relies on a stable interface. Every time a rollout breaks the visual layout or hides basic functions, she is unable to use her email until I step in to fix what the update messed up. </p><p>Forcing users to manually rebuild their primary navigation toolbar after an update is not a ""feature""—it’s a regression that alienates long-time especially elderly users who need reliability over constant redesigns.

Nach geöffnetem Profilordner habe ich die Datei &lt;global-messages-db.sqlite&gt; gefunden, Thunderbird geschlossen und diese Datei gelöscht. Nach wie vor fehlt jedoch bei Neuöffnung von Thunderbird beim Posteingang der Ordner &lt;TU&gt; mit den vielen Unterordnern. Es wäre durchaus möglich, dass dieser Ordner &lt;TU&gt; eine Größe von mehr als 2 GB mit seinen vielen Unterordnern besitzt ? Inzwischen habe ich beim Posteingang eigentlich parallel zu &lt;TU&gt; einen neuen Ordner &lt;XXX&gt; angelegt, der auch angezeigt bleibt. Bestimmt lässt sich dies bei Thunderbird mit einigen Klicks wieder aktivieren. Für Ihre Hilfe möchte ich Ihnen im Voraus danken. Mit freundlichen Grüßen H.
