Recently, I moved TBird data from a Dell  Inspiron 530 Win 7, to Alien Arora 1250. Unfortunately, the passwords would not go, so I copy and pasted the data for 10 email addresses. All worked well, until 5 days ago when I could not log into the ISP.  </p><p>Since then, 12 ISP tech support people gave me 12 different was to fix the login problem. The 'logging in' kept trying to login. The only way to stop it is to close TB and restart it. The same happens with all 10 accounts - can't login. </p><p>I followed instructions to the letter and nothing worked. Later, a tech at ISP said they have had a lot of complaints from people with Tbird and said it's Mozilla's fault. They all said they don't support Thunderbird. They only support webmail. One even suggested I delete all my cookies. Of course I'm not going to do that. </p><p>You would not believe the amount of crazy ideas I was given. </p><p>Here is the core problem: </p><p>I used both Pop and IMAP depending on the email account. TBird was great with POP and IMAP either.  </p><p>I changed all the passwords as instructed. I followed the Step-x-Step settings on the ISP web site </p><p>The ISP, Rogers, took over Shaw. Rogers, I'm told, dropped support for 3rd party email clients and requires customers to create a new email on their Webmail host. Webmail is WEBmail because it is not Email.  </p><p><strong>Testing Out TBird:</strong> </p> <ol><li> On the old Win 7 TBird (Ver. 68.1.1 (32-bit)) Email works with both POP and IMAP settings. </li><li> On the new Rig, Tbird (V. 147.0 (64-bit)) worked for a while.  </li></ol> <p><em>What Happens:</em> -- Due to the issues, I set Tbird to <strong>not</strong>:,  -- Check for new messages at startup -- Check for new messages every -- Automatically download new messages -- Fetch headers only </p><p>The two ISP are <a href=""https://rogers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Rogers</a> Rogers and <a href=""https://shaw.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Shaw</a> &lt;--- just redirects to Rogers.

I have just put up with it... currently running Tbird 147 and it just happened. </p><p>When editing an email (either the body or the Subject), if you use the backspace button (the one that deletes to the left) to delete some text sometimes the cursor will incorrectly be positioned about 5 or 6 characters further left than it should. </p><p>For example, if I had the text:  ""Quick brown fox jumps over the moon"" </p><p>If I were to highlight ""fox"" in the above example, and hit backspace, I would expect the cursor to end up positioned between the remaining spaces after 'brown' ( pipe symbol here is meant to represent the cursor position):  ""brown | jumps"" </p><p>But instead what happens is that the cursor ends up somewhere among/before the word ""brown"".  It's always further left than it should be, by 5 or 6 characters. </p><p>I believe it only happens when highlighting multiple characters and then hitting backspace.  It may be more (only?) prevalent when editing/replying to an existing email.  (But I'm still only editing the new portions that I add at the top of the email; I'm almost never editing in amongst the original quoted email content.) </p><p>I also haven't ever been able to figure out how to make it happen, sorry.  It is just random...It will happen once in an email, but then not again.  But it happens frequently - 3-6 times a day perhaps.  (Depends on how many emails I am editing. &nbsp;:) )  </p><p>I don't believe that I have noticed this issue if I were using the Delete button (deletes things to the right).  I don't think it happens when backspacing one character at a time...but it might.  I also use Option-Backspace to delete whole words at a time (instead of highlighting the word); not exactly sure if it happens only if highlighting a word, or only if Option-Backspace, or single key press... sorry, it is so random and unexpected that I don't have more specifics. </p>",Cronk;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:147.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/147.0;os:MacOS 15.7.3,0,0,0,,,
