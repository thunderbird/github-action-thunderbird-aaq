I wonder who sent this mail to me.  </pre> <pre>When this mail was sent to me, a red spam mail mark was attached to this mail. Usually, when I received a spam mail, I transfer the spam mail to a spam mail folder. But in this case, if I transfer this mail to a spam mail folder, I worries that transformation might transfer a mail from my acquaintance to the spam mail folder from that time on. </pre> <pre>In the main body of the mail which I received at January 29 18:35, 2026, it was written as follows. </pre> <p>"" Account is invalid. </p><pre>When this page is displayed, the total of the account ""<a href=""http://asahi.email.ne.jp"" rel=""nofollow"">asahi.email.ne.jp</a>"" is invalid. </pre> <p>The procedure to confirm the reason  1.

Recently, I moved TBird data from a Dell  Inspiron 530 Win 7, to Alien Arora 1250. Unfortunately, the passwords would not go, so I copy and pasted the data for 10 email addresses. All worked well, until 5 days ago when I could not log into the ISP.  </p><p>Since then, 12 ISP tech support people gave me 12 different was to fix the login problem. The 'logging in' kept trying to login. The only way to stop it is to close TB and restart it. The same happens with all 10 accounts - can't login. </p><p>I followed instructions to the letter and nothing worked. Later, a tech at ISP said they have had a lot of complaints from people with Tbird and said it's Mozilla's fault. They all said they don't support Thunderbird. They only support webmail. One even suggested I delete all my cookies. Of course I'm not going to do that. </p><p>You would not believe the amount of crazy ideas I was given. </p><p>Here is the core problem: </p><p>I used both Pop and IMAP depending on the email account. TBird was great with POP and IMAP either.  </p><p>I changed all the passwords as instructed. I followed the Step-x-Step settings on the ISP web site </p><p>The ISP, Rogers, took over Shaw. Rogers, I'm told, dropped support for 3rd party email clients and requires customers to create a new email on their Webmail host. Webmail is WEBmail because it is not Email.  </p><p><strong>Testing Out TBird:</strong> </p> <ol><li> On the old Win 7 TBird (Ver. 68.1.1 (32-bit)) Email works with both POP and IMAP settings. </li><li> On the new Rig, Tbird (V. 147.0 (64-bit)) worked for a while.  </li></ol> <p><em>What Happens:</em> -- Due to the issues, I set Tbird to <strong>not</strong>:,  -- Check for new messages at startup -- Check for new messages every -- Automatically download new messages -- Fetch headers only </p><p>The two ISP are <a href=""https://rogers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Rogers</a> Rogers and <a href=""https://shaw.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Shaw</a> &lt;--- just redirects to Rogers.
