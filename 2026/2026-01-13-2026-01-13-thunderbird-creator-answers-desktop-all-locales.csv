These were also deleted from Thunderbird (2 Gmail accounts) on our PC. We recovered the emails, in the process having to change my Google Password. Whilst the deleted emails returned, one Thunderbird Gmail account was not receiving new incoming emails. (one account is) The emails are arriving as normal into Gmail. After various unsuccessful attempts to to connect to the server  I  deleted the defective  Gmail account from Thunderbird, using the Red Button in account settings, hoping to then be able to reinstall it as a new account.  When I attempt to reinstall  the now ""deleted"" account I get the yellow ""Unable to log in at Server"" message.  . The password I am using to add the account is the same as the one I use to sign into that account on Gmail (set on Monday), but it does not seem to be working on TB. I tried the trick of not putting in the password when setting up the new account but this did not work either. I am using TB 140.6.0esr  Any suggestion please John </p>",barbnjohn;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/find-what-version-thunderbird-you-are-using""]",0,0,0,,,
