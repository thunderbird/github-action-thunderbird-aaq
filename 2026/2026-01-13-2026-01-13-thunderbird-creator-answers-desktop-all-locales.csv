She is struggling because she relies on her program (formerly mac Mail) 'knowing' the addresses of contacts and autosuggesting when she types the first few letters. Obviously with a fresh install of TB, it doesn't 'know' any of her contacts. Is there a way to make it learn from the Sent Items folder? So that it auto adds all addresses she HAS SENT TO (in the past), to her contacts/address book?

So I had an account on the Thunderbird add-on page and created some collections and also a Firefox account for sync. </p><p>Since the Firefox account became the Mozilla account, I haven't logged into the Thunderbird add-on site: <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net</a> Just now I noticed, that there is only the Mozilla account login available and I cannot get into my old Thunderbird account. </p><p>If I log in with my Mozilla (formerly Firefox) account, I am logged into a new/empty/un-customized account on the Thunderbird add-on site. If I try to change my username to what I used before, it tells me that username is taken. That means my old account still exists! Yay! </p><p>Now my question is, how do I recover it? How do I log back into it? Can I connect it to my Mozilla account? </p><p>Other people seem to have run into the same issue: <a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/how-to-connect-thunderbird-to-my-mozilla-account-without-loosing/td-p/56623"" rel=""nofollow"">https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/how-to-connect-thunderbird-to-my-mozilla-account-without-loosing/td-p/56623</a> </p><p>Please help me with that.
