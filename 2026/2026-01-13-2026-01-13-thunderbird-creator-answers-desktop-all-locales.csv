She is struggling because she relies on her program (formerly mac Mail) 'knowing' the addresses of contacts and autosuggesting when she types the first few letters. Obviously with a fresh install of TB, it doesn't 'know' any of her contacts. Is there a way to make it learn from the Sent Items folder? So that it auto adds all addresses she HAS SENT TO (in the past), to her contacts/address book?
