In many cases, emails are not permanently deleted, but the folder is no longer visible or mapped correctly. When system folders like Deleted / Trash disappear, Thunderbird may stop syncing those emails correctly. If the issue isn’t addressed early, users can lose access to emails that still exist in backups or archives. If the Deleted folder has vanished and emails are no longer accessible through Thunderbird, <strong><a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">BitRecover Thunderbird Converter</a></strong> provides a safe alternative to bring back previously stored or archived mailbox data directly into Thunderbird, without relying on server synchronization. </p>",khushiratra.pcvita,true,0,0

It puts them in Trash, with, on rare occasion, a mistake. </p><p>I want TB to filter MY LIST as mail arrives, and delete ONLY what I specify. But DELETE those, not move them to trash. My filter would catch about 95%+ of all the spam. It would not make mistakes.
