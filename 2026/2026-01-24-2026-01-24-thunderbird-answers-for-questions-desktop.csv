This is not a general Firefox or Thunderbird problem, but a system defaults issue. </p><p>It would be helpful if you told us what version of Thunderbird you are using and what your computer operating system is. I'll assume it's the latest Windows 11. Try this solution. Substitute your browser of choice for Chrome. You might have to change the default a couple of times for it to stick. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1525950"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1525950</a> </p><p>This worked for me. I changed from Firefox to Edge and back and it worked as expected. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

It usually means the sending (SMTP) server has gone off-line. However, in one recent case, it turns out the the error message was misleading, and that the email provider had changed their server address but neglected to tell their users. Can you contact your mail host support (on-line or by phone) and confirm the email settings and inquire if they are having system problems? </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

I'm not aware of an incompatibility between Ver. 146 and 147, but I could have missed it. In general, I have not had any major issues transferring profiles from near versions between Windows and Linux (Mint and Ubuntu.) </p><p>There is a possible issue in both Windows and Linux about exporting profiles larger than 2 GB. Could that be the case here? If so, the profile can be copied and imported manually. Please ask if you'd like instructions. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0
