In many cases, emails are not permanently deleted, but the folder is no longer visible or mapped correctly. When system folders like Deleted / Trash disappear, Thunderbird may stop syncing those emails correctly. If the issue isn’t addressed early, users can lose access to emails that still exist in backups or archives. If the Deleted folder has vanished and emails are no longer accessible through Thunderbird, <strong><a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">BitRecover Thunderbird Converter</a></strong> provides a safe alternative to bring back previously stored or archived mailbox data directly into Thunderbird, without relying on server synchronization. </p>",khushiratra.pcvita,true,0,0

This is not a general Firefox or Thunderbird problem, but a system defaults issue. </p><p>It would be helpful if you told us what version of Thunderbird you are using and what your computer operating system is. I'll assume it's the latest Windows 11. Try this solution. Substitute your browser of choice for Chrome. You might have to change the default a couple of times for it to stick. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1525950"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1525950</a> </p><p>This worked for me.

It usually means the sending (SMTP) server has gone off-line. However, in one recent case, it turns out the the error message was misleading, and that the email provider had changed their server address but neglected to tell their users. Can you contact your mail host support (on-line or by phone) and confirm the email settings and inquire if they are having system problems? </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

I'm not aware of an incompatibility between Ver. 146 and 147, but I could have missed it. In general, I have not had any major issues transferring profiles from near versions between Windows and Linux (Mint and Ubuntu.) </p><p>There is a possible issue in both Windows and Linux about exporting profiles larger than 2 GB. Could that be the case here? If so, the profile can be copied and imported manually. Please ask if you'd like instructions. </p>",rednoise,false,0,0

If you run into one, it probably would be either a bug in how many accounts the folder pane can display or due to ""Use Global Inbox"" being checked for that account.  1000 accounts sounds ambitious though. </p>",christ1,false,0,0
