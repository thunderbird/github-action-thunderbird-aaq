I never would have guessed that the File menu would be acting as a contextual menu, as this does not conform to any UI standard.  I don't know of any other program that uses the File menu as a contextual menu like this.  This is horrible user interface design.  The right-click contextual menu provides no option to export the private key.  Instead, the right-click contextual menu has been broken into two parts, with the part of the right-click contextual menu that should allow exporting the private key actually appearing in the File menu instead.  It's amazing that a user interface with so many users can be so poorly implemented.  Just amazing. </p>",bugzillameow,false,0,0

This is a bit clumsy, but I don't know your comfort zone. Do this. - Delete the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder - download thunderbird again from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> and reinstall it - start thunderbird, skip the option for new email address, and click help&gt;troubleshootinginfformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - EXIT thunderbird   &lt;== IMPORTANT - you are now in the profile.

My assumption is that Thunderbird was already installed and that you were updating to a newer version. Try this: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles' - if there is more than one profile showing, click 'open folder' on the inactive one - now, the addressbook's name is  abook.sqlite. do you see one there, that may have been updated recently? If so, that may be your missing addressbook. If so, then copy the abook.sqlite and history.sqlite files  to a separate folder (This is temporary) - now, close windows file manager and you are back in thunderbird at the list of profiles. Now, click 'open folder' for the active profile, then EXIT THUNDERBIRD, now, paste the two copied addressbooks here, overlaying the current files.  - now, restart thunderbird and your addressbook should be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My second suggestion (which may be too drastic, depending on volume of your mail) is to rename the msgfilterrules.dat file with thunderbird not running and then run thunderbird without filters to see if the unwanted mail movement continues. If the messages that you didn't want to be filter are be handled properly, that confirms that there is a problem in the filter somewhere.  The other option is to post screenshots of all filters, including details on the email addresses that are going wrong and to which folder.  Doing that may not give you the response you need, but no one can advise without seeing the details. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I will ignore your vulgarity and attempt to give a useful response. To be clear, you are NOT clear in explaining your issue. Is this same email being returned to the inbox, or is more email coming to you from the same sender? If it's the latter, Thunderbird is doing what its documentation says; it uses a Bayesian filter as documented here::  </p><pre><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a>   What that means is that Thunderbird evaluates each incoming message on its own merits. Translation for you: thunderbird does not have a black list; just because you mark a message as spam does not guarantee that future messages will be marked as spam. If you want thunderbird to be more active, you have an obligation, also documented, to train thunderbird by identifying regularly both spam and non-spam. With that, I end my response.
