I never would have guessed that the File menu would be acting as a contextual menu, as this does not conform to any UI standard.  I don't know of any other program that uses the File menu as a contextual menu like this.  This is horrible user interface design.  The right-click contextual menu provides no option to export the private key.  Instead, the right-click contextual menu has been broken into two parts, with the part of the right-click contextual menu that should allow exporting the private key actually appearing in the File menu instead.  It's amazing that a user interface with so many users can be so poorly implemented.  Just amazing. </p>",bugzillameow,false,0,0

If your backup is a copy of the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder, just copy that thunderbird folder to overlay the existing appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder with thunderbird NOT RUNNING, and restart thunderbird.  </p><p>OK, if all you have is a backup of the profile, here's another, low-tech, approach. This is a bit clumsy, but I don't know your comfort zone. Do this. - Delete the appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder - download thunderbird again from <a href=""http://thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">thunderbird.net</a> and reinstall it - start thunderbird, skip the option for new email address, and click help&gt;troubleshootinginfformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - EXIT thunderbird   &lt;== IMPORTANT - you are now in the profile. Copy your backup profile folder's contents and paste to overlay all content here - restart thunderbird </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My assumption is that Thunderbird was already installed and that you were updating to a newer version. Try this: - click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles' - if there is more than one profile showing, click 'open folder' on the inactive one - now, the addressbook's name is  abook.sqlite. do you see one there, that may have been updated recently? If so, that may be your missing addressbook. If so, then copy the abook.sqlite and history.sqlite files  to a separate folder (This is temporary) - now, close windows file manager and you are back in thunderbird at the list of profiles. Now, click 'open folder' for the active profile, then EXIT THUNDERBIRD, now, paste the two copied addressbooks here, overlaying the current files.  - now, restart thunderbird and your addressbook should be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
