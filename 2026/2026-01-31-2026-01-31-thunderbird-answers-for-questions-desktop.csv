I never would have guessed that the File menu would be acting as a contextual menu, as this does not conform to any UI standard.  I don't know of any other program that uses the File menu as a contextual menu like this.  This is horrible user interface design.  The right-click contextual menu provides no option to export the private key.  Instead, the right-click contextual menu has been broken into two parts, with the part of the right-click contextual menu that should allow exporting the private key actually appearing in the File menu instead.  It's amazing that a user interface with so many users can be so poorly implemented.  Just amazing. </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

If the messages that you didn't want to be filter are be handled properly, that confirms that there is a problem in the filter somewhere.  The other option is to post screenshots of all filters, including details on the email addresses that are going wrong and to which folder.

I have been working on this for about a week  I was unable to send emails with my spectrum account because of a timing out issue.  I have been reading various ways to try to fix it and somehow I wound up with the illustrated stuck on the email page in Thunderbird.  (I can send emails from the Spectrum site.)  I tried to delete it but can't and it locked up my account.  I wound up deleting Thunderbird and reinstalling it but it is still there.  (I also tried Betterbird and it was there too.)  My guess is I messed up my profile some how.  I still get incoming emails but I can't send the above or delete the page.  (It doesn't affect my gmail.) I am sorry about not doing a better explanation.  I am obviously not a computer wiz.   I know you are a regular helper (I have seen your answers) so what we think is a major problem may have an obvious solution to you.  I don't like to mess around with things because I am always afraid something like this will happen and make it worse. I have been using Thunderbird for years and I am used to the setup and like it.  My favorite thing is the contact list on the left side making it easy to choose multiple addresses.  And it is compact and you can see everything you need.
