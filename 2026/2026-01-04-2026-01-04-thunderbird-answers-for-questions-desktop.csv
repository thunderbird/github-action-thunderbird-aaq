In the instructions you sent me Mr Toad, you said to ensure that Thunderbird was not running on either machine when the file manipulations are done. I certainly have ensured that Thunderbird was not running on the Mint machine, but I was not 100% sure that I had closed it on the Win7. So I just went through it all again. I transferred only lu4hnubh.default-release, and deleted the two files as instructed. It didn't work, and I got the octopus screen again. When I powered up Thunderbird, there was only lu4hnubh.default-release in the ,thunderbird directory. Immediately afterwards, it had this: drwx------  8 richard richard 12288 Jan 13 20:33 5c3cd7li.default-release drwx------  3 richard richard  4096 Jan 13 20:33 Crash Reports -rw-rw-r--  1 richard richard     0 Jan 13 20:41 folder_listing.txt -rw-rw-r--  1 richard richard    62 Jan 13 20:33 installs.ini drwxr-xr-x 14 richard richard 12288 Jan 13 20:32 lu4hnubh.default-release drwx------  2 richard richard  4096 Jan 13 20:33 Pending Pings -rw-rw-r--  1 richard richard   259 Jan 13 20:33 profiles.ini drwx------  2 richard richard  4096 Jan 13 20:33 x7aum95y.default </p><p>Note that there are TWO xxxxxx.default-release folders. It seems that the Mint Thunderbird has just made its own and ignored the seed. You wrote that either the default or the default-release folder would do, which seemed to imply that they are roughly equivalent. On my Win7 system, OisOy8wr.default is 18.5GB whereas lu4hnubh.default-release is only 16.1 MB If the profile can fit in 16.1 MB, then what can Thunderbird be doing to take up 18.5GB in the other folder? Have not tackled the change of version matter yet. Thankyou. </p>",firefox1295,false,0,0

E-mail clients provide a way to access messages in e-mail accounts that are hosted on a server and to send and retrieve messages through and from those accounts. It does not replace those accounts. There is no such thing (yet) as a Thunderbird e-mail address. You can use Thunderbird in place of whatever you use to <strong>access</strong> your gmail account, but you would still be using your gmail account in Thunderbird. The only way to escape Google completely is to get an e-mail account from someone else, e.g., Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple, Fastmail, or your internet service provider. Then you could use Thunderbird with that account. </p><p>Mozilla is the organization that makes Thunderbird and Firefox. Firefox is a web browser like Chrome and Safari.
