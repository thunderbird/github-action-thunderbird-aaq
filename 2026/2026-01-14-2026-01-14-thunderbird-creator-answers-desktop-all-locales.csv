Maybe not the most efficient setup, but it means I don't have to scan 14 different inboxes to find the messages I most need. </p><p>I currently use ±89 filters on this primary account to file messages in a LOT of mailserver-based folders, and a few folders on the laptop. ±90% of the traffic gets filed in server-based folders so I can use any device to access message history. (I should probably note that these filters and message-threading don't always play nice together.) </p><p>For a long time, one of the message filters I'll call ""Filter BS"" successfully filed specific messages in ""Folder BS,"" a server-based folder 2 levels below the inbox. Folder BS also has 2 levels of sub-folders within it for annual and monthly filing. </p><p>Some time ago, I began to have problems with messages of many kinds (subjects/sources/etc.) going missing. Eventually, I searched and found them in Folder BS. In response, I deleted Filter BS, looked for but didn't find other filters responsible for these unexpected results, and managed incoming BS-related messages manually. But despite Filter BS having been deleted, non-BS-related messages still get ""lost,"" meaning incorrectly filed in Folder BS, which is acting like a rogue black hole, sucking up everything that gets too close. I have not been able to identify any criteria for what turns up in Folder BS beyond ""lots of stuff that doesn't in any way belong there."" </p><p>Speculating that something's ""off"" with the BS folder's directory in a way that would be nearly impossible to fix, I'm trying to figure out the least inconvenient, least risky way to solve the problem.  </p><p>Not knowing other ways I might compound the problem by making big moves with the MANY messages archived in the BS folder's 7 annual subfolders and their 12 each subfolders; and not knowing how to back up server-based in-box sub-folders, I'm stuck at an impasse. </p><p>How should I proceed? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any input. </p>",jfmarketinfo;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.2 Safari/605.1.15",0,0,0,,,jfmarketinfo

And it's the same with every message folder, there are only .msf files on my PC where I removed and re-added the account. On my laptop, the ""INBOX"" file still exists but does not get updated. </p><p>This thing is happening with only one of my e-mail accounts, the others get updated fine and new messages are shown.
