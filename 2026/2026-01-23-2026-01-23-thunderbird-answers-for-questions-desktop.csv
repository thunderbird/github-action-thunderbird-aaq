My problems started when Thunderbird did an unwanted update and then wanted me to create a new profile. My wife was dying and I’m almost 90 years old.. I’ve tried using the add-on app, but it won’t handle 20 GB. It appeared to import a bit of my profile and then quit. Once an old profile is put into the right place in the Thunderbird folder, how do I get to it.? I read about the profile.INI file. Do I need to modify that? I did a new install after saving the old profile hoping that might work, but it left me still confused. I had trouble getting the SMPT settings, incoming and outgoing settings. Finally have that working. I tried to use the slowest changing version of Thunderbird. I donated money to Thunderbird, but I’ll never do it again because they started changing everything. </p>",JayinOK,false,0,0

A brand-name software in the VPN world, NordVPN, which we unfortunately bought a 2 years subscription from (a big write off!), is the guilty party! Once you start that untested intrusive and resources grabbing software, even without enabling any VPN connection, Thunderbird is messed up! Thunderbird start up, properly with profile manager, takes 4-6 sec to connect w/o NordVPN running Thunderbird takes 5-7 min, and profile manager will not be started, once NordVPN was started and you logged in (but w/o VPN enabled. A half hour chat with NordVPN  resulted in zero resolution. but the request to run dozens of test for them.
