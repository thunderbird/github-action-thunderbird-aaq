My problems started when Thunderbird did an unwanted update and then wanted me to create a new profile. My wife was dying and I’m almost 90 years old.. I’ve tried using the add-on app, but it won’t handle 20 GB. It appeared to import a bit of my profile and then quit. Once an old profile is put into the right place in the Thunderbird folder, how do I get to it.? I read about the profile.INI file. Do I need to modify that? I did a new install after saving the old profile hoping that might work, but it left me still confused. I had trouble getting the SMPT settings, incoming and outgoing settings. Finally have that working. I tried to use the slowest changing version of Thunderbird. I donated money to Thunderbird, but I’ll never do it again because they started changing everything. </p>",JayinOK,false,0,0

How does browsing to the unzipped profile folder there help? Isn't it better to keep all the profiles in the profiles folder? How should Jay import a profile? Does he have to import at all?

I'm still not seeing the connection between creating a new profile and using the old profile, so I'm guessing that Jay may not see it either. And I'd like to know exactly how to guide him.

If there are no compatitbility issues, why did Thunderbird create a new profile? Or are you talking about the old profile after some kind of process to import it into the newly created profile? </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
