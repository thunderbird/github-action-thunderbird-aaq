It's unlikely that developers would respond to such a request. There is another place to suggest features, but there's no need to have a Thunderbird function for importing a large profile. You can just move files through the file system. </p><p>Before proceeding, would you please say more about your current set-up and what you want to accomplish? </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
