Approximately every 10-14 days the <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> account encounters an error with the message ""Command Error 12.""  When this happens, Thunderbird immediately drops all the local email folders for the <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a> account, and attempts to redownload all email and folders associated with the account.
