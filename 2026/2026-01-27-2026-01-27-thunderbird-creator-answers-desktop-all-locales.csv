Da 2 giorni però non mi fa più scaricare le mail&nbsp;!  So che ce ne sono sul server  (ho controllato!) ma, dopo un tentativo di scaricamento (nel quale mi fa vedere per una frazione di secondo che ci sono mail da scaricare),  l'azione abortisce subito, senza scaricare. Il messaggio di errore che viene subito visualizzato è: ""connessione al server reimpostata""  (ma in realtà non funziona...)                Allego gli screenshots dei messaggi di errore che vedo. Preciso anche che invece, usando altri programmi di posta, questi riescono regolarmente a scaricare le mie mail! Dunque, il problema dovrebbe eseere in Thunderbird... Qualcuno ha qualche idea di cosa potrebbe stare succedendo, e soprattutto di come risolvere il mio inconveniente?
