I have a whole bunch of separate ICS files to import due to a workflow issue, and importing them is like playing whack-a-mole. It'd be a huge improvement if the ""Next"" button could stay in a consistent place so that even if defaults can't be set up, you can just click-click-click in one place without having to dance around with the mouse&nbsp;:) </p>",denyerec;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/142.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",1,0,0,,,

My emails download, I can sometimes open and delete some, but after a short time, it gets stuck on one email and won't open any more at all.

It's really hard to troubleshoot and try to fix, as I can't get to any of the menus most of the time. This happens in safe mode as well. This is getting really irritating as I've been using Thunderbird for many years, and I'd like to fix it rather than find a new email program. </p>",brinkley_mike;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:Windows 11",0,0,0,,,
