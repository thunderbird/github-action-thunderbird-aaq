One has to add the new account, transfer messages from the old account either to local folders or the new account, and then disable or delete the old account. </p><p>The new account seems to be an IMAP account. Is it? IMAP synchronizes folders with the server. When you had your inbox and other folders access the new account, those folders were synchronized with the new account. </p><p>But I do not understand why you can find messages from the old account by searching for them or why the names of all the folders are preserved in the folderTree.json file. So my diagnosis could be wrong. </p><p>I believe that you have two options: </p> <ol><li> Re-connect to the old account if you still can, and start this process over. </li><li> Restore from a back-up. </li></ol> <p>Maybe a third option: if your old account was a POP account, I understand that those messages are still on your local drive. Was it a POP account? </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0
