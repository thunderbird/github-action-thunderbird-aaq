When I type in his name, the system defaults to the now outdated original address. If I recognize this error at the time of the creation of the new email, I can correct the automatically posted but erroneous email address to the current one. But this is awkward and apt to be missed. Many thanks for help. John Clarke </p>",jmcla,false,0,0

That happened to me recently.  SO, if that is the case, this works somewhat: </p> <ol><li> create an export of the addressbook in vcard format (export  menu is at the three dots to the right of addressbook name) </li><li> open the exported file in Notepad and locate the full info on the bad address - delete all of that, but JUST that. be careful. </li><li> create a new addressbook in thunderbird </li><li> use the tools&gt;import&gt;import from a file menu to import the vcard export </li><li> verify that it's good and then DELETE the original addressbook   </li></ol> <p>There may be better solutions, but this worked for me. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
