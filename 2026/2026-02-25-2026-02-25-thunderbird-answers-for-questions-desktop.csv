All I can state is that using a backup tool other than from Thunderbird has no guarantees, and persons on the support forum will not be able to assist. From my experience, the only  backup that works every time is one done using the OS's file management software. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I backed up my account then, but never had any reason to use it, and now that I have a new computer, it does not seem to work anymore, so I am glad I asked about it and will use the recommended OS.s file management software mentioned.
