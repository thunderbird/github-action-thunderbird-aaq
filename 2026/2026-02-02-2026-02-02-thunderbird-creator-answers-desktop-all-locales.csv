Sometimes I will finish the note and send it only to find it failed to save in my Sent folder, too. Google pointed me to someone asking this very question in 2017, but the recommended solution doesn't work and the thread was archived. </p><p>I thought perhaps the problem was with AOL. I've noticed that while my Gmail mail updates very quickly, it takes AOL a lot longer on all my devices (iPad &amp; iPhone using Apple Mail) and on my MacBook Pro with macOS Tahoe using Tbird. I'm guessing this is just an AOL issue. </p><p>So I composed notes using both AOL and Gmail as my SMTP address and waited. Eventually, BOTH popped up telling me of failure to save in Draft.
