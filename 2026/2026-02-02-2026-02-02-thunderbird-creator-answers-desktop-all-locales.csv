Sometimes I will finish the note and send it only to find it failed to save in my Sent folder, too. Google pointed me to someone asking this very question in 2017, but the recommended solution doesn't work and the thread was archived. </p><p>I thought perhaps the problem was with AOL. I've noticed that while my Gmail mail updates very quickly, it takes AOL a lot longer on all my devices (iPad &amp; iPhone using Apple Mail) and on my MacBook Pro with macOS Tahoe using Tbird. I'm guessing this is just an AOL issue. </p><p>So I composed notes using both AOL and Gmail as my SMTP address and waited. Eventually, BOTH popped up telling me of failure to save in Draft. Clicking Retry fails for a very long time (until you feel a little foolish doing it&nbsp;;) ) </p><p>I've been experiencing this problem for the past few months. I wish I could recall the specific change I made that preceded it. Sorry! </p><p>I'm not sure I can blame this one on AOL.
