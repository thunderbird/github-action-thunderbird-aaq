David et grand merci pour votre soutien.  Je suis désolé de vous solliciter autant&nbsp;! Pardonnez-moi mais je commence à être vieux (83 ans et demi …). Je commence mieux à comprendre votre proposition pour la commande « insérer » (on verra l’autre problème plus tard). J’ai cliqué sur la commande « nouveau message » en même temps que sur la commande « MAJ » (je pense que c’est celle qui permet de saisir une majuscule) mais cela ne m’a rien donné. En revanche, j’ai cliqué sur « paramètres des comptes » et j’ai cliqué sur « HTML » (voir image ci-jointe appelée « HTML »), mais cela ne change rien car je ne vois toujours pas comment ajouter la commande « insérer » dans la barre d’outils. D’ailleurs je n’ai pas vu la mention « composition et adressage ». Par contre j’ai essayé d’ajouter d’autres commandes dans la barre d’outils en cliquant sur « affichage » « barre d’outils » « personnaliser », mais je n’ai pas vu la commande « insérer » (voir image ci-jointe « barre outils »). Si vous avez le temps de continuer à m’aider, je vous en remercie bien sincèrement. </p><p>Hello Mr. David and many thanks for your support. I'm sorry to ask you so much! Forgive me but I'm starting to get old (83 and a half years old...). I'm starting to better understand your proposal for the ""insert"" command (we'll see the other problem later). I clicked on the “new message” command at the same time as the “SHIFT” command (I think it’s the one that allows you to enter a capital letter) but that didn’t give me anything. However, I clicked on “account settings” and I clicked on “HTML” (see attached image called “HTML”), but that doesn’t change anything because I still don’t see how to add the “insert” command to the toolbar. Besides, I didn’t see the mention “composition and addressing”. On the other hand, I tried to add other commands to the toolbar by clicking on “display” “toolbar” “customize”, but I did not see the “insert” command (see attached image “toolbar”). If you have the time to continue to help me, I sincerely thank you. </p>",guyrobinggl;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/144.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 OpenWave/98.4.4043.44;os:WINDOWS 11",0,0,0,,,
