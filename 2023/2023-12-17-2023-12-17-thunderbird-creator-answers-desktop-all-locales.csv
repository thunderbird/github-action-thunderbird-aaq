I click on an e-mail to highlight it.  I right click and a menu shows up, as usual.  There is an entry on that menu ""convert to"", as usual.  I choose ""event"" and nothing happens.  I used to get a box that let me choose a reminder date and when to be reminded.  Now nothing comes up.  Is there a Lightning update that is now missing? </p><p>Thank you, Ken </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",nuffsaid1

When several new emails appear in my inbox I see several emails that I do not want to open. I right click on one I do not want and select 'Delete message' the message goes to Trash and the next email opens automatically. I want to open only emails I pick out not unwanted ones. Before the latest Thunderbird update I was to delete any email without any other email opening automatically. Can you help me?

1434163,2023-12-16 17:31:06 -0800,2023-12-16 17:31:06 -0800,The Tabs in Thunderbird 115 extend across the screen and into nowhere.  They appear to be metres long,"<p>The T'bird 115 with tabs has caused my problem.  With 115.5.2 every email in my inbox and deleted box have been tabbed and extend for a huge number across the screen to the righthand side.  Many have multiple copies of each email. Using web advice to turn off tabs which suggests use TOOLS / Options /Tabs to turn off tabs.  There is no Options in my TOOLS drop down. Another solution is to right click in a space in the Tab bar then click Customise then look for the Tabs option.  The Customise tool only gives option to add more buttons to the menu bar.  I have avoided going back to an earlier version as I am worried I might lose information in the folders  that I have created for important emails (ie insurance, warranties etc). I thought the Tabs was a good idea but it is not working for me. I would appreciate any suggestions. </p><p>Peter </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pfandmc

Now I get the ""Login to server failed notice. I believe I have tried everything. I read all the help topics on the Thunderbird site, scoured google and youtube, and tried everything short of just moving to Outlook or something else. I even tried to revert back to an earlier version v102 but got the same failed notice.  My Thunderbird program is stored on my Windows PC. I don't use an email client like gmail or outlook.  Any help would be much appreciated. I'm running 3 email accounts and if I can't get this to work I'll probably have to switch all the email accounts. Thanks very much for your help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mattfiero
