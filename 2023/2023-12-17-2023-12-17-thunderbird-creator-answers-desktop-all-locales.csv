I click on an e-mail to highlight it.  I right click and a menu shows up, as usual.  There is an entry on that menu ""convert to"", as usual.  I choose ""event"" and nothing happens.  I used to get a box that let me choose a reminder date and when to be reminded.  Now nothing comes up.  Is there a Lightning update that is now missing? </p><p>Thank you, Ken </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",nuffsaid1

I right click on one I do not want and select 'Delete message' the message goes to Trash and the next email opens automatically. I want to open only emails I pick out not unwanted ones. Before the latest Thunderbird update I was to delete any email without any other email opening automatically. Can you help me?

They appear to be metres long,"<p>The T'bird 115 with tabs has caused my problem.  With 115.5.2 every email in my inbox and deleted box have been tabbed and extend for a huge number across the screen to the righthand side.  Many have multiple copies of each email. Using web advice to turn off tabs which suggests use TOOLS / Options /Tabs to turn off tabs.  There is no Options in my TOOLS drop down. Another solution is to right click in a space in the Tab bar then click Customise then look for the Tabs option.  The Customise tool only gives option to add more buttons to the menu bar.  I have avoided going back to an earlier version as I am worried I might lose information in the folders  that I have created for important emails (ie insurance, warranties etc). I thought the Tabs was a good idea but it is not working for me. I would appreciate any suggestions. </p><p>Peter </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1624756;,pfandmc

Now I get the ""Login to server failed notice. I believe I have tried everything. I read all the help topics on the Thunderbird site, scoured google and youtube, and tried everything short of just moving to Outlook or something else. I even tried to revert back to an earlier version v102 but got the same failed notice.  My Thunderbird program is stored on my Windows PC. I don't use an email client like gmail or outlook.  Any help would be much appreciated. I'm running 3 email accounts and if I can't get this to work I'll probably have to switch all the email accounts. Thanks very much for your help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1624775;,mattfiero

My company decided, right before Christmas, to force-migrate all e-mail addresses from the functioning old servers to  ""Exchange Online"", which not only made the web-browser based access more complicated, but also required changes in Thunderbird. While they provided instructions, which I slavishly followed (despite being usually rather hand around the computer), I still cannot send e-mails with my work address - they get timed out.  My company IT are notoriously unwilling to help with issues on the private computer and have recommended even beforehand to from now on only use the web-based access to avoid trouble - which is laughable, for me, as I need my e-mails offline as well. So before harassing them more loudly, I wanted to make sure it's a fault on their end not on mine. </p><p>Some details: New server is <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>, SMTP port 587. Security level is STARTTLS, authentification OAuth2. These are the changed options requested by the company IT.  The window popping up when trying to send a message asks me to chose a certificate for athentification and suggests ""Adobe Conetent Certificate 10-7"". Neither installing this manually, accepting, or changing something under ""further options"" changes the outcome that the message will be timed out.  As my private e-mail also uses port 587, and it still works perfectly normal, this port is not generally blocked by the windows defender or antivirus (I use Kaspersky). </p><p>Maybe someone has an idea what it happening here? Or knows if to slve it by installing a particular different certificate? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",thomas350
