I have removed Thunderbird, wiped out all traces and profiles for Thunderbird, reinstalled Thunderbird and this particular account keeps coming back. I bought a new computer, installed Thunderbird on that, and this particular email account suddenly appears on the new installation on a new computer. I can't get rid of it. I brought both computers to a technician and they scanned for viruses, trojans, etc., etc., etc., and there is nothing there, but this email address account keeps coming back on any computer I have installed Thunderbird, including new computers that are new out of the box. The email account I want to remove is clogged with spam and tying up my internet connection and the ISP (Charter Communications) will not help me by eliminating this particular email account. I have followed multiple instructions I have found on this forum about how to remove an unwanted email account from Thunderbird and not a single one works because the selection to do this does not exist in Thunderbird. All I get is asked for a password for the email address that the ISP says doesn't exist, but it is being flooded with hundreds of thousands of emails that get sent to this email address in my Thunderbird program. Every time I run Thunderbird, it locks into this particular account and downloads emails until my hard drive is full and crashes. Is there a way to get rid of this email account on Thunderbird or do I just remove the whole program from my computer and use something else? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615456;,FedUpWithMozilla
