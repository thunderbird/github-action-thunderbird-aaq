Zobrazujeme si zprávy seřazené podle data a podle příznaku přečtenosti SHORA DOLŮ, správný stav viz přiložený obrázek. Po nastartování Thunderbirdu nebo přechodu do jiné složky zpráv (levý sloupec) vždy chceme, aby Thunderbird zobrazil aktuální nepřečtené zprávy v dolní části seznamu a starší a přečtené zprávy byly zobrazené nahoře nad nimi. Aktuální verze Thunderbirdu sice zprávy správně seřadí, ale posuvnou lištu vpravo neumístí na spodní, ale na horní okraj a nebo někam doprostřed a my na obrazovce nevidíme aktuální nepřečtené zprávy, ale staré a přečtené a musíme pak vždy myší chytit posuvník vpravo a posunout ho do dolní pozice. Vzhledem k intenzivní práci s emaily musíme tuto operaci provádět každých několik minut, co je velmi otravné. </p><p>Starší verze si pamatovala toto nastavení a zobrazovala aktuální zprávy na odpovídajícím místě, tak jak je na přiloženém obrázku, i když jsme přecházeli TB vypnuli nebo přecházeli mezi složkami. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,cs,"",palca1

However, when I go to ""View-Sort by"", size is not able to be selected. I see someone asked this question or something similar recently and the solution says ""If the Size column is enabled (right-click any column button to enable columns) , the message (including attachments) size is shown as in the 1st attached picture. Sort by size by clicking the Size column button. To show only messages with attachments, click the paper clip icon on the Quick Filter Bar."""" But I have no idea what this means, how the heck do I get columns enabled, and how do I then get a size column? I would love to have columns in general. But all I see if filters at the top of my inbox and attachments is there but I am not able to rank them by size. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615349;,marygooderham
