Zobrazujeme si zprávy seřazené podle data a podle příznaku přečtenosti SHORA DOLŮ, správný stav viz přiložený obrázek. Po nastartování Thunderbirdu nebo přechodu do jiné složky zpráv (levý sloupec) vždy chceme, aby Thunderbird zobrazil aktuální nepřečtené zprávy v dolní části seznamu a starší a přečtené zprávy byly zobrazené nahoře nad nimi. Aktuální verze Thunderbirdu sice zprávy správně seřadí, ale posuvnou lištu vpravo neumístí na spodní, ale na horní okraj a nebo někam doprostřed a my na obrazovce nevidíme aktuální nepřečtené zprávy, ale staré a přečtené a musíme pak vždy myší chytit posuvník vpravo a posunout ho do dolní pozice. Vzhledem k intenzivní práci s emaily musíme tuto operaci provádět každých několik minut, co je velmi otravné. </p><p>Starší verze si pamatovala toto nastavení a zobrazovala aktuální zprávy na odpovídajícím místě, tak jak je na přiloženém obrázku, i když jsme přecházeli TB vypnuli nebo přecházeli mezi složkami. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,cs,1615368;1615385;1615388;1615482;1615500;1616975;1616979;1617059;1617200;1643536;1643541;1643959;1643971;,palca1
