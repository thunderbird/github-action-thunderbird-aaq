Then, I went on a trip Sep 28 to Oct 14 and did not use Thunderbird for about 17 days. On my return, I tried to open TB. I found that a screen opened that I hadn't seen before, and TB seemed to be loading. While loading, at the bottom of the screen it said ""Checking inbox for new messages..."". Then, after a while it crashed without ever opening. </p><p>I tried to open TB several times after that, and I've always gotten the same behavior -- ending with a crash and never being able to open TB. </p><p>During the loading once, I clicked on Help &gt;AboutThunderbird, which showed 115.3.3.(32-bit) and ""Downloading Update  2.4 of 5.4 MB."" </p><p>The last four Crash Reports, all dated 10/31/2023 are (the last one being the latest): bp-e634fd35-1b8a-488a-a9df-c23050231101 bp-73858652-569e-4362-95d6-030490231101 bp-992529bf-d1af-41d9-a438-43c370231101 bp-c39563fd-bca7-406f-8abf-85bde0231101 </p><p>I thank you very much for your assistance.

I have to keep scrolling back to where I was before. The other night I had to delete a lot of email and this became really hard to do with all the auto scrolling. This wasn't happening before the last update. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",kanjigirl

Also, my colleague's computer cannot save attachments after installing the new version. - I tried the bottom right ""Save"" button - I tried right clicking on the attachment ""Save As"" Neither option will offer a dialog to save the attachment.
