(115.3.2 64bit)","<p>I used to be able to sort messages by ""Order Received"" WITHOUT displaying it as a COLUMN in the display. NOW - if I don't have ""Order Received"" displaying as a column, the ""Order Received"" sort option is ""greyed-out""! For me, at least, the information showing in the ""Order Received"" column is useless and unwanted, and I hate to waste COLUMN SPACE to display information that I don't need. Please allow users to sort our messages by ""Order Received"" WITHOUT having to display it in a column. Thanks!&nbsp;:-) </p><p>Since I initially wrote the above text, someone made the following suggestion which helped a lot, but didn't SOLVE the problem: As with your problem the sort option for ""Order Received"" is greyed out. I have managed to fudge it by displaying the ""Order Received"" column, enabling the sort by ""Order Received"" then ""undisplaying"" the ""Order Received"" column. The sort order is retained. </p><p>I'm requesting that Thunderbird Supernova programmers please FIX the program so it can sort by any possible category REGARDLESS of whether a column is/was displayed for it.  Thanks very much! &nbsp;:-) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",LREmery
