However, since the SuperNova upgrade my client is downloading ALL emails all the time.  I just got 300 emails from one of her accounts.  I have turned off everything in the Server Settings: do not check for messages at startup, do not check for messages every X minutes,  do not automatically download new messages but they still download.  Short of deleting her accounts from my configuration I am not sure how to turn this off.

We will continue using this earlier version as long as we can and have no intention of upgrading again to your new monstrosity. The familiarity of a layout is a vital part of using any software and we have not found the new layout, FORCED upon us, at all helpful or in any way ""better"" than before. Your failure to provide any flexibility in adjusting the new layout to become more familiar to us is dismal - have you not heard the expression ""If it 'aint broke, don't fix it""? Not all of us want the latest gismos and features and are quite content to continue with what we have. You could at least have still allowed that possibility in the options provided rather than denying us it by FIAT. If it proves impossible to continue with the earlier version at some time in the future we will find another email client to use instead.

When I add folders to my IMAP connected accounts or if I move folders or change the name of the folder, I've found that even when I have all the ""parent"" folders selected to synch, they end up getting unchecked in certain situations. </p><p>I also prefer to keep everything synched on my end.  Specifically I do this for SSD backups. </p><p>So I've become accustomed to going to File &gt; Offline &gt; Download/Synch Now &gt; Mail Messages &gt; Select and then doing a quick scroll through the list to see if anything is not checked, check it, and do a synch. </p><p>With 115, the ""items for offline use"" window mow pops up with only one line showing (window is ""squatty"") and all folders are collapsed.  In order to view every folder, I have to click the arrow on every single folder in the tree, and I am an email hoarder and I keep very organized so I have some folder trees 5-6 deep or more.  Hundreds of folders. </p><p>Additionally there is no ""expand all"" button so now it takes 5 minutes or more to do what I used to be in 5 seconds, and I do this regularly.  This is a major change.  Note that there wasn't an ""expand all"" button before, so this was never a thing I needed to request - the folder tree in this window was fully expanded by default. </p><p>Also, one thing that really bugs me is that if I check a ""parent"" folder, my expectation is that all sub-folders would also be checked.  If they are not all checked, I would expect a difference in the icon (like a greyed-out check) to give me a visual indication that a sub-folder remains unchecked.  I don't believe this is really necessary, and hasn't been done that way in the past either, but only because one could previously do a quick scan and see what folders were not checked because the tree was fully expanded by default. </p><p>Hoping there is just a setting for this or something because this change is really ticking me off. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",budcarlson1

I changed my Thunderbird account info accordingly and all was working fine until a computer crash which ultimately resulted in that account reverting back to GoDaddy settings. As a result my latest downloaded email showing for this account is from July (of 2023). I've changed the settings again in Thunderbird, but the account is hardwired to POP3 (GoDaddy) instead of IMAP (Strikingly) and won't link to the server. I assume I will need to do a manual account configuration to change this. Before jumping in I just need to warm up my cold feet and make SURE that when I do this I won't be losing all of the folder organization for years and years of business emails which only exists in Thunderbird.

The sort order is retained. </p><p>I'm requesting that Thunderbird Supernova programmers please FIX the program so it can sort by any possible category REGARDLESS of whether a column is/was displayed for it.
