There are not thousands of emails to download,"<p>I was hoping to get to the actual customer support as I've exhausted the forum I think.   </p><p>Thunderbird keeps telling me it is downloading &lt;number&gt; of 26,800+  or sometimes it is of 36,000+ emails.  I've deleted the the pop file (even though its IMAP) I deleted the mail file.   I re-download and reinstalled.   And still when I launch it starts downloading this huge chunk of emails.  </p><p>At the server, there are less than 500 emails on the server.  No idea where it is finding tens of thousands of emails from.  </p><p>As you can imagine, Thunderbird freezes up and might be responsible for my computer shutting down without warning from time to time as I imagine that take up a lot of the swap memory.  </p><p>This is a gmail account.  Its not doing this with any of the other non gmail accounts.  Is there some know bug with thunderbird and gmail maybe?  </p><p>I did not delete completely, as I have about 7 email ids in thunderbird - I just installed over the top hoping any glitch would get overwritten, but no luck.  </p><p>Image of the note included, just so you see I am not dreaming.   </p><p>Thunderbird 115.3.4 64 bit version on Win 10 </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dkgoodwin00

I used to be able to fold them under one arrow until needed, and only see MY inbox folders that I had created to filter my mail. But with the new update I can't do that anymore. How can I fix that?  I have three accounts I like to see at a glance if I have emails to deal with. Now they don't all fit on the screen at once unless I close the Inbox arrow and hide my own folders. How can I hide the folders listed above? It's not like I use them often. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",shanacats6

(115.3.2 64bit)","<p>I used to be able to sort messages by ""Order Received"" WITHOUT displaying it as a COLUMN in the display. NOW - if I don't have ""Order Received"" displaying as a column, the ""Order Received"" sort option is ""greyed-out""! For me, at least, the information showing in the ""Order Received"" column is useless and unwanted, and I hate to waste COLUMN SPACE to display information that I don't need. Please allow users to sort our messages by ""Order Received"" WITHOUT having to display it in a column. Thanks!&nbsp;:-) </p><p>Since I initially wrote the above text, someone made the following suggestion which helped a lot, but didn't SOLVE the problem: As with your problem the sort option for ""Order Received"" is greyed out. I have managed to fudge it by displaying the ""Order Received"" column, enabling the sort by ""Order Received"" then ""undisplaying"" the ""Order Received"" column. The sort order is retained. </p><p>I'm requesting that Thunderbird Supernova programmers please FIX the program so it can sort by any possible category REGARDLESS of whether a column is/was displayed for it.  Thanks very much! &nbsp;:-) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",LREmery
