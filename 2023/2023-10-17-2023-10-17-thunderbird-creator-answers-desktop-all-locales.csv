I changed my Thunderbird account info accordingly and all was working fine until a computer crash which ultimately resulted in that account reverting back to GoDaddy settings. As a result my latest downloaded email showing for this account is from July (of 2023). I've changed the settings again in Thunderbird, but the account is hardwired to POP3 (GoDaddy) instead of IMAP (Strikingly) and won't link to the server. I assume I will need to do a manual account configuration to change this. Before jumping in I just need to warm up my cold feet and make SURE that when I do this I won't be losing all of the folder organization for years and years of business emails which only exists in Thunderbird.
