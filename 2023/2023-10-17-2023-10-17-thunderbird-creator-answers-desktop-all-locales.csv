I don't know how old this profile is but 5+years isn't unreasonable and possibly closer to 10. I have the old Profiles directory backed up. Backed up as a copy (not as an export or zip). I've not been able to get Thunderbird to load the messages however. </p><p>I've tried the various instructions for creating new profiles, pointing to the directory, editing the profiles.ini (both relatively=1 and explictly=0) and I don't see the messages showing up. The existing documentation doesn't seem to cover whatever problem I'm running into. </p><p>I'm not seeing error messages show up either so I'm not sure what to do at this point. Any recommendations on what I can do to try to recover these old emails? I see the headers are there but the body is&nbsp;?compressed?. It's not std ascii. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1611744;,eastc

I changed my Thunderbird account info accordingly and all was working fine until a computer crash which ultimately resulted in that account reverting back to GoDaddy settings. As a result my latest downloaded email showing for this account is from July (of 2023). I've changed the settings again in Thunderbird, but the account is hardwired to POP3 (GoDaddy) instead of IMAP (Strikingly) and won't link to the server. I assume I will need to do a manual account configuration to change this. Before jumping in I just need to warm up my cold feet and make SURE that when I do this I won't be losing all of the folder organization for years and years of business emails which only exists in Thunderbird. Please, please reassure me! Thank you so much, M. Britz </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",guemeskid

NOW - if I don't have ""Order Received"" displaying as a column, the ""Order Received"" sort option is ""greyed-out""! For me, at least, the information showing in the ""Order Received"" column is useless and unwanted, and I hate to waste COLUMN SPACE to display information that I don't need. Please allow users to sort our messages by ""Order Received"" WITHOUT having to display it in a column. Thanks!&nbsp;:-) </p><p>Since I initially wrote the above text, someone made the following suggestion which helped a lot, but didn't SOLVE the problem: As with your problem the sort option for ""Order Received"" is greyed out. I have managed to fudge it by displaying the ""Order Received"" column, enabling the sort by ""Order Received"" then ""undisplaying"" the ""Order Received"" column. The sort order is retained. </p><p>I'm requesting that Thunderbird Supernova programmers please FIX the program so it can sort by any possible category REGARDLESS of whether a column is/was displayed for it.
