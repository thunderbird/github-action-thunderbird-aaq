If I compact, it just lessens the number of deleted or moved messages that reappear on its initial read of the inbox from the server.  The messages that show up are marked as read and if I got to another account and then back, they disappear.  If I stay within the same account, they stay regardless of the folder I go to, until I go to another account and back. </p><p>Compacting just minimizes what it sees, it does NOT cure the problem. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;,thunderbird,emails-thunderbird,en-US,"",gwestlun

I also enjoy the emptying the thing manually before I close the program at the end of the day, as it gives me the satisfaction of doing some cleaning without actually having to scrub a floor. </p><p>Unfortunately, the folder sometimes (not always) empties itself if we have a power failure, and it empties if I accidentally close the program, which is easier now with the new design, which I find a little hard to read. </p><p>I'd like to be able to set the Trash folder to keep its contents until I deliberately, with malice aforethought, set out to cause it to become empty through a decisive action on my part. </p><p>I have searched Thunderbird support, but I've not found a relevant article.

1434008,2023-12-15 01:23:23 -0800,2023-12-15 02:12:42 -0800,Errore invio email,"<p>Buongiorno, sono a richiedere se possibile, un Vs. supporto per il seguente problema: sono alcuni giorni, che non riesco ad inviare email con Thunderbird (vers. 115.5.2 64 bit). Come server posta in uscita ho sempre usato Aruba. L'errore che viene ritornato è ""non è stato possibile inviare il messaggio perchè la connessione col server <a href=""http://smtps.aruba.it"" rel=""nofollow"">smtps.aruba.it</a> è scaduta"", a volte invece oltre al questo messaggio indica anche che la connessione potrebbe essere stata rifiutata. Random, con estrema lentezza qualche email viene inviata. Ho provato a impostare come server posta uscita gmail, ma anche con questo ho lo stesso risultato. Ho provato a cancellare l'account e ricrearlo, ma senza esito. In ultimo ho scaricato e reinstallato thunderbird ma senza esito. Tramite webmail aruba le email vengono inviate. Stessa configurazione su PC dei colleghi, funziona tutto. Non so cosa controllare per risolvere il problema. Ringrazio per l'aiuto. Cordiali saluti </p><p>Daniele Griotti </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1624337;1624339;,danielegriotti
