L'errore che viene ritornato è ""non è stato possibile inviare il messaggio perchè la connessione col server <a href=""http://smtps.aruba.it"" rel=""nofollow"">smtps.aruba.it</a> è scaduta"", a volte invece oltre al questo messaggio indica anche che la connessione potrebbe essere stata rifiutata. Random, con estrema lentezza qualche email viene inviata. Ho provato a impostare come server posta uscita gmail, ma anche con questo ho lo stesso risultato. Ho provato a cancellare l'account e ricrearlo, ma senza esito. In ultimo ho scaricato e reinstallato thunderbird ma senza esito. Tramite webmail aruba le email vengono inviate. Stessa configurazione su PC dei colleghi, funziona tutto. Non so cosa controllare per risolvere il problema. Ringrazio per l'aiuto.
