Come server posta in uscita ho sempre usato Aruba. L'errore che viene ritornato è ""non è stato possibile inviare il messaggio perchè la connessione col server <a href=""http://smtps.aruba.it"" rel=""nofollow"">smtps.aruba.it</a> è scaduta"", a volte invece oltre al questo messaggio indica anche che la connessione potrebbe essere stata rifiutata. Random, con estrema lentezza qualche email viene inviata. Ho provato a impostare come server posta uscita gmail, ma anche con questo ho lo stesso risultato. Ho provato a cancellare l'account e ricrearlo, ma senza esito. In ultimo ho scaricato e reinstallato thunderbird ma senza esito. Tramite webmail aruba le email vengono inviate. Stessa configurazione su PC dei colleghi, funziona tutto. Non so cosa controllare per risolvere il problema. Ringrazio per l'aiuto.

I am using Thunderbird for my email program I have it pinned to the taskbar at the bottom of my computer screen.  I was wondering if there is a way that when I have the mail screen open and  I open another screen like Settings, or Account Settings, if they can be shown separately on the task bar, and not combing so only the tab I have open is showing.  That way I can flip between each one a lot easier than clicking on the one showing and then having to select the next tab in the actual program itself.   Thanks Marc </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1624474;,mbouman2
