It doesn't. Profile files are stored separately from the Thunderbird program files. The program files are static and do not change (except when you upgrade the Thunderbird application version). Because we store profile and program files separately, you can uninstall Thunderbird without losing your messages and settings, and if something goes wrong with a Thunderbird update your information will still be available.

It seems that when it's set for export.imap... TB gets caught in an endless loop of always downloading messages.  For example, if it's downloading 287 of 12,000 messages...once it get's all 12k messages it stops. However, the next time I open TB, it starts downloading all over again.

A lengthy delay may mean that somehow the file has been allocated a huge amount of space and is taking an aeon to load.  Check the file in the windows file explorer for size.

Basically, it means it's not so simple to go back to an earlier version, so advised you have a backup of profile before upgrading just in case you want to downgrade. There is a method of starting Thunderbird using the Run command eg: thunderbird -P --allow-downgrade  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation</a> </p><p>Please note there have been several major changes in phases regarding the Address Book and Lightning is no longer an addon. Trying to use an older version after the address book has been altered can be a pain to fix. So do create separate exports of your address books just in case you need them. eg: Version 78 had change from .mab to .sqlite  The .mab files were not removed but they did have the names changed eg: abook.mab.bak It would also mean the 'prefs.js' file saw a load of changes as well to point to those new files. There has also been other major changes in various files in version 102. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:I also use a custom theme. I cannot use dark mode as I'm old and visually impaired and dark themes make stuff impossible for me to read.</em> </p><p>As of version 60*, Thunderbird offers a default Light theme as well as a dark theme. The preferences/options can be set up to work with computer High Contrast themes.  All addons including themes you choose to install are the responsibility of the person who created them and not Thunderbird. So you would need to check whether the theme you currently use is compatible for the version of Thunderbird you are thinking of installing. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I have a dozen email addresses. Each email account has a number of filters which move emails to subfolders on Local Folders. Basically, nothing stays in the inbox of the account. I use pop for inbound email. </em> </p><p>If you use POP then all the downloaded emails are stored on your computer in the same way as they would be if stored in 'Local Folders'. The only difference is if they remained in the pop account then they would be spread over a dozen folders instead of just the one 'Local Folders' folder. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:v52.91. is 32bit. I've downloaded the 64 bit v60.9.1   So my question is; Can I install v60 over the top of v52......</em> </p><p>On Windows OS, Thunderbird win32 versions would get auto installed in this location: </p> <ul><li> C://Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>and win64 versions would get installed here:  </p> <ul><li> C://Program Files/Mozilla Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>When version win64 first came out there were some problems noted for those who had previously used a win32 version.  So developers forced the installation of win64 into the same old location in Program Files (x86). But recently, I've noticed the win64 getting installed in 'Program Files'. I've just fixed a problem for someone where this occured. </p><p>I would suggest exit Thunderbird if running. Access 'C://Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird' folder and delete all of it's contents, so you are left with an empty 'Mozilla Thunderbird' folder. Then clear the computer 'Recycle Bin' </p><p>When installing v60.9.1, select the 'Custom' option and choose to install into same location:  </p> <ul><li>  C://Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird folder </li></ul> <p><em>re&nbsp;:I have moved my profile folder and my mail storage off the C:\ drive </em> </p><p>If you have left the profile 'Thunderbird' folder in it's default locaton: C://Users/User name/Appdata/Roaming/'Thunderbird' folder. then it should still contain all the necessary files eg: 'profiles.ini'  which would tell thunderbird program where to find the moved profile. </p><p>However, if Thunderbird starts up and has a problem locating the profile - it will ask you to create a mal account - do not do this. Instead, Create a new profile, give it a suitable name and click on 'Choose Folder' option so you can point it to use the original profile name folder. </p><p><br> The addon 'Manually sort folders' will work with all versions including v60.9.1, but you do need to make sure you have installed the appropriate addon version. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/manually-sort-folders/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/manually-sort-folders/</a> </p><p>As of version 78*: Minimise to TRay was introduced Address books - changed from MORK .mab to SQlite format.

For example, every time I go to write an email Enigmail creates an empty folder on the root of my C:\ drive.

I think I was testing v78 when I tried that encryption - so a couple of years ago. </p><p>Hence I switched to S/Mime. No extra processes, no stray folders created, no VPN issues. It just works. With the ""security settings from Address book"" addon it's exactly what I need.  </p><p>The theme I use has a dark space-themed color. The text is Light so I can read it. The light them in the browser and Thunderbird uses white everywhere and in some places I can't read the text.  </p><p>At this point I'm only going to 60.9.1.  </p><p>Although, as you've pointed out, given the issues I have with Enigmail, that seems the only roadblock to updating to 102. It's actually not - the dark theme everywhere, the square tabs and a couple of other annoying features are putting me off. I gather the theme issues start with TB95? At the same time as FireFox?

I experimented with different setting values also. It occurred to me that maybe the program needed reboot, to save the values, but doing so did not affect anything tangible that I recognized.  </p><p>David, I suspect that you are a community member and that you are a volunteer helping-out, and that you may not have anything to do with the programming of ThunderBird or programming policy, so please don't take the following as a complaint wrt to your kind reply.  </p><p>I desire, that as I type in the WRITE editor, that the text line will break at 72 or whatever the setting value I set. Instead, text just continues to the edge of the screen, at which it LineWraps. What does the setting actually do?  It doesn't break lines in received e-mail either. So what does it do?  If I break received e-mail line length with the &lt;RETURN&gt; key, the editor inserts multiple line-feeds, depending on PARAGRAP/BODY configuration. Editor inserts either 2x LineFeeds or 4x LineFeeds.  I want to control text formatting, for my convenience, not the programmer's. </p><p>Do not think for us. Ya can please some of the folks some of the time, and the remainder of the folks the remainder of the time, but ya can't please all of the folks all of the time, so don't try to think for us. Leave the edit formatting to us.  </p><p>How about presenting a char counter in a status bar at the bottom of the window, now that would be useful. Or how about a semi-translucent configurable vertical line break point indicator in the viewport? To indcate where to break the long line. </p><p>I prefer that long lines NOT WRAP at window edge, but wrap for ALL text, outgoing and incomming,  at around 60 chars or what ever I deem convenient. </p><p>There is also another problem which is somehow related, in that, breaking the lines using the &lt;RETURN&gt; key, to manually shorten looooooong lines, such as URLs, etc.,  cause the following: </p><p>Long line text:  </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx manually broken with &lt;CR&gt; key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;CR&gt; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;CR&gt; </p><p>Reader sees xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx </p><p>And the reader can't reformat it as it is hard coded. I receive e-mail that looks that all the time. It drives me phuking crazy!! </p><p>The above should never happen. </p><p>Then if I quote the above type fong'd text, for rebuttal e-mail, it is hard coded, and not reformattable!! If I break one of the short lines, ThunderBird inserts either 2 LineFeeds or 4 LineFeeds, depending upon Paragraph/Body configuration settings. &nbsp;?? Why? I know if I want a paragraph I do not want the program thinking for me because it is a robot and it is a stupid robot.  Don't think for us. It is not convenient in the long term.   There is also a mismatch in that area as well, its as though the settings flag isn't being updated properly between window dialogs? </p><p>Sorry about the bi.tching.   </p><p>Fractal_One </p>",fractal_one,false,0,0

I think you mean when viewing HTML formatted e-mails, to be able to get it to wrap at a shorter length, rather than only wrapping when it gets to the end of the window. It is possible to get it to wrap by making the window smaller, but it is a bit of a pain to have to do that each time. Reading very long lines is just not natural (and same with writing them). I tried sending plain text messages to people but then if they were on a smart phone then it is harder to read the lines when they are a fixed length, so that person/recipient complained that it was hard to read. </p>",brian05,false,0,0

I agree to part of your complaint, but Thunderbird has its idiosyncrasies; it was designed to serve a large audience, and it has been successful in that. For persons desiring significant control of formatting, there may be other email clients more suited to that task. I also have used TheBat, and that may be more to your liking.

Or have I completely missed the point. </p><p>I think I must mention this.   </p><p>You are composing in HTML apparently,  this is by default going to wrap text to suit the space in which it is read.  Placing carriage returns where you think it is appropriate to wrap text is most likely to produce some rather odd looking email with the recipient battling your formatting choices on their choice of display size. What looks readable to you may not be to the recipient.  This is especially so if you are using a desktop and they are using a phone to read your mail. </p><p>The recipient of your mail might choose to use Plain text, which will usually wrap at 80 columns as you compose like an IBM 3270 mainframe terminal or HTML which will wrap into the available space.  This is preferred as it does not try and impose your display setting on the recipient. </p><p>The reader might use a 5 inch phone screen or a 50 inch television to read your mail. The demands that places on text hard coded to wrap at a specific point can see lines that all wrap at say 60 characters and then the paragraph ends at the 80 characters because of hard coding and a small window forced a wrap, so every second line ends in the middle of the text line.  </p><p>On the other end of that scale, I use a larger monitor and what is forwarded to me as a 10 line paragraph by the sender is at times displayed on two lines because my display space is somewhat larger than the sender envisioned.  It suits me to read the information without having to scroll down. One of my pet hates of email from this forum is it wasted more than half of each display line because it centers a skinny table in the middle of the screen. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
