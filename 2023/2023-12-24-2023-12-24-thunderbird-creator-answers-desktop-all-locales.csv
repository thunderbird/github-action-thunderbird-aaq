Recently, I stopped receiving emails December 12, 2023. I sent in a problem according to the help page that I found. I believe Mozilla is now the server for Thunderbird? I don't even know if that is accurate (part of my confusion).  I followed prompts and confirmed my email address, apparently I now have a user name.  I still can't send or receive emails.  Can you help.  I need step-by-step instructions, please. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1626268;,karen108

One account has password saved but the other doesn't so I cannot access emails on this account now as they won't download without either a saved password or (as I usually do) entering a password.  This affects my husband also so not just something on my account. This happened around the 20th December. I've searched through Thunderbird settings but I can't find any way of adding a password directly into Password Manager - only edit or delete.  So I can't fix the problem we now both have with accessing new emails. So - any suggestions please or is there a fix coming?, kind regards </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1626292;1626325;1626327;1626363;1626439;1626696;1626704;1626706;1628414;1628435;1628438;,mary.therese

Do to my computer being hacked and entire password file stolen I've decided when placing any charges to my credit card I use a generated virtual card number. The app that generates the number is an extension in my Chrome browser. I've used this app before when making purchases; The app auto generates a virtual number and can send the required information to the vendors credit card purchasing page. However, I tried this when donating to Mozilla and the popup locks me out of the virtual number app so that I can't ""send"" the information over to the Donation popup. I don't use G-PAY, PayPal or any other third party processor. Maybe Mozilla doesn't allow the use of virtual credit card numbers. Anyway, my intention was to donate. Any suggestions that will allow me to use my preferred payment method? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1626358;,bgkent
