Up until now, when I wanted to send an email from an address of a different user than myself I would go to the account settings and change. For example: user1@mydomain.com to user2@mydomain.com. I only change the part before the @ sign, everything else stays the same so authentication has no problem. But that process is cumbersome because after I send the email I have to go back to account settings and change it back. I was hoping that this function ""Customize From Address..."" would save me the steps and just send the email out the same way. But, upon checking what the receivers get they appear to get the email coming from my original address, user1@mydomain.com instead of user2@mydomain.com which I used as the temporary From address. </p>",apeleg,false,0,0

I have my paid Google account (I have my own domain hosted on Google) setup with a catch all email address. When I communicate with companies I don't trust to not send me spam I use a customized address for them like ""macys@mydomain.com"" and regardless what I use before @mydomain.com it arrives at my regular email address. Sometimes I'd like to reply to those incoming email from the customized address I have for them but if I have to first go to Gmail to authenticate it it is even more cumbersome than changing the address in the Thunderbird settings.

I have two POP3 servers - one is a Rogers server and one is a Yahoo server.

A mail is a single object. The fragmenting must have been done by the mail app of the sender. Can you confirm that it happens with several senders, and if you can ask one of them to send you a mail with a sizeable attachment, connect first to the web interface of your provider and check that the mail is in one part on the server&nbsp;? </p>",gp1234,false,0,0

The problem is that sometimes when it gets deleted it gets split but it does not interfere with the further operation of TB. However, if I don't delete the email TB tries to download the email over and over again with a large attachment and is unable to let any more mail through. All the mail I get comes from Outlook </p>",dejwmartinek123,false,0,0
