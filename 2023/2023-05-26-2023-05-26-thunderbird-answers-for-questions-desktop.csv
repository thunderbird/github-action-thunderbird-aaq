All of that is quick and easy, and if you close and re-open Thunderbird now, I'm hoping you'll see the difference you want to see in the ""titles."" </p><p>If you don't see what you want, come on back to this forum and tell us, and I'll show you how to set up a userChrome.css file in a special folder inside your Profile, and we can put settings into that .css file that will fix your font displays for you. </p><p>Click the tiny thumbnail below to see what mine look like. </p>",danawilson001,false,1,1

It is the only account I have in TB but I have already told you this, sadly you failed to understand it. - ""Have you checked your Hotmail account to see if it is forwarding mail to you NO its not. That is, if I were to send a message to your hotmail account, would you see a copy in your gmail account? NO, you would not. </p>",user279447857059191873685649676568128579383,false,0,0

OR you send from gmail pop account in Thunderbird to the hotmail account which you view via the Mail app. </p><p>Please be aware that it is possible to set up Thunderbird to see whatever you like within Thunderbird and when composing mail. It does not necessarilly mean you always see exactly the same as the email you sent. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;: My main Gmail account does not forward anything or ever use Cc or Bcc. It is the only account I have in TB but I have already told you this, sadly you failed to understand it.</em> </p><p>We are well aware of it as you keep repeating this fact. You have already confirmed you are not auto Cc or Bcc in the thunderbird gmail pop account. You have confirmed you are using a Pop account. </p><p>Thunderbird pop account can only download whatever is in the server Inbox, so something is sending a copy to the server Inbox and it is not the pop gmail account in Thunderbird. Basically this is not a Thunderbird problem. You have confirmed this fact. </p><p>So now we are looking at other possibilities. Either you are sending an email from the Mail app hotmail account to the gmail account which includes the possibility of a Cc to the gmail address from that hotmail account in the Mail app. OR you have auto forwarding set up in the webmail hotmail account so it sends everything it receives (eg: all incoming mail where they are into the Inbox or the Sent) to the gmail server. </p><p>When we say 'check your Hotmail account for forwarding' we are talking about two things: </p><p><strong>1.</strong> you logging on to the Hotmail webmail account and checking for auto forwarding because this could be a server to server forwarding. I found this link which may help you to check. <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-rules-to-automatically-forward-messages-45aa9664-4911-4f96-9663-ece42816d746"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-rules-to-automatically-forward-messages-45aa9664-4911-4f96-9663-ece42816d746</a> </p><p><strong>2.</strong> access the  Mail app on computer and check the hotmail account for any auto Cc which may be set up in the account settings. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Click on 'More' and select 'View Source' </p><p>Either create an image of the 'View Source' and upload it to this webpage - we do not need to see the contents - just all the headers.

It doesn’t help that 1&amp;1 who hosted my domain from about 1996 turned into Ionis with only phone support which I hate. As far as I know, I only have domain hosted and no webmail. Anyway, I solved my problem by setting up a default Identity for all of my email accounts and this worked. I should have spent much more time understanding Thunderbird when I first put it on my PC as a backup to Pegasus Mail. It does have an awful lot of options! It doesn’t help having Apple Mail on my IPad and TypeApp on the Android, all with different ways of doing things! </p>",Tombarkas,false,0,0
