When Mozilla can't get along with AV programs, I don't blame the AV programs.  Thunderbird's box, claiming invalid certificate errors, clearly offers to ""permanently"" record the security exception, then fails repeatedly to do so, at a rate of over 100 times since Jan 1st over 4 or 5 e-mail accounts, about every second or third day.  I regard that as extortion meant to drive me from using certain software, clearly demonstrated by Mozilla Contributors railing and ranting against Network Solutions and AV programs.   I just fixed it by setting up my accounts in Apple Mail on another computer.  Apple Mail managed to download over 1000 emails without once denigrating their certificates and demanding that I spend time doing something about it.  At the age of 77, after having been maimed and disabled by a drinking driver in 1985, and having a benign but extremely painful tumor cut out of my spinal cord last year, I need that time to lay down now and then and wait for the pain to stop.  I'm fed up with the grinding hassle of using Thunderbird in Windows 10, don't have that time to spend on adolescent and spiteful programming gamesmanship.   Anyone who thinks that a constant barrage of unnecessary and unwanted error messages will force me to join and endorse their political software cult can go teach their grandmothers how to suck eggs.   I will keep a copy of Thunderbird to use offline, so I can read my old emails.  Otherwise, I'm voting with my feet, and advise anyone who wants to use a hassle-free email client to do the same. </p>",business11,false,0,0

Clearly the message is the name given is not the name on the certificate.  Given AVG is known for using dodgy self signed encryption certificates,  it could be for it.

Windows just lets any program insert an certificate into it's store. </p><p>It could also be because you are using SSL/TLS on a server without a correct certificate as <a href=""https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/smtp.tulsasoundguitars.com/feAYr8BM/"" rel=""nofollow"">this test shows</a>.

Instead of addressing that functional failure of Thunderbird to process the exception <strong>permanently</strong>, members of your group have ranted about how NS certificates are ""cheap"", how my AV program <strong>must</strong> be the problem, and how I have failed to provide you with enough private information about infrastructure in which I have no skill. Furthermore, after getting jacked around with error message boxes that don't function as advertised, and jeered at to boot, I have no reason to trust any of you with any of my private information.   I have switched to Apple Mail and am having no such problems with either certificates, or my AVG AV software, which I use on both Windows and MacOS machines.

I finally solved my problems (more than one). </p><p>Two issues: 1) I eventually discovered in the Gmail account settings that POP was enabled but IMAP was not. So I ticked that off. 2) I learned how Thunderbird and SeaMonkey set up accounts differently. In Thunderbird, once you enter a gmail address, it automatically sets the IMAP and SMTP settings. But in SeaMonkey the settings have to be done manually. My SeaMonkey application already had two Yahoo accounts with a <a href=""http://SMTP.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">SMTP.yahoo.com</a> server. So when I tried to set up the gmail account, it accepted mt settings for POP or IMAP (I had tried both), but did not ask for SMTP settings and automatically used the <a href=""http://SMTP.Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">SMTP.Yahoo.com</a> settings. That's why I kept getting the Yahoo pop up. My solution was first to remove the Gmail account I had set up and also the passwords that were associated with it. Then I manually set up a <a href=""http://SMTP.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">SMTP.gmail.com</a> with all the proper setting. And also set this as my default server. Finally when I created a new Gmail IMAP account in SeaMonkey, it worked! Thanks again. You can mark this problem solved! </p>",tc2002ca,false,0,0
