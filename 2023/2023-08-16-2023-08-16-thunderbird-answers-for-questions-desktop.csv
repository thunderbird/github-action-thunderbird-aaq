What happened is this: I gave my former Win 10 (64bit) PC (hereafter ""donated machine"") to my wife to replace her older Win 10 (64 bit) PC. We were BOTH running Firefox and Thunderbird. I deleted my Thunderbird account from the donated machine. I had copied the LARGE data files (as detailed in a help article for Thunderbird) from her old machine. I deleted the similarly-named files from the donated machine and then copied into the same directory the data files from her old machine. </p><p>That worked: her emails, address book, etc. came over, BUT, also on the donated machine are come local files containing old e-mails of mine and, in the local 'Trash"" file, e-mails of mine AND hers. (I had not noticed these previously.) I should add that we use Thunderbird interfaced with GMail, and in setting things up on the donated machine, I used the 'auto' setup which selected IMAP. I cannot figure out where the local POP3 files (with my old e-mails) came from (on the donated machine) except to guess that perhaps in the past, I had set up Thunderbird as a POP3? </p><p>In any case, in the several days since I gave the donated machine to my wife she has been using the e-mail a lot, and has now changed things enough so that I cannot go back and start the migration process over again without losing her new stuff. I figure the only way out of this is to continue my process of going through my old e-mails one-by-one, deleting as appropriate and forwarding the rest to my new machine via her e-mail account, and then leaving it to her to go through her old e-mails residing in the local files. </p><p>I would like to know how to delete the POP3 local file folders (that will be empty when we have finished the described process) that remain on the donated machine. </p><p>I am a fan of Mozilla. Permit me to respectfully suggest that the migration process could be made easier for us Ludites out there. </p><p>Thanks much for your patient help. </p>",kirkaby,false,0,0
