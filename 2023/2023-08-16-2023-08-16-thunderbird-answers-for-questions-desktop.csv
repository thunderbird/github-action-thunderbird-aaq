The ImportExportTools NG add-on will help.  Since most of your active accounts are IMAP on the tablet, follow the previous advice to download headers only if you wish to save space.  If the same accounts are IMAP on the desktop, mail will be synced between the tablet and desktop, although you can download full messages on the desktop if space is not a factor. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
