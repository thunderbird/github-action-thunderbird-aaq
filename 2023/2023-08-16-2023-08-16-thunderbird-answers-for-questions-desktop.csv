There's no magic here, although it may seem so.&nbsp;:)  Is her profile still working on the old PC? If so, it will be an easy fix, but if it was her account you deleted, then the issue is murky. More information, in detail, may help. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I want the desktop to have easy access to all the messages. But on the tablet, I just need today's stuff and the ability to get messages on the various servers where I have accounts. It seems to me there must be a lot of messages I don't need to have local access to that are on this tablet. How do I remove them and still have access from the desktop? Or is that not possible? </p>",petejc,false,0,0

With IMAP accounts, not keeping folders for offline access, i.e. downloading headers only, would eliminate almost all of the 5.1 GB in ImapMail.  Account Settings, Sync. &amp; Storage, Message Sync. </p><p>I think TB should run fairly smoothly with 1 GB RAM, although I haven't tried it with less than 2 GB.

Check the detail in Local Folders and in Imapmail to see which folders have a lot of space. It may be that simply compacting will help, but a detailed look is needed. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
