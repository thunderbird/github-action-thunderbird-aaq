If you experienced a loss of emails, then it's more likely the file was corrupt already. This can be caused by Anti-Virus programs trying to fix things or allowing a file to get so large full of old deleted stuff so it's impossible to tell where a deleted file starts and stops. </p><p>Imagine the mbox file as one long single text file document and each email is appended to the document in the order downloaded; one after the other. Imagine each email as a separate paragraph. When you move or delete an email, the original email is still there, but now imagine it like a large red pen has strikethough the paragraph. This is the equivalent of Thunderbird 'marking it as deleted' and hidding it. After a while, there are a lot of red strikethrough paragraphs. It's starting to look messy. It's getting large and quite alot is old deleted stuff. Maybe there is more red strikethrough parargraphs than good paragraphs. Compacting creates a new file and then looks at the original mbox file and it copies all the good paragraphs/emails to the new file. If there's a red pen strikethrough it gets ignored and it moves on to the next. So in the end, you have copied all the good emails and that file gets saved and the old one is discarded. The new file is tidy and smaller. </p><p>As compacting requires creating a copy, it means it can take up quite a bit of additional space just to perform this task; especially if it's being performed on all folders at once. Hence, advise is the do it one at a time. Inbox, Drafts and Junk will always have more deleted/moved mail, so comapct them on a more frequent basis. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

What happened is this: I gave my former Win 10 (64bit) PC (hereafter ""donated machine"") to my wife to replace her older Win 10 (64 bit) PC. We were BOTH running Firefox and Thunderbird. I deleted my Thunderbird account from the donated machine. I had copied the LARGE data files (as detailed in a help article for Thunderbird) from her old machine. I deleted the similarly-named files from the donated machine and then copied into the same directory the data files from her old machine. </p><p>That worked: her emails, address book, etc. came over, BUT, also on the donated machine are come local files containing old e-mails of mine and, in the local 'Trash"" file, e-mails of mine AND hers. (I had not noticed these previously.) I should add that we use Thunderbird interfaced with GMail, and in setting things up on the donated machine, I used the 'auto' setup which selected IMAP. I cannot figure out where the local POP3 files (with my old e-mails) came from (on the donated machine) except to guess that perhaps in the past, I had set up Thunderbird as a POP3? </p><p>In any case, in the several days since I gave the donated machine to my wife she has been using the e-mail a lot, and has now changed things enough so that I cannot go back and start the migration process over again without losing her new stuff.

Try UNticking View&gt;Folders&gt;All folders and see if that leaves all the folders she uses, as what she wants is probably all under Unified. On your question, Unified folders is a view that lets the user see multiple accounts as though they were one. If your wife has just one account, then using 'all folders' is redundant.  You should unsubscribe from Allmail and Important and Starred, as those are Gmail labels that duplicate other folders. I suggest logging on to her gmail account online, click the gear icon in upper right, then click to show all options. In tool bar, click 'labels' and all labels will be shown, with a tickbox on right on which ones to show on IMAP accounts. I suggest UNticking allmail, important and starred there. That may eliminate them from the Thunderbird subscribe menu (although I would still check the subscribe folder anyway.  </p><p>That should take care of her account.
