My suggestion:  - the contacts are in the abook.sqlite file. That can be imported with tools&gt;import&gt;import from file  - message files (if POP) would be in the Mail/accountname folders. if you set up the account (without password) first, you could copy the folders in to overlay the defaults established in setup. Omitting password ensures that new messages are not downloaded first.  - private folders I would assume would be in Mail\Local Folders folder and could be copied to the new profile in same location (with Thunderbird not running). - I would not suggest attempting to copy and run the application from old PC, as any dependency or registry settings would not be available. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

I have a new disk in my PC and I have the old disk which ""blue-screened"". I have recovered all my data from other applications off the old disc, and installed a new copy of Thunderbird. Now my problem is how to get my Local Folders and Contacts from the old Thunderbird disk onto my new computer and new Thunderbird. I have plugged the old blue-screened disk into my PC and can see most things on it but I cannot find my old Profile and it's data. The main problem appears to be how to decipher the AppData construct in a location address. I'm sure if I can find my Profile on the old disk I will be able to transfer it to my new copy of Thunderbird on my new disk. Assistance in this area will be greatly appreciated.

My ISP has POP3 servers, so your remarks about IMAP are not relevant for my situation. </p><p>I have 2 computers (a desktop and a laptop, although the types of computers is not germane). So I have to have the ""until I delete it"" setting turned on, or the emails would be deleted from the server after I downloaded them to either computer. I suppose that I could use the ""Leave messages on computer for at most xx days"" option in order to allow me to access,say the last 2 month's emails from my phone, but my ISP also has a web mail feature, so I can also access my emails from a public computer when I'm away from either of my computers.  </p><p>Other than deleting unwanted emails on either of my computers(resulting in them being deleted from the server), I will occasionally perform cleanup of the servers by signing onto the web mail feature and deleting all emails older than a certain date.  </p><p>This still leaves the cleanup of duplicate emails that accrue on Thunderbird due to things like mail downloads that get interrupted or don't complete normally due to server or internet issues. When this happens, the duplicates only exist on Thunderbird. There are no duplicates on the server. But based on the scenario that I described in my original post, if I have duplicates of emails on Thunderbird on either of my computers, when I clean up the duplicate copies on Thunderbird, it looks like the original email on the server will also be deleted. If it's older than the ""Leave messages on computer for at most xx days"" setting, that's not a problem. But if it's only a week old, then that's going to mess up my plan of keeping emails on the server newer than the number of days listed in the above option. </p><p>So do you see that Thunderbird's action of deleting the <strong>original email</strong> from the server when all I have done is delete an extra copy of an email from Thunderbird creates a problem? I don't understand your comment about the server detecting duplicates that exist only on Thunderbird and not on the server. </p>",TampaTom,false,0,0

Part of my question was that I don't understand what mail-in-a-box actually is, but I think they are probably an app that allows entities to set up their own email untraceable server, which means that scammers/ spammers can set up an email phishing system sending out thousands of untraceable emails per day.
