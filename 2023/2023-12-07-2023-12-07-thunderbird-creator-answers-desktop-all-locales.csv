However, while that worked in the past, now while it does take the incoming email and transfers it to the sub-folder, it is leaving emails in the inbox, in effect doing a copy and not a move. As no indicator or the email number appeared next to the inbox, it wasn't until I actually clicking on the inbox where I found almost 1,000 emails there that I had already managed from the sub-folders. I have double checked the message filters, and it definitely indicates to move the emails, not copy. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dave0judy

Mostly 115.*. </p><p>I can't get any extensions to install directly, or after downloading the .xpi file. Thunderbird never lets you click on the last button to get the extension to install. Thunderbird must be force closed. </p><p>So, my success has been to choose debug extensions, and install the file as temporary. THIS WORKS! The extensions load and operate perfectly. </p><p>The downer is I'm having to re-install the temporary addons every time I run Thunderbird. </p><p>I'm willing to do some extended troubleshooting, debugging, upload logs, pics, whatever you folks need to provide a solution for this.  </p><p>I'll install whatever beta/daily versions there are in order to get this resolved for everyone with a Chromebook. It seems there are lots of other folks with Chrome OS Linux that can't load extensions. </p><p>It is ""technically"" I think a Linux virtual machine or as they call it a container. </p><p>I have lots of other Linux apps running happily. Libre Office runs great, as do video editors, etc... </p><p>I'm even willing to do a screencast video reproducing the problem. I'll do that later on.  I'll post a link to the video so experts can watch exactly what happens. A 2 minute video is often better than text. </p><p>If anyone wants to do remote debugging, or connect, or have me set up adb debugging I will do that also. </p><p>Anyway, let me know exactly what additional information is needed. </p><p>I'll post a short video in a bit. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1622599;1622601;,leowankerddd+tb
