However, while that worked in the past, now while it does take the incoming email and transfers it to the sub-folder, it is leaving emails in the inbox, in effect doing a copy and not a move. As no indicator or the email number appeared next to the inbox, it wasn't until I actually clicking on the inbox where I found almost 1,000 emails there that I had already managed from the sub-folders. I have double checked the message filters, and it definitely indicates to move the emails, not copy. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dave0judy

Thunderbird must be force closed. </p><p>So, my success has been to choose debug extensions, and install the file as temporary. THIS WORKS! The extensions load and operate perfectly. </p><p>The downer is I'm having to re-install the temporary addons every time I run Thunderbird. </p><p>I'm willing to do some extended troubleshooting, debugging, upload logs, pics, whatever you folks need to provide a solution for this.  </p><p>I'll install whatever beta/daily versions there are in order to get this resolved for everyone with a Chromebook. It seems there are lots of other folks with Chrome OS Linux that can't load extensions. </p><p>It is ""technically"" I think a Linux virtual machine or as they call it a container. </p><p>I have lots of other Linux apps running happily. Libre Office runs great, as do video editors, etc... </p><p>I'm even willing to do a screencast video reproducing the problem. I'll do that later on.  I'll post a link to the video so experts can watch exactly what happens. A 2 minute video is often better than text. </p><p>If anyone wants to do remote debugging, or connect, or have me set up adb debugging I will do that also. </p><p>Anyway, let me know exactly what additional information is needed. </p><p>I'll post a short video in a bit. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1622599;1622601;1622661;1622739;1622831;,leowankerddd+tb
