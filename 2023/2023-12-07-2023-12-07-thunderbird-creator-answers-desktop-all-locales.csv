However, while that worked in the past, now while it does take the incoming email and transfers it to the sub-folder, it is leaving emails in the inbox, in effect doing a copy and not a move. As no indicator or the email number appeared next to the inbox, it wasn't until I actually clicking on the inbox where I found almost 1,000 emails there that I had already managed from the sub-folders. I have double checked the message filters, and it definitely indicates to move the emails, not copy. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",dave0judy
