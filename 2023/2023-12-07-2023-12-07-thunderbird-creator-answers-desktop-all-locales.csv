However, while that worked in the past, now while it does take the incoming email and transfers it to the sub-folder, it is leaving emails in the inbox, in effect doing a copy and not a move. As no indicator or the email number appeared next to the inbox, it wasn't until I actually clicking on the inbox where I found almost 1,000 emails there that I had already managed from the sub-folders. I have double checked the message filters, and it definitely indicates to move the emails, not copy. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dave0judy

Xfinity is requiring us to order a new router through their website and the site would not let me log in, requesting that I change the password. Neither I nor my partner could log in using our usual passwords, so I just reset it. </p><p>Now I can't access emails through Thunderbird. I can access the emails through the Xfinity website and I added the new password to my phone, so can access them there. I've tried entering the new password on Thunderbird but it will not work.
