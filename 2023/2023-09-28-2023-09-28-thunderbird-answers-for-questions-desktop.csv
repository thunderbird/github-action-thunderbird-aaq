The problem is that the User Name in the Edit SMTP menu in all 4 accounts always changes to the last setting and account used to get outgoing mail to work. Then the other 3 accounts, now with that last SMTP user name identical to that sent one, will not send mail until I change it to its own username. Then that changes the other 3 and so on.  Not fun to use now. </p>",warrenp3,false,0,0

This is not uncommon where a user has two or more email accounts with the same provider. To ensure that is not a problem, I suggest - clicking to account setting pane and selecting 'Outgoing server (SMTP' and ensure that the description field for each SMTP server is different. If any have the same name, that could be an indicator of the problem. - next, review the account page for each account, ensuring that the bottom line that identifies the SMTP server is the correct one for that account and that the email id for the server matches the email id for the account </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I re-installed Thunderbird and tried to re-establish my 3 accounts using a saved profile. The other two worked fine. Thunderbird found the setup for the Comcast account in it's database OK, but could not verify the password. Within my Comcast account, there is a setting to allow email clients (they mention Thunderbird) to access my email. As nearly as I can tell, there are no other requirements for special passwords, keys, or other settings. None were required when I was using the same setup in the previous distro. The first time I set up Thunderbird using the Comcast account several years ago, Thunderbird went through the auto setup without a hitch (same password). I'm glad to provide any other information you need. Thanks </p><p>Follow-up: The first thing I did this morning was check my email in Thunderbird and there appeared to be no change. The other two accounts had downloaded new mail. Comcast had not. So, I wrote the above. After closing, I went back to Thunderbird and found that all of the Comcast mail had been downloaded and it appears to be working as it should. It took from sometime yesterday until this morning to fix itself.  Thanks for answering, but I guess I'm OK now. </p>",bilyo41,false,0,0
