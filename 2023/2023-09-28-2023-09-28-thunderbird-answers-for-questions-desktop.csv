If any have the same name, that could be an indicator of the problem. - next, review the account page for each account, ensuring that the bottom line that identifies the SMTP server is the correct one for that account and that the email id for the server matches the email id for the account </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Have you changed or updated anything recently? If not, (or even if so!) can you check the configuration of you email downloads is still correct? If you can download emails to phone, are there any that are too big or 'not ordinary' &gt; and if you do not need them, delete them using the phone? You may need to contact the server ISP and check that the configurations are correct, unless you still have their set-up instructions. Best of luck, David </p>",d.church,false,0,0

As I have had this happen before with other accounts with possible complicating issues, I think this is a technical issue that Thunderbird maintainers should correct. Even a notification would be acceptable if there was/is a good reason for it to take a long time for the initial download. In this case, I don't see a good reason for the system to fail in verifying a legitimate functioning password. Thanks. </p>",bilyo41,false,0,0

I re-installed Thunderbird and tried to re-establish my 3 accounts using a saved profile. The other two worked fine. Thunderbird found the setup for the Comcast account in it's database OK, but could not verify the password. Within my Comcast account, there is a setting to allow email clients (they mention Thunderbird) to access my email. As nearly as I can tell, there are no other requirements for special passwords, keys, or other settings. None were required when I was using the same setup in the previous distro. The first time I set up Thunderbird using the Comcast account several years ago, Thunderbird went through the auto setup without a hitch (same password). I'm glad to provide any other information you need. Thanks </p><p>Follow-up: The first thing I did this morning was check my email in Thunderbird and there appeared to be no change. The other two accounts had downloaded new mail. Comcast had not. So, I wrote the above. After closing, I went back to Thunderbird and found that all of the Comcast mail had been downloaded and it appears to be working as it should. It took from sometime yesterday until this morning to fix itself.  Thanks for answering, but I guess I'm OK now. </p>",bilyo41,false,0,0

Several email providers now require unique passwords when their services are accessed from email clients. If yours is one of those, you may need a special password when accessing from the new PC. An example is Gmail. Tell us more about your account and someone here may have more information. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
