Have you changed or updated anything recently? If not, (or even if so!) can you check the configuration of you email downloads is still correct? If you can download emails to phone, are there any that are too big or 'not ordinary' &gt; and if you do not need them, delete them using the phone? You may need to contact the server ISP and check that the configurations are correct, unless you still have their set-up instructions. Best of luck, David </p>",d.church,false,0,0
