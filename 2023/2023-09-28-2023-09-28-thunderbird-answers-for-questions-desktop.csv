Have you changed or updated anything recently? If not, (or even if so!) can you check the configuration of you email downloads is still correct? If you can download emails to phone, are there any that are too big or 'not ordinary' &gt; and if you do not need them, delete them using the phone? You may need to contact the server ISP and check that the configurations are correct, unless you still have their set-up instructions. Best of luck, David </p>",d.church,false,0,0

I re-installed Thunderbird and tried to re-establish my 3 accounts using a saved profile. The other two worked fine. Thunderbird found the setup for the Comcast account in it's database OK, but could not verify the password. Within my Comcast account, there is a setting to allow email clients (they mention Thunderbird) to access my email. As nearly as I can tell, there are no other requirements for special passwords, keys, or other settings. None were required when I was using the same setup in the previous distro. The first time I set up Thunderbird using the Comcast account several years ago, Thunderbird went through the auto setup without a hitch (same password). I'm glad to provide any other information you need. Thanks </p>",bilyo41,false,0,0

Several email providers now require unique passwords when their services are accessed from email clients. If yours is one of those, you may need a special password when accessing from the new PC. An example is Gmail. Tell us more about your account and someone here may have more information. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
