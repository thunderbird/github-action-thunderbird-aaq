Once you have saved the messages to a folder on your computer, you can use a programm to compress the mails into a single file. Usually your operating system should be able to do this, but there are also dedicated tools out there, like 7zip. Afterwards, you can attach this compressed file (e.g. as .zip or .7zip) to an email, which you then can send to your correspondent. I suspect this file will be quite large and many email providers refuse to transfer or receive files larger than 10-20 megabytes, so you potentially might be forced to use a file host service (<a href=""https://alternativeto.net/software/filemail/?license=opensource"" rel=""nofollow"">https://alternativeto.net/software/filemail/?license=opensource</a>) or another synchronisation service like samba, syncthing, onedrive or dropbox et cetera. </p>",Thilo.Ertel,true,0,0
