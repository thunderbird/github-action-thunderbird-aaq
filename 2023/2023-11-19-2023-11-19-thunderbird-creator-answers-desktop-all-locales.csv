I used Thunderbird on the old PC and am trying to set up Thunderbird on the new PC.  My email account is with AOL.  When setting up Thunderbird on the new PC, it asks for the password.  I am trying to use the AOL password but it does not work.  The same password works on other devices.  I have no access to the data on the old hard drive.  Any suggestions greatly appreciated. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",wmattiace
