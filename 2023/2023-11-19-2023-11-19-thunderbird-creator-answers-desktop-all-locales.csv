I#m using MPD in user mode to listen radio streams. Since the last update of Thunderbird (115.4.1 64-Bit) the start of thunderbird crashes pulseaudio. Everytime Thunderbird is started there is an ugly sound from speaker and the running radio stream is interrupted. Here are the log lines from MPD player from that event: ``` Nov 19 10:22&nbsp;: output: Failed to play on ""Pulse-Audio"" (pulse): disconnected Nov 19 10:22&nbsp;: exception: Failed to open audio output ``` I've to choose my station again, then MPD will play again program.
