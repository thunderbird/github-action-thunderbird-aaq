Normally, I would expect emails to be automatically marked as ""read"" after opening them for several seconds; in other words, after actually reading them. Now, it does not appear to be the case - a large fraction of emails no longer are marked as ""read"", regardless of how long they are opened/viewed for, regardless of how many times one opens these specific emails. The only way to mark these as ""read"" seems to be to manually force the client to mark them via right click or some other menu. </p><p>TL;DR: Emails are no longer guaranteed to be marked ""read"", even after opening multiple times.

When it is active again, instead of being in my inbox with my emails all listed, the Local Folder panel shows up.

I open the email again and click the attachment again, and it doesn't allow me to open or download the attachment. Instead of going back to my inbox, I jump to drafts and that is where the Local Folder settings panel shows up. If something doesn't work, I don't want to have to go to a folder outside of Inbox, have the Local Folder settings panel appear (which I do not want) and then have to click back on Inbox.
