Normally, I would expect emails to be automatically marked as ""read"" after opening them for several seconds; in other words, after actually reading them. Now, it does not appear to be the case - a large fraction of emails no longer are marked as ""read"", regardless of how long they are opened/viewed for, regardless of how many times one opens these specific emails. The only way to mark these as ""read"" seems to be to manually force the client to mark them via right click or some other menu. </p><p>TL;DR: Emails are no longer guaranteed to be marked ""read"", even after opening multiple times. Only occurs since latest update. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1616535;,nukeman05

Until last week I had an option in Thunderbird to filter the displayed messages in a folder (Inbox or others) with self defined filters, e.g. ""all messages with subject starting with xxx"" or all messages from addresses not on address book. I am not sure whether I removed an add on or this option was removed with the latest update of Thunderbird. Anyone knows a solution? </p><p>Attention - I am not talking about the filter options which remove mails to other folders, it was just a display filter which reduced the number of displayed mails in a folder. </p><p>Regards, Reiner </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",reiner24

Changing it with View&gt;Font Size changes everything, and this uses way too much space in the Folder and Message Detail panes. If you compare the defaults prior to the latest update to what 115.4.1 has you will see what I mean. Tried to find something in ConfigEditor but didn't see anything.

1430229,2023-11-06 18:35:32 -0800,2023-11-06 18:35:32 -0800,Thuderbird bug,"<p>When I am in my inbox in Thunderbird it will freeze. When it is active again, instead of being in my inbox with my emails all listed, the Local Folder panel shows up. The only way I can get my inbox to show up again is to click on Local Folder and then back to Inbox. This also happens when a function doesn't work. For example, I click on an attachment. It's fine. I open the email again and click the attachment again, and it doesn't allow me to open or download the attachment. Instead of going back to my inbox, I jump to drafts and that is where the Local Folder settings panel shows up. If something doesn't work, I don't want to have to go to a folder outside of Inbox, have the Local Folder settings panel appear (which I do not want) and then have to click back on Inbox. Any ideas why this is happening and how to stop it? Is it a bug? Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lojgeams

But thunderbird keeps trying to Get Mail from it.  I can't seem to delete it.  I went to the Account settings like other users have noticed, and the Delete button is greyed out.  What do I do? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",wwwwoolf
