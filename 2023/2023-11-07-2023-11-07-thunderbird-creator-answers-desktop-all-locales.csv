Last time thunderbird updated, it installed a new folder called Important. Unfortunately EVERYTHING that comes in is marked important so this folder is just a third redundant  folder that I don't need and can't get rid of. Every time I try to delete it, I get an error message telling me it cannot be deleted. </p><p>I know this doesn't seem like a big deal but all these extra folders that cannot be collapsed take up a lot of space in the list and end up pushing the folders I need to get to, down off the screen. I end up with extra frustration and taking more time than necessary, having to scroll up and down to find what I need.  </p><p>Anyway, thanks for your time. I hope you can help me.
