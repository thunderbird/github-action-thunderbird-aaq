I had several email accounts in the old version and now the new version has lost these. I found them eventually buried at the bottom, but now its so difficult to go between these I don't want to use this downgraded version. Please switch us all back ASAP without loosing our email accounts etc. </p><p>As you will see from screen shot 1 every time I click on my old accounts it brings up a set up page, which the old version didn't do and I certainly don't want to set up all 6 accounts each time I use this terrible version. </p><p>As you will see from all the screen shots my right hand panel is so confusing I have no idea where anything is now, where as the old version was laid out in a much simpler and easy way, so why change it! </p><p>Its buried the emails at the bottom of the column where as before they were at the top for easy access. </p><p>I've now turned off automatic updates and wished it had never been on in the first place. Please fix this ASAP and let me know as I've had to turn off auto updates to stop this happening again. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",info9901
