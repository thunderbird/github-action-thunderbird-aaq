Not well enough to have turned automatic updates off. </p><p>It has 4 email accounts on it - 3 hotmail accounts and one standard email account from a domain I own.

I knew this was update related because Thunderbird opened a browser window announcing the update with a what's new thing. </p><p>Fine.  Things change.  But here's what happened... There was an unwanted, problematic change in my Unified Folder section where there are normally only Inboxes of the 4 accounts.  The hotmail inboxes were OK but the non-hotmail email had all of its SUBFOLDERS now under the Inbox inside the Unified Folders section.  With this change, ALL THE EMAIL (NEW AND STORED) are now part of the Unified Folder section.  These hundreds+ emails are now displayed when I choose the Inbox at the top of Unified Folders. </p><p>Did not know what to do to try to fix this.

I also turned off auto updates. </p><p>I installed only one email account - the one that was messed up and it looked ""normal"".  Fine again.  Tried to do the update to 115 and the Unified Folder section did the same thing with this account by putting all the IMAP folders under it at the top instead of having it separated lower in the main Folders list.  So I uninstalled, deleted  and reinstalled version 102, putting all 4 accounts back. </p><p>Attaching a screenshot of how I like it to look and a screenshot of what it looked like that I cannot tolerate.
