If one was 102 and the new is 115, then expect some differences, as 115 is intentionally different. Simplest approach:  - exit TB on both PCs - copy profile from old PC:  c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird - paste to same location on new PC. You will be prompted for overwrites. Allow - restart TB on new pc </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
