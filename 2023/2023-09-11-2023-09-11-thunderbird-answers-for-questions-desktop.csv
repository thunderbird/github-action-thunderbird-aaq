If you're having this problem, this might work for you as a work-around temporarily until there's an official fix (or even recognition of the problem). </p><p>I've played around with both my old and new workstations and have verified this works on both of them as they're experiencing the same problem. </p><p>I mentioned in my first post that deleting the folderCache.json, session.json, and xulstore.json was the only way I could get Thunderbird to actually show the mail folders but that's not entirely accurate.  It turns out that only the xulstore.json needs to be deleted before restarting Thunderbird. </p><p>This really sucks of course because all your toolbar button customizations and layout settings including column width settings (but not the column selections themselves it seems?) are stored in that file.  And also, deleting it will cause Thunderbird to go back to each account and download all message headers in all folders again (don't know why and this really sucks bandwidth). </p><p>So it's not much of an improvement but at least the folders themselves, their color coding and visibility information which seems to be set in other files is still intact after you restart. </p><p>So, my procedure right now is to open the Thunderbird profile folder in File Explorer (for me: C:\Users\brian\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\64ngqwlg.default) and before starting up Thunderbird, delete the xulstore.json only.  Then start Thunderbird and you should see the default layout but with your previous tabs intact.  Then click the hamburger menu (File menu) and select View --&gt; Folders --&gt; Unified Folder (or whatever you want) if your folders aren't initially displayed. </p><p>After that, you should see your mail folders and emails.
