When you set up an Outlook account, it will be available at <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> because that is the home of the account. Thunderbird is an email client that helps you manage the account more effectively. So, that means you can access your account in both places if desired. That also applies to Gmail. Thunderbird is an email client and can never be the sole owner of an email account. There must always be an email host that makes the account available, and then Thunderbird helps you manage it. Most users rely solely on Thunderbird, using the website interface with email host only when account problems surface. I hope this is helpful. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My suggestion is to copy the message folders from old profile and based into Mail\Local Folders folder. Then, copy the recent mails into that folder so they're all together. Then, exit TB, and copy the updated local folder to overwrite the message folder in the account. To be safe, do backups first. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
