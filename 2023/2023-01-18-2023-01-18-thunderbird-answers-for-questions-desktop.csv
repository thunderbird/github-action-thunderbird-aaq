Let's assume you download full copies and have selected to 'Leave message on server' and 'Until I delete them' When you use a POP account for a gmail email address you have no access to the gmail Trash. So any email you delete in the Pop account will only get the 'Inbox' label removed and the email will still be on the server in the 'All Mail' folder which is where gmail stores all your emails.  This means periodically you would be forced to logon to the gmail webmail account via a browser, access the 'All Mail' folder and manually locate and delete the emails you have already deleted within Thunderbird. </p><p><strong>IMAP is a different type of account.</strong> IMAP is designed to store all emails on the server, but offer full synchronised access to all of the server folders, so you can see an identical copy in Thunderbird imap account. In an imap account, any email you delete will get deleted off the server. This also means if you logon to your webmail account and delete emails, then when you open Thunderbird, all of those emails will be auto deleted from the imap account - why - because imap folders synchronise with server folders to display what is held on server. The benefit of this means you can access via webmail, or Thunderbird imap account or an imap account via a phone or other computer and still see all the same folders and emails. However, you should not think of the downloaded copy in Thunderbird as a separate independent copy because it can only display what is held on the server. You can download full copies or headers on a per folder basis and you can create a backup of your Thunderbird profile to another external device to ensure you have more than just the one copy on server. </p><p><br> <strong>In both POP and IMAP accounts:</strong> When you download full copy of email, it gets written to an mbox text file which has same name as folder eg: Inbox. The next downloaded emails gets appended to same file. So in the end it's like one text document where each email is like a paragraph. When you delete or move the email, a marker is set up to say 'mark as deleted and hide'. This means you do not see the deleted email unless it's moved to another folder, but the original copy is still in the original file.  This helps if you need to quickly recover the email.  However, over time you end up with a large text document containing loads of 'marked as deleted' emails which consumes space and starts to look messy. It also becomes more prone to get corrupted. You have to properly delete those emails - do some basic house cleaning called 'compacting' - this properly deletes the emails and this will also ensure they get deleted off the server. Additional Info on compacting: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders</a> </li></ul> <p>Manually compact a folder: </p> <ul><li> Right click on folder and select 'Compact' </li></ul> <p>The Inbox, Drafts and Junk folders need frequent compacting as they get the most 'moving' or deleteing of emails. </p><p>I would suggest&nbsp;: </p> <ol><li> Check your Account Settings to ensure all is set up to do as you require. </li><li> Compact folders. </li><li> Check the webmail account </li></ol> <p>If you have a Pop account and want to change to an imap account, then you cannot simply alter the server settings. In Thunderbird, you have to set up a 'New' &gt; 'Existing mail account' for that email address and set up as an imap account using imap server settings as determined by the server requirements. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
