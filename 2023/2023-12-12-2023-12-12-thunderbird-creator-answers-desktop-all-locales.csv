I currently use Optus Web Mail via Thunderbird and have a lot of important emails stored in folders in Thunderbird. Due to issues with Optus, I am looking to move to another NBN retailer and use either Gmail or Outlook for emails. However, when I do this I will loose my Optus Web Mail accounts. Will I still be able to access the Optus WebMail emails stored on my PC via Thunderbird? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ekosciuk

All other folders and their contents were missing. </p><p>What did I do wrong and what do I need to do to migrate all folders/sub folders and their data? </p><p>Thanks, Richard </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",signifer

Right-clicking it and selecting Delete or Rename does nothing. It shows up as a msf file in the Profiles folder but moving it to the trash has no effect because a new folder is created when I restart TB. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1623691;,gh108
