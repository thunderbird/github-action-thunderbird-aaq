I have been using TB program for many years and recently my system updated (exact date unknown) and installed TB version 115.5.2 (64-bit) on my Dell laptop with Windows 10 operating system.

The page loads and 2 error messages pop-up:   (1) Server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> has disconnected.  The server may have gone down or there may be a network problem.   (2) The current operation on ""inbox"" did not succeed.  The mail server for account dan@***************.com (a Go Daddy domain name address) responded: User is authenticated but not connected.   </p><p>I have 2 email addresses tied to TB; the other is a <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> address and it is coming through fine.   </p><p>I am also able to receive both of my email addresses on my iPhone and the Outlook Office program on my laptop. </p><p>I have contacted Go Daddy, and since they no longer support the service of their emails, it was handed over to Microsoft 365 Email Essentials, they could not provide any solutions regarding my situation.  I have experienced updates before with TB since the hand over took place, a few years ago, and didn’t experience this current issue. </p><p>Please shed some light on how I can continue to access my emails on my laptop with Thunderbird. They appear to be coming through in Outlook Office program, and I would rather not use Outlook since I have a lot of folders setup on Thunderbird with archived emails in them.
