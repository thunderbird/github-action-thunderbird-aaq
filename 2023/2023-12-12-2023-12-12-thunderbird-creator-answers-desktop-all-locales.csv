Now I finaly managed to find the way: open from file - message ... and one by one opening each file (email). After that I go to ""message"" - ""copy to folder"" (i created one specialy for it). Than I go into that folder and: ""move to"" - inbox. That was the only way I could import the mails. But since its manual and each email, it takes forever ... also you can't select multiple files at once. Now my question is: is there any free faster way to do it? based on what I wrote above?
