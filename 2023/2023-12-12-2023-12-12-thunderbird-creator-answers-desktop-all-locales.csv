I currently use Optus Web Mail via Thunderbird and have a lot of important emails stored in folders in Thunderbird. Due to issues with Optus, I am looking to move to another NBN retailer and use either Gmail or Outlook for emails. However, when I do this I will loose my Optus Web Mail accounts. Will I still be able to access the Optus WebMail emails stored on my PC via Thunderbird? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ekosciuk
