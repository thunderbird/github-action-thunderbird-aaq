All was well for some weeks, but then a weird problem developed. </p><p>I've always used Group By Sort, a huge help in organizing my endless flow of email. But now, when I enable Group By Sort, Thunderbird <strong>randomly mixes new and old messages</strong> - the list shows recent messages from 2023, then skips to 2022, then goes back to 2023 again. (See attached image.) I can't see any pattern to it. This problem affects all my email folders and sub-folders. </p><p>I've tried all the obvious things - changing sort direction and column, using Repair Folder from the Properties dialog, etc. My only fallback at this point is to use Unthreaded view, which seems to sort correctly. </p><p>Needless to say, this is incredibly annoying. I was hoping Supernova would improve my life, instead it seems to have broken one of my favorite features. (My last resort will be to revert to pre-Supernova Thunderbird... if that's even possible.) </p><p>I've searched up and down the Internet, can't find any discussion of this problem.
