I have ALWAYS done this.  Something has changed semi-recently though, and at first I thought I was just mis-remembering deleting it, but now I have just been suffering with the problem. </p><p>I use Thunderbird on my personal computer at home using IMAP to connect to my email provider.  I use my email providers web based email interface when I access my personal email from my work computer.  Both Thunderbird and the email providers web based email interface access the same email account. </p><p>At home, using Thunderbird, if I SHIFT+DEL messages they are removed from my Inbox (and NOT put in Trash).  Later when I go in to work and login to the web based email interface, the messages are still in my Inbox.  While at home using Thunderbird, _IF_ I remember to ""compact"" my Inbox, then later when logging into web interface of email, the messages are NOT there.  I have not changed any settings in Thunderbird.  This is just some semi-new issue.  As I said, I have always used SHIFT+DEL to get rid of messages. </p><p>My Thunderbird mail settings are set to ""When I delete a message move it to 'Trash on [my imap server]"".  And this DOES work.  If I just press the DEL key to delete a message, it gets removed from the Inbox and moved to Trash.  And then if I login to the web based mail interface, the message is no longer in my Inbox (and properly in the Trash). </p><p>So there seems to be some kind of disconnect with the ""Immediate Delete"" (SHIFT+DEL) option.  Is there some setting where I don't have to remember to ""compact"" my Inbox?  I have ""Compact all folders when it will save over 200MB in total"" enabled (I have not changed this setting).  That is about the only setting I can find about compacting, but I'm not sure it's really a ""compact"" problem. </p><p>Also of note, is that I RARELY QUIT Thunderbird or turn off my computer (I usually put it to sleep).  But again, this is nothing new.  And QUITTING Thunderbird does not help anyway.  SHIFT+DEL a message, QUIT Thunderbird and then check email via web based interface, and the message is still there.  I DO NOT (and have NEVER) had the option (under my account settings) ""Message Storage -- Clean up (""Expunge"") Inbox on Exit"" enabled. </p><p>Right now, the only ""fix"" seems to be to remember to compact the Inbox. &nbsp;:-/ </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1625595;,billy23

When I choose one to move to a separate folder to keep, the inbox contents flips to some point that I don't require, and I then have to scroll through to the point where I took the email I was storing again, often hard to determine. It is random , and if the email I want to shift is on the current day, it seems to behave, but when I choose to move one from a few days ago, it is hopeless. It is time consuming, and annoying, and I can't see the point of it. Why is this happening, and how can I fix it please? It usually flips back to a point earlier than the date I am working on. Weird, and has only done this since one of your last updates, and always stable in the past....For a new addition to the program it is so inefficient.
