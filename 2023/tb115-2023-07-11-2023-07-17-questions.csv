It told me to delete emails for it to be able to compact. It had been set to advise me every time it had more than 10Mb to compact and up till then, it had always compacted successfully. So I deleted 100Mb of emails, yet it still told me that it needed me to delete more emails. The Profile folder was located in its own 10GB partition.  So I checked the partition and found that it had less than 100MB of space left.  So I copied the Profile folder into another 30GB partition and within Thunderbird, I changed the location of the four email local directories by typing the new location address in each of the Server Settings - Message Storage - Local Directory folder.  I very soon noticed that I also had to change the address of the Profiles folder in the Profiles.ini and installs.ini folder.  So I changed that manually.  When I opened Thunderbird it appeared to open without any problems.  My emails appear to be intact.  I haven't noticed any missing or corrupted emails.  The email structure e.g. sub folders, appear to be all there and correct, but it is not asking for the emails to be compacted. Under General Settings, the original setting is still set i.e. inform when more that 10MB and ask every time before compacting.  The old Profiles address is not accessible to Thunderbird any more, although I can still access it and am keeping it as a backup.  When I choose an email folder to compact, nothing happens.  I have tried the Repair Folder dropdown for the main INBOX folder but nothing happened.  I did notice that once all the Profile addresses were changed, Thunderbird automatically started to and completed re-indexing all the folders/files.

A trial download of around 90 emails appeared to be successful and the messages were moved into a number of TB local folders.  Daily life then overtook the project. Now resuming, it's a bit of a shock to find TB almost completely empty:  no emails, no folders, and no account for the webmail, no accounts at all.  (The only thing there was a handful of collected addresses from a failed attempt some years ago to set TB up as an active client for a different webmail service.)  I thought I exited TB after the trial download before manually deleting the messages on the webmail server but maybe I didn't — if this is significant.  And I don't know what the TB settings for the webmail account were, which it set up automatically, as the account has now vanished.  I should have checked at the time, I realise. Not much to go on but can anyone surmise what happened, what I did wrong? Should I assume that the emails are lost for good?  I did not take a specific TB back up.  There is nothing in the TB profile.  File History was on an hourly schedule at the time but I am unclear what exactly it backs up, or how, and I can't see anything relevant there.  And comments in the forum suggest you can't restore successfully from there anyway. And I'd be very grateful for any advice on how to do this properly so that the emails, etc.,  do not evaporate.

Come è possibile, ora, riordinare le Colonne in Thunderbird, quelle dove vi è lo Stato, ad esempio, quindi anche il Pulsante per Scegliere quali Colonne Visualizzare. Sino alla precedente versione, ciò si poteva fare, non agevolmente, usando la Navigazione ad Oggetti di Nvda, oppure con un Addon di Nvda, che ora non funziona più, ma quest'ultimo è un problema dello Sviluppatore del Componente, di cui attenderò Feedbacks. Nel frattempo, ho urgenza di poter riordinare le Colonne, giacchè la voce ""Non letto"" mi viene letta immediatamente prima dell'oggetto, a me interessa avere invece prima l'Oggetto e poi il ""Non letto"", dunque dovrei scambiarle. Inoltre, quando un messaggio è stato letto, viene detto 2 volte dalla sintesi, siccome avevo nelle versioni precedenti, anche lo ""Stato"" attivato.

The only thing I seem to be able to open successfully is the Troubleshooting Information. I can’t access my account settings or various other parts, and I daren’t try clicking anywhere else as I suspect it’ll just hang again or even make things worse. </p><p>I don’t know if it would help, but I have a backup copy of my profile folder from just before the upgrade to Monterey, which I’ve always stored separately in my “Home” folder. Would replacing the contents of the current profile folder with those from my backup be of any use? </p><p>Thanks for any help! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,,JiggleJog
