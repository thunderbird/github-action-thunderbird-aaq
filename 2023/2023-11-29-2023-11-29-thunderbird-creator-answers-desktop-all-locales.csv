Once you help me solve it, my donations will begin. The browser link in my incoming email stopped working about 3 months ago. I have to right click on the link, start my browser manually and paste the link. I've tried it with Firefox, Edge and Chrome (preferred) and none of them work. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jimarch

It takes a few seconds for it to filter all the emails, and then the message list pane changes to show only the matching emails. If I then modify my quickfilter expression (to be more inclusive or selective, or to correct a type), as soon as I edit it, a new set of matching entries is shown </p><p>If the quickfilter does include a 'body' selection (as opposed to only Sender/Recipient and/or Subject), the message display for some time appears to show *all* messages in the inbox (while it seems to perform the body search). This can be several seconds (I had cases where it took 10 seconds!) depending on the size of the inbox (and possibly other criteria) before the correct search result is shown. </p><p>This is disconcerting, espo as one does not see any visual feedback whether the search is still ongoing, or whether all the shown message in fact did match the filter criterion. Only when several second later it does flip to the limited list can one be sure. </p><p>I think message display should </p><pre> - either stay unchanged until the filtering has completed   - or blank/grey out while it searches </pre> <p>but in all cases there should be a visual indicator in the message list pane that the search is still working </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mkoerber
