E' la prima volta che entro in contatto con voi e vi prego di scusarmi se non volendo non seguo correttamente eventuali prassi di comunicazione.

All'avvio di Thunderbird ora mi presenta una schermata iniziale dove mi invita ad attivare un account di post. In pratica non trova più nessuno dei molti account da me aggiunti al programma negli anni e di conseguenza le relative email salvate. Ora se il problema è abbastanza risolvibile per gli account registrati come IMAP, il DRAMMA vero è per quelli che erano stati attivati come POP. Tutto perso. Impossibile recuperare ultimo backup fatto. Impossibile risalire a profile vecchi. Niente non funziona nulla.

I used to access my work emails with Thunderbird via IMAP. This worked for many years, including the use of 2FA, until my employer has disabled Thunderbird access. Their reasoning for blocking Thunderbird is provided below. In short, Thunderbird does not comply with GDPR and therefore there is a risk that my work related data ends up in third-party hands. </p><p>My question: Is there indeed such a risk? Has anybody heard of similar cases? It would mean that Thunderbird can't be used in professional environments. </p><p>--- The way you log in via Thunderbird is through a so-called enterprise application at Microsoft and that is the problem. Basically, the enterprise application asks for a lot of rights - in your case, Thunderbird's need for access to read all your emails. It's not possible for us to see how an application like Thunderbird accesses and processes your data - in theory, they can just harvest all your data, and that's what we have to deal with. So there is one GDPR aspect we need to take into account: ensuring that our data does not end up with third parties unless there is a data processing agreement in place. You can read a little more about the principles of how a third party will access data via a CBS/Microsoft account here if you want to dive a little deeper: <a href=""https://www.varonis.com/blog/using-malicious-azure-apps-to-infiltrate-a-microsoft-365-tenant"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.varonis.com/blog/using-malicious-azure-apps-to-infiltrate-a-microsoft-365-tenant</a> The article is heavily biased towards decidedly malignant enterprise applications, but the approach will be the same. </p><p>The challenge is not so much with the Thunderbird application you have installed, but rather the way it logs in via the so-called enterprise application at Microsoft. Here it is not possible for us to see how the enterprise application uses the data it has access to. It's a bit like installing an app on your phone that asks for access rights to everything. It may not use the rights, but it's not something you can be sure of. </p><pre>----- </pre>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ralf.wilke

As I also have a DoD email, I can send myself test messages.  If I send an unencrypted message from my DoD email in reply to to an S/MIME signed message from TB, I get the behavior described below in the original post, where my DoD S/MIME signature is not valid.  If I reply to the same signed TB email with an encrypted message from my DoD email, TB decrypts the message but still says my signature is not valid.  However, the ""invalid"" message is slightly different with an additional clue - the message states that ""This message includes a digital signature, but the signature is invalid. The message was signed using an encryption strength that this version of your software does not support.""  See snips 4 (error)+ 5 (successful decryption) below.  Is it possible that the newer signature certificates from DoD use an encryption strength that cannot be decrypted by TB, yet the message encryption works?  Another clue is that it appears I can send encrypted emails to some DoD recipients (but not all) even if their signature is invalid.  </p><p>Original Post: I have received a signed email from a DoD sender in TB v115.5.1.  The S/MIME icon states the Digital Signature is Not Valid (png below), consequently, the cert was not imported into the  TB Certificate Manager.  I have updated the DoD Root Certificates, and ensured that the most commonly used DoD Root certs and Email certs have trust settings that identify web sites and mail users (add'l png examples).  I cannot examine the cert I received in TB, although I seem to recall I could by clicking on the icon in earlier versions of TB.   </p><p>How can I: 1) Identify the certificate authorities for the invalid cert to ensure they are trusted? 2) Examine and import the certificate from the user?  This is not unique to a single user, it happens with DoD emails whose certs were not already in my Certificate Manager, and the organization I commonly communicate with is changing everyone's email, so everyone is getting new certs.  This prevents me from sending encrypted emails to the recipients. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1631023;1632280;1632385;,jfg223
