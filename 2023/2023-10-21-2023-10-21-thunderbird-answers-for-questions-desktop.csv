If it was QuickSearch in the past and now it's Global Search  And I have not changed the fact that I use the search window in the toolbar, then it is indeed a change in Thunderbird that makes it so.  </p><p>The search I'm using is in the very top bar (with Apple's three dots) and has two icons in it that I can't even make out on my 4K display, the pixels are too small. Redesign and smaller pixel icons are also a change in Thunderbird. </p><p>Your suggestion of what to toggle id not work. But With your description of where I might find it, and the use of the word ""Quick""  I found the ""Quick Filter"" which you called Search, and I toggled that on (it was not visible by default) - possibly another change in Thunderbird.  </p><p>And there I found the ability to again hone the search by Sender Recipients, Subject and Body.  </p><p>Interesting that the button is a Quick ""Filter"" but the modification button next to it lets me ""Sort"" by: So the new version of Thunderbird is not consistent in terms. It should be ""Quick Search"" or ""Filter By"" for those two parts of the same task to be unified in name. Perhaps this happened with the change in Thunderbird to 115.  </p><p>I am thankful that I can still hit Enter to continue the search across all folders, just as before.  </p><p>So, thank you again for your help because you provided key clues that enabled me to track down the tool I was looking for. I hope future revisions make it the default tool, as it was in the past, because I find it more intuitive and delivering better results than the Global Search which appears now to be default.  I hope also that the development team correct the names of the features to make it clear that they are two parts of the same function, not two different functions.  </p><p>Thanks also for the information about ""Connect.mozilla""  A simple byline would help differentiate the two more clearly.  </p><p>I will carry over some of this response to Connect as that is where the developers are and I think they need to be made aware of it. </p>",VidPro,false,0,0

My Thunderbird runs in the Linux environment of a Chromebook with the latest stable ChromeOS version. Currently version 118.0.5993.86 (Official Build) (64-bit) I've had the problem since migrating from 102 to 115. Emails are almost impossible to delete from the trash. I have two accounts stored, both as imap. One of them is a smaller German provider and the other affected is a GMX account. However, I have had to hard shut down the Linux environment after a deletion process because Thunderbird no longer responds at all. </p>",aod7373,false,0,0

So if you are saying all marked as  junk email cannot show remote content as no banner with options is displayed then in that respect nothing is wrong. That behaviour is correct. </p><p>You would have to mark it as Not Junk and move to Inbox in order to get the ability to see the banner for remote contents options. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:TB thinks everything is junk -  i dont have adaptive junk filtering enabled or anything in that section,</strong> Can I assume it was set up and you have just disabled it in Account Settings &gt;Junk Settings&nbsp;?
