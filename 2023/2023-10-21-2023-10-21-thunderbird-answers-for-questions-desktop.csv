Ahora voy a especificar con más detalle lo que quise manifestar en la pregunta anterior y me apoyaré en varias imágenes. Las Imágenes 1 y 2, procedentes de la versión 102.15.1, es lo que aparece en Thunderbird cuando se recibe un correo (Imagen 1) y y lo que resulta de ordenar su impresión (Imagen 2). Es lo que yo siempre he esperado en todos los años que llevo utilizando Thunderbird, heredado de Netscape. Las imágenes 3 y 4, procedentes de la versión 115.2.3 SUPERNOVA, para el mismo correo que antes, es lo que aparece en Thunderbird cuando se recibe el correo (Imagen 3) y lo que resulta de ordenar su impresión (Imagen 4). La diferencia entre las imágenes 1 y 3, consiste en que en la 3 hay 3 renglones que no están en la 1: Fecha, ID del Mensaje (azul sensible) y Agente de usuario. No sería importante sino fuera la causa del desastre en la impresión del correo, como se observa en la Imagen 4, con un conjunto de numerosos renglones, totalmente irrelevantes para mí y que ensucia la impresión del correo. Sobra todo lo tachado en la Imagen 5. Sin duda, todos esos renglones se imprimen porque SUPERNOVA añade una información, que se imprime de mala manera. Lo que yo pido a Mozilla es que o se eliminen esos tres renglones o si no es posible, que no ensucien la impresión, y si tampoco es posible volveré a instalar la versión anterior a SUPERNOVA, para imprimir correctamente los correos. </p>",luis48,false,1,0

If you want support in fixing your migration so 115 works, I will do what I can.  But I am done helping people to go backwards to an unsupported version.  This forum and my blog has plenty of discussion on how going back commencing with the release of V68 is done, including full discussion on the topic. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I refuse to mess with the downgrade brigade,  you made your choice and will have to live with whatever corruption that has created.  But, I will not now, or ever promote it as a reasonable approach to change. Data loss and corruption are not acceptable to me.  Sorry. </p><p>You still have not downgraded your data and some at least will have been lost.  I am not across what this particular version will have left in a newer file format,  but calendars, contacts, passwords and mail data are all in the process of changing.  What you don't have now is something you will perhaps not work out for a long time,  like the inability to save a changed password.  But there will almost certainly be issues resulting from your decision. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If there is, your comment would have been better served to provide a link to the Mozilla document explaining proper way to go from 115 back to 102.  </p><p>Given the fact that installing 115 took zero time to update ""all my data... file format, passwords"" I suspected that there was not actually any update to my data, just to the interface that looked at it.  Moreover, I had done nothing but get mail a few times in 115, to realize it was not for me, and use my procedure to go back.  </p><p>I have now been doing everything for 18 days since I went back to 102. I have had zero issues on multiple e-mail accounts, from multiple systems, with e-mail going back over a decade. </p><p>As I said, this much content can not be instantly converted to something else. It would have to take time to migrate the data. But the switch from 102 to 115 took zero time. I launched the app, and it was all there. There was no ""conversion"" of my mail / profile - which is actually the largest single folder on my computer.  </p><p>This instant open indicates that nothing I have was ""converted"" and nothing needed to be ""un-converted"" except the prefs file that prevented 102 from opening my profile. I reserve the right to be wrong. I use Thunderbird for mail, not calendaring, task, chat, ... </p><p>If you have evidence to specific ""data-loss and corruption resulting from my decision"" then post it.

Most antivirus products that implement mail scanning (something I consider a waste of time) issue self signed encryption certificates which are not trusted by Thunderbird.  Most of these companies have instruction on how to manually add their untrusted certificates to the Thunderbird store.  But you in doing so vouvh for the validity of the certificate,  something Thunderbird can not verify because the certificates are not in the chain of trust TLS relies upon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
