I am writing to seek assistance with a persistent issue I have been experiencing with Thunderbird. Whenever my computer resumes from hibernation, I receive notifications indicating new emails in the system tray, and the affected account is highlighted in blue as if there are unread messages. However, upon checking, I find that all the emails have been read and there is no actual new mail. </p><p>I have ensured that all the settings for my account are correct, and both my computer and mobile device are configured with IMAP. This problem seems to occur consistently after the computer resumes from hibernation. </p><p>I have already taken the following steps to troubleshoot the issue: </p><p>-Updated Thunderbird to the latest version available. -Checked the account settings and ensured that the ""Notify me of new messages"" option is enabled. -Disabled and re-enabled notifications in Thunderbird. -Verified that both Thunderbird and my mobile device are set up for email synchronization. -Restarted Thunderbird and my computer multiple times. </p><p>Despite these efforts, the issue persists. I suspect that it might be a bug in Thunderbird. </p><p>I kindly request your guidance and support in resolving this issue. If anyone else has encountered a similar problem or has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate your input. </p><p>Thank you for your attention and assistance.
