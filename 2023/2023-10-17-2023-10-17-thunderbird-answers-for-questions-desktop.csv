It is manned by other Thunderbird users like yourself who offer their free time (unpaid volunteers) to help people solve issues. We are not employees. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:Your failure to provide any flexibility in adjusting the new layout to become more familiar to us....You could at least have still allowed that possibility in the options</em> </p><p>I tried to find any questions you asked on this but I cannot find any. </p><p>Yes there are lots of new things but I've managed to set up things so it's more familiar.  For example the new layout offers the same old Message List as before but in addition offers a Card View, so in this area you can still use same as before. Nothing has changed. </p><p>The Menu Bar still exists eg: File Edit View and I've provided a fix on how to put it in the original location.

There's a load more stuff - many unused toolbars or items on them can be disabled if you do not want them. The development is still on-going so a few tweaks are inevitable. </p><p>It's like anything new - the developers always set it up as default and then people like you and me need to assess if we want it or find out how to modify things. I've been getting used to it and in most respects it's actually a lot better than I first imagined and I'm no spring chicken&nbsp;:) </p><p>Rather than dismiss it altogether, I would suggest you try it and please ask a question if there is something you cannot find or you need to modify to suit your requirements.

We don't get to vote on new features, or any other strategic or tactical decisions. We're just here to help people.  </p><p>I will share with you that I also found the new layout difficult, and sometimes frustrating. But I decided to try to work with it to discover its strengths. With a bit of experimentation, I found that I can work well with it. So, while we hate to see you go, I encourage you to revisit 115, as a lot of work went into the design.
