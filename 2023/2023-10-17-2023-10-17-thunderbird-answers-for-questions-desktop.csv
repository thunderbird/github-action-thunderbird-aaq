The two messages you mention cite two different SMTP servers from two different providers.   If you only have one provider, then something is definitely wrong.  I would go into Account Settings and check.  Since you are getting emails, your download server settings must be OK. At the bottom of the first page of each email in the account settings is where you select what outgoing server you use.  Make sure that is set correctly for each email account.  Then check in the Outgoing Server settings at the bottom to make sure the outgoing server you are using has the correct server name, account, and password and the type of security.   Your provided should provide those for you.  The settings for the outgoing server may be different that for the download server. </p>",marklang,false,0,0

The only thing that has changed is that the old  buttons which were self explanatory now have very unintuitive replacements, which in the case of the blue New Message button is positively unhelpful being right next to the replacement for the Get New Messages button, which completely confuses their functions. Quite why the developers thought this was in any way a beneficial change is beyond me - their old labels were immediately easy to understand and you didn't have to hover or try them to find out what they do (or, in the case of the new New Message button, waste time finding out that it has nothing to do with getting new messages). </p>",jacksonew,false,4,0

They were 'closer' to the header, since the Mail Toolbar with the buttons was lower than the current Unified bar (it's possible to merge the Menu and Unified bar and place the combined bar right above the tabs bar).  You can hide the 115 Folder Pane Header from View/Folders and use the Get Messages and Write buttons on the Unified bar. </p><p>Currently, only the colours of the cloud icon and New Message button can be altered, with css. </p><p>It's not that customization options are hard to implement, it's that the developers don't see the need for them. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I'd more naturally guess its a Back up to Cloud tool, or opens Hidden Tools, or some kind of private mode. And Changing the old Write button to + New Message right next to it just reinforces the impression that the cloud symbol is nothing to do with getting new messages. Having to hover a cursor over something to see what it is is an unnecessary distraction. I need to see clear text, like it used to be, not a Guess What this Does button. I appreciate that Get Messages and Write can now be added as text to the unified bar at the top but this is not where these functions were in my previous layout (i.e. in the folder pane header). Given that the folder pane header remains, can't its cloud symbol and New Message buttons be modified back to their more intuitive previous versions (i.e. Get New Messages and Write)? A simple revision or customisation option surely? </p>",jacksonew,false,2,0

I'm not a newbie and have been into computers since 1964, so my posting was not spur of the moment. In reply and clarification: 1. I know this isn't the right forum but Thunderbird support doesn't give a direct link that I've ever found to go to the place that is the right one to use in these sorts of circumstances. The only one I could find takes me to the community in one form or other and in this case took me here. I simply hoped that someone in Mozilla would pick it up. 2. I've been looking several times since the new version was released to see how to go back to something more familiar and up until recently the only advice being offered that I found was a clear set of instructions to get back safely to v. 91. And having done it that is OK by me. One answer stated clearly (at the time I looked) that there was no way to get the original look back inside the new version, only to approximate to it, but if there now is I'll look into it *when I get time* - why should continually checking for a fix take top priority over my other problems when I didn't ask for the change in the first place? Wouldn't it have been better to have offered the ""workaround"" at the time the change occurred, suggesting that it hadn't been properly trialed and so this ""need"" hadn't become apparent? 3. The reason why I posted the message (intended for the developers) now is that my wife had only just recently let me know that she had struggled with it and had enough of the new version and wanted to go back. She isn't technically savvy and has no wish or intention to become so - why should she? - and asked me to revert her. It was only this later request that prompted me to (try to) tell the developer how we feel. 4. The pace of change in technology and software is getting now such that it is dictating people's lives. These things are supposed to be tools - easy to use, familiar and reliably constant. Thunderbird isn't the only culprit. The constant need to ""adapt"" the tool is distracting our time and energy from more important issues. Anyway, thank you all for your suggestions. </p>",41tutsham,false,0,0
