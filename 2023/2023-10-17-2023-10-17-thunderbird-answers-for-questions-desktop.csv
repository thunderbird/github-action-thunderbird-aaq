I'm not a newbie and have been into computers since 1964, so my posting was not spur of the moment. In reply and clarification: 1. I know this isn't the right forum but Thunderbird support doesn't give a direct link that I've ever found to go to the place that is the right one to use in these sorts of circumstances. The only one I could find takes me to the community in one form or other and in this case took me here. I simply hoped that someone in Mozilla would pick it up. 2. I've been looking several times since the new version was released to see how to go back to something more familiar and up until recently the only advice being offered that I found was a clear set of instructions to get back safely to v. 91. And having done it that is OK by me. One answer stated clearly (at the time I looked) that there was no way to get the original look back inside the new version, only to approximate to it, but if there now is I'll look into it *when I get time* - why should continually checking for a fix take top priority over my other problems when I didn't ask for the change in the first place? Wouldn't it have been better to have offered the ""workaround"" at the time the change occurred, suggesting that it hadn't been properly trialed and so this ""need"" hadn't become apparent? 3. The reason why I posted the message (intended for the developers) now is that my wife had only just recently let me know that she had struggled with it and had enough of the new version and wanted to go back. She isn't technically savvy and has no wish or intention to become so - why should she? - and asked me to revert her. It was only this later request that prompted me to (try to) tell the developer how we feel. 4. The pace of change in technology and software is getting now such that it is dictating people's lives. These things are supposed to be tools - easy to use, familiar and reliably constant. Thunderbird isn't the only culprit. The constant need to ""adapt"" the tool is distracting our time and energy from more important issues. Anyway, thank you all for your suggestions. </p>",41tutsham,false,0,0

For example the new layout offers the same old Message List as before but in addition offers a Card View, so in this area you can still use same as before. Nothing has changed. </p><p>The Menu Bar still exists eg: File Edit View and I've provided a fix on how to put it in the original location.
