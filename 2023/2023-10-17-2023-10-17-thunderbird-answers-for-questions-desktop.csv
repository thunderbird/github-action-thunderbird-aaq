I'm not a newbie and have been into computers since 1964, so my posting was not spur of the moment. In reply and clarification: 1. I know this isn't the right forum but Thunderbird support doesn't give a direct link that I've ever found to go to the place that is the right one to use in these sorts of circumstances. The only one I could find takes me to the community in one form or other and in this case took me here. I simply hoped that someone in Mozilla would pick it up. 2. I've been looking several times since the new version was released to see how to go back to something more familiar and up until recently the only advice being offered that I found was a clear set of instructions to get back safely to v. 91. And having done it that is OK by me. One answer stated clearly (at the time I looked) that there was no way to get the original look back inside the new version, only to approximate to it, but if there now is I'll look into it *when I get time* - why should continually checking for a fix take top priority over my other problems when I didn't ask for the change in the first place? Wouldn't it have been better to have offered the ""workaround"" at the time the change occurred, suggesting that it hadn't been properly trialed and so this ""need"" hadn't become apparent? 3. The reason why I posted the message (intended for the developers) now is that my wife had only just recently let me know that she had struggled with it and had enough of the new version and wanted to go back. She isn't technically savvy and has no wish or intention to become so - why should she? - and asked me to revert her. It was only this later request that prompted me to (try to) tell the developer how we feel. 4. The pace of change in technology and software is getting now such that it is dictating people's lives. These things are supposed to be tools - easy to use, familiar and reliably constant. Thunderbird isn't the only culprit. The constant need to ""adapt"" the tool is distracting our time and energy from more important issues. Anyway, thank you all for your suggestions. </p>",41tutsham,false,0,0

I'd more naturally guess its a Back up to Cloud tool, or opens Hidden Tools, or some kind of private mode. And Changing the old Write button to + New Message right next to it just reinforces the impression that the cloud symbol is nothing to do with getting new messages. Having to hover a cursor over something to see what it is is an unnecessary distraction. I need to see clear text, like it used to be, not a Guess What this Does button. I appreciate that Get Messages and Write can now be added as text to the unified bar at the top but this is not where these functions were in my previous layout (i.e. in the folder pane header). Given that the folder pane header remains, can't its cloud symbol and New Message buttons be modified back to their more intuitive previous versions (i.e. Get New Messages and Write)?

The only thing that has changed is that the old  buttons which were self explanatory now have very unintuitive replacements, which in the case of the blue New Message button is positively unhelpful being right next to the replacement for the Get New Messages button, which completely confuses their functions. Quite why the developers thought this was in any way a beneficial change is beyond me - their old labels were immediately easy to understand and you didn't have to hover or try them to find out what they do (or, in the case of the new New Message button, waste time finding out that it has nothing to do with getting new messages). </p>",jacksonew,false,11,1

At the bottom of the first page of each email in the account settings is where you select what outgoing server you use.  Make sure that is set correctly for each email account.  Then check in the Outgoing Server settings at the bottom to make sure the outgoing server you are using has the correct server name, account, and password and the type of security.

I temporarily changed the IMAP login to ""Normal Password"" leaving smtp on OAuth2, deleted the login password mentioned above and then pressed [Send] on an email.  I wanted to see what smtp does when it has no way to authenticate.  It results in the OAuth2 login being displayed with a URL like <a href=""https://login.microsoft.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?responde_type=code&amp;client_id=....&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalho"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.microsoft.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?responde_type=code&amp;client_id=....&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalho</a>..., which immediately redirects a couple of times ending up at <a href=""https://idp.DOMAIN.NAME/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://idp.DOMAIN.NAME/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php</a>.  That page is blank, and after a second or so it disappears without asking for input.  But the oauth:// password entry is recreated nonetheless, and looks to be valid because when I revert the IMAP login to OAuth2 I don't get prompted to get a new OAuth2 bearer token.  So sending with SMTP is traipsing  down the OAuth2 path, but in the end it fails in the way I described in my first post.  Ie, it presents the dialogue with then [Enter New Password] button.</p>",russell+accounts.firefox.com,false,0,0

You can use a tool like [Postman](<a href=""https://www.postman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.postman.com/</a>) or make HTTP requests.   - Make a POST request to `<a href=""https://login.microsoftonline.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.microsoftonline.com/</a>{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token` with the required parameters to obtain a token. </pre> <p>5. **Configure Email Client:** </p><pre>  - Update your email client's SMTP settings with the following details:     - SMTP Server: `<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>`     - Port: `587`     - Encryption: `STARTTLS`     - Username: Your full Office 365 email address     - Password: The OAuth2 token obtained in the previous step </pre> <p>6. **Verify and Test:** </p><pre>  - Verify that your email client is configured correctly.   - Send a test email to ensure that the OAuth2 authentication is working. </pre> <p>7. **Check Logs and Errors:** </p><pre>  - If it's not working, check the logs or error messages from your email client or the tool you used to obtain the OAuth2 token.   - Ensure that the permissions assigned to your application cover the necessary scopes for sending emails. </pre> <p>Remember that the steps may slightly vary based on the email client you are using. If you encounter specific error messages or issues, they can provide more insights into the problem. Always ensure that your application and authentication details are handled securely, and follow Microsoft's documentation for the most up-to-date information.check;<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://networkershome.com/ccna-course-in-bangalore-india</a> </p>",shahqaim285,false,0,0

They spread by infecting other files or software and can often require user interaction to propagate. </pre> <p>2. **Worms:** </p><pre>  - Worms are self-replicating malware that can spread across networks without user intervention. They exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems to replicate and infect other computers. </pre> <p>3. **Trojans:** </p><pre>  - Trojans, or Trojan horses, disguise themselves as legitimate software or files to deceive users into installing them.

Rimane ora quello che è ancora più grave, se posso usare questo termine, cioè quello che cliccando su uno qualsiasi degli account sia la posta di arrivo che spedita non si apre alla data corrente, non si vedono in pratica le email arrivate ancora in grassetto.

My suggestion is this: - rightclick the unified toolbar and click 'customize' - drag all the buttons you would normally use, such as get messages, write, forward, delete, etc  - if menu bar is on, click view&gt;toolbars and UNtick it  - click view&gt;folders and UNtick the folder pane header (This is optional. I happen to like that header, but omitted from my screenshot to give you a view close to 102.)  </p><p>Now you have a clean view. Instead of menu bar, you have the hamburger menu in upper right. This view is now close to 102, but in doing so, you lose some of the features of the folder pane header. This new design completely removes the need for the old menu bar and gives you full control of what features you want. Okay, I may seem biased, but I was like you at first. I didn't like the view and I insisted on keeping the menu bar. Now, I prefer the new view. And THANKS for being open to this change. So many post here with anger that the view is different. True, it's different, but is very flexible. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
