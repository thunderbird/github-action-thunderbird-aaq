A questo punto ci sono due possibilità; se il programma client è chiuso si apre un nuovo messaggio con l'allegato ma immediatamente dopo si apre Thunderbird nascondendo sotto il messaggio che intendo completare ed inviare; se invece il programma client è aperto il messaggio rimane sulla barra delle applicazioni. In entrambe i casi devo cliccare ancora una volta sul messaggi e quindi proseguire. La mia richiesta è questa: è possibile mantenere in primo piano il messaggio che intendo completare ed inviare?

I have followed the documentation to change the order of emails shown but its still puts emails from 2013 right there at the top. Additionally, can anyone provide any insight as to why, and I do mean WHY, folks who are sharp enough to code an email client for commercial release are simultaneously so dull that they don't realize that setting the out of the box default sort settings of that email client to show oldest emails first is a misguided choice at best.  </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Mario </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1617808;1617949;1617973;,mariogasmone

Have rescued emails from Junk folder with shift+J hundreds of time but TB is NOT trainable. At this point I want to DISABLE ALL of TB junk-spam filtering capabilities. I have un-checked ""Enable adaptive junk mail controls for this account"", closed TB and restarted my computer. On restart, even though ""Enable adaptive junk mail controls for this account"" remains un-checked, emails still go to the junk folder. Note that the only emails that go to the junk folder are the ones in which I have cc'd myself. In other words, <strong>only my own email address is going to junk</strong>. BTW my own email address is on the white-list. I have spent way too much time reading all the Support community discussions and find no solution for HOW TO TURN IT OFF. Please help. Thanks. [TB 115.4.2, Win 11, have been TB user for 13 years &amp; it's worked great until now] </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1617825;1620645;1620655;1620657;,RML_Seattle

The program said it was up to date (v68 I think) but I then discovered that the 64bit version was up to v115 and it had the necessary ""calendar"" (to see these Invites) built into it so I installed it and everything seemed to be fine after the upgrade except that I lost my Address Book (all the websites I saw said the upgrade would ""handle"" everything and none warned that Address Book should be exported BEFORE upgrading!), however, just from yesterday, TB has stopped downloading messages from (just) ONE of my <a href=""http://ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ntlworld.com</a> accounts! </p><p>When I click 'Get Messages' and look at the bottom I see it accessing all the accounts I have EXCEPT the main one I use! </p><p>Now, recently, for some unknown reason, Virgin Media LOCKED this mail account and I had to go through a whole load of palaver to get it up and running again!  This, of course, involved accepting a new, ridiculously complex, password for the mail account but I did all that and once I had entered the new password into TB, the account worked fine all of last week. </p><p>However, as of yesterday, TB has stopped even trying to fetch the mail from the ntlworld server associated with my main email address (it gets the messages from my other ntlworld addresses no problem) and I can still SEND emails from my main ntlworld address! </p><p>I looked in the saved passwords and noted that the new password is there against the <a href=""http://smtp.ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ntlworld.com</a> linked to this email address but there is no sign of a <a href=""http://pop3.ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3.ntlworld.com</a> line for this account or the associated password! </p><p>I can find no  advice on how to manually add in this account and its password for a pop3 server and wondered if that was why TB was not downloading messages from that server/account anymore? </p><p>I have already tried deleting popstate.dat for the a/c in question and even tried deleting global-messages-db.sqlite (which meant I had to go into EVERY webmail for ALL of my accounts and delete ALL the messages in them to avoid the possibility of re-downloading thousands of emails!!!) but my suspicion is that the account not being listed in the saved passwords (just for pop3, the smtp password is there alongside this email address) is the root of the problem. </p><p>TB doesn't ASK me for a password for this account when getting messages it just doesn't attempt to fetch them from that account/server at all! (Everything is all properly set up &amp; the account IS 'ticked' to be included when getting mail!) </p><p>Any ideas what the problem (actually) is and how to fix it?
