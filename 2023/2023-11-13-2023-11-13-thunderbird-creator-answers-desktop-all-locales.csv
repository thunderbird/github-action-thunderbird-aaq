Premessa: utilizzo Mozilla Thunderbird come programma predefinito di posta elettronica. Ho un quesito da porvi; mi capita spesso di inviare uno (o più file) che ho nella mia cartella documenti. Per farlo clicco con il tasto destro del mouse sul file da me prescelto quindi ---&gt; invia a ---&gt; destinatario di posta. A questo punto ci sono due possibilità; se il programma client è chiuso si apre un nuovo messaggio con l'allegato ma immediatamente dopo si apre Thunderbird nascondendo sotto il messaggio che intendo completare ed inviare; se invece il programma client è aperto il messaggio rimane sulla barra delle applicazioni. In entrambe i casi devo cliccare ancora una volta sul messaggi e quindi proseguire. La mia richiesta è questa: è possibile mantenere in primo piano il messaggio che intendo completare ed inviare? (Credo fosse una funzione presente sul vecchio Outlook Express). Grazie a chi mi vorrà dare suggerimenti. </p>,customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,1617790;,sandro18
