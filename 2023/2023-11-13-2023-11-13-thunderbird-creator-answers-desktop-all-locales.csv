I have confirmed that LibreOffice, Notepad, and Google Chrome can print to the printer. When I try to print, the list of printers is limited to ""Save to PDF"" and nothing else is available. All other programs can understand what printers are. </p><p>Attempted solutions: 1) Cleared the cache: This fixes the problem for one iteration, and then it forgets how to print again 2) Reset the print_printer value in Config Editor: Same result as attempt (1) 3) Removed (after backing up) the configuration files in: C:\Users\debbi\AppData\Local\Thunderbird C:\Users\debbi\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird This forced Thunderbird to reconfigure the connection completely. After the data is set up (as IMAP), the messages appear again. Attempting to print gets the same result as attempt (1) 4) Uninstalled Thunderbird AND removed all the data in the folders listed in attempt (3). Then, reinstalled from Thunderbird version 102. I had it run the reconnection all over again (IMAP) and got the emails. Attempted printing with the same result as in attempt (1). </p><p>I am at a loss. One suggestion was to modify some file named addons.json in the profile, but if I remove that file, all user data, and the entire program, wouldn't a clean reinstall fix this? If the profile is somewhere other than the AppData folder, please help me to understand. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Eric214
