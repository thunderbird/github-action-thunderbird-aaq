When ever I attempt to do so, when I click SEND it pops up the usual message box ""Sending Message"" followed by the Subject text.  This box remains on the screen for some minutes and then it sounds an alert and is replaced with a message box ""Send Message Error"" with the message ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtpauth.earthlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtpauth.earthlink.net</a> timed out. Try again.""  There have been NO changes to the specs for sending or receiving with Earthlink that I am aware of.   </p><p>I still receive messages on Thunderbird just fine and can both send and receive message on Google's email client with Earthlink just fine with no recent change its specs. </p><p>Please HELP! </p><p>Bud Crain </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dumbowsky
