Questi sono i miei suggerimenti. Il backup non sono stati fatti in mbox ma la copia integrale della base messaggi. Il profilo dell'epoca forse lo trovo forse no. Il problema quindi è irrisolvibile?

Purtroppo lo strumento TB ha molti limiti, per la sua applicazione, lo faccio anche per altri programmi che non fanno cambiamenti così radicali nella gestione dei dati e li tutto procede senza particolari intoppi. Poi, secondo me, non ha senso non permettere backup incrementali di fatto. Nel cambiare versione, non c'è retro compatibilità (forse è il metodo di indicizzazione che cambia visto che gli archivi, per quanto ho capito, restano gli stessi) e questo genera grossi problemi nel recupero dati (esperienza diretta).  Se ti capita un problema nel cambio versione devi fare numerose operazioni (se va tutto bene) quando di regola dovrebbe bastare rimettere ""su"" soltanto l'archivio in backup. Ad ogni modo, appena c'è questo cambio di gestione dei dati, negli ng di supporto, anche generali ci sono sempre troppi utenti che restano ""appiedati"" con sempre le stesse problematiche (a volte non risolvibili). Magari TB di default quando sa che cambia tutto, un bel backup automatico del profilo precedente lo dovrebbe fare. Ciao. P.S. Grazie per i link. </p>",cosentino1960,false,0,0

Imap accounts can only show what is on the server. You only see the folders which are subscribed to be seen. So in effect the imap account folders and the folders you see in the gmail webmail account are in effect one and the same. You should not regard imap account folders as independent folders. When you delete an email it must get put into the subscribed gmail  imap Trash folder, so when it synchronises with server gmail understands you want to delete the email from the 'All Mail' folder and put the email into the Trash.  If you manually or via filter 'move' an email from an imap folder to 'Local Folders' mail account, gmail understand you want to remove only the label called 'Inbox' and therefore archive the email in the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>I would advise that you only put 'copies' of imap emails which you really want to keep as a separate independent copy into 'Local Folders' mail account.  </p><p>So it is impossible to set up an imap account up as a deferred account using 'Local Folders' mail account. </p><p>However, it is possible to use the 'Unified' view.

Even when integrating an image the border is not set.... </blockquote> <p>When you copy and paste a table from Excel (OR any MS product) it contains a load of ms html css code and you may find that not all of that code is accurately displayed in Thunderbird or indeed in any product that is not owned/created by Microsoft.  This is expected because Microsoft have their own html css settings that are very specific to Microsoft products. MS Excel, like all MS Office products are very specialised and offer far more functionality than offered in just an email product. </p><p>This is the reason why emails have the abilitiy to add attachments.  If you want the recipient to be able to see exactly what you see, then you add the excel file as an attachment and then the recipient can open that attachment using the appropriate software. Please note they may not have MS Excel and so might use a program like OpenOffice Calc which will try to it's best rendition of the code. </p><p>If you want to change the border: double click on the outline of table and you should see the 'Table properties' window allowing you to modify the settings. </p><p>If copy pasting a load of text from eg: MS Word then I suggest you strip the formatting: Edit &gt; Paste without formatting </p><p>This has the added bonus of removing all the bloated css code that MS products like to stuff into an email. You can then apply any required formatting. </p><p>It is also worth noting that MS products use points for the size of fonts as Thunderbird uses pixels. eg: 12pt = 16px </p><p><br> Always remember, whatever you see in the email you are composing, it may not neccessarilly look the same on the recipient computer.  The recipients computer may have different font or have settings to increase/decrease the fonts. eg: My settings remove all small fonts, medium setting on my computer may be greater than on yours. I may also choose to override and remove any colours or force tables to be centralised etc etc or even not display any formatting.  So when composing an email it's worth baring this in mind. Thunderbird composing is designed to be suitable for all people using different OS and with different visual requirements. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I have worked for four months now with this setup and it basically works fine: I can handle my emails on Windows in the morning and continue under Linux in the afternoon. But sometimes things go sideways. </p><p>Windows Explorer gave me the first clue: if I request the file properties for specific files in my mailpath some of them are different when it comes to file ownership and modbits (access rights). Files created under Windows are all owned by my personal user account, but some of the files created under Linux are - for some obscure reason - owned by root. Maybe some of the processes forked by TB under Linux run with root privilege(?!) If anyone would like to comment on this, please don't hesitate to do so. I run Debian Linux with Xfce on my desktops, by the way. </p><p>Logging into a shell on my Samba server I saw also differences in modbits for a couple of files in root of the the mail directory. These files, including 'prefs.js', turned out NOT to be writable for my user account anymore (only for root). As long as I simply handle my emails under Windows this restriction does not hurt. But when I want (or need) to change my settings (that is where 'prefs.js' comes into play) I find that I can adjust them but they will be lost the moment I restart TB. </p><p>Long story short: after changing file ownership from root to &lt;userid&gt; for a total of just 6 files and 1 directory and changing some of their modbits I was able to make everything work for TB, both under Windows and Linux. This includes adding new mailaccounts for my new provider and getting rid of the TB nagscreen (kindly asking for a donation). For the latter I went into 'Settings &gt; Configuration Editor' and removed the URL defined in the 'app.donation.eoy.url' field. So @David, I think this is a better way of doing it, rather than disabling (or removing) the start page. No need for that, I think. But, of course, thank you once more for your willlingness to help me out. </p><p>Gr, Steijn van Essen From i8088 to i7-980X in 25 years and still waiting … But not for much longer: when Windows is gone, Intel will be next (in favor of ARM on Raspberry Pi). </p>",Steijn_van_Essen,false,0,0

Unfortunately many Thunderbird settings are stored as absolute paths and they do not transition well from Linux to Windows and back. </p><p>Why your file ownership was switched to root, I have no idea,  but if I was guessing I would be thinking a bug in Samba is more likely than just about anything, or the files being copied by the root user.   </p><p>Thunderbird runs entirely in the user space, with no elevated privileges.  I therefore can not see the access required to actually make the changes on Linux existing.  Samba however it is pretty much what it does, managed files and permissions. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

That's what I hope decently developed software to do (at least when it comes to simple tasks like writing an office document, playing a video or audio file, or handling emails). And therefore, giving it a second thought, I might have tried logging on to TB once using the root account when I ran out of options to get rid of the donation screen. Can't remember for sure, but this seems a more likely explanation than TB switching to elevated privileges all by itself. Having said this, my mixed OS TB setup has worked flawless (apart from the settings issues) for four moths and seems to work even better now. Simply installed TB both under Windows and Linux, put (under Windows) my mail directory (and profiles) on a Samba share/NAS, copied/synchronized my settings in profile.ini from the Windows desktop to the Linux desktop and then, by magic, I could also handle my email under Linux. </p><p>@Matt &amp; @David, </p><p>Thank you once more for helping me out with this problem (digesting your suggestions and having given it a second thought, I most likely created myself). </p><p>Gr, Steijn van Essen From i8088 to i7-980X in 25 years and still waiting … But not for much longer: when Windows is gone, Intel will be next (in favor of ARM on Raspberry Pi). </p>",Steijn_van_Essen,false,0,1

That is typical, and the approach that I recommend. Here is what is happening:  - you compose in arial - you send the message but, since there are no HTML elements (such as bold), the message is sent as plain text.  - because it was sent as plain text, an aberration of the setting in settings&gt;general appears. (We'll fix that later) </p><pre>It is important that you decide your intent. Is it that you want recipient to receive message in Arial instead of their preferred font? Or is your concern to have Arial for yourself to read for your own preference? If it is important to you that they receive the message in your font, then you need to set settings&gt;composition to always send as 'HTML and plain text' or as 'HTML.' That will eliminate the discrepancy you see.   </pre> <p>However, if you are open to letting recipient make that choice (which I recommend), then my suggestion is to change settings&gt;composition to default to 'variable width' and font size to 'medium' . The 'variable width' font is not a font, but a setting within Thunderbird to send NO FONT specification in an HTML message, requiring the recipient's email client to provide the font chosen by recipient.  </p><p>Next, fix the aberration in settings&gt;general.  </p><p>- in settings&gt;general, set the font and font size to your choice.  - click the 'advanced' button. set every option to your preferred font size (see my example attachments. I use calibri 14 point. ) - tick the box to allow other fonts  - now, look at top of pane. it probably either shows 'Other writing systems' or 'latin.' That is a drop-down menu. click it and switch to the opposite and set all fonts and sizes there to be IDENTICAL to what was on the other pane. Once done, click back and forth a couple of times to be sure that 'other writing systems' and 'latin' match. - click ok.  </p><p>Now, when you write, the font selected in settings&gt;general will appear in composition pane and the message in sent folder will match. This does work, as I have given same advice here many times. Follow all the steps and your issue should disappear. </p>",davidsk,false,1,1

If all the mail you see is arial, that means you are receiving plain text messages, which otherwise do not have a font specification.

You see arial only when receiving plain text fonts (which cannot be overridden in any email client) or they send HTML with specifying a font. What you're saying to me is that all you see is arial.

Instead of creating new account, I think you should be able to highlight your account and select a 'change password' option.  What password does he still hold?

In any case, you cannot set account passwords in Thunderbird. You have to set a password for your email provider's server. And you'll have to do that on the server, not within Thunderbird. Typically there is only one account password for both, the incoming, and outgoing server. Whether this is any different for your email provider, you'll have to check with them. Yahoo certainly isn't one of them. As said before, you can only tell Thunderbird to remember the password, so that you don't have to type it again and again. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

Since these rules are stored in a file located in a folder unique to that account, all you need to is create ""hard links"" of the filter file in the other account folders. You only need to do this once for each account, never again, unless you start using different rules for different accounts. </p><p>Here is how to make the hard links. </p><p>1. Shut down Thunderbird. Close all TB windows. Make sure you don't have any others open, like alerts or messages you were composing! You can also check Task Manager to see that TB has no processes running. </p><p>2. Identify the TB folder for your current profile. 	For example, in Windows 10, you could expect the folder name to be ""C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\&lt;8-digit random code&gt;.default"". 	If you have more than one folder with a random 8-digit code, choose the folder with the latest  modification time (unless you think you modified another profile folder even more recently). </p><p>3. Within that folder you just identified, there are sub-folders related to each mail account you have setup in TB (for that profile). Identify the account folder for your one email account that has all of (and the only) rules you want to share with other accounts. </p><p>	Generally, Windows 10 users would find that folder in ""C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\&lt;8-digit random code&gt;.default\ImapMail\&lt;vendor incoming mail server URL&gt;. </p><p>	For example, if you had just setup your rules for a Yahoo IMAP account in Windows 10, you could expect to see a folder name like  	""C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\4b3oc8e9.default\ImapMail\<a href=""http://imap.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.yahoo.com</a>"". </p><p>4. Identify all of the other folders in your profile that contain your accounts to which you want to apply the same filter rules.  	For example, if you have a Google account it could be something like ""C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\4b3oc8e9.default\ImapMail\<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>"". </p><p>5. **For each of mail account folders you will be sharing those rules with,**  	delete the msgFilterRules.dat file (or rename it to something like msgFilterRules.dat.bak). 	(Do NOT do delete the file in the folder which has all the filter rules you want to propagate!) </p><p>6. After you have deleted or renamed all of the filter rule files in other account folders, you will create the hard links. </p><p>	a. Open a Windows command prompt window as administrator (or for another OS, do an equivalent shell operation).  </p><p>	b. Change your directory to the folder with the original ""good"" filter file (with all the rules you use).  		For example, ""cd C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\&lt;8-digit random code&gt;.default\ImapMail\&lt;vendor incoming mail server URL&gt;"" </p><p>	c. Make a **hard link** (not just a ""shortcut"" or ""soft/symbolic link"") to each additional account folder using the current folder's msgFilterRules.dat file. 		Use the mklink command with the ""h"" (for hard) option: 		""mklink -h ../&lt;additional vendor incoming mail server URL&gt;/msgFilterRule.dat msgFilterRule.dat"" {doing this for each additional account needing the same filter rules} 		E.g., for making a hard link to a Google account from a Yahoo account, it would be ""mklink -h ../<a href=""http://imap.google.com/msgFilterRule.dat"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.google.com/msgFilterRule.dat</a> msgFilterRule.dat"" </p><p>7. Once you have made all the hard links for each account sharing the rules, you will essentially have a single collection of rules to which each account is pointing. Hard links were designed for needs like this! In many similar situations, you could also use soft links, but Thunderbird (for reasons I don't know of) requires hard links. </p><p>8. Restart Thunderbird and enjoy the simplicity of the same filter rules shared by multiple accounts. </p><p>Note: Every solution I have previously seen offered for this problem has involved making a copy of the original filter file in each additional account folder (or editing the msgFilterRules.dat file and pasting in the rules from another file). However, that solution requires recopying the filter rules file to each account directory **every time the filter rules have changed**. That requirement is an invitation for making mistakes, including forgetting to copy the files after a filter change or only copying the files to certain accounts.  I hope this has helped someone, someday.&nbsp;:-) </p>",Bruzote,false,2,0
