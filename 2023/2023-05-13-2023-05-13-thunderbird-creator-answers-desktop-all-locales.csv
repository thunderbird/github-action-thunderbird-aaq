I have a sub-folder of Garry named ""JunkMail"". I'm not certain but I think that I must have created it for troubleshooting the issue with Garry's emails going to Junk Mail. I refer to that folder as GJunk.  Here's what I need to understand better: 1. Is it possible that TB, not I, created GJunk? 2. Regardless how it was created, will emails that I mark as Junk and ones that TB automatically classifies as Junk, be moved to GJunk? 3. I think that there are some folders that TB creates automatically, right? Like Inbox, Trash, Sent. Is JunkMail another of those folders that TB creates automatically? </p><p>For troubleshooting, I sent an email to myself and marked it as Junk. It didn't get moved anywhere, it's still in Inbox. Later I sent another email to myself. It didn't get automatically marked as Junk. </p><p>Thanks for your help.

We use Thunderbird for our email client for our business email. Our email address is hosted through Go Daddy. Not long ago we were required to switch settings to utilize Microsoft365 to access email. We had someone that is in the tech business set it up for us. It has worked fine for up to now. (The person that set it up for us is out of the country for a week or yes, I would have him help me). Today we cannot access email without entering a password. It said that it didn't work. I went straight to GoDaddy to login to email to check to be sure that I had the correct password. (It opens a Microsoft window now where it used to log in to Webmail.)  I was able to login with the password that I have. So, password must be good.  I chatted online with Go Daddy and the tech had me remove my email from thunderbird and re add it. Once that was done it wouldn't sync. we tried several configurations. Finally after trying a few options in the settings I am able to receive NEW email, but most prior mail is gone along with all of my folders.  It doesn't matter where I login to email now, via thunderbird or directly through Go Daddy/Microsoft, I am only seeing new emails and all folders are gone.  Is there any suggestions to try? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1580465;1580472;,Cindy40
