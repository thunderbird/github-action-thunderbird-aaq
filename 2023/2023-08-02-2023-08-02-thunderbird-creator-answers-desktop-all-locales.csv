The first page will have the email header including who from, who to, date and subject, the next page has the body of the email with the 3rd being the sender details. This despite the body of the email only being a few lines long. If the email trail is a number of emails I end up with pages and pages to print.  </p><p>Would appreciate help as I don't feel like destroying multiple trees when I need a hard copy to go on file. </p><p>Thanks, and cheers. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",annesch1
