I also don't like the new font family/face for the list of folders window and the ""Subject--Correspondents--Date"" window.  Is there a way I can change the font family/face?  The only options I see are to change the font size and the vertical spacing of the lines with the ""Density"" options. </p><p>3.  I also don't like the new icon in the Task Bar for Thunderbird.  I think it might be a fox curled up, but because it's so small it just looks like an imperfect blue circle with a white center--meaningless.  Can I change that back to the old one or something else? </p><p>These changes actually made me consider changing to Microsoft Outlook. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1594658;1595694;1595711;1595750;1595987;1596085;1596224;1596248;,MozThunderbirdUser

The saved Gmails are organized into files/folders.  The minute I click on one message in a folder, the entire contents of all the emails completely get deleted. They are not in trash and are removed from my ALL EMAILS file, as well.  They are totally gone:  all of my business emails for 3 different Gmail accounts on Thunderbird and have been deleted from Gmail. Why has this happened? Can I fix this? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1594946;1595132;1596155;,melissadoff
