I checked all the server settings, they are correct.  This is only happening in Thunderbird and I haven't changed any settings. </p><p>I have a ton of messages in this profile and the outbound messages I have stuck are a bit important.  Have I encountered a bug?   </p><p>I tried doing Repair on some of the mailbox folders (Inbox) and get some weird results.  One account is sticking several non-Spam messages in the Spam folder and won't allow me to take them out, and that's on a different account -- I have like three Gmail accounts configured. </p><p>Help!&nbsp;:) </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",forrie1
