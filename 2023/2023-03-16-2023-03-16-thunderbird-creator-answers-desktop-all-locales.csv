Today, Thunderbird got automatically updated to version 112.0 beta and suddenly it was impossible for me to navigate to specific messages (I'm using speech synthesizers to read everything, which means I have to do everything entirely from my PC keyboard, without using the mouse). When I pressed Tab or Shift+Tab several times, I got to the list of messages but then when I wanted to select a message by pressing the arrow keys, suddenly the selected message opened and I was unable to get back to the list of messages. </li></ol> <p>I then wanted to revert to an older version so I installed version 102.9.0. When I ran it, I was asked to create a new profile. When I did that, there was no option at all to get to the messages that I had previously saved locally within the other profile. So my question is this: How do I access the messages that were saved locally on my hard drive within the currently inaccessible profile when I had previously set up multiple email accounts for that profile? Or how do I navigate to specific messages in version 112.0 Beta which DOES allow me to access the other profile? I mean, the one and only reason why I've now gone back to 102.9 is that I'm unable to navigate to specific messages in 112.0 beta even though version 111 was still manageable for me (it was enough to find the folder, press Tab, find the message, press Enter and there it was). </p> <ol><li>2. How do I tell Thunderbird to always conform to ""strict MIME"" for my outgoing messages (i.e. to never use ""Content transfer encoding = 8bit"")? </li></ol> <ol><li>3.

So, is there a way to prevent the ""recheck for new messages in a folder when opening that folder"" behavior and, e.g., only check for new messages on the schedule in each account's settings, by doing ""Get Messages,"" etc.? </p><p>Thunderbird is about as responsive as I would expect when I'm working in offline mode. So, I suppose I could open Thunderbird, allow it to sync up to the IMAP accounts, then go offline to work on the messages that came in, then go back online to sync what I've done to the server.
