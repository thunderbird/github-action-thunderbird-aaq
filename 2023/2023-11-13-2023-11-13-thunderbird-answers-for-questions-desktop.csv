I have set the font to variable width in global preferences so my settings should match yours Re-running the scenario I get your result but continuing to insert html fails. </p><p>The scenario is Click New message Click in the Body of the email type ""qwerty"" for example and enter for new line Then from the toolbar select Insert - HTML and type <b>Hello</b> (with html bold tags around the word Hello)  Click Insert. It works Then repeat the HTML insert, That works as well Now press enter for a newline Then repeat the HTML insert. It fails and note the new line has been deleted. For hereonin the insert HTML fails </p><p>It has me puzzled as to what is going on </p>",mike.thompson1,false,0,0
