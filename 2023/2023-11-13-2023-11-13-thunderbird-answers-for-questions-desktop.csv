I hate to say it but Thunderbird is a wonky and buggy email client that needs a lot of development. I was hoping to find something to manage my mail on a Windows machine at work but to paraphrase: ""This chit aint it!"" For now I'll keep lugging my Macbook around since it has Einstein Mail on it which is an email client that wasn't programmed by monkeys. I am going to mark this as solved, as my short time with the bird is over. I have already plucked and feathered it, shoved a stick of butter up its bum and sent it to the oven. </p><p>Thanks Again </p><p>Mario </p>",mariogasmone,false,0,0

As I understand it, Synchronization is done automatically for all <strong>headers</strong> on the server <em><strong>regardless of any settings?</strong></em>. </p><p>2. When I <em><strong>read</strong></em> a particular message, is the message <strong>body and attachment(s)</strong> downloaded locally automatically (regardless of any settings)? </p><p>3. If I check ""<em>Keep messages in all folders for this account on this computer</em>"",  will that download all messages <strong>body and attachment(s)</strong>.  </p><p>4. When/how are the messages <strong>body and attachment(s)</strong> downloaded locally? Is it done ""randomly""  when TB is open?  I do not have the option that you mentioned ""<em>check the advanced button in the synchronization setting. To ensure all download, click file&gt;offline&gt;download</em>"" (The Advanced button just lets me select what folders to include). I do have another option though if I want to force the download: File&gt;&gt; Offline&gt;Download/Sync Now... However, does this mean download of messages <strong>header or body and attachment(s)</strong>? </p><p>5. Can I see in Thunderbird which messages <strong>body and attachment(s)</strong> have been downloaded locally? If so, how? </p><p>6. The folder ""ImapMail"" has a subfolder for my mail account ""<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>"". It has the files and a folder as shown in the attached image. Which file(s) contains the messages <strong>body and attachment(s)</strong> and which one(s) contains the headers?
