Unfortunately I'm not a programmer. </p><p>I looked at one of those articles before posting and both now. The information requires programming skills, creating a file and placing the file created in a location I can't figure out because it doesn't tell where the file goes. It refers to an image that is supposed to show where the file goes but the image isn't there. I searched my computer and no file of that name exists that I can locate with a search and then replace. Searching brought up 8 folders named ""chrome"" several have the word Thunderbird in their path and others have mozilla. So this is a dead end even if I could manage all the steps to create the file because I can't risk breaking Thunderbird or anything else because don't know what I'm doing. </p><p>Can Mozilla or anyone explain why the user interface had to be so totally broken in this update and now needs programming to get the functionality back? We have been through many updates that made changes to Thunderbird over the years but there was always some setting to restore anything important like basic functionality if it had gone away. This time there isn't. Not even an add on that I can find. All I wanted to do today was get my email work done. Instead I spent it trying to restore the functionality that was taken away by the unnecessary update. I would go back to the previous version and never update again if that is possible and necessary. I have no Idea what the previous version number even was. I just want to get my email work done efficiently every day.

However, the ""Total Message Count"" shows all the emails in all the folders regardless if they were opened or not.

However, the way it was prior to 115 was better because that number showing up was a reminder that you have messages to send. With the messages marked as Read and the number not showing up the user may forget (like I do) that they have messages siting in the Outbox that need to be sent. I know I'm not the only one complaining about this, I read 2 other posts elsewhere where people gripe about the same thing. </p>",firefox1809,false,0,0
