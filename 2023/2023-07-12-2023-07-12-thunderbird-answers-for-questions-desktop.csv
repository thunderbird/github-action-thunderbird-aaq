Instalé thunderbird en otro PC y copié el perfil pero quedó igual, es decir sin mostrarme las cuentas de correo, solo me muestra las carpetas locales y no me deja enviar correos. Me da la idea de que hay un fail en alguna actualización ya sea de thunderbird o de exquilla, que es el complemento de pago que tengo instalado para operar con cuentas de microsoft 365, o también llamadas exchange, ya que thunderbird por sí solo no acepta esas cuentas. También puede ser que haya algún intento de hackeo, pero tal parece que no hay otros usuarios con el mismo problema que yo. </p>",coolblue7003,false,0,0
