Nothing with regard to historical API changes is going to change.  Add-ons are not supported on this forum as they are supported by their authors.  Clearly the author of your add-on ceased updating it.  Fundamentally it is no longer available.  That is ALL we can report to you. </p> <blockquote>  But really, is this thread really going to make me go through all the use-case justifications that I have posted here in the past? </blockquote> <p>Nope,  actually to request features is off topic in the support forum,  and you should have been pointed to the correct ways to request change rather than allowed to continue here.  There is nothing anyone in a peer user support forum such as this can do that you can not do yourself.  </p> <blockquote> All I have asked for was a simple replacement for the Select All plug-in. </blockquote> <p>And such a thing does not exist.  No amount of discussing or lamenting will change that.  I have given you the appropriate venues to request change.  This is not one of them. Sorry. </p> <blockquote> If that is (as it seems to be) beyond the capabilities of the current developers, why not say so, and we are can just move on. </blockquote> <p>As no one has asked them (the developers) it is rather difficult to determine what is possible.  I would think it would be fairly simple,  but just because I think that does not mean anyone of the paid developers will actually implement it.  First it will need to be requested. </p>  <blockquote> But all I see here is deflection and non-solutions.  Why? </blockquote> <p>You are asking in the wrong place of the wrong people might be a large part of your issue with getting what you think is acceptable service. You want the product changed to to include a button that has never been in the core product. This is simply the wrong place to request such a thing.   This is user support where folk try and explain how to do what you want without the button. The addon developer has seen fit to not release a version of that button in recent years. (It might not even be possible.  I am not an addon developer.) so from a support perspective the only option is a workaround. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,0

But they were wrong in that decision. There is a clone called betterbird that kept the toolbar under menu bar and defaults to unthreaded . That's an option if you don't care for the new direction. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I think we could choose where to put it in the old days and I certainly always had it under the folder tabs so it was the first thing next to your actual messages.  As the toolbar buttons are the tools you access most when reviewing your messages it seems most intuitive to have them closest.  I know in time I will get used to the new position and shape etc but in the meantime I keep trying to change folders when I go to the old delete button location.  Very irritating. </p>",fjaf,false,0,0
