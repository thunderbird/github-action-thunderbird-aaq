I can of course find and read any archived email by opening the Local Folder from within Thunderbird.

For instance, I want to copy the entire email archive onto a removable hard disk, so as to be able to consult it from other computers. </p><p>I can find Local Folders on my hard disk, and within that a folder called ""Archive.sbd"". That in turn gives access to documents called, for instance, ""emails.2021"" and ""emails.2021.msf"". The problem is that opening document ""emails.2021"" leads to an unusable mass of binary code.

I badly need help with Thunderbird, which has been acting very strangely for some days. To make things as clear as possible, let me first give the details of my setup. I am using an iMac running OS High Sierra. These are my Thunderbird account settings: </p><p>Server type: IMAP mail server User name:  mail@myaccount.com Server name: <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> Port: 993 Connection Security: SSL/TLS Authentication: Normal pw </p><p>Outgoing Server (SMTP): <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> - <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> User name: mail@myaccount.com Port: 465 Connection Security: SSL/TLA Authentication: Normal pw </p><p>The problem: Endless churning when I attempt to download emails, leading eventually to a “server timed out” error message. However, a further wrinkle: sometimes a few emails will come through anyway. When I try to send a message, more churning, then an error message saying “Sending of message failed. The message could not be sent because connecting to the Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> failed. The server may be unavailable or is refusing SMTP connections. Please verify settings and try again”. Sometimes, when I try again, I get a different error message: “Your draft message was not copied to your drafts folder due to network or file access errors”. </p><p>What is particularly confusing and distressing is the seemingly random and inexplicable nature of the problems, and the fact that until about ten days ago, Thunderbird worked fine. Any assistance would be very welcome. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1576484;,stathatos1
