I exchanged one email address with another on my service provider Spectrum. Now I'm not getting some of my service providers emails coming into thunderbird. I'm getting most of them but some are not getting through. I know to look for these by seeing that some emails show as unread (bold) but it looks on thunderbird that every one has been read. So I go to Spectrum and I find them there. I read them there and the bold comes off on Thunderbird. But the emails don't come through so I can only read them from the Spectrum website </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",RobinClaire
