Price alone is not the be all and end all. </p><p>IMAP is at best a glorified cache of what is on the server.  You change to a new server, it reports no mail and everything that exists is deleted via synchronization. </p><p>Why does it do this? Because it is at the very heart of the IMAP mail protocol.  The server is considered the canonical source of information about what exists. </p><p>Why do folk have issues?  Because they really do not know enough about the subject to know there might even be issues in the migration.  They would hire a mechanic to fix their car,  but undertake IT for some reason a do-it-yourself product.  Sometimes with a friends smart kid.  Rarely satisfactorily. </p><p>The mail you have inadvertent delete might still be on your old server setup.  I have no idea what decommissioning process would occur.  So reconnecting to the old server may simply bring it in.  (A much simpler process than trying to undelete mail from a local file.) </p><p>Thunderbird by default stores mail in mbox files in the local hard drive and these can be accessed with a text editor to mark the mail they contain as new rather than deleted,  but that is something of a desperation approach.  Chances of recovery are high if the folders have not been compacted and the defaults re storage remain in place.  However unless you are familiar with the file system and text editors the learning curve is reasonably difficult. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Occasionally a security update to windows can cause issues.  but that is limited to gross version numbers (windows 10, windows11) </p><p>Now the server ""error"" in my experience is usually related you outgoing servers.  So go down the list of accounts to outgoing servers (SMTP) and make sure any gmail accounts are actually identified with the appropriate related email address in their description.  It also makes ensuring the correct outgoing server is linked to the identity in the incoming server settings of each account.  With these large providers unilaterally changing some things like the senders name (<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>) to that specified on the server, having the correct outgoing enter is quite important. </p><p>Having said that each account must be unique.  So check the accounts you already have to make sure a broken version is not still configured. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It explain about where they are saved and how to edit what is saved.  BTW I really do not think bleeding edge development versions of the product are suitable to you.  You apparently expect explicit instructions and a development version is by default ""under construction""  You reference V114,  so I assume you are using a beta version which is now V115.  I suggest you right click on the toolbar and select the menu bar be visible.  Then you will not need to complain about missing or lost menu choices.  In recent years they have been the most stable interface of all, being largely unchanged since V2.   </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb</a> </p><p>Note that when you add an account the add process includes a save or remember password option which defaults to selected.  Whenever you are asked for an account password you are also prompted below in the dialog to use the password manager to save the password. </p><p>Thunderbird saves a separate password for incoming and outgoing.  Even if they are identical. </p><p>Many folk who appear on this site with password issues have installed a third party password manager (sometimes in an internet security suite, I think Norton for one had such a ""feature"" if I recall correctly) and that is the source of their frustration.  Not Thunderbird or their mail server/provider. </p><p>It is also a ""feature"" of many antivirus product or their firewall components to simply block new unknown versions of Thunderbird,  and here you are on a beta that updates often.  When that blocking occures you are prompted for a password. </p><p>Finally if Thunderbird fails to connect it pops up a connection failed error and asks for a password,  the assumption that that is the most common reason for a once working setup to suddenly fail.  But the existence of a request does not in itself mean there is a password issue at all, it means there is a connectivity issue. </p><p>So then we move on to oauth authentication which is used by most of the non ISP mail providers these days.  The initial authorization process uses a password known to you to authorize the access. The actual ongoing token used by Thunderbird to interact with the server is supplied via the internet to Thunderbird by the mail provider and is stored in the password manager.  You will see these in the password manager as oauth: in the beginning of the entry.  Authentication failures with oauth do not pop up a ""normal"" request for password prompt.  Instead starting a flow of web pages to authenticate permission for Thunderbird to access the account with the provider. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try: </p><p>Double-check your account settings: Ensure that the server settings for your Virgin Media email account in Thunderbird are correctly configured. Verify that the incoming server is set to ""<a href=""http://imap.virginmedia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.virginmedia.com</a>"" and the port is set to the appropriate value (usually 993 for SSL/TLS encryption). </p><p>Verify your internet connection: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection. You can try accessing other websites or services to confirm if your connection is working properly. </p><p>Disable any security software or firewall temporarily: Sometimes, security software or firewalls can interfere with the connection to email servers. Temporarily disabling them and then attempting to connect to the server again might resolve the issue. </p><p>Clear Thunderbird cache: Clearing the cache in Thunderbird can help refresh the connection settings. To do this, go to ""Options"" or ""Preferences"" in Thunderbird, find the ""Privacy &amp; Security"" or ""Advanced"" section, and look for the option to clear the cache. Once cleared, restart Thunderbird and try connecting to the server again. </p><p>If the above steps do not resolve the issue, please provide more details about any error messages or specific problems you encounter while trying to connect to the server.

Some people expect it should be Undo the last letter I typed; some think Undo last word I typed, Undo the last sentence or Undo parargraph.   </p><p>However, Undo it means undo everything back to last start point. The start point may be the start of the email if you kept typing and inputting in a ongoing forward manner. But if at any point you perform an edit of a section then a new start point has been effectively created. </p><p>If you type some text and then paste some text and then undo - it will undo everything because it is a contiguous input.  This is not new, it has been the same for so long I cannot recall it being any different. </p><p>Example: If you typed some text such as <strong>what gets undone</strong> and went to a new line and typed the word <strong>test</strong> (at this point all the text on both lines is part of the same block using undo now would remove all of it - so do not do it) then used 'back space' to edit thus removing the <strong>t</strong> so you have <strong>tes</strong>, this effectly means this is a new starting point as there has been an edit, now retype in the letter <strong>t</strong> and that becomes the new start point; now use Ctrl+Z to undo, you will find only the letter <strong>t</strong> gets removed. Use Ctrl+Z again and the t is reinserted as that was the previous edit section, Use 'Ctrl+Z' again and everything is removed as that was all part of the same contiguous editing block. </p><p>Note:  if you ever type a section and then want to preserve it - add a space and use backspace to clear the space or type a double full stop/period and then use backspace to clear one of full stops. This acts like an edit meaning if you then pasted in text and needed to undo, a Ctrl+Z would only undo back to last new starting point - the edit of the space/full stop so Undo in this case would only remove the pasted section. </p><p>This is a neat trick to remember - using the backspace as an edit to reset a start point. This is particulary useful for those who like to use Undo. </p><p>That's all well and good but what happens if by accident you used Undo and the whole lot disappears. Do this: 'Edit' &gt; 'Redo' (<strong>Ctrl+Y</strong>) will get it back. Using 'Ctrl+Y' Redo is used as a reverse of Undo 'Ctrl+Z' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
