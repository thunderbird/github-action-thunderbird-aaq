I am too out of the loop to be aware of a lot of newer industry practices. It may sound condescending,  but unfortunately I feel the trust of what I said was true.  Folk treat email as if it is simple,  and in reality like everything else, once you scratch the surface it is anything but simple. </p><p>You are not alone however.  Just look at the almost total absence of email migration tools offered by those web hosting services.  Few people are aware of their need a migration plan to include email. When they do get around to asking.  Often after the fact when they have already lost mails. The hosts offer some rather sad suggestions like moving mail from one account to another using Thunderbird and IMAP.  That technically works,  but usually ends in problems whee more than a few email are involved. </p><p>This site does appear to have details of the migration using file manager you should use.

Price alone is not the be all and end all. </p><p>IMAP is at best a glorified cache of what is on the server.  You change to a new server, it reports no mail and everything that exists is deleted via synchronization. </p><p>Why does it do this? Because it is at the very heart of the IMAP mail protocol.  The server is considered the canonical source of information about what exists. </p><p>Why do folk have issues?  Because they really do not know enough about the subject to know there might even be issues in the migration.  They would hire a mechanic to fix their car,  but undertake IT for some reason a do-it-yourself product.  Sometimes with a friends smart kid.  Rarely satisfactorily. </p><p>The mail you have inadvertent delete might still be on your old server setup.  I have no idea what decommissioning process would occur.  So reconnecting to the old server may simply bring it in.  (A much simpler process than trying to undelete mail from a local file.) </p><p>Thunderbird by default stores mail in mbox files in the local hard drive and these can be accessed with a text editor to mark the mail they contain as new rather than deleted,  but that is something of a desperation approach.  Chances of recovery are high if the folders have not been compacted and the defaults re storage remain in place.  However unless you are familiar with the file system and text editors the learning curve is reasonably difficult. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I decided to delete all my ISP email accounts and the smtp connection settings for them and add them back.  I was successful in getting 3 of 5 accounts added back, but I'm struggling with the last 2.  In TB I go to Account Settings &gt; Account Actions &gt; Add Mail Account...  to get to the data entry panels.  In the first set I enter the name, email address (complete with domain name) and password requested.  Before coming to TB I set my browser to my ISP's web pages for setting up and changing email passwords and set the PW there to the same value that I copied and pasted into the PW panel. </p><p>After clicking the Done button I got a response indicating confirmation.  I think - but don't know - that this step checked to verify the ISP domain was valid and maybe even that an account exists there.  After this confirmation, I chose the POP3 protocol for mail handling for the account and chose to configure manually.  My ISP uses port 110 for incoming POP3 mail and 'none' for connection security and port 587 for outgoing SMTP mail with connection security also set to none.  These settings worked  for the 3 accounts that I successfully deleted and added back in TB. </p><p>For the 2 accounts in question, my last response after it checks the password is per screenshot.

Unfortunately in the last 20 years the public consciousness has largely turned ""the internet"" and ""the web"" part of the internet into interchangeable terms.  If you are not familiar with ports,  it may be helpful to consider them in terms of lanes on a highway.  You can access lane 443,   but that does not mean you can get stuff to the same destination even using lave 993 </p><p>Things like VPN's, software firewalls and in some cases other installed software all can interrupt data on specific ports,  either intentionally your thorough accident.  Some VPN's simply do not support anything but the World Wide Web.  Software firewalls are particularly suspect as most rely on recognizing the software making the call to the port.  Hardly helpful if the software is a new version.  For instance you mention Thunderbird as version 102.12.0.  The point part (12) will last about 4 weeks usually.  The next component which you report a 0 can be updated any time in that 4 weeks if there is some sort of emergency release required.  So at best these software firewalls go out of date about every 4 weeks and most rely on phoning home to learn of new releases. </p><p>Hardware firewalls on say routers do not interest themselves in the source application.  They simply allow or block data on a port number, or block and allow certain <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram"" rel=""nofollow"">datagrams </a>on the port using packet inspection.  Historically there was a US ISP that released new modems to their customers that blocked their own mail ports.  It was a mess and went on for longer than it should have because the majority of mail is now transacted on webmail,  not mail clients. So even these can cause issues. </p><p>Roboform is not something I am familiar with,  but in the past the Norton ""vault"" caused issues with auto filling old passwords.

I am running 102.12.0 64-bit on Windows 10 22H2. I should have checked it more carefully.  I never run beta versions or those under development knowingly.  </p><p>The article link was helpful because I was unaware that right clicking a displayed connection would allow me to edit the data.  Likewise the information about oauth token gives me more to consider.  Thanks.   </p><p>I do not see a ""flow of web pages"" related to TB permission to access the ISP mail client but rather see only the message shown in the screen shot.  Providing the known-to-be-at-my-ISP mail account password in response only returns the same message.  The message appears periodically, based on a time interval (I think) and is presented for each of my ISP email addresses regardless of anything I initiate in TB. </p><p>I do use a password manager, Roboform.  If it provides a password without me being aware of it, that is news to me.  That's another avenue to investigate. </p><p>I had not suspected a connectivity issue because I can send and receive Gmail and browse the web successfully, although I have experienced some response delays.  My wife has experienced the same using her iPad and iOS facilities without TB.  I left this area unexplored because I thought the issue to be related to 100+ degree temperatures in our area for the last couple of weeks.  I will explore this further. </p><p>Finally, can you respond to my recovery strategy of resetting passwords in both TB and at my ISP?  Is this plan realistic?  Is there a better strategy?

It explain about where they are saved and how to edit what is saved.  BTW I really do not think bleeding edge development versions of the product are suitable to you.  You apparently expect explicit instructions and a development version is by default ""under construction""  You reference V114,  so I assume you are using a beta version which is now V115.  I suggest you right click on the toolbar and select the menu bar be visible.  Then you will not need to complain about missing or lost menu choices.  In recent years they have been the most stable interface of all, being largely unchanged since V2.   </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-tb</a> </p><p>Note that when you add an account the add process includes a save or remember password option which defaults to selected.  Whenever you are asked for an account password you are also prompted below in the dialog to use the password manager to save the password. </p><p>Thunderbird saves a separate password for incoming and outgoing.  Even if they are identical. </p><p>Many folk who appear on this site with password issues have installed a third party password manager (sometimes in an internet security suite, I think Norton for one had such a ""feature"" if I recall correctly) and that is the source of their frustration.  Not Thunderbird or their mail server/provider. </p><p>It is also a ""feature"" of many antivirus product or their firewall components to simply block new unknown versions of Thunderbird,  and here you are on a beta that updates often.  When that blocking occures you are prompted for a password. </p><p>Finally if Thunderbird fails to connect it pops up a connection failed error and asks for a password,  the assumption that that is the most common reason for a once working setup to suddenly fail.  But the existence of a request does not in itself mean there is a password issue at all, it means there is a connectivity issue. </p><p>So then we move on to oauth authentication which is used by most of the non ISP mail providers these days.  The initial authorization process uses a password known to you to authorize the access. The actual ongoing token used by Thunderbird to interact with the server is supplied via the internet to Thunderbird by the mail provider and is stored in the password manager.  You will see these in the password manager as oauth: in the beginning of the entry.  Authentication failures with oauth do not pop up a ""normal"" request for password prompt.  Instead starting a flow of web pages to authenticate permission for Thunderbird to access the account with the provider. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

From what you've described, it seems that some of your due events are being removed or hidden in Thunderbird, even though they are present in your CalDAV server and mobile devices. </p><p>To troubleshoot this issue, I would recommend trying the following steps: </p><p>Check Thunderbird's calendar settings: Go to Thunderbird's Options or Preferences menu and navigate to the Calendar section. Make sure that all calendars are enabled and properly synced with your CalDAV server. </p><p>Verify event dismissal settings: Thunderbird allows you to dismiss events, which may hide them from view. Check if you have any settings enabled that automatically dismiss events after a certain period of time. Adjust these settings if necessary. </p><p>Review Thunderbird's filter options: Thunderbird provides filtering options that allow you to customize the display of events. Make sure that you haven't accidentally applied any filters that could be hiding certain events. </p><p>If none of these steps resolve the issue, I would recommend posting your question on the Thunderbird Support Forum. There, other Thunderbird users and volunteers can provide further assistance and help troubleshoot the problem. </p><p>Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist you. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

I get your point about different expectations about ""Undo"".  </p><p>Actually everything would be fine for me, if the 'Redo' would work as you describe, yet in case of normal paste from MS Word it simply does not work in my case - the pasted text with the entire section back to the last edit point will disappear and cannot be restored. The 'Redo' (CTRL+Z), even if activated repeatedly, has no effect anymore. So the solutions you propose unfortunately do not work in this particular case. </p><p>Only if I paste text from Word as ""paste without formatting"", the 'Redo' behaves normally - as you describe it. I checked inserting from browser or email, and it also works normally. Could this be then a Word-related bug?  </p><p>Best regards, </p>",vishap,false,0,0

Some people expect it should be Undo the last letter I typed; some think Undo last word I typed, Undo the last sentence or Undo parargraph.   </p><p>However, Undo it means undo everything back to last start point. The start point may be the start of the email if you kept typing and inputting in a ongoing forward manner. But if at any point you perform an edit of a section then a new start point has been effectively created. </p><p>If you type some text and then paste some text and then undo - it will undo everything because it is a contiguous input.  This is not new, it has been the same for so long I cannot recall it being any different. </p><p>Example: If you typed some text such as <strong>what gets undone</strong> and went to a new line and typed the word <strong>test</strong> (at this point all the text on both lines is part of the same block using undo now would remove all of it - so do not do it) then used 'back space' to edit thus removing the <strong>t</strong> so you have <strong>tes</strong>, this effectly means this is a new starting point as there has been an edit, now retype in the letter <strong>t</strong> and that becomes the new start point; now use Ctrl+Z to undo, you will find only the letter <strong>t</strong> gets removed. Use Ctrl+Z again and the t is reinserted as that was the previous edit section, Use 'Ctrl+Z' again and everything is removed as that was all part of the same contiguous editing block. </p><p>Note:  if you ever type a section and then want to preserve it - add a space and use backspace to clear the space or type a double full stop/period and then use backspace to clear one of full stops. This acts like an edit meaning if you then pasted in text and needed to undo, a Ctrl+Z would only undo back to last new starting point - the edit of the space/full stop so Undo in this case would only remove the pasted section. </p><p>This is a neat trick to remember - using the backspace as an edit to reset a start point. This is particulary useful for those who like to use Undo. </p><p>That's all well and good but what happens if by accident you used Undo and the whole lot disappears. Do this: 'Edit' &gt; 'Redo' (<strong>Ctrl+Y</strong>) will get it back. Using 'Ctrl+Y' Redo is used as a reverse of Undo 'Ctrl+Z' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
