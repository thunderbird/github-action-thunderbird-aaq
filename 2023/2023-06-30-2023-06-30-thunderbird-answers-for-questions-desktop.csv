Make sure that all calendars are enabled and properly synced with your CalDAV server. </p><p>Verify event dismissal settings: Thunderbird allows you to dismiss events, which may hide them from view. Check if you have any settings enabled that automatically dismiss events after a certain period of time. Adjust these settings if necessary. </p><p>Review Thunderbird's filter options: Thunderbird provides filtering options that allow you to customize the display of events. Make sure that you haven't accidentally applied any filters that could be hiding certain events. </p><p>If none of these steps resolve the issue, I would recommend posting your question on the Thunderbird Support Forum.

Are there any plans in that direction? Thanks. </blockquote> <p>Let's be very clear - scammers can and do use bogus email addresses or abuse other peoples email addresses so the 'sender' may not necessarilly be the real sender. You cannot rely on it. Just because it says the sender/from email address it does not mean it is the real sender. </p><p>Obviously that is not the same as Junk mail. Junk mail may be perfectly geniune marketing emails sent by geniune businesses which may be of interest or not. They will have a real sender email address, but sometimes if might be a no-reply address.  Such as this email. Comments posted will be sent as emails to those following this question. It is genuine but it is a 'no-reply' type of email. </p><p>The full headers or information viewed in 'View Source' of an email will offer a lot of information. This means Thunderbird has always made all the available information available to the user.  You could check origin of IP address. </p><p>But the bottom line is use your common sense and do not let curiosity get the better of you because scammers are banking on it. </p> <ul><li> Do not allow remote content to be auto displayed. </li><li> Advise you only switch on 'Display attachments inline' when you are certain of their origin and switch it off again afterwards. </li><li> Do not click on any links until you have verified the links really do open on correct and expected website. Check it first - Hover over link to see link info displayed in Status Bar. </li><li> If it says something like click here to logon to bank and when you hover over it the link info says <a href=""http:youhavebeenconnedbank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http:youhavebeenconnedbank.com</a> then I would assume it is dodgy.  </li><li> Do not open any attachment just to find out what it contains. I've had plenty of bogus emails claiming I've made a purchase see invoice attached or similar. You do not need to open an attachment when you know it is a fake.  Just delete the email. </li><li> Be wary of all emails even from people you know - why - because scammers may be abusing their email address. So if that email content does not read like that email is from your parents or best friend then it may not be. </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird is already very safe providing you operate your email safely follwoing those basic rules and seeing a 'sender' or 'from' email address does not mean the sender entered their real email address. Do not rely on it. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,18

What you see in the 'FROM' column header in Thread Pane depends upon whether the sender included a display name or not and whether you have chosen Settings to alternatively use the set display name for contact in the address book or not which would override whatever is displayed in From column and in the headers displayed in an opened email. </p><p>As I've been helping on this forum for quite a while, I've accumulated a lot of images showing various versions going way back to 2012. I can tell you they do not show email address in 'From' column header if sender included a display name with email address when sending. That's why the author created the 'full address column' addon in the first place.  Addons are not created if the functionality is already available.  There are occasions when functionality gets added and the addon is no longer required. At this point you usually discover the addon does not get maintained for future versions. </p><p>Mind you there is a sort of workaround which has always been available via using the current system. So you could try it. It's not perfect because it relies upon you adding it to an address book first, but it would then reveal email address for any further unwanted emails from that sender. IF you created a new address book for received junkspam email addresses and deliberately entered the contact 'display name' as the junk 'email address' and then instructed settings to use that contact 'display' name - you will see email address in 'From' column should they send another email regardless of whatever the sender enters as a display name. </p><p><br> re&nbsp;: I currently have version 115.0.1  It would seem you have chosen to download and install 115* For those still using 102* - if Thunderbird is in control of the updates then those people will still be using  102* and the current one is 102.14.0 </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,3

But please remember you are seeing what the sender put in as the sending email address and it may not be the real email address.  I find reading the content will instantly tell me if email is junk/spam or scammer created.  If email address is a friends email address and the content does not read like normal from that person then it is likely to be a scam.  If email wants you to click on a link which is clearly a bogus link and email is from unknown person or business  which you did not initiate communicating with then do not click on it - delete email. If email contains attachments and you know you do not know person or you did not purchase anything or email is threatening in some way - ignore it and delete email. </p><p>I've had plenty of bogus/spam/scammer emails and some threatening in nature, but if I had relied on the FROM email address I would have said they were ok.  If you want to see it then it is available via various means including via addon. But I see no advantage as a real con person will not reveal the true sender email address anyway.  </p><p>If people are concerned and do not use the addon, please do one of the following. Select the email so it displays in Message Pane. Yes, email has been opened, but if all remote content is disabled and you do not start clicking on anything then it is totally safe. This means you can see 'full headers' if you switch it on OR you clickon 'More' and select 'View Source' to see all header info.

The 'View' &gt; 'Message Source' has always been available to check out the source code of any email.

Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try: </p><p>Double-check your account settings: Ensure that the server settings for your Virgin Media email account in Thunderbird are correctly configured. Verify that the incoming server is set to ""<a href=""http://imap.virginmedia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.virginmedia.com</a>"" and the port is set to the appropriate value (usually 993 for SSL/TLS encryption). </p><p>Verify your internet connection: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection. You can try accessing other websites or services to confirm if your connection is working properly. </p><p>Disable any security software or firewall temporarily: Sometimes, security software or firewalls can interfere with the connection to email servers. Temporarily disabling them and then attempting to connect to the server again might resolve the issue. </p><p>Clear Thunderbird cache: Clearing the cache in Thunderbird can help refresh the connection settings. To do this, go to ""Options"" or ""Preferences"" in Thunderbird, find the ""Privacy &amp; Security"" or ""Advanced"" section, and look for the option to clear the cache. Once cleared, restart Thunderbird and try connecting to the server again. </p><p>If the above steps do not resolve the issue, please provide more details about any error messages or specific problems you encounter while trying to connect to the server. This will help me further assist you in finding a solution. </p>",suram080,false,2,0

Whenever you are asked for an account password you are also prompted below in the dialog to use the password manager to save the password. </p><p>Thunderbird saves a separate password for incoming and outgoing.  Even if they are identical. </p><p>Many folk who appear on this site with password issues have installed a third party password manager (sometimes in an internet security suite, I think Norton for one had such a ""feature"" if I recall correctly) and that is the source of their frustration.  Not Thunderbird or their mail server/provider. </p><p>It is also a ""feature"" of many antivirus product or their firewall components to simply block new unknown versions of Thunderbird,  and here you are on a beta that updates often.  When that blocking occures you are prompted for a password. </p><p>Finally if Thunderbird fails to connect it pops up a connection failed error and asks for a password,  the assumption that that is the most common reason for a once working setup to suddenly fail.  But the existence of a request does not in itself mean there is a password issue at all, it means there is a connectivity issue. </p><p>So then we move on to oauth authentication which is used by most of the non ISP mail providers these days.  The initial authorization process uses a password known to you to authorize the access. The actual ongoing token used by Thunderbird to interact with the server is supplied via the internet to Thunderbird by the mail provider and is stored in the password manager.  You will see these in the password manager as oauth: in the beginning of the entry.  Authentication failures with oauth do not pop up a ""normal"" request for password prompt.  Instead starting a flow of web pages to authenticate permission for Thunderbird to access the account with the provider. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Providing the known-to-be-at-my-ISP mail account password in response only returns the same message.  The message appears periodically, based on a time interval (I think) and is presented for each of my ISP email addresses regardless of anything I initiate in TB. </p><p>I do use a password manager, Roboform.  If it provides a password without me being aware of it, that is news to me.  That's another avenue to investigate. </p><p>I had not suspected a connectivity issue because I can send and receive Gmail and browse the web successfully, although I have experienced some response delays.  My wife has experienced the same using her iPad and iOS facilities without TB.  I left this area unexplored because I thought the issue to be related to 100+ degree temperatures in our area for the last couple of weeks.  I will explore this further. </p><p>Finally, can you respond to my recovery strategy of resetting passwords in both TB and at my ISP?  Is this plan realistic?  Is there a better strategy?

Unfortunately in the last 20 years the public consciousness has largely turned ""the internet"" and ""the web"" part of the internet into interchangeable terms.  If you are not familiar with ports,  it may be helpful to consider them in terms of lanes on a highway.  You can access lane 443,   but that does not mean you can get stuff to the same destination even using lave 993 </p><p>Things like VPN's, software firewalls and in some cases other installed software all can interrupt data on specific ports,  either intentionally your thorough accident.  Some VPN's simply do not support anything but the World Wide Web.  Software firewalls are particularly suspect as most rely on recognizing the software making the call to the port.  Hardly helpful if the software is a new version.  For instance you mention Thunderbird as version 102.12.0.  The point part (12) will last about 4 weeks usually.  The next component which you report a 0 can be updated any time in that 4 weeks if there is some sort of emergency release required.  So at best these software firewalls go out of date about every 4 weeks and most rely on phoning home to learn of new releases. </p><p>Hardware firewalls on say routers do not interest themselves in the source application.  They simply allow or block data on a port number, or block and allow certain <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram"" rel=""nofollow"">datagrams </a>on the port using packet inspection.  Historically there was a US ISP that released new modems to their customers that blocked their own mail ports.  It was a mess and went on for longer than it should have because the majority of mail is now transacted on webmail,  not mail clients.

So go down the list of accounts to outgoing servers (SMTP) and make sure any gmail accounts are actually identified with the appropriate related email address in their description.  It also makes ensuring the correct outgoing server is linked to the identity in the incoming server settings of each account.  With these large providers unilaterally changing some things like the senders name (<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>) to that specified on the server, having the correct outgoing enter is quite important. </p><p>Having said that each account must be unique.

I decided to delete all my ISP email accounts and the smtp connection settings for them and add them back.  I was successful in getting 3 of 5 accounts added back, but I'm struggling with the last 2.  In TB I go to Account Settings &gt; Account Actions &gt; Add Mail Account...  to get to the data entry panels.  In the first set I enter the name, email address (complete with domain name) and password requested.  Before coming to TB I set my browser to my ISP's web pages for setting up and changing email passwords and set the PW there to the same value that I copied and pasted into the PW panel. </p><p>After clicking the Done button I got a response indicating confirmation.  I think - but don't know - that this step checked to verify the ISP domain was valid and maybe even that an account exists there.  After this confirmation, I chose the POP3 protocol for mail handling for the account and chose to configure manually.  My ISP uses port 110 for incoming POP3 mail and 'none' for connection security and port 587 for outgoing SMTP mail with connection security also set to none.  These settings worked  for the 3 accounts that I successfully deleted and added back in TB. </p><p>For the 2 accounts in question, my last response after it checks the password is per screenshot.  I can't understand why it works for 3 accounts but not for the last 2.

Price alone is not the be all and end all. </p><p>IMAP is at best a glorified cache of what is on the server.  You change to a new server, it reports no mail and everything that exists is deleted via synchronization. </p><p>Why does it do this? Because it is at the very heart of the IMAP mail protocol.  The server is considered the canonical source of information about what exists. </p><p>Why do folk have issues?  Because they really do not know enough about the subject to know there might even be issues in the migration.  They would hire a mechanic to fix their car,  but undertake IT for some reason a do-it-yourself product.  Sometimes with a friends smart kid.  Rarely satisfactorily. </p><p>The mail you have inadvertent delete might still be on your old server setup.  I have no idea what decommissioning process would occur.  So reconnecting to the old server may simply bring it in.  (A much simpler process than trying to undelete mail from a local file.) </p><p>Thunderbird by default stores mail in mbox files in the local hard drive and these can be accessed with a text editor to mark the mail they contain as new rather than deleted,  but that is something of a desperation approach.  Chances of recovery are high if the folders have not been compacted and the defaults re storage remain in place.  However unless you are familiar with the file system and text editors the learning curve is reasonably difficult. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I am too out of the loop to be aware of a lot of newer industry practices. It may sound condescending,  but unfortunately I feel the trust of what I said was true.  Folk treat email as if it is simple,  and in reality like everything else, once you scratch the surface it is anything but simple. </p><p>You are not alone however.  Just look at the almost total absence of email migration tools offered by those web hosting services.  Few people are aware of their need a migration plan to include email. When they do get around to asking.  Often after the fact when they have already lost mails. The hosts offer some rather sad suggestions like moving mail from one account to another using Thunderbird and IMAP.  That technically works,  but usually ends in problems whee more than a few email are involved. </p><p>This site does appear to have details of the migration using file manager you should use.
