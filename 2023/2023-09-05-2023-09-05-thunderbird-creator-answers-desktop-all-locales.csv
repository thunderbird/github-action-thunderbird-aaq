I started using Outlook in 2022, and in June 2023, I had a problem with my laptop and decided to reinstall Windows, and back up my .pst file. Later, in late August 2023, I decided to Install Thunderbird. I forgot to move my backup .pst in the Outlook files folder, so I only have my email from June 2023 on Outlook and later transferred to Thunderbird automatically. Now I successfully combine my old .pst with my newer .pst, but I can't import my email from Outlook, not even with import tools. When I tried to import, it always shows 0%, even after I wait for hours (1-2 hours). Can someone help me/give me a guide on how to import my .pst? For your information, if needed, my .pst size is 15GB. Thanks in advance. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",dzakyzamzam
