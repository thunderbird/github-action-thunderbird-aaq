I have composition settings set to allow HTML as needed. I seek to add inline (not attached) photos, as well as to change some composed text to bold or italic. There are no such options within my TB menu, despite my having read many, many suggestions within the community forum that such are available. Ideally, I would see options such as are described here: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-91#w_new-user-interface-for-adding-attachments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-91#w_new-user-interface-for-adding-attachments</a> </p><p>and immediately scrolled down from there, which speaks of a font menu. When I drag an image to TB's composition, I receive only an attachment option--one rectangle--not two rectangles of options. And there is no means to bold or italic a word. Please advise. </p><p>Many thanks! </p><p>Tony </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ajgarcia2

Junk and Trash can be deleted in their respective Unified Folders by doing a CTRL+A and the Delete key, but it makes me a bit nervous as this action could inadvertently be applied to the Unified Inbox or Sent folders as well.  But a right-click and selection of Empty Folder at least makes one stop and think.
