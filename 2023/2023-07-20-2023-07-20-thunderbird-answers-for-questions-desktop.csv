I have the address books and lists in the left pane, the names in the next pane to the right and then the compose pane. i can select individual names and drop/drag them into an list on the left. I can hold down shift and drag contiguous names into a list, but i can only select one name when holding down the command key. I cannot select multiple non-contiguous names to add to a list. F9 doesnt seem to have any effect. Thanks for the .sqlite tip. i thought i was going nuts not able to find abooks.mab. </p>",tallenvt,false,0,0

You'd have thought the new setup would've checked for that before setting up brand new accounts, but it didn't. There will need to be many improvements in this if you expect people to willingly upgrade. As it is now, they're going to run screaming and never try it again. I'm not trying to be nasty here, just pointing out what people will do: this needs work. I can't comment over the rest of the interface since I've not seen it yet. </p>",deeholtsclaw,false,0,0

I gave it 15 minutes, then clicked the button whereupon Windows 11 claimed to collect information for a bug report. After rebooting, the Beta copy was nowhere to be found and the icon launched the regular version. </p><p>I have a lot of saved emails dating back over two decades. The current copy has 5 email accounts, 4 of which are no longer used but saved for history. That was imported from KMail on Linux. And a few years ago I migrated it from my Ubuntu machine to my Windows 10 gaming machine that has since been updated to Windows 11. At first I thought it was just sorting through a lot of stuff even though the import didn't take all that long, but if it really takes 15 minutes to load from my NVMe drive, that's a problem. </p>",deeholtsclaw,false,0,0
