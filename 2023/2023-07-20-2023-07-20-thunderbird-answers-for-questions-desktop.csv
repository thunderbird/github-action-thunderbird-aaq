Discovering replacement CSS with the new environment will be a matter of individual experimentation. SO, what that means is that some of the CSS tweaks that we have used may not be available in the near future, if at all. CSS is no specialty of mine so I also am waiting to see what new CSS becomes available. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
