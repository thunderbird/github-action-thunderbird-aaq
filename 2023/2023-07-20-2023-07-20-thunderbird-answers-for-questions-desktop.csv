I even went to the trouble of quoting your use of drop box in the reply.  I would hardly be trying to tell you the current release version was not supported. </p><p>Thunderbird struggles to function without serious issue on a local NAS or a network drive (network saturation), without the added overhead of syncing.  Total corruption of the profile is the most likely long term result of using cloud services as they are an order of magnitude slower that local network resources.   </p><p>Use of streamed backups on the Thunderbird profile is also not supported as Thunderbird just does not have the modern file locking and caching abilities to cope with any other software messing in it's profile while it is running.  Likewise you will find this forum full of suggestions to folk to disable on access scanning in internet security suites/Antivirus programs to prevent issues with data integrity. </p><p>The issue you are currently seeing will be the surface of an iceberg of data corruption, duplication and other, til now, hidden issues.  I have seen these smart synced profiles make multiple copies of the storage files (Often copies that are never referenced again)  Search the web of those folk with hundreds of prefs.js files complaining that Thunderbird does not save their changes.  Or those complaining that they have issues with the same mail being downloaded over and over (pop accounts) or even those that appear to have lost the mail in a folder because it is corrupted. </p><p>It used to be that antivirus programs were the greatest source of data corruption.  Personally I am thinking that the cottage industry in synced profiles is fast catching up.  Thunderbird sync can not come soon enough,  but like profile import it will probably be unable to sync password, making it largely useless. </p><p>You might want to have a look at how many redundant pref.js files you have in your profile.  My guess is many,  each with a number to make it unique, created when your sync created a contention issue.  The copies are never referenced because Thunderbird is hard coded to use only the prefs.js file, but the data is saved. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Please excuse us types who only use forums in desperation and don't always get the shorthand! </p><p>From my understanding now, I think this boils down to TB not being happy with using any location for the profile other than the standard location on, what is for me, my system drive of C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird. Even though there is a post on the KB <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Moving_your_profile_folder_-_Thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.mozillazine.org/Moving_your_profile_folder_-_Thunderbird</a> that seems to indicate this - maybe I have read this wrong as well! And just to spell it out for my brain, it is because of the time lag of reading and writing to a different drive. Like lots of people, I keep my data separate from my system and in my case all in Dropbox, so I wanted to do the same for my email folders - to have a synced back up in case of HDD failure. I will have to plan a new way of backing up and revert to the original location for the profile. Maybe even looking at a different email system.

Ha több levélre van szükség, mert ez pl. egy hírlevél, akkor érdemes valamilyen erre szakosodott szolgáltatást igénybe venni, mert a legtöbb szolgáltató nem engedélyezi a tömeges levélküldést, mert hamar tiltólistán találhatja magát az ember. </p><p>Egy alternatív lehetőség a következő kiegészítő használata: <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mail-merge/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mail-merge/</a> Ezzel pl. fájlban tárolt listából is lehet testreszabott e-maileket készíteni, plusz megoldható az is, hogy ne egy időben menjen ki az összes levél, így betarthatók a szolgáltató adott időszakra vonatkozó levélküldési korlátozásai. </p><p>Üdv, Balázs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0

""I don't know how you managed to get something about a web service out of my response."" </p><p>If it's looping back to the local machine on port 80/443 then it's looking for a web service.  If Thunderbird isn't therefore using a web service, how does it expect this response?  Either way, this is not functional design which is why it doesn't work.  No other piece of software has this issue with Google auth.  The app should be communicating with Google, and any browser handoff should be cleanly handled with the app and not trying to pass through localhost over http/https where other services could respond to the generic request.  Indeed, this is insecure design that basically begs for hijacking. </p><p>Given your response attitude however, it's pretty clear that Mozilla doesn't really have an interest in usage or feedback, leaving this a dead product.
