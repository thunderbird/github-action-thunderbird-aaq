There are many changes. Part of this frustration we share is that we are experiencing a new version, one with much new code (which was part of the goal), so I believe there will be continual refinements. There is no good answer ever for 'Why?, as the response may well be ""because it doesn't do that (yet).' On setting all accounts to a predefined setting, that feature has never been available, as this is account-specific. All I can suggest is to work with what is there and anticipate refinements as it goes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Ha több levélre van szükség, mert ez pl. egy hírlevél, akkor érdemes valamilyen erre szakosodott szolgáltatást igénybe venni, mert a legtöbb szolgáltató nem engedélyezi a tömeges levélküldést, mert hamar tiltólistán találhatja magát az ember. </p><p>Egy alternatív lehetőség a következő kiegészítő használata: <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mail-merge/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mail-merge/</a> Ezzel pl. fájlban tárolt listából is lehet testreszabott e-maileket készíteni, plusz megoldható az is, hogy ne egy időben menjen ki az összes levél, így betarthatók a szolgáltató adott időszakra vonatkozó levélküldési korlátozásai. </p><p>Üdv, Balázs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0

It's worked and I'm up and running.   </p><p>I did have a complication in that the newest version of TB is not yet compatible with a crucial Add-on for me, but I was able to uninstall everything and install the same version as I'm currently using on my old machine.  I went back through the steps, which included deleting the material from the new machine that I had copied over, because once the newest version had installed, the profiles were no longer compatible to go backward to the version I wanted to return to.  I had to do this in the past and it was very complicated, but having a copy on my external HD made it simple to start over with the good files from the old machine.

Please excuse us types who only use forums in desperation and don't always get the shorthand! </p><p>From my understanding now, I think this boils down to TB not being happy with using any location for the profile other than the standard location on, what is for me, my system drive of C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird. Even though there is a post on the KB <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Moving_your_profile_folder_-_Thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.mozillazine.org/Moving_your_profile_folder_-_Thunderbird</a> that seems to indicate this - maybe I have read this wrong as well! And just to spell it out for my brain, it is because of the time lag of reading and writing to a different drive. Like lots of people, I keep my data separate from my system and in my case all in Dropbox, so I wanted to do the same for my email folders - to have a synced back up in case of HDD failure. I will have to plan a new way of backing up and revert to the original location for the profile. Maybe even looking at a different email system.

I even went to the trouble of quoting your use of drop box in the reply.  I would hardly be trying to tell you the current release version was not supported. </p><p>Thunderbird struggles to function without serious issue on a local NAS or a network drive (network saturation), without the added overhead of syncing.  Total corruption of the profile is the most likely long term result of using cloud services as they are an order of magnitude slower that local network resources.   </p><p>Use of streamed backups on the Thunderbird profile is also not supported as Thunderbird just does not have the modern file locking and caching abilities to cope with any other software messing in it's profile while it is running.  Likewise you will find this forum full of suggestions to folk to disable on access scanning in internet security suites/Antivirus programs to prevent issues with data integrity. </p><p>The issue you are currently seeing will be the surface of an iceberg of data corruption, duplication and other, til now, hidden issues.  I have seen these smart synced profiles make multiple copies of the storage files (Often copies that are never referenced again)  Search the web of those folk with hundreds of prefs.js files complaining that Thunderbird does not save their changes.  Or those complaining that they have issues with the same mail being downloaded over and over (pop accounts) or even those that appear to have lost the mail in a folder because it is corrupted. </p><p>It used to be that antivirus programs were the greatest source of data corruption.  Personally I am thinking that the cottage industry in synced profiles is fast catching up.  Thunderbird sync can not come soon enough,  but like profile import it will probably be unable to sync password, making it largely useless. </p><p>You might want to have a look at how many redundant pref.js files you have in your profile.  My guess is many,  each with a number to make it unique, created when your sync created a contention issue.  The copies are never referenced because Thunderbird is hard coded to use only the prefs.js file, but the data is saved. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Users are not magicians to discover what works or not. </blockquote> <p>Perhaps,  but it has been 20 years since I saw a real comprehensive manual for any software. </p><p>The issues here are manifold,  and perhaps not helped by David's understanding that sound just does not work with IMAP. </p><p>The wav files generally work,  but Thunderbird has historically been quite picky as to what does and does not actually play.  I never really got to terms with the issues,  but setting the wav file in the account setting and clicking play makes the issues there clearer.  If the sound file plays there,  then it will work with Thunderbird wwhen it get new mail.  If it does not play at that point,  please prompt again and I will go off looking for exactly what the specifications are,  but I think it is something about bit rates and the file being stereo. </p><p>Then we have the issues with when to play the sound file.  Modern IMAP severs support a feature called IDLE.  This has a sub option for push email.  You will find this setting in the server setting as ""allow immediate notifications when new messages arrive.""  This means that mail is immediately forwarded to your mail client when it is received via the IMAP sync process, I am not completely au fait with the IDLE push notifications, but they do only occur for some folders in most implementations, hence the continuing need for timed checks.   </p><p>Use of Idle is distinct from the timed 10 or 15 minute checks for new mail in the settings line above it and like POP this is the time when new mail sounds apply as the delivery mechanism alerts Thunderbird that there is new mail. So I guess the IMAP sounds will be broken if you allow IDLE,  but your mail will arrive slower if you disable it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
