At some point there is no space left in my PC and I have to remove thunderbird and re-configure it from the start.  For instance, now it's 43.3 GB large (it can go up to &gt; 150 GB), but the inbox and outbox folders are ca. 14 GB (checked from 'Folder properties' inside Thunderbird). It is apparent that there is something wrong and I am tired of this situation.  Could you help me&nbsp;? Thank you  Lorenzo </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lorenzo.biancalana89

There is a way to do it? And if not, please consider to give it as soon as possible. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",web89

Have tried compacting, deleting, etc. Nothing works.  I get no error messages - instead there is a black dot that swims from side to side next to the ""inbox"" tab at the top of the icons.
