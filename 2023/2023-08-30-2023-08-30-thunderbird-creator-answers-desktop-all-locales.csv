Is this possible? </p><p>While researching the above issue, I saw an article that talked about the option to have the full emails downloaded or only stubs (everything but the email body from what I can gather).  While consuming more local space and taking longer to download, the full download would mean local backup captures the full email and also email can be reviewed even if the internet connection is down.

Two months ago we migrated from Aruba, an Italian mail provider, to Gmail. Now I have a new PC and I downloaded the latest version of Thunderbird. I don't know why, but the automatic settings of Thunderbird is still showing me the old Aruba servers and not the ones of GMail. I called Google Workspaces assistance and they said it's ok from their side, my GMail account is set up correctly. If I try to setup the account manually, the message I receive is that Thunderbird cannot connect to GMail. Who is telling Thunderbird that until two months ago my provider was Aruba?
