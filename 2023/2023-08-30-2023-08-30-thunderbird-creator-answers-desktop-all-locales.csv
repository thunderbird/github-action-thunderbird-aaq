Two months ago we migrated from Aruba, an Italian mail provider, to Gmail. Now I have a new PC and I downloaded the latest version of Thunderbird. I don't know why, but the automatic settings of Thunderbird is still showing me the old Aruba servers and not the ones of GMail. I called Google Workspaces assistance and they said it's ok from their side, my GMail account is set up correctly. If I try to setup the account manually, the message I receive is that Thunderbird cannot connect to GMail. Who is telling Thunderbird that until two months ago my provider was Aruba? PC and app are brand new...  I attach three screensghots Thank you for your help! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rmarchesi2003

With the new version however, when one navigates between subscriptions, the indicator is removed. </p><p>Is it possible to get the old behaviour back or have this configurable at all? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",andponlin
