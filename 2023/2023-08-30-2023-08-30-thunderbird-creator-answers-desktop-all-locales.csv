Recentemente hanno aggiornato il programma alla versione 115.1.1 (64 bit). Dopo l'aggiornamento la funzione ""Mostra messaggi nella conversazione"" (tasto Conversazione, vedi immagine allegata) non funziona più correttamente. Online ho trovato solo articoli riguardanti la funzione Discussione (threads) erroneamente confusa con la funzione Conversazione. Purtroppo non ho riscontrato un comportamento univoco: con alcune conversazioni funziona, con altre funziona solo parzialmente, con altre non funziona affatto. Ci sono dei parametri da settare per far funzionare correttamente la Conversazione? Con la versione precedente tutto funzionava bene per i messaggi sul server di posta, mentre non ha mai funzionato per i messaggi archiviati in locale.

I called Google Workspaces assistance and they said it's ok from their side, my GMail account is set up correctly. If I try to setup the account manually, the message I receive is that Thunderbird cannot connect to GMail. Who is telling Thunderbird that until two months ago my provider was Aruba?
