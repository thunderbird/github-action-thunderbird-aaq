Who is the email service provider? </p><p>Update: Having looked at the screenshot in your other thread, I see the SMTP server name is <em><a href=""http://mail.waitrose.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.waitrose.com</a></em>. From what I can find, it seems Waitrose email got moved to John Lewis Broadband, which is in the process of closing its email service and you are required to transfer your Waitrose service to Plusnet IF you are a broadband customer, OR export your data if you are not a broadband customer, before the closure date, according to <a href=""https://webmail.johnlewisbroadband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webmail.johnlewisbroadband.com/</a>. It's possible you're experiencing problems authenticating with the SMTP server because of whatever is happening on your email providers end. I strongly suggest you use webmail to access any communication from your provider and act on it before it's too late. If you will be transferring your service to Plusnet as a broadband customer of John Lewis, then you will will have to use the SMTP server settings of your new service provider after the transfer is complete. Contact you provider for help with that process. If you will not be transferring to Plusnet, then you will need a new email service. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

I can't fit it all on here, but it's what I was referring to with changing the server entries.  </p><p>&gt; Dear Valued Customer, &gt; We’re committed to making sure you have the most secure email experience. &gt; &gt; That’s why we’re updating our security. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an online security protocol that encrypts all data between servers and email clients. Due to an increase in attacks and security vulnerabilities in recent years, older versions TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer being used. To make sure your data continues to be safe, we are supporting the more advanced TLS 1.2. &gt; &gt; We’ve determined that you are connecting to your email using an unencrypted client connection and your data is not safe. &gt; &gt; This security update requires all email server connections to use an encrypted connection. We will make the switch to require encrypted connections on May 4th, 2023. &gt; My existing server entries are not the same as the ones in this letter.  I thought that might be why the update messed up my incoming mail from aol.  Do think this is possible?  Currently my server type: POP Mail Svr  Server Name:  <a href=""http://pop.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.aol.com</a>   Port 995   Neither of those is what they are showing starting May 4th. They also suggest IMAP.  I'm afraid to change anything in case I screw it up. </p>",smarveloustoo,false,0,0

Yes, that's a scary message and another user who saw this a couple of days ago did serious damage to his account by trying to replace POP with IMAP and, in doing so, he lost a lot of messages.

I do have the advantage of having left them on the aol server so I can go back and get them (or just plain send them) there, but I don't know that system anymore so I've lost one there as well.

I didn't realize that it may be problematic to move to the next official release version (115) from this Beta version.  If it's not a matter of simply updating through the Beta version interface to 115, I'm guessing my procedure would be to download and install v115 when it is released? </p>",phobo49,false,0,0

Install the 115 release version once it becomes available. If you do have any other versions of Thunderbird installed with their corresponding profiles make sure you don't mess them up. Always start a certain version of Thunderbird with the corresponding profile. </p>",christ1,false,1,0

In my experience, even if a top message is automatically selected upon opening the application, some items in the toolbar remain grayed out, that is, until I click away from that folder or email, and then click back to that folder or email.  At that point, the entire toolbar displays as enabled.  </p><p>Yeah, I think I'll be migrating to the latest release vs. the Beta versions, although I've been pretty happy with the Beta.  It was only in the last two updates that this particular issue cropped up for me. </p>",phobo49,false,0,0
