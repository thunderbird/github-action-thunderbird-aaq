At the same time, we switched ISPs for our home internet.  Many years ago, before I knew better, I set up a personal email account with my ISP.  Moving now from that ISP for internet, I had to establish new email accounts for my wife and I, which included configuring IMAP.  That's where the overlap is.  I felt my post was rather long as it was and so I skimped on details but unfortunately that caused some confusion. </p><p>Further to my last question, might you know the answer regarding what is the benefit of IMAP for those who have no need to work offline?  My wife has no need to work offline.  Is there any benefit to leaving her hotmail account as IMAP instead of going POP? </p>",dgillesp220,false,0,0

Much appreciated.  From what I have been told here, by GoDaddy support docs and have seen on other sites, it seems it is a requirement to configure new hotmail and similar account setups as IMAP and not POP (GoDaddy email now has to be IMAP for example, even though not ""hotmail""). </blockquote> <p>Godaddy has a Microsoft Exchange based mail system that is provided by Microsoft under contract to Godaddy.  In all honesty you can compare office365 and the Godaddy offering to some extent. You can not compare Hotmail and Godaddy.  I really have no idea what godaddy has to do with this discussion of a hotmail account. </p> <blockquote> From what I understand and from a small amount of testing, it seems that doing a Move of an email from the inbox to a folder in another email account under Thunderbird results in removing it from that inbox (which will sync back to the Hotmail server and remove it there) but will not affect the email moved to the other account. </blockquote> <p>That is correct.  Once the mail is removed from a folder controlled as a part of the synchronization of content for an account it is effectively deleted from the server (once an IMAP expunge command is issued) </p> <blockquote> This is good as my wife and I keep all travel-related email in a travel folder/subfolders in one email account.  However, I am of the impression that moving the email to Local Folders and then deleting from the Hotmail inbox will indeed also remove those email from the Hotmail server after syncing, but then moving them back to the local Hotmail TB account will, upon the next syncing, just put them back on the Hotmail server.  In essence, it seems to me that IMAP almost renders the local IMAP account setup useless.  I mean, why have it local on the PC if it also remains on the server and the PC can just be another device that the email can be accessed via browser? </blockquote> <p>You are deleting the mail from the server and then putting it back when you move the mail back into the IMAP syncronised folder.  This is not anything odd,  or unexpected.  It is a design feature of IMAP.  You can remove and add email to a syncronised account. </p><p>You can not remove an email from an IMAP account and also have that email listed in the account on Thunderbird.  It just does not work that way. </p><p>You say the account is a hotmail account.  As you can still use POP with a hoptmail account I suggest you add the account to Thunderbird again and select to use POP not IMAP when you do that.

Fundamentally each email has a unique ID,  it also has a header field called References:  When you click reply or forward, the emails ID is appended in the references header,  so it is possible that a single email can have hundreds of references. depending on how many replies and forwards it has had. </p><p>The issue arises when folk simply click reply on another email that has the recipients they want to communicate with (instead of using a mailing list to set up the recipients) and then proceed to change the subject and replace the body of the email.

This clears the references and changed the message id. </p><p>This can also be generated by poorly written web sites and scripts that reuse references and id's. </p><p>In both cases it is probably better to ask the sender to stop whatever it is they are doing wrong.   </p><p>Note that pressing Ctrl+U in Thunderbird will open the message source and you can manually confirm that there is not an issue with the references being read wrong or interpreted wrongly by Thunderbird. </p><p>There are some overrides you can set in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">Config Editor</a>.

The second computer is a desktop which is used mainly for playing video files downloaded from the web. Having said that the installation of Windows and programs follows a similar, often identical pattern so the desktop also has all the programs you mention, except Mailwasher, installed. As Mailwasher is installed on the laptop and works fine with encrypted modes I can't see how that could cause a problem. However I will install it on the desktop just to be sure that is not causing the conflict.  Apart from that the installation of other software is almost identical on both machines as I have a written procedure which I follow on every new installation/reinstallation. The installation on the laptop of Win 11 is in fact only about a month old. </p><p>What I would like to know is where the encryption software is installed. Is it part of Windows or Thunderbird. Because all computers were working fine in encrypted mode until last week when I installed the latest Windows update and the new version 115 of Thunderbird I am guessing that this is when the problem started and the incompatibility arose. Having thought about this I think I will wait until I get home and the second Tuesday of the month is issued by MS together with any Thunderbird updates which are issued up to that date. Any bugs just might be sorted by then. Although it is a possible danger not using encryption I can bear with it for a short time but not long term. </p><p>I have also asked both my ISP helplines (TSO and Zen) if they have any ideas so I am in stasis for a short while before making any final decision. </p>",alandiu1943,false,0,0

I also uninstalled Thunderbird version 115 and then installed Thunderbird 102.15.0 and still had the problem. My main suspicion  is that the culprit is the Win 11 update I installed sometime early last week so I wonder if anyone else has experienced this problem. </p><p>I remain puzzled and can't really think of anything else to check without a complete reinstall from scratch which at the moment I am not willing to contemplate particularly on this current laptop (I am at my holiday caravan for the next couple of weeks) as it had a reinstall from scratch only about a month ago. </p>",alandiu1943,false,0,0

I changed it to Port 110 with STARTTLS and Normal Password and I can now download my emails. Not really happy though as Port 110 is unencrypted so it seems that something has changed in the encryption system but no idea what. I also found with a second account that the POP3 settings no longer worked. Originally Port 995 with SSL/TLS and Normal Password but had to change to Port 110 with NO security. This seems to confirm that some problem has arisen with the security encryption system.

If you rigth click on Unified toolbar and select 'Customise' You will notice there are tabs - Mail, Address Book, Calendar, Tasks, Chat, Settings, You can customise all those various tabs from within that one customise area.
