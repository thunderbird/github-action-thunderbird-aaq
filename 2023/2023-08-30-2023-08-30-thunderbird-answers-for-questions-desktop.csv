From what I have been told here, by GoDaddy support docs and have seen on other sites, it seems it is a requirement to configure new hotmail and similar account setups as IMAP and not POP (GoDaddy email now has to be IMAP for example, even though not ""hotmail""). </blockquote> <p>Godaddy has a Microsoft Exchange based mail system that is provided by Microsoft under contract to Godaddy.  In all honesty you can compare office365 and the Godaddy offering to some extent. You can not compare Hotmail and Godaddy.  I really have no idea what godaddy has to do with this discussion of a hotmail account. </p> <blockquote> From what I understand and from a small amount of testing, it seems that doing a Move of an email from the inbox to a folder in another email account under Thunderbird results in removing it from that inbox (which will sync back to the Hotmail server and remove it there) but will not affect the email moved to the other account. </blockquote> <p>That is correct.  Once the mail is removed from a folder controlled as a part of the synchronization of content for an account it is effectively deleted from the server (once an IMAP expunge command is issued) </p> <blockquote> This is good as my wife and I keep all travel-related email in a travel folder/subfolders in one email account.

In essence, it seems to me that IMAP almost renders the local IMAP account setup useless.  I mean, why have it local on the PC if it also remains on the server and the PC can just be another device that the email can be accessed via browser? </blockquote> <p>You are deleting the mail from the server and then putting it back when you move the mail back into the IMAP syncronised folder.  This is not anything odd,  or unexpected.  It is a design feature of IMAP.  You can remove and add email to a syncronised account. </p><p>You can not remove an email from an IMAP account and also have that email listed in the account on Thunderbird.  It just does not work that way. </p><p>You say the account is a hotmail account.

Fundamentally each email has a unique ID,  it also has a header field called References:  When you click reply or forward, the emails ID is appended in the references header,  so it is possible that a single email can have hundreds of references. depending on how many replies and forwards it has had. </p><p>The issue arises when folk simply click reply on another email that has the recipients they want to communicate with (instead of using a mailing list to set up the recipients) and then proceed to change the subject and replace the body of the email.  This does not clear the references field.  This is the fundamental difference between clicking reply over ""edit as new"".  This clears the references and changed the message id. </p><p>This can also be generated by poorly written web sites and scripts that reuse references and id's. </p><p>In both cases it is probably better to ask the sender to stop whatever it is they are doing wrong.   </p><p>Note that pressing Ctrl+U in Thunderbird will open the message source and you can manually confirm that there is not an issue with the references being read wrong or interpreted wrongly by Thunderbird. </p><p>There are some overrides you can set in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">Config Editor</a>.

I also found with a second account that the POP3 settings no longer worked. Originally Port 995 with SSL/TLS and Normal Password but had to change to Port 110 with NO security.

I like a layout as like as possible to the classical layout: with titlebar on top, and then menubar, and below the tabs, and below the toolbars. It would be possible in your solution? </p>",web89,false,0,0
