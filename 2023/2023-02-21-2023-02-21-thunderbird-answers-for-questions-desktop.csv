Generally from folk that have such a horrible antivirus solution that mail simply does not work. </p><p>Personally I went out of my way to <strong>not </strong>have a mail virus scanner because it offers somewhere between zero and in my opinion nothing when using Thunderbird. (BTW I consider A/V essential if using Microsoft mail clients as opening a mail is enough to infect a computer with malware). </p><p>Lets look at this.  A plain text file comes down the wire.  Your anti virus scans it for ""threats"" in transit and says it is ok.  Then it gets to Thunderbird which at most will render the HTML content.  It will not run any scripts in the mail,  by default even fetching remote images may not occur.  The display of even an infected email is way more secure than opening a Facebook window in a browser.  By itself, HTML is a display medium,  not a program execution medium.  Especially as Thunderbird does not allow HTML that does execute things. </p><p>Now we have all these mails on your hard disk.  Still as plain text files.  Threat level while at rest.  Zero.  Open them in Windows notepad.  Threat level still Zero.  Open them in Thunderbird, there is a small threat.  But seriously it is approaching Zero as well.  But your antivirus is scanning them again!  Why. They were fine 10 seconds ago.  The reality is because these product are really not very smart and don't recognize what came over the wire as what is written to disk.  Then it scans the entire file,  despite only a few hundred bytes of information being appended. </p><p>So you say how does that correlate with the story about emails being one of the biggest threats.  I did not say anything about attachments is a big part of the story.  But they are also plain text until you decide to open or save them.  It is only at that time that a file of the type shown in the attachment list comes into existence.  And you can't get malware from a word macro when the file does not exist. </p><p>Now if I have a virus/malware in my systems memory from creating a file containing it I expect the A/V product to kill that sucker dead, like right now.  If I try and write it to the file system, I expect immediate refusal.  Probably including flashing red warnings and and offer to clean memory as well. Because now it is a real potential threat,  not that it can do anything unless you execute it by opening the file.  But at least it exists. </p><p>So while folk have been trained to look at email as a threat.  Apparently the message about the real threat has not managed to get through.  Most of the recent hacks involving email have used social engineering,  not computer code to get the information.  An antivirus will not protect against that.  Vigilance by humans checking that what they are doing is not being gullible is the only solution for that. </p><p><br> </p>  <blockquote> But even if that is what is causing the problem, that the antivirus is scanning the folder, the Thunderbird program should be sophisticated enough to just move on to the next folder, or do whatever has to be done, to continue, and not present the meaningless message with which the end-user has no ability to do anything as is suggested in the pop-up message. </blockquote> <p>No if your computer is not getting mails,  I would expect you to be made aware of that fact.  If you search for mail and get nothing but you know you saw it yesterday I would expect the program has made you aware it is having difficulties.  So you don't start with the search is broken. </p><p>Fundamentally Antivirus scanning in a Thunderbird profile while the program is trying to open files is counter productive and should not be occurring.  Thunderbird stores mail is one file per folder, and unless compacting occurs regularly (it does not with scanning) those files only get bigger with every mail that comes in.  Space in the folder from deleted and moved mail is not recovered without compacting.  That is it's function.  This, in addition to folder routinely having multiple gigabytes of mail in them results in no time when the folder is actually not in use.  It takes an A/V program something in the order of 10 minutes per gigabyte of file to scan it.  Thunderbird fetches mail every 10-15 minutes.  So before the scan ends,  another fetch has started.  But it may fail is indexing is still going from last time etc. </p><p>Fundamentally a profile folder is a busy place and on access file scanning is offering no additional protection for significant problems.  Just let it scan the entire disk every night if you are concerned,  when Thunderbird is not running at all. </p><p>Just as an aside,  historically most antivirus programs avoided outlook PST files because interfering just made a mess. Likewise when I had a Microsoft server I had to have a special server antivirus that knew to ignore the exchange and SQLServer installation databases. </p><pre>All we are suggesting it you do the same for Thunderbird. </pre>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

If the idea is to nag them into disabling anti-virus, then put that in the error message.

It is recommended that you do not enable remote content.  There may be occasions when you know that email is legit and really need to see remote content, but you allow it only for that email and not as a general option. I've never found an occasion when I really need to see the pretty images.  </p><p>By default Thunderbird does not enable 'Display Attachments inline' for your security. If you receive a genuine email from a friend or relative that includes eg: an image, then you may choose to enable that option temporarilly to see the image.  </p><p>To check any link - hover (do not click) over a link to see the real link displayed in the bottom Status Bar. Attachments - scammers hope you are curious and not savvy. Bottom line is do not open any attachments that you are not absolutely certain of their origin. </p><p>Providing you follow those basic rules, then there is no real advantage in using an Anti-Virus on emails. </p><p>Whenever, you need to save or open something then you may have Anti-Virus settings that say scan the file upon opening and/or scan the file when uploading/downloading from server. If using an Imap account then that is a lot of scanning as imap folders synchronise with server folders. </p><p>One way of cutting down the amount of scanning is  to access the Anti-virus and make the Thunderbird profile name folder an exemption so it is exempt from the scanning.  That's not the same thing as disabling scanning for incoming/outgoing files/emails. It also does not stop any scanning of any attachment file you choose to open as they usually open in another program and also in read-only mode - a security option set by default on most computers. </p><p>I would suggest you try this first as there is no advantage in scanning a file that stores emails everytime it gets opened. Then see whether this setting offers you a better experience. </p><p>If you do want Anti-Virus products constantly scanning every file that gets opened or any file uploaded or downloaded to server, then I strongly advise you set up the Anti-virus to always ask you what to do should it ever come across something it does not like. Why&nbsp;? Because you will need to instruct a do not fix. Any attempt to fix a file that is likely to contain hundreds of emails may result in the Anti-virus deleting loads of emails.  </p><p>It's better and with no risk to note which file has the problem, then create a 'Test' folder on desktop. Select the problem folder in Thunderbird and use 'Save as' to get individual emails saved as eml files in the 'Test' folder. Run the AV scan on the 'Test' folder and then you can get information on which specific email is the problem. Back in Thunderbird delete the problem email and then compact the folder to completely remove all traces. Also delete the bad .eml file and then empty the computer 'Recycle Bin'. Problem solved with no loss of emails. </p><p>In addition to the suggested Test of making the Thunderbird profile folder execmpt from scanning, you can also run a Test to check out what improvements you get when the Anti-Virus is not running. Start your computer in 'Safe Mode with Networking' and then start Thunderbird as normal. If you normally use a  wireless connection then you may need to connect your computer to the router/hub using an ethernet cable in order to perform that test. </p><p>These two separate tests will confirm whether the AV was causing you a load of annoyance and whether just stopping the scanning of profile files seriously improves the situation without stopping the scanning on incoming files. Just don't click on links unless you have checked what they are linked to and do not open any attachments you are certain of origin and do not allow remote content to be displayed. As a heads up anything in the 'Junk/spam' folder cannot display remote content as a security feature until it is set as not junk and moved out of Junk/Spam folder. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

An invisible ""email"" with a self installing address book update code or some other similar method shouldn't be that hard to figure out, triggered by an update in the address book. </p><p>Since Mozilla is all about security and privacy etc, customer's should be able to opt in or out of this as they see fit.

Particularly relevant in mail products that appear to lack the control over remote images Thunderbird has.  Products that they always show remote images will load these web bugs.  My email from Ebay is full of them, as is mail from most US based companies. Ebay even offered to discontinue email from my saved searches because I did not read them, the bugs are so integrated into their marketing processes.   </p><p>Thunderbird does not load remote images in mail marked as junk for exactly that reason.  What is an essential feature in a Microsoft product because it encourages web bugs by it's convenient design, serves no real purpose in Thunderbird because Thunderbird has addressed the issue with privacy in mind by not even loading the images. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
