Everything from past that point the other employess successfully tag and see as tagged, while I see these messages as not having any tag at all. </p><p>In the hopes that it's some bug within my Thunderbird (currently 102.12.0) I installed the Beta 115.0b3 version as a separate entity and configured it from the scratch... The issue persists. </p><p>My config below. What am I doing wrong?

You are not on the guest list yet"". The exact wording might be a bit different, since I'm translating it from German. Then all mail addresses configured in Thunderbird are offered for the response to the invitation. In fact I'm on the list on invitees, otherwise I wouldn't have received the invitation. It's actually not a big deal, I can select the correct mail address and send the answer. But it is a bit annoying and not completely obvious why Thunderbird behaves this way. </p><p>Thanks. </p><p>Christian </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",cortlieb

I have tried using the import method with various file types, I have tried just copying the folders in manually.  Nothing seems to work, I either get errors or Thunderbird just doesn't recognize the old folders. </p><p>FYI - I also have bought the full paid version of the Thunderbird Migration Wizard software from <a href=""http://recoverytools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">recoverytools.com</a>.  With this, I can change my old emails folders/files into practically any format. </p><p>What is the proper way to import my old stuff???
