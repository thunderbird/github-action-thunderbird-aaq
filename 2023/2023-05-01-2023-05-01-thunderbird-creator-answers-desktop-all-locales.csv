I thought I might have too much data on the system, but I just can't open anything to start deleting. Strangely, it will allow me to write a new mail. I'm not very computer-oriented, so please be especially clear in your suggestions - I'm not a four-year-old, but it might be best to explain things to me as though I were.

Thunderbird says the inbox has reached its size limit of 250Mb, although there are only 2230 emails there. I have much bigger inboxes for other accounts, the inbox files for which are bigger than 250Mb. Compacting the inbox does not work, nothing seems to happen.

I've used the layout.css.devPixelsPerPx variable in the Config Editor to get the menu, folder index, headings, and other fixed parts of the UI to a reasonable size, but the message pane, reply quote, and other parts of the displayed text are way too large. I've tried to use the font size controls in Settings to adjust them, but with little luck. </p><p>So, what I would like to see is a concise table showing each font size parameter and exactly which panes and text it applies to. Or, I would like to see written instructions for making the font size the same for all text appearing in Thunderbird, anywhere in Thunderbird. </p><p>Or any other answer that is equivalent to these to help me achieve the same font size throughout Thunderbird. </p><p>Note: while I can see that some text is too large, I have not verified that a recipient would see text that is too large, since I'm not certain how to test for this, or how to text for both plain text and formatted text. I prefer to send plain text and receive formatted text, if that is relevant. </p>",customize;needsinfo;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1578335;1578346;1578348;1578349;1578350;1578352;1578355;1578494;1579054;1579057;1579062;,David536

Apparently Firefox has this feature enabled but TB does not. Here is what IT services told me as to why TB is not compliant and does not work any more: </p><p>""The truthful answer to whether Thunderbird will ever be compliant is we just don't know. The issue lies with Mozilla not having yet implemented a feature now available in Firefox to enable the app to report back to Azure what version it is. </p><p>I suspect Thunderbird may have an inbuilt/embedded browser as this is something also observed in other apps."" </p><p>Do you know if TB will be updated so that it will be compliant?
