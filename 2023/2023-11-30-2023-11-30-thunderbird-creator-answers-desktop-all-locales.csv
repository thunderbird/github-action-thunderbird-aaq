When I start my next Thunderbird session those e-mails re-open. </p><p>After the each of the past few Thunderbird updates (I am not using version 115.5.0) I have found that, when starting Thunderbird, there are tabs for the previously open e-mails, but the tabs are completely blank.  There is nothing to indicate what was previously open. </p><p>1) Can I recover a list of the e-mails that were previously open? 2) Can this be fixed in future releases so that this information is not lost upon another update? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",anzucker

I'm using T-bird v 115.3.2, and since the upgrade to 115, I've been seeing weird behavior regarding opening messages vs their getting marked read. </p><p>I'm referring to actually opening the message in a new window (I do not use the preview window--it is turned off). </p><p>My usual reading behavior is to open a message, read it, then press &lt;F&gt; to go to the next message. In either case, most messages immediately get marked as read. However, some random messages do not get marked as read immediately--after a delay, the message gets marked as read. It seems to be related to messages from some specific senders, as opposed to random messages. For example, marketing messages from Southwest Airlines always seem to have this issue, as do the daily newsletters from ""The Hustle."" </p><p>What are the criteria for T-bird to think a message has been read? If it matters, I'm seeing this on mailboxes where I use IMAP access. I have not seen it occur in the mailbox where I use POP3 access, but almost all of those messages are plain text. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",MikeyinCVCA
