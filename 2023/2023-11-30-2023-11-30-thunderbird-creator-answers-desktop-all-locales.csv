When I start my next Thunderbird session those e-mails re-open. </p><p>After the each of the past few Thunderbird updates (I am not using version 115.5.0) I have found that, when starting Thunderbird, there are tabs for the previously open e-mails, but the tabs are completely blank.  There is nothing to indicate what was previously open. </p><p>1) Can I recover a list of the e-mails that were previously open? 2) Can this be fixed in future releases so that this information is not lost upon another update? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",anzucker
