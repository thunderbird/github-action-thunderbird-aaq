I'm using T-bird v 115.3.2, and since the upgrade to 115, I've been seeing weird behavior regarding opening messages vs their getting marked read. </p><p>I'm referring to actually opening the message in a new window (I do not use the preview window--it is turned off). </p><p>My usual reading behavior is to open a message, read it, then press &lt;F&gt; to go to the next message. In either case, most messages immediately get marked as read. However, some random messages do not get marked as read immediately--after a delay, the message gets marked as read. It seems to be related to messages from some specific senders, as opposed to random messages. For example, marketing messages from Southwest Airlines always seem to have this issue, as do the daily newsletters from ""The Hustle."" </p><p>What are the criteria for T-bird to think a message has been read? If it matters, I'm seeing this on mailboxes where I use IMAP access. I have not seen it occur in the mailbox where I use POP3 access, but almost all of those messages are plain text. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",MikeyinCVCA
