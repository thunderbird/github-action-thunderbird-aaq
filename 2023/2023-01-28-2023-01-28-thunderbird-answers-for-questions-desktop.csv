I reviewed your prior questions and - just a guess - it may be that you write lots of words in your request, but never give any information useful in helping you. Such as error messages, account setup information for incoming and outgoing. Knowing that doesn't guaranteed a solution, but it is a big help. There are too few here to respond to all problems, and the need to continually prompt for information tends to send us to work with those who give information up front. So, please share some details. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I did some research and discovered that Thunderbird no longer is funded by the Mozilla foundation. That's bad news.  My ISP, that I have I have been using since 2010.  That ISP is Wide Open West in Denver, CO.  Now to save money they have done a deal with Synacor in Buffalo, NY to handle all of their email.  They have had problems with email for a long time. I tried calling them and got a senior tech, but they sussed me out. Suddenly they asked, are you a end user.  I said yes and they said that they could not talk to end users. So I may be changing my ISP soon. I have been working on this for 5 days today.  I have been brought to rage and tears during that time. I have been uninstalling Thunderbird. I have been reinstalling Thunderbird reverting the releases for Thunderbird (all those files were in my downloaded in that very file going back in time - no joy there.  Full disclosure, I am running MS 7 64bit professional, in a desktop that I built.  Still MS sends me updates on the second Tuesday of every month. Usually a security rollup but lately they threw me MS Edge.  This is a good machine. Now I really needed email so I decided to buy MS office but office has gotten so bad, I researched last known good Office, which is 2016. And I was able to purchase that at discount. So I clicked on outlook and with no setup was in business.  So I will be expunging Thunderbird using MS uninstall and then going to Program files to remove any mention of Thunderbird and finally using a utility will remove any registry entry pertaining to Thunderbird.  Thank you very much. Please enjoy your life but don't get old. All the best to you, Mike PS - there is still a problem with Synacor, they don't have a valid digital certificate. </p>",macme,false,0,0
