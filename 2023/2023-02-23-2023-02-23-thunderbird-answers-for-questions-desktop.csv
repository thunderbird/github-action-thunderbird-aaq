There is a little plus sign to the right of that. click it. 3) choose on the network  4) there is now a place to put your url, so go ahead and do it </p>",britta5,false,0,0

Either confirm my assumed events or place the correct sequence.

Repeat I used the Thunderbird support method for deleting an e-mail account from Thunderbird and not that I deleted it from my server, which would be an irrelevance to Thunderbird if Thunderbird didn’t have a bug. Whether or not an e-mail address is deleted from a server, once it is deleted from Thunderbird using the advised method Thunderbird should not try to access it. HINT: If Thunderbird still tries to connect to a deleted account there IS A BUG in the Thunderbird programming NOT A FEATURE. </p><p>So your next sarcastic statement seems to indicate you struggle more with understanding English than how a programme should work. HINT: Programmers tend to not create a product feature to access items deleted from the programme. A programme trying to access something DELETED from its programming isn’t what the average person (unlike you) would expect it to do nor is it the program trying to do what it’s told. </p><p>The reason I did not send the troubleshooting information is because it is useless. </p><p>“BTW that troubleshooting information would have shown exactly what accounts were configured and I would not be guessing.” </p><p>Wrong! You could not possibly know what accounts are configured using the Thunderbird troubleshooting information from my PC.  </p><p>Here’s the thing, due to the sentence above which I have now decided deliberately to not explain but is fact, I now believe I have figured out what the bug (intended feature) is and why the bug (intended feature) exists and I know it needs to be fixed because, in the same circumstances, it will always appear, always be a bug (intended feature) and can only be resolved by reprogramming Thunderbird i.e. support has no solution. What I also realise is that it won’t only cause errors when deleting accounts. </p><p>I somehow doubt anyone is going to be able to figure it out regardless of how long Thunderbird eventually needs to take looking at it’s coding so thanks for your support and feel free to live with the bug (intended feature) as I will live without Thunderbird. </p><p>In the event the bug (intended feature) reappears (which it inevitably will), you can go back and forwards politely forever and never figure it out (because you don’t know the essential question to ask or even think you need to ask it). And the reason why you will need to do that is because you chose the route of sarcasm instead of ignoring superfluous comments driven by frustration and seeking to offer actual support (even after  being told that’s the error you are making). Truth is, I now know what I have discovered is more important to Thunderbird than it is to me. </p><p>Your next two paragraphs: Hence my last comment (unlike this post of yours) efficient support only addresses the central issue concerning the product and ignores everything else that is unrelated. You’re explaining to me what I just explained to you in my last post. You just proved me right. </p><p>But the things you’re “not interested in” are important to someone who understands support. For example Stans incorrectly said I could correct the error by text editing one of the .js files. If I hadn’t already searched for text and found no reference to the deleted account neither he or I would know, that method didn’t work. But to you: You’re apparently not interested in finding out if the account has been deleted from the configuration settings. Wow, you’re going to be a great help then. </p><p>BTW, I have all my hidden files viewable so I know, if I highlight them all my search will encompass all. HINT: Apart from that anyone with a clue wouldn’t even consider a Thunderbird profile setting could be held in a Windows hidden file so that’s just deliberate nonsense, white noise (you do know they’re hidden to protect the WIN system not addons?) You would have to do one of your “not interested” searches to find out. </p><p>What did I do? Read the correspondence, I said it more than once. No need to confirm your assumptions when I provided the facts you don’t seem to be able to follow. Seriously how difficult is it for you to comprehend “I deleted an e-mail account using the Thunderbird suggested method and Thunderbird stopped working?” As the phrase goes: ""Not rocket science."" What did I expect would happen? Well, silly me, I expected Thunderbird to keep working. </p><p>This is what I mean, you’re so worked up about some little defensive attack and battle of sarcasm based on the analysis of what you don’t like, you have totally missed the actual problem described several times and that makes you look incompetent.  </p><p>Every time someone tries to have a go at a comeback you simply prove you’re not capable of doing it and end up looking even worse. Recommendation: Give up. Lock the article without comment. </p><p>And, no thanks, I have no intention of starting a new topic. The original topic heading was accurate and just fine. And from this point, I would rather the bug (Thunderbird feature) remains exactly where it is safe in the knowledge sometime in the future it will cost time and effort to resolve it. </p>",firefox2220,false,0,2

You have failed to clearly and concisely elucidate what it is that is the issue,  or the steps someone else could follow to repeat such an ""issue"" so they could understand. </p><p>I wish you well on your quest of someone that will just listen to you and agree.  That is not me. I do not even understand and you apparently are not prepared to make it clearer. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,2

Thunderbird kept trying to log onto the deleted account. Because it couldn't log onto that account it couldn't send any e-mails and became useless. Two copies of the Thunderbird error message were included. </p><p>I could accept a 5 year old not being able to follow that but not a computer literate 7 year old. </p><p>Sorry but to me, that places you as thick as a brick. You shouldn't be on this site let alone commenting. (Take the hint.) </p><p>Clearly you're not even smart enough to pick up on the fact, in my last post, I already figured out it was a programming issue that support couldn't solve. So yes, from that point on you were already done. </p><p>Perhaps, if you want to continue on the site, you should take reading and comprehension lessons. </p><p>As said this issue should be locked without further comment.  </p><p>Repeat: THE BUG IN THUNDERBIRD IS AN ONGOING ISSUE REQUIRING RE-PROGRAMMING AND CANNOT BE SOLVED BY THIS SITE SUPPORT.   </p><p>I'll make one offer: If Thunderbird want to know the error in their program that needs resolving, they can contact me but not via this site. </p>",firefox2220,false,0,0
