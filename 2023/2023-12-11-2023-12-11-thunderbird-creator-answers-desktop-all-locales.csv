The email folder tree is hidden left. When I pull it to standard location,  when I click to the message folder to see the emails, they do not appear on the right. I need then to reset the screen setting to get to the standard classic theme. This holds only short time and again I have a blank screen as attached.  When I click to File and then on Exit, it takes very long to close the TB. Closing the TB wit the right cross top works immediatelly. In my case I have a big folders (few GB each) and multiple emal accounts. I really have to say, that in speed and friendly usage is the 115 step backwards from 112. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",zetka

If I put that in and manually import the ICS file then the event is found. So it seems this is a bug in a new release of Outlook... does anybody know if there is a way to make the parsing of calendar attachments more permissice in Thunderbird so I can get these working again?
