Last Month I downloaded Thunderbird email app and set up with a new email account using mailfence. Now I find that my mailfence email address was only a free trial and I have to pay to continue to use. I now wish to set up with my original free email with gmail. I did uninstall the Thunderbird app and then installed from fresh. Unfortunately it still has the mailfence email remembered in the Thunderbird App. How so I start again from scratch using my gmail account instead of the mailfence account that has now expired? Thank you in anticipation of you help. </p>,download-and-install_1;needsinfo;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1623741;1623822;1623882;1625407;1625475;,bronleasull
