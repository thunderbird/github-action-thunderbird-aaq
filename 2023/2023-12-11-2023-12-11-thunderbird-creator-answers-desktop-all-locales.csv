Naturally, I assume Thunderbird is doing what it always does and I don't notice that, going straight to the reply.  Until my reply hits my inbox seconds later, as being from 'Bob' to 'Me' and is not saved in the Sent folder.   Usually I just forward that received mail to 'Bob', who at first got confused that I'm forwarding my own response.  It seems to happen in batches, but then another message from 'Bob' to 'Me' will reply normally from 'Me' to 'Bob'.  Always the same accounts.
