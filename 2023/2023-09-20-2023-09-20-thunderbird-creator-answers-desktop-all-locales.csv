Background: I normally use different emails for each login, but all have the same domain. If my domain is @ZZZ.com and I create an account here for firefox, the email is firefox@ZZZ.com. If it would be an account for amazon, it would be amazon@ZZZ.com and so on. On my mail server is a catch all for @ZZZ.com, that redirects the emails to one email account. I use that email Account for reading/managing all the incoming emails. In that main email account I would like to automatically sort emails depending on the prefix before @ZZZ.com. So if amazon sends me an email to amazon@ZZZ.com it should moved to a folder called amazon. If the email is from firefox, it should be moved to a folder called firefox. I could make folders by hand every single time when I create a new account, but that would be a lot of work. I would love to have a function/filter that I can click, that takes all emails and if the recipient has @ZZZ.com it checks the prefix and move it to the matching folder. If the folder doesnt exist yet, then create it and move the email. If there is a way to do it? With the default filter rules I cant find any way to do it. Maybe with a self written plugin? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",firefox2468

This addon is not supported in Thunderbird 115, but I'm hoping the new certificate functions in 115 will work.

I just updated it to this version.  It looks pretty but the two top toolbars have changed position. Before the update I used to mostly just hit Get messages and Write. But now those buttons are tiny and on the very top level.  I don't really use any of the buttons on the now lower level toolbar, so I have been trying for ages to swap them back but I can't find any control that lets me do this? Can anyone help please? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1606665;1609163;1609183;,addyjustforregistering

Now when in games using full screen windowed mode, the new mail alert pops up over the game, where it never used to do that.

It seems entirely random.  This is not new to 115, but it's still annoying.  I can be in the same game, hear the notification and not lose focus.  Other times, even in the same game, the notification steals the game's focus. </p><p>I checked the settings, they are the same as before.

I have found some good code online which has allowed me to change a few colors, but it would be nice to be able to do much more customization of this great open source software!  Thanks.
