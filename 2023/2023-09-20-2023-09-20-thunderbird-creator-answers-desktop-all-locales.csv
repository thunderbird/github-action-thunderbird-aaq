When the latest version of Thunderbird opens, these get replaced with blanks, including no title in the tab. They can be re-opened because many of them have a tag that can be found in the search box, but this is a SERIOUS bug for at least one user. Note that even those messages in the current inbox become blank. This is like a magnified version of the problem when the inbox is compacted. On steroids.  A SERIOUS bug that needs to be fixed. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",sb5k
