Half of those have S/MIME certificates which I get from <a href=""http://actalis.it"" rel=""nofollow"">actalis.it</a>. They are free and have to be renewed each year. Each year a new certificate is created and imported in to Thunderbird.  </p><p>I use an add on called ""security settings from address book"" which allows me to automatically encrypt emails to recipients who have a flag set in the custom fields. This addon is not supported in Thunderbird 115, but I'm hoping the new certificate functions in 115 will work. I will not be using OpenPGP, Enigmail or GNUPG.  </p><p>As each email address gets a new certificate each year I have to import each certificate to be able to access these older emails. So my question is this; </p><p>I assume if I don't import the certificates for each account for every year I will be unable to access the emails that were sent/received during the valid period of the related certificates - is that correct? </p><p>How will this affect people with whom I sent/received encrypted emails? Are they going to have to upgrade to 115 at the same time? I would have thought that as long as they have their certificates already installed in the same manner in which I had in my old Thunderbird they would not have to do anything?  </p><p>Unrelated to encryption/digital signatures, I've just had a thought... Am I going to come across any issues pointing Thunderbird 115 to my existing mail folders?  </p><p>I believe there is no ""upgrade path"". I have to do all of this from scratch? </p><p>I have about a 1,000 filters.

Background: I normally use different emails for each login, but all have the same domain. If my domain is @ZZZ.com and I create an account here for firefox, the email is firefox@ZZZ.com. If it would be an account for amazon, it would be amazon@ZZZ.com and so on. On my mail server is a catch all for @ZZZ.com, that redirects the emails to one email account. I use that email Account for reading/managing all the incoming emails. In that main email account I would like to automatically sort emails depending on the prefix before @ZZZ.com. So if amazon sends me an email to amazon@ZZZ.com it should moved to a folder called amazon. If the email is from firefox, it should be moved to a folder called firefox. I could make folders by hand every single time when I create a new account, but that would be a lot of work. I would love to have a function/filter that I can click, that takes all emails and if the recipient has @ZZZ.com it checks the prefix and move it to the matching folder. If the folder doesnt exist yet, then create it and move the email. If there is a way to do it? With the default filter rules I cant find any way to do it. Maybe with a self written plugin? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",firefox2468
