To create a profile on the other drive, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folders' and click 'about:profiles' and click the 'create profile' button and, from there, define a profile on the other drive. You would then need to copy the profile contents of old folder to the profile on the other drive. Another option on saving space would be to just move the account to the other drive, assuming that it's the account and the messages that take up space. To do that, you could click 'account settings' and on the account page, look at bottom line where it shows the location of the account. You could exit TB and copy the folder to the other drive. Then, restart TB, click the account settings page and click the select button on that line to select the profile where you had copied it to the other drive. Exit and restart TB to verify that all is well. Once satisfied. you could then delete the account folder from the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have even had to put up with well meaning antivirus company employees that had obviously drunk the cool aid telling me it was ""another line of defense""  I guess their jobs depended on peddling the corporate line and selling fear.  Be under no illusions fear sells. </p><p>Let us look at this.   Your mail comes in and your antivirus scan the encrypted traffic before Thunderbird ever sees it.  Thunderbird then writes the incoming mail to your inbox because it has finally received it from the same antivirus. This antivirus now scans the changed inbox file for a ""threat"" that is obviously was not capable of finding when it arrived. You click forward,  this same software embarks on another scan looking for something it has failed to find the last twice it performed this identical function. </p><p>Now you are saying that it is important that this file update to a text file which has already been scanned before Thunderbird ever got the email needs another scan, using the same tools that certified the incoming mail clean because somewhere in the memory of your computer which the product is also certifying and monitoring malware just materialized like Captain Kirk in  a transporter beam.  Malware comes fro somewhere,  it does not spontaneously spring into existence. </p><p>I suggest you have a detailed look at what Quarantine means.  In most cases you will loose access to the entire folder as all the email in the folder are stores in a single file.  and Thunderbird indexes that file to find the email it wants.  So the intrusion of the antivirus into that file by way of editing is obviously destructive and as bad as the malware they purport to so the just quarantine everything.  I have seen folk here with thousands of mails from their inbox ""quarantined"", or outright deleted for no reason other than the antivirus needs to sell fear. </p><p>Thunderbird does not execute scripts in mail.  This means that is matters not at all what the antivirus finds in the body of an email.  It can not execute.  Unless you load it in  Outlook or similar which does run scripts you will not be infected with malware.  Before you could load than mail in another mail client however first you would need to make a copy of the specific email for outlook to open.  As soon as you do that,  the antivirus will jump on the file you saved because it is monitoring the file system generally. </p><p>In the case your incoming mail has a malware laden attachment,  again,  not a risk.  It is stored in Thunderbird as text.  It matter little what you try and do,  getting malware for a text file is so close to impossible as for it to be so.  When you decide to save or view the attachment,  the very first thing Thunderbird has to do, is decode the mime encoded text the attachment is transmitted and stores as and turn it into the described file. (something your antivirus program already did before Thunderbird ever say the email) </p><p>Antivirus is continuously scanning memory for suspicious data,  so it will probably stop the decode.  If it does not,  the file then has to be written to the computers disk so the relevant helper application can open it.  The write will again see the antivirus scan the new file.  Then the read of that file by the helper application (say word) will trigger yet another opportunity for this ubiquitous scanning to do it's job. </p><p>So,  I will leave it at that.  Your idea that not scanning the Thunderbird profile data while the program is running is increasing your risk may be correct.  But the increase in risk is in my opinion almost infinitesimal.  You do it your way,  but please do it in an informed manner.  Look for information about threats from somewhere other than those selling detection tools.  They have a vested interest is scaring you and everyone else into buying their product for fear of getting ""got"" by this mysterious malware. </p><p>The responsibility to be careful always remains with us,  but do not swallow the propaganda of the antivirus industry without question. </p><p>Ps.  What antivirus is editing Thunderbird storage files?  That is worth making a not of. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
