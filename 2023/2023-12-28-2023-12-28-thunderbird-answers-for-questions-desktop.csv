I'm still not seeing my folders under that profile.  Also--I followed your suggestion best I could.  There is no ""profile folders"" label.  There is ""profile folder"" (singular) and at the bottom of the list, ""profile"" which is where the ""about:profile"" link is found. Used that, did ""create profile"" then ""next"", named it, and browsed to the profile I wanted, but it's not seeing all the stuff it should see.  I'll try again.  This is getting to be a major PITA. </p>",dennyw0713,false,0,0

When I clicked send, TB said something like ""Total size of the attachments is 40MB.  Are you sure you want to send this email?"" </p><p>I clicked on ""Yes"" and assumed that TB sent the email.  But TB didn't send it.  TB just left it sitting in Outbox with no notification to me.  And after that, every email I tried to send got piled up in Outbox, also unsent.  And no notifications from TB that it wasn't sending these emails. </p><p>I deleted the first email with all of the attachments and hoped that would break the logjam, but it didn't.  I had to delete every that was bottled up in the Outbox, then restart TB (twice) to break the logjam.  Then I had to remember and re-create every email and send them one-by-one.  (I didn't attempt to re-send the first email that had a lot of attachments.) </p>",clintoconner2,false,0,0

They will be at the very top of your list of emails as just about every mail service sorts the new stuff by date and time in descending order. </p><p>How to block them is far more difficult.  either mark them as spam and let Thunderbird work it out over time or create a filter to do something with them. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

To create a profile on the other drive, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folders' and click 'about:profiles' and click the 'create profile' button and, from there, define a profile on the other drive. You would then need to copy the profile contents of old folder to the profile on the other drive. Another option on saving space would be to just move the account to the other drive, assuming that it's the account and the messages that take up space. To do that, you could click 'account settings' and on the account page, look at bottom line where it shows the location of the account. You could exit TB and copy the folder to the other drive. Then, restart TB, click the account settings page and click the select button on that line to select the profile where you had copied it to the other drive. Exit and restart TB to verify that all is well. Once satisfied. you could then delete the account folder from the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
