When I clicked send, TB said something like ""Total size of the attachments is 40MB.  Are you sure you want to send this email?"" </p><p>I clicked on ""Yes"" and assumed that TB sent the email.  But TB didn't send it.  TB just left it sitting in Outbox with no notification to me.  And after that, every email I tried to send got piled up in Outbox, also unsent.  And no notifications from TB that it wasn't sending these emails. </p><p>I deleted the first email with all of the attachments and hoped that would break the logjam, but it didn't.  I had to delete every that was bottled up in the Outbox, then restart TB (twice) to break the logjam.  Then I had to remember and re-create every email and send them one-by-one.  (I didn't attempt to re-send the first email that had a lot of attachments.) </p>",clintoconner2,false,0,0

They will be at the very top of your list of emails as just about every mail service sorts the new stuff by date and time in descending order. </p><p>How to block them is far more difficult.  either mark them as spam and let Thunderbird work it out over time or create a filter to do something with them. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0
