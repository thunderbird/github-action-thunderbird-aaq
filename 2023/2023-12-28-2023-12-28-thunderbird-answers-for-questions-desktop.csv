To create a profile on the other drive, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folders' and click 'about:profiles' and click the 'create profile' button and, from there, define a profile on the other drive. You would then need to copy the profile contents of old folder to the profile on the other drive. Another option on saving space would be to just move the account to the other drive, assuming that it's the account and the messages that take up space. To do that, you could click 'account settings' and on the account page, look at bottom line where it shows the location of the account. You could exit TB and copy the folder to the other drive. Then, restart TB, click the account settings page and click the select button on that line to select the profile where you had copied it to the other drive. Exit and restart TB to verify that all is well. Once satisfied. you could then delete the account folder from the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Now i am trying out your system so before I donate money, can you let me know if it is possible to add six different emails into this Free version of thunderbird, I just want to know if it is working, I have a few online start ups and I need access to six emails only.  It looks like thunderbird is not sending out some emails. and it receives the new emails at the bottom of the list instead of at the top.  With the horror of disgusting corporate greed today, where can I learn to build decentralised applications, because of the corruption today blocking out small businesses, I am now looking at building decentralised software and will perhaps make them open source. I am already a full stack dev with 20 yrs exp.   Now I want to move my existing innovations to decentralised architecture. </blockquote>",mark.webley,false,0,0
