I frequently backup them, by synchronising the whole profile folder in different disks over the network or external hard drives. While doing this, I noticed that almost all the files in the <em>ImapMail</em> folder (which, as far as I understand, contains two files for each folder) are detected as changed, even if I did not receive any new email in most of those folders. This obviously slows down the copy, and forces me to copy several hundreds GBs even I received only a few new emails (in very specific folders). Each folder has a small file (the "".msf"" one) and a big/huge one (the one without extension); it is not a big deal if the small files change (for instance to keep track of some metadata), but it is a huge problem for me if the big ones do that even if there are no new emails in that folder. </p><p>Is there a way to tell Thunderbird to change those files only if I received new emails in the folders they refer to? </p><p>btw, why do those files without extension change if there are no new emails? (this seems like a bug) </p><p>Thanks </p><p>--- </p><p>P.S. it is a follow up from a previous question (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1396003"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1396003</a>). </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1585969;1585982;1586125;1586228;1586328;,pdanilo
