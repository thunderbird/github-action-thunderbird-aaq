My problem is that when I receive an email addressed to more than one of my accounts, if I reply using the reply button in the email preview pane, it sometimes using a different From account in the reply than the one I am replying from BUT does not happen if I use the Reply in the right-click context menu or the Message-&gt;Reply option.  So I setup identities on each account and selected the ""reply from this identity"" and typed in the that profile email address to try and fix it.  The problem still occurs when using the button in the preview pane BUT does not happen if I use the Reply in the right-click context menu or the Message-&gt;Reply option.  Why is that and how can it be fixed?  Can I remove the reply option in the preview pane somehow?  I think this problem might be new as I have not seen this behaviour before and have always used .  It appears that it chooses the first of my accounts listed in the recipient list of the email to place in the From field.  Again this does not occur on any other Reply option I tried. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help with this </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",denis.desjardins1
