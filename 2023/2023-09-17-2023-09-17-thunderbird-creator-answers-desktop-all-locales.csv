I often need to plan several months ahead (doesn't everyone?) and would like to see the next 3-4 months in the calendar sidebar. I'm used to this view from Outlook and find it exceptionally useful. I just upgraded to version 105 and was hoping it would be configurable, but cannot find it anywhere. IMHO having just one month is redundant with the main calendar view. Am I missing something? Thanks in advance! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1604257;,pocket22

I just tested toi see if this was also the situation on my laptops and I found it is not. I uninstalled and reinstalled SuperNova on my PC and continue to experience the same issue. What could be the issue on my PC that is causing this oversized font. It is only happening with SuperNova and not on any other application. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mozfan2
