I like the way my messages list seems to hold more, every line is closer together and the font may even be smaller. Strangely, despite everything being more compact, my Folders list used to have more space at the bottom. My big complaint though is when trying to access the bottom message in the messages list, sometimes I go a bit low and there is suddenly a blue bar. I dragged it and it is the Message Pane. I do not want that. At all. I thought by disabling it, it was gone, but there it is, encroaching on my most recent message! I tried expanding the density, but it exploded everything. I just need a bit of space between the last message and the edge of the list. Or get rid of the Message Pane.

Si può a): eliminare questa commistione oppure b): è diventato obbligatorio? Nel primo caso vorrei avere le istruzioni per la sua eliminazione. Nel secondo caso, mio malgrado, dovrei rinunciare a Thunderbird che oramai uso, si può dire, da sempre. Grazie.

I often need to plan several months ahead (doesn't everyone?) and would like to see the next 3-4 months in the calendar sidebar. I'm used to this view from Outlook and find it exceptionally useful. I just upgraded to version 105 and was hoping it would be configurable, but cannot find it anywhere. IMHO having just one month is redundant with the main calendar view. Am I missing something?
