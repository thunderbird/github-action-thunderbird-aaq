I can login to my Outlook account, I have disabled my antivirus, don't have any other app open, I tried the ""Help -&gt; troubleshoot mode"", erased cache, restarted my pc, I even tried to change the ""Identification Method"" to ""no identification"" or ""normal password"" instead of ""OAuth2"", the only thing that doing this last change does is that if the OAuth2 is selected the Pop-up window is completly black, while when the setting is on ""normal password"" for example, the screen at least shows up correctly, but still can't go past the email part.

When I select the email I want to print it picks up all the ""headers"" from the old emails in the trail and wants to print all these as well.  I have attached an example that only shows a small email, but I have some that have 15-20 emails in the trail. I know I can restrict how many pages to print but that seems like a cumbersome way to do it and still gives you ""some partial info"" from the other emails. I'm not sure what I'm missing and have been a long term Thunderbird user for many years. In the example attached, I only want to print the latest email at the top and not the following info that could in most cases be over about 7-8 pages. I hope my explanation is clear to you.
