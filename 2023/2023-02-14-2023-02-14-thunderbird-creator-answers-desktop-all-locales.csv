Now, I had some time and I dug a bit deeper. I noticed that the CPU usage spikes are related to the ""main"" view or the inbox tab, whatever it is called. For instance, if I open another tab like Add-ons manager, everything is fine. However, going back to the inbox view tab CPU usage jumps up, and if I move the mouse over the open inbox view tab, CPU usage spikes up to 100% for one core immediately and the fans start ramping up. Hopefully this describes the issue on a good enough level. </p><p>I had no problems for long and this problem appeared a month or maybe two ago. I've since switched to using webmail so I don't remember the exact update when this started occurring for me. Since then, I have been trying Thunderbird every now and then, but the problem persists. </p><p>For what it's worth, my operating system is Manjaro GNOME 22.0.1 running under a Wayland session with kernel 6.1.7. My Thunderbird installation has a few RSS feeds and my work email. I have three plugins installed and enabled: Provider for Exchange ActiveSync, LookOut (fix version), and LanguageTool. I monitored the CPU usage with htop. Any help is appreciated, because I would really like to use Thunderbird. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",waeiski

I had problems with my BT email a short while ago due to a problem with SMTP which was successfully resolved and a new password applied. Since this was some time after the recorded pwning I assumed that the necessary change had been made. However, after months of no spoofing I am now receiving regular spoofs. Can the spoofers have been alerted by the pwning notice? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1565580;1565663;1565775;,NorJean

Ho provato a chiamare l'assistenza Infocert e mi hanno detto di cambiare password e disinstallare la PEC sul client per visualizzarle sul web, ma si è rivelato essere inutile in quanto sul web comunque non trovo le mail e il client è stato ormai cancellato. Dicono che il problema sussiste con Thunderbird e che per il ripristino PEC devo sentire voi.

I have looked at the privacy policies and didn't see anything like what is included in the screen shot I have attached.  I have not had to agree to anything like that for my other two email addresses that come into my Thunderbird program. I can login to the Office 365 iglide account online, with no problems, so my password is not the problem.  Can you help?  Thank you!

Quando trocamos a senha o Thunderbird pede pra colocar a nova senha (ao iniciar o aplicativo, ao enviar ou ao receber), porém neste caso, mesmo marcando pra salvar a senha, ele nunca salva e sempre tem que colocar a senha. Verifiquei em Ferramentas → Configurações → Privacidade e Segurança → Senhas → Senhas Memorizadas, e realmente não aparece mesmo depois de marcarmos pra salvar. </p><p>Tentei apenas atualizar o Thunderbird, porém não deu certo. Outra maneira que pensei foi desinstalar e instalar novamente, mas por conta do backup o funcionário preferiu ficar colocando a senha. Desinstalar e instalar seria uma boa opção pra resolver? </p><p>Obs.: o e-mail/aplicativo estão funcionando corretamente, o problema mesmo é ficar pedindo a senha toda hora. </p><p>Desculpe pelo incômodo e se puderem me orientar agradeceria muito. </p><p><br> Att, </p><p>Renan Mendes Libba - Milazzo Fiat. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,pt-BR,"",renan.mendes
