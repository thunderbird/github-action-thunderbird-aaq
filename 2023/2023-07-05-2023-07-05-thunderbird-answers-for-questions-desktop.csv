Nem ír ki semmit a Thunderbird, csak a beérkező leveleim nem jelentek meg, de most kb. 10 perccel ezelőtt helyre állt és jöttek a leveleim. Nagyon fontos minden, mert könyvelő vagyok és az ügyfeleim leveleit a héten nem kaptam meg, csak úgy vettem észre, hogy hívtak telefonon, hogy nem válaszolok a levelükre. Most egyenlőre működik minden és nagyon köszönöm a segítséget, biztosan Ti voltatok akik segítettek. Üdv. Vargáné Rebi </p>",varganekisrebeka,false,0,0

The service that Thunderbird offers is saving the passwords for you so that you do not have to enter them every time you want to view messages. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0

It 'sounds like' you want a new email account. If so, you can get a free one at several places, such as <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://gmx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.com</a>. <a href=""http://usa.com"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.com</a> among others. You cannot change one account to another. The process is to add the new account and then delete the old account. I hope this is helpful, as I am only guessing at your issue. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
