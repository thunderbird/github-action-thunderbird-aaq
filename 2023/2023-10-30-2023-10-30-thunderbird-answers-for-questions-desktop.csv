Because I travel, I bring a copy of my entire TB Mail folder (e.g. 9drsumio.default) with me off my main home machine and run that in an external 1TB USB drive.  This set up has worked faultlessly until this trip out to Athens. The startup profile on this machine is set up to present me with the option to use a local profile (which is all IMAP and runs on the C: drive) or to switch and run off the external drive (T:) which is a mix of POP3 and IMAP. The Local C: drive configuration works fine.  The external T: drive config however works on all other accounts save my main POP3 account.  I'm getting the same error msg as Irosen888 but mine is solid. Looking in the console log I get the same 4 error entries every time I try to pull emails for this one POP3 account.  The other POP3 accounts are all on the same email Host so it's unlikely to be host related. The failing email account is 480MB and I have 80GB space on the external drive.  Hosting wise I'm only running at 5%. I therefore conclude that it isn't a space problem. I've checked around the file permissions and they are identical to the other POP3 accounts that are working. I've eliminated the router as a possible issue by switching to ""Hot Spot"" on my mobile but I get the same errors. I'm not using any antivirus software other than what comes with Windows 10. I've run CHKDSK on both drives - both came back clean. I can access this eMail account on my Mobile and Tablet too (but only using IMAP though). </p><p>Any ideas where I can look next? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",support80,false,0,0

Being an old hand at fixing Data Systems I've learnt the hard way not to put multiple changes into the mix as that can get very confusing when debuggung systems. It is with confidence therefore that I can say that using the TB internal ""Repair Folder"" function in the ""Folder Properties"" menu resolved my problem.  Just prior to that though I was on the 32bit version of TB but did the upgrade to the 64bit version which in itself didn't resolve the problem. Phaz </p>",support80,false,0,0
