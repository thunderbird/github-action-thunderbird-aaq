This caused me not to be able to download or send messages for one of my accounts.</em> </p><p>Why did you make changes in the first place? It should be simple enough to correct things, but it would be useful to know what settings you are currently using so please post the following information. </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> scroll down to 'Mail and News Accounts' section </li><li> Copy all the data in that section and paste the info into this forum question. </li></ul> <ul><li> Tell me the account number which is having the problem. </li></ul> <p>Then please logon to webmail account via a browser and confirm there are new messages on the server. This action confirms A) the password is good B) the server is accepting new mail. </p><p>some people find no new mail arrives on server and this can be due to too many emails on server and it has used up quota, so it cannot receive any more emails until some are deleted off server. Hence pop cannot download new mail as they do not exist. This particular problem mainly occurs with people who use Pop. </p><p>Whilst in webmail account, please empty the Spam folder and suggest you delete any really old emails to create more space. Also, in server Inbox look for the oldest not downloaded email - read it and either move to another folder or delete it as it is possible that email is causing a log jam and thus preventing a download. </p><p>Report back on what you discovered in the webmail account. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
