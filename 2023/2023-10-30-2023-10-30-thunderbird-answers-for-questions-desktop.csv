So, if you have switched it on then I can understand your concerns. </p><p>Most virus's get onto your computer via two methods. 1. You allow your curiousity to get the better of you which is what the sender is trying to accomplish. You get an email which has an attachment, you have no idea why you have the attachment. You may not even know who sent the email or why. You open the attachment when you should have just deleted the email. I've had numerous emails with bogus people saying they had attached an invoice, but I knew it could not be true.   Do not click on stuff which you should not click on. </p><p>2. You choose to click on a link which may be text or an image link, but you have not checked what the real link is before you clickon it.  Link might have the text which says it will open on a specific webpage, but inreality it does not.  Usually, your Firewall Anti-Virus will pick up and block a bogus website, but you cannot always be certain. </p><p>How to know the link is the correct one: Hover over the link and the real link is displayed in the bottom Status Bar. </p><p>If you delete emails which you do not like then remember to 'compact' that folder to completely remove all hidden traces.  </p><p>If you allow Anti-virus to scan your Thunderbird profile and it locates a problem and tries to fix it, then you stand a very good chance of losing emails. Please remember, AV products do not understand that an mbox file is not just one email, so killing a file could potentially delete all emails in that file or cause corruption of file. This is not the same as scanning an email being downloaded or file which you download from a browser. </p><p>There is nothing in a Thunderbird Profile which CCleaner can nor should touch. I've has all kinds of problems with passwords, sessions files etc getting 'cleaned up' and it causes no end of inconvenience for no good reason.  I cannot stress how important it is to make sure CCleaner goes no where near Thunderbird. </p><p><br> re&nbsp;: I put ""Get messages"", but it says it will get messages for all accounts, and I have like 5-6 accounts, and don't want to get all the email at once.  </p><p>There has been a bug report request to get that sorted.
