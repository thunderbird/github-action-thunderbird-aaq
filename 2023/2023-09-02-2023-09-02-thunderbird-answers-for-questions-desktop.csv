Despite all the help that you have offered, what I really want is global menu options within Thunderbird itself, by which I can permanently set my preferences. I remain very surprised that Mozilla have not seen fit to include such options, but instead have imposed their own preferences, apparently leaving only a technical fix as the solution. For those of us who prefer to use programs as they are delivered, without tinkering with the code which runs them, this is a very unsatisfactory situation. You suggest a profile backup.  Again, this seems to be a 'technical' fix, as I can see no option for it within the Thunderbird menus. Sorry, but I shall not be following your suggestions. It would be good if my comments could somehow reach Mozilla themselves, rather than remaining in this forum.  Is there any way that I can approach them direct? </p>",blackberrylane.co.uk,false,0,0

If stability is primary (but only temporarily), 102 is a good choice. The threading solution applies to both. Once done on 102, it should remain for 115.

There is, as documented above, already the facility to set one folder as desired and then set as the default for that account. Also, the above-mentioned user.js file option would protect you from the threading setting in any future thunderbird install. I strongly encourage you to remain with 115, as that is the only version that will be updated. The good news is that 115 is being regularly enhanced. The beta is up to 118 and the daily is at 119. 115 was a bumpy upgrade due to a truckload of new code to replace old code, but this gets smoother with each revision. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I really don't want to get into using config editor, I just want a simple menu option which I ( and other not-very-technical users ) can use.  If threading is as unpopular as you imply, it is rather surprising that Mozilla have not come up with a simple 'once-for all' menu solution. I should have thought it would be relatively straightforward to have global options for the whole of my Thunderbird installation, by which I could choose various options: 1)  Threading or not 2)  'Correspondents' or 'From' and 'Recipient' 3)  Descending or Ascending date order. Different people are sure to want different options, so why not give the flexibility to choose?   As far as I recall, earlier versions defaulted to 'From' and 'Recipient' and to Descending date order, and threading had not even been introduced as a possibility.

Instead select the account name itself.

Why was this IP listed?  122.3.175.206 has been classified as part of a proxy network. There is a type of malware using this IP that installs a proxy that can be used for nearly anything, including sending spam or stealing customer data. This should be of more concern than a Spamhaus listing, which is a symptom and not the problem.  The proxy is installed on a device - usually an Android mobile, firestick, smart doorbell, etc, but also iPads, and Windows computers - that is using your IP to send spam DIRECTLY to the internet via port 25: This is very often the result of third party ""free"" apps like VPNs, channel unlockers, streaming, etc being installed on someone's personal device, usually a phone. Technical information  Important: If this IP operates as a mail server, it should look and behave like a mail server. As it stands, the HELO used appears to be dynamic and this may cause confusion as that is behaviour commonly observed in malware/proxy networks.  Recent connections:  (IP, UTC timestamp, HELO value)  122.3.175.206 2023-09-01 01:05:00 <a href=""http://122.3.175.206.pldt.net"" rel=""nofollow"">122.3.175.206.pldt.net</a>  Important points:      The HELOs are often dynamic-looking rDNS and usually claim to be from geographically very different networks OR spoofs of major brands.     They can include impossible HELOs like ""<a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>"", ""<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>"", ""<a href=""http://comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">comcast.net</a>"" - Gmail, Outlook and Comcast do not use these. These are all fake.     If the HELO does not make sense for the IP generating it, it should be looked at closely.     There is often more than one compromised device.     Guest networks should also be secured.  This is a simple explanation of how it can work: <a href=""https://www.spamhaus.com/resource-center/when-doorbells-go-rogue/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spamhaus.com/resource-center/when-doorbells-go-rogue/</a>  Any devices with ""free"" VPNs, TV streaming, channel unlocking, or 3rd-party apps installed are the first things to check. What should be done about it?  We very strongly recommend securing your firewall to not allow any packets outbound on port 25, except those coming from any email server(s) on your local network. Remote sending of email to servers on the Internet should still work if web-based, or configured properly to use port 587 using SMTP-AUTH. Guest networks should be secured too.  After port 25 is outbound is secured, the proxy needs to be found and removed. We can only see what's coming from the NAT (public) IP; anything inside your network is visible only to you. You can start logging at the router or firewall to see what's trying to use port 25 and that should lead you right to the compromised device(s).  </blockquote>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
