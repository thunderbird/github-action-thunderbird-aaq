If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded and all other preferences	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

I really don't want to get into using config editor, I just want a simple menu option which I ( and other not-very-technical users ) can use.  If threading is as unpopular as you imply, it is rather surprising that Mozilla have not come up with a simple 'once-for all' menu solution. I should have thought it would be relatively straightforward to have global options for the whole of my Thunderbird installation, by which I could choose various options: 1)  Threading or not 2)  'Correspondents' or 'From' and 'Recipient' 3)  Descending or Ascending date order. Different people are sure to want different options, so why not give the flexibility to choose?   As far as I recall, earlier versions defaulted to 'From' and 'Recipient' and to Descending date order, and threading had not even been introduced as a possibility.

For those of us who prefer to use programs as they are delivered, without tinkering with the code which runs them, this is a very unsatisfactory situation. You suggest a profile backup.  Again, this seems to be a 'technical' fix, as I can see no option for it within the Thunderbird menus. Sorry, but I shall not be following your suggestions.

Otherwise, it will be the usual long slog to fix them all – again. I appreciate your point about there being many functions and that it would be difficult to provide simple menu options for each, but I have two comments to make about that: 1)  Menus can have sub-menus and if it can be done in config editor, it could only be a short step to put it into a menu system. 2)  It would not be so bad, except that all (or at least most) of these fixes that I want are only to change BACK to what used to be the old TB default values.
