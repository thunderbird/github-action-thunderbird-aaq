All accounts were set up using protocols pulled from the TB database when the accounts were first registered, and using primary or app passwords where required to support 2-factor-authorisation. </p><p>All of these accounts, except iCloud, present all folders created in the email accounts, and work perfectly. For the iCloud account, sending and receiving emails work perfectly, but only those folders that have been created since the original registration in TB can be seen and accessed. Those additional folders have definitely been successfully synchronised back to the original online account, but the remainder of the folders and subfolders that still exist in the online account since it was originally created (none appear to have been lost) are not synchronising with the TB iCloud account, and are not appearing in TB under the iCloud account name. </p><p>I have tried deleting the iCloud account from TB - having checked that the folders that exist in the TB iCloud account have been synchronised back to the main online account - then adding the iCloud account back again using a freshly-generated Apple ID app password, but the problem remains: none of the non-TB generated folders appear in the TB iCloud account. I noticed that TB spent a considerable time checking for additional folders in the iCloud account immediately after adding the account, and after the previously TB-generated folders became visible, but no more folders were synchronised after that. </p><p>I found an older Mozilla Support question concerning exactly this problem, but the topic was archived before a solution to this problem could be suggested. In that thread, it was suggested to check the flag in the properties for the folder, ""When getting new messages for this account, always check this folder"", and set the flag if not already set. This 'solution' is not valid for this problem, as the TB folder properties can only be checked if the folder is visible, and setting the flag made to difference to this behaviour. Interestingly though, when I performed that suggested check, none of those flags were already set for the folders that are visible.  </p><p>Can anyone account for this behaviour? It seems to me that it might be an issue of authority of access to the folders in the original online iCloud account, but I'm not an expert in these matters. </p><p>Can anyone suggest how to fix this? </p><p>Can anyone suggest, is this an Apple iCloud email problem, or a Thunderbird problem?

This should be either automatically the same address the email was sent to or at least optionally selectable choice in preferences instead just always using my default email address. </p><p>Longer version: 1) I order something from Acme Inc. I give them my alias email in format of user@acmeinc.domain.etc.  2) there is an issue with the order. Acme Inc contacts me by sending email to user@acmeinc.domain.etc 3) I get the email. I reply by pressing the reply option in Thunderbird 4) Thunderbird sets my sender address as user@domain.etc instead of using the email address user@acmeinc.domain.etc the email was sent to 5) Before sending the email I will have to manually go and type in the address that I want to use so that a) my actual email address is revealed to automatic systems b) I can potentially be able to see who leaked my email address and where (marketing, spam, ..) </p><p><strong>The format of the email address is not an issue. The email address used when replying is.</strong> </p><p>Please make it so, that when pressing the reply button the same email address the message was sent to will be used by default, or atleast add this as an option for the user to select in the preferences. </p><p>The fact that email programs have junk (e)mail options does not remove the fact that junk mail still happens and the actual solution is to remove unwanted junk at the server, not the client level (we have many, many, nice devices, don't we). </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1589916;1589942;1589944;1590039;,skape

This includes an 'All Mail' and a 'Archives' folder. For reasons that should be obvious, I only want the one called 'Archives' to be included in the archives unified folder. Unfortunately Thunderbird is automatically including both of these folders in the unified archives folder. I can open the unified folder properties and unselect the 'All Mail' folder from the search options, however the folder is still shown as one of the subfolders in the unified archives folder. </p><p>How can I actually get Thunderbird to remove this subfolder from its unified archives? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",firefox2377

Drafts are saved locally on my computer. If you write a letter for a long time, then periodically displays a sign: ""Could not save the message as a draft. Error sending the message."" Forced saving a draft is also not possible with the same message. Thunderbird software version 102.13.0 (64 bit). Despite the fact that it cannot save a draft, the program freely allows you to drag and copy messages into the Drafts folder. If you create a new POP3 account, then there is no error with drafts. Please help. What can be done? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",weandi
