I have 2 gmx accounts with the same full name (not aliases) introduced when they were created. The parameters (email address, pswd) for these accounts are different, of course. When I want to create IMAP (or POP3) accounts in Thunderbird for the 2nd gmx address, this fails. and I get the message : « unable to login at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password ». This forces me to manage my emails as webmail only, which defeats the main purpose of  using Thunderbird, of course (i.e. to manage all emails/accounts on the same page). How can I go around this issue? Do I have to change my full name on the gmx server? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1605196;1605217;,prfndr
