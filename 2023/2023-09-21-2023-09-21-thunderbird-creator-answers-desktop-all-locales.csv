However, I am missing the small green unread-button, that I also use to change the status of the mail in the table view.  As I use the unread status to sort mails and keep mails up on the list. To quickly change the read status back is part of my way of organising my work. Of course there is a menu and a context menu but all this requires more moves.  Can I customise what I can see and interact with on a card? </p><p>KR, idi </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ydi

I have 2 gmx accounts with the same full name (not aliases) introduced when they were created. The parameters (email address, pswd) for these accounts are different, of course. When I want to create IMAP (or POP3) accounts in Thunderbird for the 2nd gmx address, this fails. and I get the message : « unable to login at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password ». This forces me to manage my emails as webmail only, which defeats the main purpose of  using Thunderbird, of course (i.e. to manage all emails/accounts on the same page). How can I go around this issue? Do I have to change my full name on the gmx server? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1605196;,prfndr

The bad news:  All my  pre-Supernova CSS syntax in userChrome.css is broken.  It would be very nice to have a handbook of CSS classes and syntax so that we could continue to be able to customize the new UI and at least get it back to the condition we had before the Supernova upgrade.  I have found some good code online which has allowed me to change a few colors, but it would be nice to be able to do much more customization of this great open source software!  Thanks.

Now when in games using full screen windowed mode, the new mail alert pops up over the game, where it never used to do that.  If I'm in an exclusive full screen game, the alert causes the game to lose focus, which again, never happened in 102. </p><p>The calendar alerts sometimes steal focus in either full screen mode, but sometimes not.  It seems entirely random.  This is not new to 115, but it's still annoying.  I can be in the same game, hear the notification and not lose focus.  Other times, even in the same game, the notification steals the game's focus. </p><p>I checked the settings, they are the same as before.  I prefer Thunderbird's notification over the system notification style, but it doesn't seem to obey the system's focus assist rules. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",jim.chaney
