The bad news:  All my  pre-Supernova CSS syntax in userChrome.css is broken.  It would be very nice to have a handbook of CSS classes and syntax so that we could continue to be able to customize the new UI and at least get it back to the condition we had before the Supernova upgrade.  I have found some good code online which has allowed me to change a few colors, but it would be nice to be able to do much more customization of this great open source software!  Thanks. (For example, how can I change the colors on the compose window?) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",aseatanner

Now when in games using full screen windowed mode, the new mail alert pops up over the game, where it never used to do that.  If I'm in an exclusive full screen game, the alert causes the game to lose focus, which again, never happened in 102. </p><p>The calendar alerts sometimes steal focus in either full screen mode, but sometimes not.  It seems entirely random.  This is not new to 115, but it's still annoying.  I can be in the same game, hear the notification and not lose focus.  Other times, even in the same game, the notification steals the game's focus. </p><p>I checked the settings, they are the same as before.  I prefer Thunderbird's notification over the system notification style, but it doesn't seem to obey the system's focus assist rules. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",jim.chaney
