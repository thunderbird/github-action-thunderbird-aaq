I have 2 gmx accounts with the same full name (not aliases) introduced when they were created. The parameters (email address, pswd) for these accounts are different, of course. When I want to create IMAP (or POP3) accounts in Thunderbird for the 2nd gmx address, this fails. and I get the message : « unable to login at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password ». This forces me to manage my emails as webmail only, which defeats the main purpose of  using Thunderbird, of course (i.e. to manage all emails/accounts on the same page). How can I go around this issue? Do I have to change my full name on the gmx server? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1605196;1605217;,prfndr

My mail provider and ISP is British Telecom (BT). I use SMTP not IMAP. A couple of days ago TB suddenly stopped sending emails (and I mean suddenly - one minute ok, next minute not) with a message saying it could not connect with the SMTP server and requested a 'new' password. Giving one (i.e. the correct one, again) produced even more errors along the same vein.  Neither stopping and starting TB nor a computer restart made any difference. I seem to remember it wasn't receiving then either but on some support site somewhere it suggested I ensured my Windows was up to date. I did that and emails are now received (but still won't send). </p><p>I've been searching the internet for ideas but nothing has suggested anything other than check the password, the SMTP server name, the connection security, the authentication method and the port. See the attached screenshot. None of these things has changed for ages, yet it started to misbehave very suddenly. I did actually change the password on my account and tried that - made no difference.  I have stopped my ZoneAlarm firewall temporarily, tried a send which failed again and restarted it, so  it's not the firewall (Windows FW is off). I have another BT email account in TB and they both do the same thing. I have three other accounts in TB and they all work properly as they go through two other providers' SMTP servers. I set up a new BT account and made it an IMAP one in TB. Same result. Deleted it. The odd thing is that if I access my mail through the web browser that BT provide, emails can be sent and received no problem. It's for that reason that the BT support desk will not look into this problem. I've called them twice now. The first agent suggested I contacted Microsoft, for some reason, which I tried to do but their support website says they do not do telephone support any more and all the suggested Help topics vaguely related to this problem are concerned with MS products like Outlook and Hotmail. The second washed his hands of the problem as soon as he heard that webmail works and strongly suggested I try Thunderbird support, so here I am. It does seem logical I suppose. </p><p>Sorry to be so verbose  but I wanted to get everything out.  Any advice would be useful but I hope someone has the magic bullet.
