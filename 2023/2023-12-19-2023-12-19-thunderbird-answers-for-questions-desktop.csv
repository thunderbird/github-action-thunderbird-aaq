I had a look at crazy <a href=""http://domains.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">domains.com.au</a> and they appear to offer full domain registration in the .name space </p><p>I think you need to be aware that all domain registrations have the potential to have a web site, email or even FTP and Gopher servers, to step back about 30 years.  These are all just protocols that require infrastructure and some registration in DNS. </p><p>Gandi offer domains specifically for email hosting and can be accessed for such through the Thunderbird new account wizard or check here <a href=""http://shop.gandi.net/en/domain/suggest?"" rel=""nofollow"">shop.gandi.net/en/domain/suggest?</a> as a registrar for the .name space,  you could transfer your existing domain registrations there. </p><p>Can you tell me who your existing registrar is in the .name domain (the actual domain name would be good as well). </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

But for completeness will outline its structure and function. dot name has been around for 20years. Its structure is firstname dot familyname dot name, and includes email forwarding to a similar structure, ie, firstname @ familyname dot name. </p><p>The gmail authentication operates on the part to the right of the @. familyname dot name. Clearly using smith, jones, Mohamed, etc, many family names have millions of firstnames, ie millions of 3rd level (only the first one to register gets the unique 3rd level domain, joe or joan, etc). Hence, no individual can own the second level, and thus no individual can verify their email because they don't own the second level domain, no DNS, etc. So all dot name domain client who use the forwarding will come a cropper. </p><p>Verisign, the register for dot name, are playing hardball, saying the forwarding is only used for replies, but gmail, and I suspect, many others will follow their lead, are comparing incoming and outgoing to trap scammers, ie, those pretending to be someone they are not. </p>",longinthetooth,false,0,0

Thansk for the link to gandi. Instead of Exchange they use Wordpress, explicitly for web hosting, no mention of email management and forwarding </p><p>So, I'm thinking of using dot au. Essentially replacing the dot name with dot au. But importantly, me owning the secondly level with my familyname, and hence the ability to verify the domain, and pass the authentication process. hence fisrtname @ familyname dot au. Consequently minimal change to my regular contacts. </p><p>But, the big but, is how do I go from merely owning the second level domain to setting up and managing the emails and their forwarding to my ISP. </p>",longinthetooth,false,0,0

But it is an email application in which keeping track to the various threads of a discussion is entirely relevant.

The fact that you are able to use your account indicates that your password still works. However, to be safe, you may wish to log into your online account and change the password for peace of mind. The problem you are experiencing is because someone is sending mail with your email address, which is something that is a common hack.
