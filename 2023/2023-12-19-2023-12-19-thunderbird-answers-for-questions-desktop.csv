I refuse to be locked into proprietary protocols and file formats.  But what is a dot name domain? </p><p>Are you referring to the name gTLD  I think the registrar involved will have more to do with the access to DNS records than the actual TLD.  I had a look at crazy <a href=""http://domains.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">domains.com.au</a> and they appear to offer full domain registration in the .name space </p><p>I think you need to be aware that all domain registrations have the potential to have a web site, email or even FTP and Gopher servers, to step back about 30 years.  These are all just protocols that require infrastructure and some registration in DNS. </p><p>Gandi offer domains specifically for email hosting and can be accessed for such through the Thunderbird new account wizard or check here <a href=""http://shop.gandi.net/en/domain/suggest?"" rel=""nofollow"">shop.gandi.net/en/domain/suggest?</a> as a registrar for the .name space,  you could transfer your existing domain registrations there. </p><p>Can you tell me who your existing registrar is in the .name domain (the actual domain name would be good as well). </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

But it is an email application in which keeping track to the various threads of a discussion is entirely relevant.  My opinion is that those that don't want to know if the message they just got is part of a larger conversation they have been having over perhaps a period of years are the ones that are treating it like a SMS texting app.   </p> <blockquote> Stop forcing changes on us. We don't want them.  </blockquote> Some do.  Not necessarily us.   I agree. I should be able to change the settings so things look and work as they did before.  But I am not loosing to much sleep over it. I am however filing bugs in bugzilla about issue I identify.  What are you doing? <blockquote> Fix the tool bar and Search Bar so it works like it did for the previous decade.  </blockquote>  I have no idea what you are talking about.  Perhaps elucidate your issues so others can understand.  AS far as I am aware there have been no changed in search.  It is the same dodgy somewhat broken thing it has been for decades. If it is not doing it for you.

I can say that Thunderbird accessibility to those with disabilities, especially those using screen readers has been improved by the move away from XUL interfaces to more web technologies based ones.  I might not like how they look,  but I have to acknowledge where progress has been made. </p><p>There is a user experience mailing list,  have you contributed? <a href=""https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/ux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/ux</a> What about offered feedback using the link on the Thunderbird help menu? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
