But for completeness will outline its structure and function. dot name has been around for 20years. Its structure is firstname dot familyname dot name, and includes email forwarding to a similar structure, ie, firstname @ familyname dot name. </p><p>The gmail authentication operates on the part to the right of the @. familyname dot name. Clearly using smith, jones, Mohamed, etc, many family names have millions of firstnames, ie millions of 3rd level (only the first one to register gets the unique 3rd level domain, joe or joan, etc). Hence, no individual can own the second level, and thus no individual can verify their email because they don't own the second level domain, no DNS, etc. So all dot name domain client who use the forwarding will come a cropper. </p><p>Verisign, the register for dot name, are playing hardball, saying the forwarding is only used for replies, but gmail, and I suspect, many others will follow their lead, are comparing incoming and outgoing to trap scammers, ie, those pretending to be someone they are not. </p>",longinthetooth,false,0,0

In fact, the two are solutions for different problems. </p><p><strong>2FA</strong> ensures that anybody who wants to login to your email account or who wants to connect to it using an email client like Thunderbird must provide a second factor (the 2F in 2FA). It is not enough to just know your username or e-mail address and your password. A second factor is required in addition to the password, which would be the first factor. An important characteristic of this second factor is that it is not some fixed value like your password (something you know). The second factor is often linked to you as a person (think of your fingerprint or your face, something you are) or it is something that is valid only for a limited time and can only be generated by a special device or tool (something you own). Both types require you to be present while connecting to your email account. You must present your fingerprint or your face or you must read the currently valid code from the special device. It is difficult to automate these actions. Therefore email clients like thunderbird usually don't support 2FA. Usually you don't want to present the second factor every time you open your email client. </p><p><strong>OpenPGP</strong> and <strong>S/MIME</strong> are ways to encrypt email between the sender and the receiver. The sender and the receiver agree on a shared secret (usually using something called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"" rel=""nofollow"">public-key cryptography</a>). The sender then encrypts the email on his device using this secret. Only then does he send the email to the receiver. The receiver then uses the secret to decrypt the email on his device. During the whole way the email takes from sender to receiver it is encryped. This is even true while it is sitting on some email server, waiting for it to be delivered. Nobody except the sender and the receiver are able to ever decrypt the message. </p><p>You can <strong>combine 2FA and OpenPGP and S/MIME</strong>. You can use the former the make it impossible to access your email account for some attacker who managed to steal your password. You can use the later to make sure that nobody can read an email other the the receiver you want to be able to read it. </p><p>Thunderbird supports OpenPGP and S/MIME out of the box. I am not aware of any way to use 2FA. </p>",lutz_horn,false,0,0
