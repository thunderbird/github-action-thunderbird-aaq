Questo comporta incessantemente un messaggio di errore con apertura di una finestra dove mi chiede i dati di accesso, la chiudo e dopo pochi secondi riappare rendendo impossibile lavorare. Se la lascio aperta posso continuare a lavorare ma non effettua l'invio dei messaggi di altri account. Fino a ieri funzionava tutto bene, come posso fare per escluderlo nuovamente da invio/ricezione? Naturalmente le spunte sono disattivate. Grazie e buon lavoro. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,"",ri.ser.leo

I have a number of accounts and find the Unified Account is great to do a quick scan and act on the emails most pressing to respond to. In the Unified Account Inbox, the emails I delete or mark as junk are automatically moved from Inbox to the Trash or Junk folders. They no longer exist in the Unified Inbox. When I move emails to their respective folders in the individual accounts by the click, drag and drop method, the emails are moved to those folders but they continue to be shown in the Unified Inbox. No big deal, except the risk is that I miss moving an email from time to time, and these superfluous emails take up space on my PC unnecessarily. Can you advise how I can move emails from the Unified Inbox to the individual folders and not leave a copy in the Unified Inbox? Is it safe to delete the emails in the Unified Inbox that have been moved, and not loose the moved emails in there individual folders? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",maat2747
