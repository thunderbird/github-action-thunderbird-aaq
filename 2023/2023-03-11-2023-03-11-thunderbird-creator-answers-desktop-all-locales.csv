1407740,2023-03-11 11:31:26 -0800,2023-03-12 00:21:40 -0800,Development Request?,"<p>Hi, </p><p>Update: I forgot to put in a few things, one is that you could host internet content and pages on your own machine through the software, and only needed an IP Address.  Which is a useful feature. </p><p>Search pages all open tabs, search pages in hiistory, search pages from a range of book marks.  So you can bs mvtrs K and find something you saw before.  With a classical search language like Lycos and google, used to use. </p><p>The word processor and a document reader, that wraps text and elements from Fiat's like pdf, todjebghym easy to read on screen.  Support for open formats, PDF, and modern word. </p> <hr> <p>I was wondering if you can pass this around to the development teams please? </p><p>Disclaimer: I am disabled and often ot well enough to deal with my computing environment, so I can't help do thise, but from my design experience, I can point in the right direction. </p><p>We need something like thunderbird integrated into all browsers. The world has gone mad.  The feature sets on some even desktop browsers is limited, mobile is worse.  We need something that gives beyond the old Opera M2 desktop browsers days. </p><p>Most people use a phone as their computer.  But mobile phones are so dumbed down it makes it impossible.  This has spread to edge on windows.  It is more difficult yo use in a dedicated way. </p><p>Details: </p><p>A thunderbird user plugin and dedicated app in a browser, and for as many browsers that support the plugin/add-on. </p><p>- All thunderbird and M2 features with index backup and correct recoverability (which was a problem in M2).  File folders in the index are real folders with name and index data relationships in case of crash, and loose of index even, the complete index can be recreated as it was no difference, except for any unrecoverable entries triple time stamped with remaining data and corrupted in a corruption file.  The tripple time stamp is when created, when last used by user, and present time stamp.  It can be extended by having additional cached histuru of when the use last used it, or 10 or so times.  This allows the user to think back to what they may have been working in at that the, and identify losses and potential recovery strategies.  Anti corruption data recovery coding used, to resort vorrot database indexes.  This corruption was an issue with M2. </p><p>- Integration into a side panel, and any side of the screen.  Please see my interface  suggestions in the office level textmaker pro on Android, which tucks all the word desktop like GUI functions into hamburger popup menus. Multiple pop up menues allow sub menues and multiple planes to popup, you can drag select and copy in between.  A split side by side or one above the other verticle mail/document/panel compare function. </p><p>- Textmaker cones out of the company efforts from Euro office from the 1980's.  The person in charge might be the same person, and might welcome a takeover to use his code for opensource.  His products are well written. </p><p>- Search, copy paste anything, including tabs list. </p><p>- Notes on everything, allowing useful notes with subject, tags and time, and in general, like Opera M2 did.  Savable offline only for privacy, and both offline and online for backup security.  Attached to data described, and as seperate files as desired. </p><p>- Wordprocessing integration, with spell and grammar check, search and word counts, merge and document compare, with sophisticated email/document/file find features, able to write in html and JavaScript etc for website and web page editing.  Not Word, just the useful bits to make it small, but still able to do some site, blog or a good book on.  They are all related code.  The document search, compare merge mentioned above. </p><p>-2 an extension to the word processor, wouldn't to make an seperate extension to make it a tool for sophisticated website and programming development, programming development and project management with integration to GitHub etc. Think like old code warrior days, with visual layout for web and visual object/components. It, itself, is extendible. It uses the word processing code, and the word processor uses it as an add on, to keep size down by, and ability to release as a seperate dedicated add on to thunderbird (requiring only hooks).  It could into one product. </p><p>- Able to be used on email, forms, feilds  </p><p>- Back up and save anything  anywhere. </p><p>- ""Hide interface a lot"" motif, and do virtually anything rather then hardly anything motif. </p><p>- Ability to rearrange menues and any visual element. </p><p>- Some secure non threatening macros, even if sometimes parts of the macro need to be stepped verified by pressing a same key, or placed popup icon on screen in the same place each time (user certainty of where to respond next, and situational awareness if macro has potential problems or has changed).  It is simple macros to replace simple key presses with maybe some user selection of input involved at stages of the macro. </p><p>So, the structure would be group of exclusive objects, dedicated hook interface for development/website/forum  build project app plugin, group of services objects to app and plugin, group of development/website/forum  build project plugin to app.  No other program can use these unless these are designed to let them exclusively. </p><p>If any part fails, other parts can continue to develop independently.  The development/website/forum  build project app plugin can exist as it's own app etc.  If it fails, it is simply not available for thunderbird edition.  Sub units can also follow this, reverting back to what worked previously as things advance among a new path. </p><p>JavaScript for transportability between browsers, with C to JavaScript translation compile where and if required, to seed start the code base all in one language for the future. </p><p>Further browser feature integration: </p><p>The above includes saving the current session or sessions anywhere on the system the user can, even to an safe object. To have a lost of alternative places based on where you have saved that data in the past, and any data (makes it easy to rekeatedky fo between one or more, source locations to one orr more destination locations doing file copies. </p><p>Some suggestions that Opera was too frightened to do, where: to break down the list into nested subgroups (which can be named, and searched for during a tab list search).  Multiple lines of separate (duplicate for list editing copy paste delete is also possible) scrollable lists for difference subjects or work areas, savable to different session files for backup (apart from copy list into bookmarks without the back history, except maybe the previouse single site that linked/led them to that site).  The user can put their work on one line, their chats on a other etc etc etc, and select which one they presently want to work on.  The lines can go onto a collapsible menues attached to a resizable tab bar.  So you can deepen the bar a number of lines and scroll to more, and put the Y amount of lines you want to use at the moment at the top.  The user selects the lines they want to work on, which goes to the work section on top, following that, is the 5 most recent lines, followed by a the other lines in user chosen order (my order, date, or line name A-z ascending or descending).  The use is always in control and can pick how they want to work. The user can also select how many lines for the history lines.  5 may seem a lot, but sometimes people will need more.  The control menues is on the line.  Simple dots are big enough for control menues,but on mobiles you need more space.  Intimately you only need one single line to get to everything in all the features for thunderbird plugin development and this etc, because of expanding menues.  Simple and effective. With the search functionality, you can find anything in all the user dude structures.  Which means some should be user password/screen lock verification protected to see them.  Which means giving the user the option of locking the search functions is a good idea, with user time out of inactivity before they relock, and multiple levels of unlock, instead of the user unlocking data here and there.  I'm interested in professional level use browser, which is useful for independent casual researchers like myself as well.  I'm the multiple level locking, the user canock individual data to one of more levels, or levels below a certain level, and individually each time as they wish.  The most important they give an independent password per file, next level is an independent lock, as in screen lock on phone or fingerprint.  The next level is to give the data a level, 0 is the highest, infinity is the lowest, password or unlocked verification on each. The user then ulocks the levels he wants to be used and the timeout.  Fur instance, if he lets a friend use his machine, he ulocks the lowest level he was t the person to have access too. Strangers, work collesges and assistants asell, he can just select a level and timer, and importantly ability to change or not, to see or not, to merge or not, and walk away.  This also allows shared group work remotely.  A group can be given an common level, individual users can be given similar setup codes to form a group.  But, let's say level 10 allows everybody to see the group content, but level 9 allows some to add into the group, 8, to add to the group, 7 to suggest change single item that needs approval (another feature to add), 6 time changes single item per unit of time, another 5 to suggest changes to groups of items with a approval, another 4 groups per unit of time, and 3 other groups in general.  Now, let's say these level numbers start at 1000, or 19,00 or a million, or a billion, and the work colleague, friend, family, or public stuff at 10x level greater each category, with all your private stuff lower.  However the user wants to set it up.  They can then share access publically to anybody if they wish, into the account that had it attached.  Somebody can come along and ask, hey, anybody know of any medical information to help me with this condition and leave a link, and watch for links to turn up in the bookmarks.  No privacy violation, it can all be anonymous.  This leads to a rule based macro language (using javascript contract to act as calls to the JavaScript engine) to customise rules due each level.  But, looking sideways, individually sideways l, a structure for groups and users can be setup where the group or use is nominated to have access to resources.  The good thing is.  They one year levels can be introduced, next advanced levels, sharing and the next macros and  then groups, giving the development team a omg time to build up to a final version. </p><p>The above structures can attract new people to work on the different new features of it. One group may bring in Wordprocessing, another add site building on that, another hosting, another coding, another project management.  The isolation of structures, allow independent development without affecting the development of parts further up the heirarchy, and can be chopped and birned if they don't work out, hardly affecting the main core work further up.  An interface to strict resources is given, and you walk away and let them (competently) get along with it.  It will not be that simple of course, but you have ability to chop off and burn that which is unreasonable and start again or not.  </p><p>Thank you, Wayne. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1570157;1570178;,2w
