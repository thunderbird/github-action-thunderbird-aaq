Here is my concern: </p><p>I have two laptops, each running Thunderbird. They both can access my local ISP and download email – whatever email is on that server will download to both laptops, no matter which one polls for it first. And mail will remain on that server until I delete it from there since TB is set to leave messages on server. </p><p>I thought I could set up my Gmail account that way – so that each laptop using TB could download all recent email – and both could get all of the email, no matter which one accessed it first. </p><p>Well – it doesn’t seem that it works that way. If I download the email to laptop A – then when I try from laptop B – it doesn’t download any that was already downloaded to laptop A, and visa versa, since apparently it is only downloading each email once – to whichever laptop polls for it first – not both like my local email server. </p><p>I have Gmail set up as POP, with the option to leave messages on server checked, and each laptop works fine independently – but all of the email can never be downloaded to both laptops – one is always missing some. </p><p>After I download any messages, the messages that are downloaded are not marked as read on the Gmail server - they remain marked as unread, but they will only download to the first laptop that polls for new messages. </p><p>I was hoping that someone might be able to tell me a trick to make this work. I do not want to change to IMAP since it seems that would make the ""confusion"" worse - if one laptop deletes a message, it would be deleted from the server as well. I want to continue to use POP3, but I want each laptop to operate independently and be able to get all of the new email that is on the server - no matter which one polls first. </p><p>I did read the info about Recent mode - but I'm not sure that will work as it seems it will only ""show"" 30 days of emails - what about the rest? I have many going back several years that I want to keep, and don't want anything to delete them either from TB or Gmail. </p><p>Seems there must be a way to do this, and it seems like it is a TB issue in the settings. </p><p>I appreciate any help that anyone can offer. Thanks! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1562598;1562599;1562602;1562627;1562660;1562672;1562705;1727262;,SumoBot

I installed Thunderbird and configured the settings as follows: </p><p>Server settings for each email address: </p><p>Server name         <a href=""http://imap.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.aol.com</a>           port 993 User Name           [email]@verizon.net Connection security      SSL/TLS Authentication method         OAuth2 </p><p>Outgoing server: Description:    &lt;not specified&gt; Server name:      <a href=""http://smtp.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.aol.com</a> User name:      [email address number 1]@verizon.net Authentication method:     OAuth2 Connection Security:   STARTTLS </p><p>I can receive emails sent to both addresses.  Both show up in their respective Thunderbird inboxes.  But I can only send emails from email address number 1, the one used for the outgoing server.  When I try to send an email from email address number 2, I get a popup that says </p><p>Sending of the message failed. An error occurred when sending mail.  The mail server responded:  Request failed; Mailbox unavailable.  Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. </p><p>One thing I should add is that email address number 2 was, under Verizon, an alias for an auto-generated email account which in turn was a sub-email of email account number 1.  But ever since Aol took them over, I've always logged into email address number 2 via the Aol website, so clearly Aol treats it as its own email address.  </p><p>Any help will be most appreciated!
