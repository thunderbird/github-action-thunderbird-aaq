If you must minimise everything surely the word 'Get' would be more indicative of what it does.  Not everyone uses 'the cloud' and many have poor eyesight making such a small symbol difficult to see and interpret.  Thanks for the quick response. </p>,johnbl,false,0,0

Most antivirus products that implement mail scanning (something I consider a waste of time) issue self signed encryption certificates which are not trusted by Thunderbird.  Most of these companies have instruction on how to manually add their untrusted certificates to the Thunderbird store.  But you in doing so vouvh for the validity of the certificate,  something Thunderbird can not verify because the certificates are not in the chain of trust TLS relies upon. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
