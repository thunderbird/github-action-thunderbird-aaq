There is a new toolbar called 'Message List Header' and by default it has the 'Quick Filter' button on it (Note you can aso put this onto the Unified Toolbar) and the right of that is a new icon - right click on that new icons to see options. Table View is the old standard view with column headers.  Cards View is a new option which does not use columns and each email will use at theast two lines.
