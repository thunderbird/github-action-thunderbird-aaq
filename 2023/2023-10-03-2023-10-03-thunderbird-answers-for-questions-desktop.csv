Le soluzioni sono orientate alla risoluzione se hai ancora il profilo Thunderbird. Invece l'aggiornamento mi ha eliminato completamente il profilo anche da Windows 11 e dal disco del PC. Quindi io mi ritrovavo come non l'avessi mai installato in precedenza. Dopo l'aggiornamento, quando ho aperto Thunderbird mi diceva di creare un profilo, ma non mi permetteova di farlo perchè mi presentava una maschera di errore vuota. Ho dovuto disinstallare Thunderbird aggiornato e reinstallarlo. Quindi mi chiedevo se ci fosse la possibilità che l'aggiornamento avesse messo il mio profilo nascosto, oppure rinominato (tipo old) in un punto diverso del disco del PC, o qualcos'altro. Mi chiedevo se ci fosse la possibilità di recuperare in altro modo per esempio con un tool, oppure se c'è una specie di cestino sul disco dove poter recuperarlo. Perchè andando in C, users, app data, roming, ecc. il profilo non esiste più. </p>",elvfirefox,false,0,0

And even though noone is complaining here, we found many people complaining on social media about this new program that makes us wait 3 minutes or more before we can even use it because it's so complicated. We found someone to guide us about how to go back to the old program. Part of this job was to apparently do what you suggested, and going to the troubleshoot mode.

The title of the thread you sent me to was <strong>How to move the 'Menu Bar' above the 'Unified toolbar'</strong>.  My original request was to give an option for allowing for the TB toolbar to remain separate from the System Title.  As I indicated in my reply, I found out how I could do that,  by unchecking ""Hide system window titlebar"".  But that solution alone left the TB tool bar in the wrong location (above the menu bar).   On a system with the tool bar un-unified, following the instructions in the <strong>How to move the 'Menu Bar' above the 'Unified toolbar'</strong> thread will move the tool bar so the three bars will be in the order System Title bar, Menu bar, and TB tool bar. So I can confirm that the solution in that thread works in the situation where there is no unified tool bar. </p>",product,false,0,0

Outlook has a similar system and so does/did Lotus Notes!!! They all have their own extensions. </p><p>Intersting you used the import function. - Normally, creating (using the existing profile folder) your profile would import the whole folder structure including any customisations which are stored in the prefs.js file (usually associated with the about:config we use to edit) and all your mail folders, and sub folders associated with each account </p><p>I have 4 main accounts and each with their sub folders, using imap then builds these on the server side as well, so there is always a copy there in case things go belly up - so long as you dont delele locally, they remian on the main server. I backup anyway, not just with TimeMachine, but a manual copy to an ext drive </p><p>For some reason your last sentence does not load fully, but I managed to read to the end - so you are most welcome. Glad to have been of some help. Know what its like to loose emails!!! </p><p>But I recommend you create the profile using the main folder.

Now and then there is an issue, but helps to have TB running to go and delete the current PW that's stored in TB. </p><p>I suggest you log into your apple mail via a browser and reset the pw to a simple one for the moment, before you do much else </p><p>For the notes under: 1. Moving the app - you could do or you can do a couple of things. Rename the current one and then install a fresh copy. 2. Better to copy the Profile into same folder and rename it or the current one so 2 instances. (Hope you have enough disk space!) or into another folder (part to backup or part to use this, in which case better left in same folder 3/4. As noted in 1. yes, install a fresh version and run with the -P (needs to be a capital P I believe) and then pick up one of the Profile copies. </p><p>As you are running IMAP you could try the authentication process by installing a virgin TB and create new account in it for your Apple mail, having sorted the pw first as above, and that may reset the authentication 2sv or 2fa to access your apple mail. If that works, and being IMAP it will reload all your mail from the server, that may well be enough. </p><p>Hope that's fairly clear&nbsp;:-) </p><p>I guess you are in the US, only mention due to time diif incase you want to ping mw on Whatsapp or something, i can send you my contact details </p>",acdp,false,0,0

Nessuno deve pagare per aggiungere una semplice app come ha fatto Firefox dove con le ultime versioni mi e' successa la stessa cosa, ma li ho trovato gia' installato ""Firefox color"" ed e' stato un lampo ricreare la stessa coerenza di prima. La cosa che da fastidio e' che si pensa a linux esclusivamente come ubuntu, ubuntu fa gli elementi arancioni? Beh ci basta fare tutto arancione per linux, ubuntu fa il tema gtk a due tonalità di grigio scuro? Allora ci basta fare thunderbird ""zebrato"" a due grigi, ubuntu usa il blu come colore di hover? Beh in linux l'hover e' blu e basta. </p><p>Dove lo devo mettere sto user.css e cosa ci dovrei scrivere dentro?

Comunque dai finiamola quì tanto non c'e' volontà di risolvere il quesito, altrimenti ci avrebbero pensato gia' gli sviluppatori. Ti ringrazio e buon lavoro. </p>",clrpla74,false,0,0
