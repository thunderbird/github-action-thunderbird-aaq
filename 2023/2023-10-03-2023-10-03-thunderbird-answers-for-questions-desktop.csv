I was able to get the newly down-loaded TB to work; I tried to shut down my computer, but it said TB was open, so it couldn't shut down.  I went to my activities monitor to see if TB really was open, and it said it was using 8 kb of memory (it was the smallest item).  But then it seemed to magically open.  So the new version of TB seems to work, but it treated me as a new account, and didn't find my old emails or contacts. I checked the security tab you mentioned, and mine looks just like yours (except it's missing the line ""Allow accessories to connect     Automatically when unlocked"").  But I have the ""App Store and identified developers"" selected. I was able to retrieve from the Time Machine the version of Thunderbird I deleted; I hoped that if I opened that, it would access my old data, but it won't open (doing the bouncing thing).   I tried to follow the instructions above about accessing the old data, but my computer seems to be set up a little differently. If I go ""Macintosh HD: Users: Kent"" there is no Library folder.  I have a library folder at the Users level, but there is not a Thunderbird folder there (though there are a lot of folders there). I will try to attach a screenshot of what I see, maybe that will help you guide me.  I feel like I'm close, but not there yet. </p>",kjames196,false,1,0

When more people use it, the incorrect API usage breaks . </p><p>For the address book, it was not correctly asking for permission to use the Address Book, so the permission dialog was never popped up. People previously using Address Book on 10.x were fine, but new profiles broke. </p><p>Note that these problems have often taken years to fix on TB as they don't effect any devs with the specific skills (TB and OSX) needed to fix them, (1720257 took 18 months) but there are sometimes geek-only workarounds such as that needed to get the Calendar and Address book integrations working previously. </p>",mitra1,false,0,0

Dopo l'aggiornamento, quando ho aperto Thunderbird mi diceva di creare un profilo, ma non mi permetteova di farlo perchè mi presentava una maschera di errore vuota. Ho dovuto disinstallare Thunderbird aggiornato e reinstallarlo. Quindi mi chiedevo se ci fosse la possibilità che l'aggiornamento avesse messo il mio profilo nascosto, oppure rinominato (tipo old) in un punto diverso del disco del PC, o qualcos'altro. Mi chiedevo se ci fosse la possibilità di recuperare in altro modo per esempio con un tool, oppure se c'è una specie di cestino sul disco dove poter recuperarlo.
