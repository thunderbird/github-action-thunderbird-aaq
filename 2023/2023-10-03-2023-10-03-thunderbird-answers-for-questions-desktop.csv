Le soluzioni sono orientate alla risoluzione se hai ancora il profilo Thunderbird. Invece l'aggiornamento mi ha eliminato completamente il profilo anche da Windows 11 e dal disco del PC. Quindi io mi ritrovavo come non l'avessi mai installato in precedenza. Dopo l'aggiornamento, quando ho aperto Thunderbird mi diceva di creare un profilo, ma non mi permetteova di farlo perchè mi presentava una maschera di errore vuota. Ho dovuto disinstallare Thunderbird aggiornato e reinstallarlo. Quindi mi chiedevo se ci fosse la possibilità che l'aggiornamento avesse messo il mio profilo nascosto, oppure rinominato (tipo old) in un punto diverso del disco del PC, o qualcos'altro. Mi chiedevo se ci fosse la possibilità di recuperare in altro modo per esempio con un tool, oppure se c'è una specie di cestino sul disco dove poter recuperarlo. Perchè andando in C, users, app data, roming, ecc. il profilo non esiste più. </p>",elvfirefox,false,0,0
