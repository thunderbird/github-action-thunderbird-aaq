Dopo il recente disservizio creato da <a href=""http://Virgilio.it"" rel=""nofollow"">Virgilio.it</a>, capita che sul mio client Thunderbird ver.102.12.0 (64bit) installato sul pc fisso Windows10, l'account imap impostato appunto su <a href=""http://Virgilio.it"" rel=""nofollow"">Virgilio.it</a> pur avendone ricontrollato attentamente le impostazioni, visualizza solo 3 cartelle (posta in arrivo, posta inviata, cestino). Purtroppo oltre alle cartelle standard non visibili, avevo anche creato alcune cartelle personali di archivio per categoria le quali qui non appaiono più, mentre sulla webmail si. Inoltre e, stranamente su un vecchio portatile Lenovo T400s, lo stesso client installato sempre su Windows10, funziona perfettamente. Anche sul mio Android ver. 13 (One UI 5.1) installato su Samsung Galaxy S215G su cui utilizzo l'app GMAIL, sotto l'account di Virgilio, viene tutto visualizzato. Ho provato a disinstallare Thunderbird dal pc e dopo averlo reinstallato, purtroppo non è cambiato assolutamente nulla. Considerando che sia sulla webmail di Virgilio, che su Android, che sul portatile tutto funziona, immagino si tratti di qualcosa che avrebbe a che fare col pc desktop; ma la cosa strana è che qui, dopo la disinstallazione e la reinstallazione, nulla è cambiato. Potreste dirmi cosa devo fare? Ho segnalato il problema a Virgilio ma son passati già molti giorni e non ho ricevuto alcuna risposta. Grazie.

I was hoping that when Google Tasks got combined/integrated with calendar Reminders a few weeks ago, it might have meant I could uninstall the addon and use Tasks with native Thunderbird CalDAV, but that doesn't seem to be the case. By which I mean, if I uninstall the Provider and try to subscribe in Thunderbird, only my calendars are visible for selection, not my task lists. </p><p>Is there a way of exposing the task lists to Thunderbird other than with the Provider, so I can try a way which will sync correctly? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1587829;1587894;1587995;,carlwark

How do I do that? </p><p>(If I'm just supposed to change the settings that are already filled in for the first account, the interface is extremely confusing.

After I finally found the error console I did not understand one word it said.  My impression is that Thunderbird import looks for a file or a folder.  SysInfo Converter gave me a ""Outlook 0"" folder which had and an empty MBX file and a sub folder called Top of Personal Folders which contained a Contacts, Deleted Items, Inbox, and Sent Items folders, and each of those has sub folders and/or MBX files.

Waiting a long time didn't help.  I compacted the folders and that didn't help either.  TB was responsive and the Advertising window behaved normally too, i.e. I could scroll, view, mark, or forward a message normally.  The Task Manager showed CPU use continuous from 2 to 5%.  I checked and my C: drive had 62 GB free and the Recycle Bin had nothing significant on C: so that shouldn't be a problem.  Eventually (maybe 15 min. later?) that stopped happening, but the filter problem persisted.   </p><p>I noticed that Advertising had 10,701 messages so I selected the oldest 10,042 and deleted them, but that failed with an error message saying I should empty Trash, compact folders, and try again.  I did that and it completed successfully.   </p><p>After all that I tried again and the filters still didn't work, but now the Advertisements folder was behaving normally.   </p><p>That's about all I can think of.
