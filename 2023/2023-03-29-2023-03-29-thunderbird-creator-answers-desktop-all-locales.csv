TB dovrebbe essere predisposto a poter leggere le precedenti email senza dover fare numerosi passaggi, dai risultati spesso inutili o imprevedibili. TB potrebbe almeno bloccare l'avvio del programma e segnalare a quale versione si fa riferimento per poter recuperare velocemente le email. Altra soluzione creare un programma esterno che possa convertire qualsiasi archivio/profilo a quello più recente ed evitare all'utente mal di testa di notevole entità. Insomma trovare una soluzione per gli utenti che altrimenti devono passare giornate a ripristinare versioni di programma per poter leggere la propria posta backuppata. Oggi mi ritrovo a non poter aprire la posta dal 2021 ad andare indietro. Come si fa? Grazie. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,it,1573087;1573219;1573235;1573301;1573428;1573514;1573557;1573617;,cosentino1960

Having enjoyed the benefits of Thunderbird for a long time, I thought it was reasonable to donate. I hoped the screen would disappear after this, but it didn't. I have searched for solutions to get rid of it, because it slows down TB whenever I want to look into my emails. But sofar, without success. The only things I DID find were that I can get rid of the screen under Linux (as a normal user). Under Windows I can start TB 'as Administrator' and then remove the URL (see below) from the settings. But as I recall it, it reappeared after a couple of restarts of TB even in this case. And starting TB as Administrator gives me no access to my emails which are stored under my user account. Removing the URL, by the way, can not be done through the normal settings screens. I had to go to the ""hamburger"" menu icon and then select Settings, scroll all the way down and then click on the Configuration Editor button. There I found these three related parameters and their values: </p><p>app.donation.eoy.url = https//<a href=""http://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/102.0/eoy/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/102.0/eoy/</a> app.donation.version = 1 app.donation.eoy.version.viewed = 1 </p><p>My questions: </p><p>1) Why can't I remove the URL for the ""end-of-year"" donation screen as a normal Windows user? </p><pre>  Every time I delete it, it's back the next time I start TB.  (for God's sake, it's almost April by now and I DID donate at year's end&nbsp;;-) </pre> <p>2) The file 'prefs.js' in my user mail profile/directory seems to hold part of my settings, but it states ""DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE"". Could I define a 'user.js' file to actually circumvent my inability to remove the URL through the Configuration Editor? 3) Or even better: what IS the right way to remove the donation screen in my situation; or put differently: is this an error (f.e. with user rights) in the Windows version of TB not present in the Linux version? </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help or suggestions, </p><p>Steijn van Essen From i8088 to i7-980X in 25 years and still waiting … </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1573113;1573163;1573183;1573721;1573753;1574945;,Steijn_van_Essen
