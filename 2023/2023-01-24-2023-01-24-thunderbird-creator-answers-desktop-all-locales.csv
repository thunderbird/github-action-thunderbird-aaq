It was great when TB starting properly supporting a per-account (outbound) SMTP server, however, this seems to have newly broken. I fell over it today, but I don't reboot things for ages so I cannot pinpoint the start. </p><p>Here's the issue. </p><p>I have accounts on many mail servers, many on the same (mainly <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a>, and <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>, as it happens). </p><p>Each one of them, to send mail, wants me to log in with an individual sending address. Fair enough. This used to work just fine. </p><p>However, suddenly, just the <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> addresses are broken. What *seems* to be happening is that the same, single login address is being used for all N accounts. Naturally, this breaks when the login address doesn't match the one on the From: line. So I have to futz around, fiddle around, and so on, and then things work. (I.E. I change the TB settings so that the outbound SMTP auth login matches the From: line, have to re-enter the password, and only then will the message be sent.) So if I have two accounts, x@att.net and y@att.net, only one of them (at a time) ""works"" with <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> - it's whatever I successfully used last. If I sent mail from x@, this address is being used (and it's in the account settings field. over-riding what was there before), even if I send mail from y@. Or z@. Etc. If I change the SMTP auth address to y@, then that account works perfectly, but x@ doesn't. And so on. </p><p>Now the weird part is this: my Gmail addresses still work perfectly. I can send from all of them without changing a thing. </p><p>The only thing I can see is that Gmail is set up to use oAuth, and <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> is set up to use 'normal password' (via SSL, so I'm not that bothered about security). </p><p>Did I unknowingly manage to break something? Is there a new tweak? Help! </p><p>Jonathan </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1561631;1562038;,jonathan89
