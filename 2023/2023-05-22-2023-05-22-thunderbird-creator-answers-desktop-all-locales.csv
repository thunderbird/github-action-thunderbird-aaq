I have no need for them, and just recently, after many years, I manage to get the cursor to jump to an Address Field or to the middle of the text I'm typing......then I have to find the text I've typed in the middle of nowhere, and look at the Address Field before I send a message to someone I don't want to send to.  This takes up a lot of time, and proofing and proofing and proofing. 2. TB has gotten a Lot better with embedded Photos, but still can't copy a photo back to it's source for additional editing.  So it's always a good idea to save the original source in a readily available place, just in case.  If TB could copy photos from it's text field like standard Windows apps do, that would be a nice improvement. 3. I paste text into TB from who knows where, a newspaper, a website.  Invaviably the Font Style, Size, etc is different.  And TB's non-standard text design has a hard time.  I've learned to copy everything to Notepad to fix it up.
