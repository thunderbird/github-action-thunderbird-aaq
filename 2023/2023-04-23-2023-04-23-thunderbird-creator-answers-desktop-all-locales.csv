I have been plagued by Brazilian Hackers trying to get into my email/Microsoft account for just over a year now (see example screen shot 1 below) and as a result I have always set-up long/complex passwords with 2 factor authentication. The Hackers have been sending emails to me in Portuguese (which is some comfort as they might not know I am English living in the UK). Unfortunately, I think they may have got very limited access to my Mozilla Thunderbird email account because, when I opened an email back in March 2023 from one of my usual contacts I saw lines of code (with a reference to Brazil) in the drop down menu which you would normally click on if you wanted to see full details/logos from the sender. </p><p>Needless to say, I panicked and deleted/uninstalled the Mozilla Thunderbird/Email account from my computer without first removing my email address from the Mozilla Thunderbird Server. I am very concerned that my emails will continue to be forwarded to my Mozilla Email Account on the server (which I now have no control over) and I am not sure if the Hackers have taken over the account. See Screen shot 2 below which shows some illegal syncing activity. My question is, how can I arrange for my email account to be deleted from the Mozilla Thunderbird Server. Thank you.

I typically have a half a dozen tabs open at a time in TB, generally the same half a dozen. For at least a year now when I re-open TB the same number of tabs open, with the last-selected tab selected. So far all is well, except that the selected tab switches from the email account that it was open in against when I shut down TB to the first account in the Folders pane. I then have to switch it back to the correct account every time. It's gotten annoying enough that I've now joined this Support site so I can ask how to fix this. I tried the ""open the profiles folder, quit TB, delete the session.json file and re-open TB"" dance, but all that did was cause it to forget all of the previously opened tabs. I re-opened them in the desired order, selected the 4th one at random, then quit TB. When I re-started it, the 4th tab was selected, but the content was the first account in the list instead of the one it should have been. For reference purposes, all the other tabs still have the appropriate accounts open in them. I have the same version of Thunderbird installed on 2 different Windows 10 computers, and both of them are manifesting this behavior. I'm currently running TB 102.10.0 (32-bit). Please advise as to how I can fix this. If there is any other information that I can gather that will assist you with resolving this issue please let me know.
