After the update when I send a message, it is not saved in the Sent box. The recipient receives the mail, but I cannot see it in my Sent box. I uninstalled Thunderbird, restarted the laptop and installed the latest Thunderbird, but still the same.  On my older laptop, which is still on Windows 10 and I have Thunderbird linked to the same IMAP mail server, this problem does not exist, so I assume  my IMAP mail servers are correct.

I have been plagued by Brazilian Hackers trying to get into my email/Microsoft account for just over a year now (see example screen shot 1 below) and as a result I have always set-up long/complex passwords with 2 factor authentication. The Hackers have been sending emails to me in Portuguese (which is some comfort as they might not know I am English living in the UK). Unfortunately, I think they may have got very limited access to my Mozilla Thunderbird email account because, when I opened an email back in March 2023 from one of my usual contacts I saw lines of code (with a reference to Brazil) in the drop down menu which you would normally click on if you wanted to see full details/logos from the sender. </p><p>Needless to say, I panicked and deleted/uninstalled the Mozilla Thunderbird/Email account from my computer without first removing my email address from the Mozilla Thunderbird Server. I am very concerned that my emails will continue to be forwarded to my Mozilla Email Account on the server (which I now have no control over) and I am not sure if the Hackers have taken over the account. See Screen shot 2 below which shows some illegal syncing activity. My question is, how can I arrange for my email account to be deleted from the Mozilla Thunderbird Server. Thank you.
