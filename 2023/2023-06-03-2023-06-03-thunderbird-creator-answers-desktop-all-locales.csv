I don't use any ESET product myself, but I have to retrieve mail from a an Exchange-mailserver that requires ESET 2FA. The first login step seems to work, and then an ESET-authentication window pops up but the contents of the window remains blanc, so there is no way to enter my one-time code. This happens both if I approach the mailserver as an Exchange server, and if I approach the mail server through the OWA-protocol (using Owl). Known problem? Any suggestions? Should this be an issue for Thunderbird or for ESET? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1584034;,e.r.savelsbergh

So I can't open TB because it can't locate my profile. I can't find any backups that have the profile folder included. I do however have the same data and profile on my Android phone and can read/write from there normally. This virtually is a copy of what I had on the PC (folders and sub folders etc). My question: Is there a way to copy the profile from my phone across to the PC (even if that means downloading thousands of messages)? </p><p>Your help would be very much appreciated. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1583718;,13pgus
