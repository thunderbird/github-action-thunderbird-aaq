This does not let Thunderbird off the hook.  Can I get some support from Thunderbird?  Firefox works fine as does every program on my desktop PC.  Can I get some support?  Please respond or I will be uninstalling your little not very robust app. Thanks a bunch. Since I have asked for support earlier this week, and I have received none, loet me try to incentivize you with a $20.00 donation to Thunderbird.  Is Thunderbird still part of the Mozilla foundation? I want an email (pop3) that works.  Please.  Thank you in advance for your kind cooperation... </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1562359;1562367;1562369;,macme

Ogni volta che creo una nuova cartella, questa viene creata con la disposizione predefinita e devo quindi modificarla come vs articolo legata alla ""copia visualizzazione"". Questo processo però è estremamente lungo perché di cartelle ne creo moltissime e devo ricordarmi ogni volta di fare questo passaggio. Vorrei quindi sapere come fare a memorizzare la mia versione di disposizione delle colonne in modo che diventi il default per ogni singola nuova cartella; ho già cambiato l'ordinamento in base alla data modificando la relativa voce nel registro di configurazione ma non riesco a capire qual'è la voce relativa alle colonne da visualizzare?!?!?!? Già che ci siamo vorrei anche sapere come impostare, per default, che le mail NON devono mai essere raggruppate (in modo da non dover agire su ogni singola cartella) e come applicarlo al volo a tutte le cartelle già esistenti.

This was a feature in the Virtual Access email software, where when a folder was the 'active' or highlighted folder, you used the 'Signature' icon or menu option, whereby you created the 'Signature' for that particular folder. So for my friends my signature was 'All best, Jonathon'  or for my family 'Love, Dad' or 'Love, Jonathon' for acquaintances or companies, a signature that included my address and contact numbers. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1562393;1562398;1562403;1562695;1562699;,TheFlapjack

Before deleting the said user, there is a check box that says Remove Message Data. We check this checkbox. Just want to clarify that deleting the message data doesn't mean it affects whatever we had in the mail server, right? It is only being deleted in Thunderbird locally right? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1562410;1563014;,milkylorejo

I've had to re-install Thunderbird on a Windows desktop computer (likely after the machine had been formatted and Windows re-installed), and set up again two email accounts. I've also brought back the Thunderbird profile from a backup. Yet, several folders that existed before are no longer there -- including the Sent folder under one of the accounts, a Gmail one. I'm not sure whether the missing folders were under that Gmail account, or rather local folders, but I assume that either way they would be in the backed up profile. What can I do to resurrect those missing folders?
