And I'm only saying ""probably"" because I still don't know how it all happened, or the source of the size problem itself, so I'd like to let it sit for a day or three first. </p><p>The ""Language and Appearance"" section on the General tab of the Settings page had Calibri 14 as default font.  I think I'd looked there, but I knew Calibri (which I'm getting used to) was a proportional-width font . . . and I didn't see a fixed-width font there, so I couldn't tell if that option applied to fixed-width fonts.  When I tried going into the Advanced options, I went down the list and saw the font chosen for plain-text messages was something called ""Consolas"" -- which I'd never heard of, and certainly never selected myself.  It also said the size setting was the same 14 as for Calibri, so I don't know how the huge characters I saw started appearing.  (Is Consolas usually extra-big?)  Anyway, I re-set that to Courier New (still at 14), which I believe I had chosen before -- and it seems to have changed the text of the old messages back to a more normal size. </p><p>Again, thank you.  If nothing else messes this up in a few days, I'll gladly mark it as a solution.

I don't see a ""status"" indicator when I open the font -- the nearest I get for all four variations is where it says the embeddability is ""editable"".

Or I can just ignore the font, since I've told Thunderbird to ignore it, and wait to see if anything goes wrong again. </p><p>So no clear indication of the cause yet, but a possibility -- and the problem itself is still gone, so the countdown to approving the solution continues.

My recommendation is this:  - first, copy the POP message folders to Local Folders, being sure to rename as needed to protect them. That may be best done by first defining folders in local folders for each account and then copying the folders there. Check to ensure that all are safely there.  - now delete the POP account (to ensure that it doesn't continue reading and downloading and deleting messages) - now set up the IMAP accounts and you're good to go.
