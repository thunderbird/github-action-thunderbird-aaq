I keep my email files &amp; such on a separate partition/drive from where Windows is. I recently had to reinstall Windows 11, which effectively uninstalled Tbird.  I reinstalled and tried to get my profiles.ini to point to that previous profile so Tbird could see the 20 years' worth of saved emails as well as the ones from this year.  I've tried several times and all failed. I've put the exact name &amp; path of the profile I want in each location of profiles.ini with IsRelative=0, and told Tbird to use the name when it starts, but that has failed repeatedly.  I had to uninstall/reinstall Tbird bc I'd managed to FUBAR profiles.ini      Help? </p><p>The profile I want to use is E:\TbirdMail\ko07yqoy.slt </p><p>Current profile.ini: [InstallB8CB05495C44C742] Default=C:\Users\pixda\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=0 Path=C:\Users\pixda\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Default=0 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/pteabyby.default </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=0 Version=2 </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1626987;1627038;1627105;1627154;,dennyw0713

I receive an email that shows in the email list with the subject, from, and date of the real email.   However, the body of the email is from some other email, and corrupted at that.   I showed one jpg that shows the email listing, and 3 jpgs that capture how the first part of the email appears in Thunderbird.  Even though I don't have the headers expanded, I see detailed header-type information.  I captured down to where the body of the message starts in case something in all that apparent expanded header provides a clue.   When I look at the email on my Google web account, it is fine.  It only shows this way in Thunderbird.   It has only happened about 3 times in the last 2-3 weeks.   The body I see, by the way, seems to be the same every time.   I am hoping someone has some ideas.    </p><p>In most cases, it has been an email I did not really need anyway, so I just deleted it.  One was a needed email, so I opened it in the Google web interface and forwarded it to a different account, where it showed fine.   </p><p>Thanks again for any advice. I am currently using TB 115.6.0 in Windows 10.  However, it has happened on the earlier versions I had over those past couple of weeks. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1627093;1627096;1627107;1627111;,marklang
