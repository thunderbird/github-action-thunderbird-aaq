I keep my email files &amp; such on a separate partition/drive from where Windows is. I recently had to reinstall Windows 11, which effectively uninstalled Tbird.  I reinstalled and tried to get my profiles.ini to point to that previous profile so Tbird could see the 20 years' worth of saved emails as well as the ones from this year.  I've tried several times and all failed. I've put the exact name &amp; path of the profile I want in each location of profiles.ini with IsRelative=0, and told Tbird to use the name when it starts, but that has failed repeatedly.  I had to uninstall/reinstall Tbird bc I'd managed to FUBAR profiles.ini      Help? </p><p>The profile I want to use is E:\TbirdMail\ko07yqoy.slt </p><p>Current profile.ini: [InstallB8CB05495C44C742] Default=C:\Users\pixda\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=0 Path=C:\Users\pixda\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Default=0 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/pteabyby.default </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=0 Version=2 </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",dennyw0713
