I keep my email files &amp; such on a separate partition/drive from where Windows is. I recently had to reinstall Windows 11, which effectively uninstalled Tbird.  I reinstalled and tried to get my profiles.ini to point to that previous profile so Tbird could see the 20 years' worth of saved emails as well as the ones from this year.  I've tried several times and all failed. I've put the exact name &amp; path of the profile I want in each location of profiles.ini with IsRelative=0, and told Tbird to use the name when it starts, but that has failed repeatedly.  I had to uninstall/reinstall Tbird bc I'd managed to FUBAR profiles.ini      Help? </p><p>The profile I want to use is E:\TbirdMail\ko07yqoy.slt </p><p>Current profile.ini: [InstallB8CB05495C44C742] Default=C:\Users\pixda\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=0 Path=C:\Users\pixda\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Default=0 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/pteabyby.default </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=0 Version=2 </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",dennyw0713

Email were piled up in there - not sent.  And I received no notification from Thunderbird that these emails weren't going out.  Thunderbird was silently filling up the Outbox with unsent emails.   </p><p>I use three different email addresses, and all emails I have tried to send from all addresses are not being sent. </p><p>I couldn't find any way to force TB to send these emails. </p><p>I found that if I right-click on an email, there is an option to ""edit as new"".  I clicked on that on a couple of the emails and tried to send them again - and they just kept piling up in the Outbox. </p><p>HELP PLEASE! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1626949;,clintoconner2
