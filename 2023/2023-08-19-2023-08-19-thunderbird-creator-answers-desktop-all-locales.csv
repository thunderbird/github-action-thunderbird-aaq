From ""local folder"" I created many more named folders (sharing the same hierarchy level as ""inbox""), and many of these folders have their own sub-folders. </p><p>I have setup dozens of message filters to handle the various addresses, senders, subjects, etc. Most are used to simply direct mail to a certain folder.  </p><p>I created a new filter today, for a messages that end up in a particular sub-folder. The triggers were two subject based filters, set to mark these messages as read. A separate filter is set to send these messages into the aforementioned sub-folder. When I added the new ""mark as read"" filter today, and ran the filter, every message in the sub-folder disappeared. They are not in the trash, not in the junk folder, they are just gone. I checked every folder I have, and can't find the missing messages. The sub-folder in question shows 0 messages in the properties. Repairing it made no difference either. There was no ""undo"" to be done. I eventually restarted TB, with no resolution. This is repeatable and certainly filter related. I waited until new messages cam in to this folder, and tried the filter again manually. It should have triggered automatically, but it did not. When I triggered it manually, the new messages also disappeared. </p><p>Please tell me how to prevent this from happening in the future. I can afford to lose what is already gone, but would like to resolve the cause in case it happens to a more critical folder. </p><p>Thank You!
