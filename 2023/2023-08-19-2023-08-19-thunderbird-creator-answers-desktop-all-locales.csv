Computer simply shut off due to low battery.

However, it does not resolve the issue.  </p><p>It looks like the import operation works fine, as it tells me it is finished and that it needs to reboot. However, when it reboots, it comes back again with the same ""set up account"" screen, and none of my data is on there. </p><p>Any idea what’s going on? Also, why are there two `.thunderbird/` folder with profiles in it (one in `~/.thunderbird` and one in `~/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/.thunderbird`)? Is it part of the problem? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",louis.vigneras

From ""local folder"" I created many more named folders (sharing the same hierarchy level as ""inbox""), and many of these folders have their own sub-folders. </p><p>I have setup dozens of message filters to handle the various addresses, senders, subjects, etc. Most are used to simply direct mail to a certain folder.  </p><p>I created a new filter today, for a messages that end up in a particular sub-folder. The triggers were two subject based filters, set to mark these messages as read. A separate filter is set to send these messages into the aforementioned sub-folder. When I added the new ""mark as read"" filter today, and ran the filter, every message in the sub-folder disappeared. They are not in the trash, not in the junk folder, they are just gone. I checked every folder I have, and can't find the missing messages. The sub-folder in question shows 0 messages in the properties. Repairing it made no difference either. There was no ""undo"" to be done. I eventually restarted TB, with no resolution. This is repeatable and certainly filter related. I waited until new messages cam in to this folder, and tried the filter again manually. It should have triggered automatically, but it did not. When I triggered it manually, the new messages also disappeared. </p><p>Please tell me how to prevent this from happening in the future. I can afford to lose what is already gone, but would like to resolve the cause in case it happens to a more critical folder. </p><p>Thank You!
