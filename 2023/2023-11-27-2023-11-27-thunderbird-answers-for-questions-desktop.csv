I chose the one that had the most users and the relatively high rating of 4 out of 5 stars.

This has worked in previous versions, I don't use it very often so I can't speak to which version was the last that it did work. Thanks for the input. </p>",f_lawrentz,false,0,0

My suggestion is to first carefully review the setup for the account on each device. Are they all IMAP, or are some POP? And what are the specific settings for each? For example, one of those setups might be POP and set to download and delete after x days. That is a challenge seen regularly here where users access mail across more than one platform. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
