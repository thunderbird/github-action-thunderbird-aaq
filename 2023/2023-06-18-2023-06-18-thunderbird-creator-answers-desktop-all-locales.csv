I didn't see instructions for that specific scenario.  If there are instructions, please point me to them and I apologize for missing them. </li></ol> <ol><li>2)  When WLM messages are 'exported', does the exportation result in the messages being deleted from WLM file location?  That is, does exporting mean that a COPY of the messages are exported and the original messages are left in place? </li></ol> <ol><li>3)  I have my WLM messages in many folders and subfolders.  Can the folders and subfolders be transferred to Thunderbird on a second computer in one step WHILE PRESERVING AND AUTOMATICALLY RECREATING IN THUNDERBIRD THE EXACT SAME FOLDER/SUBFOLDER LAYOUT AS EXISTS IN WLM WITH THE SAME FOLDER/SUBFOLDER NAMES AND CONTENT? </li></ol> <p>I'm not overly technical, so I appreciate replies in simple terms.   </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1586145;1586152;1586153;1586155;1586157;1586185;1586186;1602062;1602421;,cvancant

I have a company Gmail account (myname@companyname.com), with a delegated account (info@companyname.com), for which I don't have the password, as I can only acces it from the Gmail web site. How can I configure Thunderbird (version 102) to access the delegated account? I have tried several tutorials, but none worked. I can access my personal account perfectly, but can't access the shared one. Is there any updated step-by-step to configure this? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1586158;1586160;1586166;,rasteserdi

I do not know why or how this started to happen (and it seemed not to be necessary) but I just learned to live with this slight inconvenience. But now I have a major inconvenience: I can send e-mails from Thunderbird but no incoming e-mails appear in Thunderbird. I have two questions -- 1: How do I get rid of having to enter this password? and 2: Could this have something to do with my not being able to receive e-mails? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1586194;1586197;1586200;1586208;1586209;1586212;1586213;1586216;1586225;1586240;1587603;1587842;1587892;1587997;,jhromer1
