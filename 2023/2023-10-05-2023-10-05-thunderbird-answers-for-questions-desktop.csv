Thunderbird was designed to run on a local hard disk and generally struggles with data stored on local server shares that are accessible at gigabyte networks speeds.  One drive is at best a slow road to data and Thunderbird will mess in it's own nest if you place profile data on onedrive or any other cloud provider storage.  The most usual think is hundreds of copies of files appear in the profile folder.  Settings changes are lost and mail files a corrupted beyond recovery.  That is why there is not a simple how to.  Because it is a very very bad idea. </p><p>You might be able to obtain this using the Thunderbird sync,  but that has not made it to a release version and is still I think under active development.  I did see a note suggesting folks could test it on pre release versions.  It is certainly in development versions,  but I would not trust it with valuable production data. </p><p>My personal suggestion of sign up with a mail provider that does offer IMAP,  google or GMX would do.  Set up the new account to periodically log into the Juno account and retrieve the mail that is in that account. (generally this is a 15 minute to 30 minute frequency. </p><p>Then use the new account in Thunderbird for your Juno needs as it will sync through IMAP and you still have access to the mail and the account. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Juno, to my knowledge, is only a dialup provider. Is that why you are using it? That is, if you have internet access regularly, my suggestion is to switch from Juno to an email provider that supports IMAP.

Your first goal would be to get both PCs sharing the same onedrive . Onedrive wouldn't be keeping the two in sync, you would be being careful with each PC's use.

Ma du a tékomos ügyfélszolgálattal három órán keresztül próbálkoztunk. Ennek keretében beléptem a webmailen keresztül is, és (mivel a tárhelyem 100%-os telítettséget mutatott) ki tudtam üríteni a „szemét” mappát, meg a spames üzeneteket. A hibabejelentésem elment egy hibakóddal, és az ügyintéző javaslata alapján, ő generált egy új jelszót az e-mail fiókomhoz. Azt is javasolta, hogy az új jelszó miatt, társítsam a Thunderbird-del, ehhez küldött egy pdf dok-t („mozilla thunderbird beállítása telekom”), a kézi irányítással történő adatfrissítéshez, de az ott leírt lépések nem voltak végrehajthatók a képernyőn, az „Eszközök” között ugyanis nincs „postafiók beállításai”. Az „Eszközök”-kel egy menüben található egy „Postafiók beállításai”, de az nem ad lehetőséget a kívánt adatfrissítésre.  Az idő és a lépések előrehaladtával többször is próbálkoztam a gép újraindításával, de minden maradt a régiben, ugyanaz az ablak ugrott fel, az Önöknek is elküldött szöveggel („Sikertelen bejelentkezés . . . stb.) A tékomos hibaelhárításra 72 órájuk van, nem tudom, jutnak-e valamire.  Ha van valami ötlete a fentiek alapján, azt örömmel veszem, mert szeptember 7-e óta nem tudok belépni fiókomba.
