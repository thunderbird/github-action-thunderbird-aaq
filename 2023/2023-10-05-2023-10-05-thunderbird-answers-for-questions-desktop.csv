Ennek keretében beléptem a webmailen keresztül is, és (mivel a tárhelyem 100%-os telítettséget mutatott) ki tudtam üríteni a „szemét” mappát, meg a spames üzeneteket. A hibabejelentésem elment egy hibakóddal, és az ügyintéző javaslata alapján, ő generált egy új jelszót az e-mail fiókomhoz. Azt is javasolta, hogy az új jelszó miatt, társítsam a Thunderbird-del, ehhez küldött egy pdf dok-t („mozilla thunderbird beállítása telekom”), a kézi irányítással történő adatfrissítéshez, de az ott leírt lépések nem voltak végrehajthatók a képernyőn, az „Eszközök” között ugyanis nincs „postafiók beállításai”. Az „Eszközök”-kel egy menüben található egy „Postafiók beállításai”, de az nem ad lehetőséget a kívánt adatfrissítésre.  Az idő és a lépések előrehaladtával többször is próbálkoztam a gép újraindításával, de minden maradt a régiben, ugyanaz az ablak ugrott fel, az Önöknek is elküldött szöveggel („Sikertelen bejelentkezés . . . stb.)

I highly appreciate your concern. </p><p>About a week ago I got a message like 'you can upgrade TB now'. I did that, assuming incorrectly that I would be upgraded to 90 something (I forget, the next version of what I had). I had seen announcements of 115, but didn't understand that simply upgrading would not be sufficient. When I then tried to open TB I got a message to re-install one of my accounts. I don't have a screenshot of that, but I am sure you are familiar with it. I filled out the password, etc., but then only got the emails of that account. I couldn't find a way to put in the details for my second account. What I deplore is that I lost all the emails of accounts that TB was able to show that are no longer active. I don't use them frequently, but once in a while I check on addresses. My problem thus is: how to get all the emails back, not only those of my active email addresses, but also those of my former addresses.  What happened next is that I checked on the Internet how to solve this problem. Most of the respondents advised to use the recent TB data as filed under Thunderbird in Library in my user account. I was advised to replace the TB folder in Library for the new TB by the older TB data. This did not work. Unfortunately, my daily backup program then deleted the most recent TB data I had. Fortunately, I have other backups with older TB data (dating beck to before the email addresses were terinated. What I hope you might help me with is a) how to get the emails back under addresses that are no longer in use; b) if a) has no answer, I hope you can tell me how to recreate both of my active addresses. I apologise if I come over as inexperienced (stupid?). My hope is that someone with experience can help me get back all emails. Unfortunately, I can't recreate what my TB looked like before (and make a screenshot). I hope my 'story' above is sufficiently informative! </p>",gerard17,false,0,0

Thunderbird was designed to run on a local hard disk and generally struggles with data stored on local server shares that are accessible at gigabyte networks speeds.  One drive is at best a slow road to data and Thunderbird will mess in it's own nest if you place profile data on onedrive or any other cloud provider storage.  The most usual think is hundreds of copies of files appear in the profile folder.  Settings changes are lost and mail files a corrupted beyond recovery.  That is why there is not a simple how to.  Because it is a very very bad idea. </p><p>You might be able to obtain this using the Thunderbird sync,  but that has not made it to a release version and is still I think under active development.

So if you have a folder named ""AAA"" at the same level as [Gmail] and you have a folder called ""AAA"" inside [Gmail], in 115 you will see two folders called ""AAA"" at the same level. For your two folders called AIR, this may be the case. And if there were only 2 folders called Administrative it would also make sense. But you have 3 called Administrative which doesn't make sense.

My question is with 102 where the hierarchy shows correctly, is the folder TRACES shown gray? My guess is that it is. If so, it was created as what is called in imap parlance a ""noselect"" folder"", that is, a folder that can't contain messages but only contains other folders. In TB 102 and earlier these type of folder will show as gray. But with 115, they currently are not shown at all so you end up with several ""Administrative"" folders all at the same level with their parent folders (TRACES, LILT etc.) completely hidden in the folder pane. </p>",gd_smth,false,1,0

This explains why some folders were ""disgorged"" and others were not: Articles, for example was intact at the top level in 115 according to my screen dump (I don't have it installed right now) and has messages in it. ICS, LILT and TRACES do not have top level messages.  </p><p>It is really strange that 115 chose not to display them. In computer science there are many kinds of trees with the content only at the leaves: this does not make the trees useless, but rather greatly facilitates search. I was wondering whether Thunderbird developers have sufficient background in HCI/usability, but maybe this technical argument will convince them to restore visibility of these folders?  </p><p>Wasn't able to retrieve my laptop today, but tomorrow I'll install 115 and try an experiment: put a bogus email message in each folder that is not visible (using my other computer Tbird 102) and see whether that makes them appear in 115. This of course should not be necessary; there will be hundreds of folders and it is a hack to fix an obvious design flaw.  </p><p>Other question: [Gmail] is also a ""noselect"" and has only Drafts, Spam, Trash and Junk. I really don't want these displayed at top level: I only look at them when there is a problem to diagnose or fix.  </p><p>Thanks again for identifying the issue, and I'll report on whether I can get them to display with the email trick.

To fix, for example, folder ICS you need to go to gmail site and go into settings. Under label setting if you see a label called ICS, you need to make sure the checkbox ""show in imap"" is checked. If you don't see the label ICS you need to create the label ICS and make sure ""show in imap"" is checked/enabled. (Note: you will see other labels like ""ICS/Administrative"" but you need to have an ""atomic"" label just called ICS too, if it doesn't already exist.) Edit: Forgot to mention that the label changes at gmail site require a restart to be seen in TB. I realize you probably have 100s of labels that need this fix so it's a pain to have to do this.

I'm having a little trouble understanding what she is recommending, and how it maps to the problem I reported. It seems focused on [Gmail], but the folders I am talking about are not under [Gmail]: in fact, most of them were created before Gmail even existed, probably a decade or more before! (I first set up this account in 1998.) IMAP has been an email standard since the 1990's and Tbird used to support it well; I don't see why this would be a problem. I am especially concerned about someone's recommendation of ""won't fix"", just because they are user created folders! That is what users do to organize their email!   </p><p>In <a href=""http://mail.google.com/mail"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com/mail</a> I found that the folders are listed  under ""Labels"" -- so that is what they call them now? I can see that the no-select folders are displayed differently from the select. For example, I have dozens of folders under COLLEAGUES in my IMAP hierarchy but in the Gmail web interface they display like COLLEAGURES/Jane-Doe etc. at the top level. On the other hand, the folders that are behaving correctly all also display correctly with a triangle to open them in Gmail.  </p><p>I don't understand Anje's advice -- how is creating something under [Gmail] supposed to help? But I did discover that I can manually create parallel folders -- for example ""Colleagues"" (comes out as a diferent folder due to lower case) and then manually drag all of my folders from the nonselectable version to the selectable version (e.g., from COLLEAGUES to Colleagues). I am working in 102.15.1 because of course these folders won't exist if I changed to 115, but I am hoping that after doing that they will display correctly in 115.  </p><p>But again, a tbird ""upgrade"" should not break mail hierarcies created under decades old standards, and this is tedious, so I am wondering whether you can translate Anje's advice into big folder hierarchies that are not under [Gmail]?  </p><p>Thanks, Dan </p>",dan_suthers,false,0,0

Pretty tedious.  </p><p>But PROPOSALS itself had nonselectable sub-folders PROPOSALS-1998, PROPOSALS-1999, etc. I accidentally created a new *selectable* folder by the *same* name, and the nonselectable folder became selectable! </p><p>Verified that this works and I was quickly able to convert all noselect to selectable folders.

This could take a few hours.

She created the folders at gmail site, since, as you point out, you can't do this with 115 because you don't see the top level no-select folders.
