I hope you can help me straighten out a confusing mess I've created with Thunderbird v 115.4.2.  </p><p>I want to see SentCopies under Local Folders, and I also want to remove from UNIFIED  Folder/Sent any Local Folder of any name. This has always worked fine. And TB continues to place sent copies into the Local Folder when sending, But the display of the file tree got confused after I tried to rearrange the place of SentCopies in the Folder tree, so the folder names displayed in the tree by TB now have some puzzles and mix-ups.    </p><p>I have set TB to place a copy when sending an email into the Local SerntCopies folder, but for the last 24 hours the folder tree in TB has stopped showing any SentCopies folder. (The folder is still fine on the disk, and it used to display correctly, but after I did some fiddling and trying to move the ""SentCopies"" icon  up in the tree, it stopped showing any SentCopies folder anywhere in the tree).  </p><p>Fixing this should aslo, I hope, correct another confusion that has crept in: TB is now showing a wrong label, namely, Unified Folder&gt;Sent&gt;Local Folder&gt;Sent, when in reality at that position it is displaying the content of Unified Folder&gt;Sent&gt;Local Folder&gt;SentCopies. </p><p>I am attaching some screenshots to show you 1) the Profile from the Local Folders Mail folder, in case that is helpful; </p><pre>2) the Copies and Folders page for the accont that requests each sent email to be copied to the Local Folder/Sent Copies folder; and </pre> <p>3) TheTB folder tree as it is now displayed.  </p><p>Thanks for helping to get this working normally.  </p><p><br> </p><p><br> \ </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",kmartinp
