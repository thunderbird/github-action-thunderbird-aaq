I am running Ubuntu 22.04, and Thunderbird 115.4.1. One now has a column taken on the left which is unnecessary, and a section at the top which is above the menus with e.g. File... but I would like my File menu at the top, as it used to be. The second issue is more frustrating - the search facility, where one can find the emails being sought, allows me to search by many options, and I was able to display the results sorted by subject, size or my normal was by date, but I never use the message threads as that is rarely of interest, and I can sort on that using the message subject if needed. Now, when I search the results are ONLY in the message threads, and if I try to sort by date, I lose all information, and the ONLY option is to see the messages by thread which is no use to me!

My emails and address books did not load. Eventually the emails appeared but after much trouble I still can't see the address books. I tried importing them and those that imported lost a lot of emails and also their names. This is serious for me as my hundreds of personal email addresses and several thousand other important ones are not accessible. I have been using Thunderbird for over 20 years and like it. Please stop mucking around with something that was working. I have wasted about 8 hours or more so far. I HATE the new version. Please tell me how to get my address books up or how to go back to the previous version. Thank you. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",vbivell

I have two IMAP accounts configured. </p><p>I set up a message filter rule to move messages from the Inbox to a specific folder based upon the subject.  That works fine.  Then I changed to rule to instead move the message to a folder on a different account.  That doesn't work.   </p><p>I can manually copy the email from the original account to the second account with no problem.  So, Thunderbird has no problem moving a message from one account to another.  But, it's not doing that when using a Message Filters rule. </p><p>I did look at the filter log.  Thunderbird is applying the filter to the message. </p><p>When I edited the rule to specify to move the message to a different account, Thunderbird listed both accounts and allowed me to select the folder on the second account.

When I wake up, the software is hanging, no messages have been downloaded for hours, the cursor is a small blue spinning circle, and the program is not responding. I have to force-quit with task manager, start it up again, then it runs fine for several hours, before doing the same thing again. Just now, I found it hung again, without having to go to bed first. </p><p>I have no way of knowing if any email is being lost during this time or not, but I have no reason to think it is.
