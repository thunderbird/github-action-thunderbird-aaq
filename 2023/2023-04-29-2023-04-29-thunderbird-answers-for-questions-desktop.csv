File contention is something Thunderbird does not do will with.  Generally an exception for the Profile folder will make things much better.

My best guess what happened is that your calendar data on the exporting computer got corrupted somehow, and that this causes the import on the other computer to fail.

However, converting a HTML message to an event may have been the trigger. Did you ever do this? So after all, it's possibly a bug in Thunderbird Calendar, and all I can do is to suggest to raise a new Bugzilla bug for your problem. I don't think you mentioned your version of Thunderbird yet, that may also be an important information. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

Currently running 102.10.1. Also, I have 4 different computers and everyone has the same issue when I have tried to export and then Import. The export shows it goes through to save, but it's the importing that shows a error and that it's empty on all my computers, except you can import it to Outlook. I also reformatted my lap top and reinstalled TB and that has the same issue, So I would say this is a bug in TB.   I also noticed in a few previous help messages other people have the same issue and no one responded like  you have to get this fixed. In addition, it would be wonderful if TB programed the calendar to sync on other computers that have TB just like the emails do and message do. I hope you can find a fix for this as I only like using TB as my email provider </p>",metrorep,false,0,0
