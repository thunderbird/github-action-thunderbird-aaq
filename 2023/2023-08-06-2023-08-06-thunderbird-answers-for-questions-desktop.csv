It will probably be a day or so before I know if that has any effect on TB. If it has not turned on spontaneously in three days I will try enabling each extension one at a time to see if one of them may be responsible, I cannot imagine that it would be because I rarely use them and I have not used any of them since upgrading to v 115. </p>",binghamjc1,false,0,0

When I go to turn on troubleshoot mode a box pops up that says: Troubleshoot Mode will disable all add-ons and temporarily use some default preferences. Are you sure you want to restart? I don't know what default preferences it is going to use. I did not turn it on. </p>",binghamjc1,false,0,0
