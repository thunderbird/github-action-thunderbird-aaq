The ""Version 102.13.0"" error might be related to your Thunderbird version. Make sure you have the latest version installed, as updates often come with bug fixes. As for the 'Active' folder issue, it's possible that there's a glitch causing this. Let's try a couple of things. First, restart Thunderbird and your system â€“ sometimes a simple reset can do wonders. If the 'Active' folder still gives you trouble, let's attempt a repair. Go to Thunderbird's ""Help"" menu and select ""Troubleshooting Information."" Then, click on ""Repair Thunderbird."" This might help fix any underlying problems. If that doesn't work, consider checking Thunderbird's support page or reaching out to the Thunderbird community for further assistance. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

It's important to access those old emails for legal matters. To address this, you can follow these steps: </p><p>First, open Thunderbird on your new laptop. Click on ""File"" in the top menu and select ""New"" and then ""Existing Mail Account."" Enter your name, AOL email address, and the password associated with your AOL email account. Thunderbird will try to automatically configure the settings. If that doesn't work, you might need to set up the account manually by selecting ""Manual config"" during the setup process. For incoming mail server, choose ""IMAP"" and enter ""<a href=""http://imap.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.aol.com</a>"" for the server hostname. Use ""993"" for the port. For outgoing mail server (SMTP), use ""<a href=""http://smtp.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.aol.com</a>"" as the server hostname with port ""465"" or ""587."" Enter your AOL email address as the username, and you should be prompted to enter your AOL password. Thunderbird will then start downloading your AOL emails to your new laptop. You should be able to access those old emails for your legal matters. </p><p>If you encounter any issues during this process, feel free to reach out for further assistance.

While Thunderbird doesn't directly support importing .wab files, you're right that converting to .csv might lead to losing the organization. What you can try is to use a two-step approach. First, convert your .wab file to a .csv file (I know, it's not perfect). Then, before importing into Thunderbird, organize your .csv contacts into folders that mirror your old structure. This should help maintain some of the organization. When importing into Thunderbird, make sure to choose the option to import into the system address book, and those folders you created should be preserved. It's not seamless, but it should keep your structure intact. Good luck, and let me know if you need more guidance! </p>",suram080,false,0,2

Since your laptop's Thunderbird is connecting fine, it's likely an issue specific to the new installation. Let's try a couple of things. First, ensure that your antivirus or firewall isn't blocking Thunderbird's connection. Sometimes security software can interfere. Also, make sure you have the correct server settings: incoming (IMAP/POP3) and outgoing (SMTP) server addresses and ports. If Thunderbird isn't saving your password, it might be due to a corrupted profile. Try creating a new profile by launching Thunderbird with the command ""thunderbird.exe -P"" (without quotes) in the Run dialog.

I did however find the emails. They were in a new file, named as per my account name,  in the deleted folder. Now I am 100% sure I did not delete them.  How do I get them back to the inbox, can I just drag and drop that folder back to the inbox? Thanks. Jon </p>",greenfinger,false,0,0

It sounds like your messages might have been archived automatically. To locate your archived messages, go to the ""Archive"" folder in Thunderbird. If you don't see it, you can check your Thunderbird settings to ensure that automatic archiving is properly configured. You can do this by going to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Options"" &gt; ""Advanced"" &gt; ""General"" &gt; ""Config Editor"" and searching for ""mail.autoArchive."" Make sure it's set to ""true"" if you want automatic archiving. If your messages aren't in the Archive folder and you don't have any backup, it's advisable to reach out to Thunderbird's official support for further assistance. They might have additional steps to help you recover your lost messages. Hang in there, we'll work to get this resolved! </p>",suram080,false,0,1

Don't worry, we can get this sorted out! It's great that you've already tried reinstallation, which can help sometimes. Let's give this a shot: First, double-check your SMTP settings for your Outlook account in Thunderbird. Make sure they're correctly configured. Also, ensure any antivirus or firewall isn't interfering with sending. Sometimes disabling them temporarily can help troubleshoot. If the issue persists, you might want to try removing and re-adding the Outlook account in Thunderbird again. Sometimes a fresh setup can fix these quirks. Give it a go, and let's see if that gets your Outlook messages flowing smoothly again! If not, we're here to help. </p>",suram080,false,0,3

Seeing messages from different accounts in one place is a neat feature, so I understand your concern. From what you've described, it seems that the Unified Inbox isn't showing messages from account B properly. To fix this, try a couple of things: first, double-check your account settings and ensure they're all correctly configured. Then, let's reset the Unified Folders view. Go to ""View -&gt; Folders -&gt; Unified"" to toggle it off and then back on. This might refresh the view and show all the messages from both B and C. If the issue persists, maybe try a quick restart of Thunderbird. Hope this helps you get your Unified Inbox working as it should!

With IMAP everything is managed on the server, and the client (Thunderbird) is just a mirror of what's on the server. The mistake you did was moving messages to the IMAP folder while Thunderbird was not running or offline. Upon re-starting Thunderbird the server erased those messages on the client it didn't know about. </p> <blockquote> There is no backup on this computer. </blockquote> <p>That's the second big mistake.

It seems like during the transition from POP to IMAP, moving your emails didn't go as planned. While I'm not sure about your specific situation, it's possible that the dragging process might have caused some issues. However, don't worry just yet! Your emails might not be completely gone. One thing you could try is to check the ""Local Folders"" section in Thunderbird. Sometimes, when you drag emails around, they end up there. If you don't see them there either, it's worth checking if you have any backups, perhaps on an external drive or a cloud storage. In the future, to avoid such situations, it's a good practice to back up your important data regularly. If you're really stuck and can't find your emails, consider reaching out to Thunderbird experts for more specialized help. </p>",suram080,false,0,1
