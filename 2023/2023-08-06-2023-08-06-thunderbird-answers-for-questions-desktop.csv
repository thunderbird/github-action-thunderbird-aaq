Seeing messages from different accounts in one place is a neat feature, so I understand your concern. From what you've described, it seems that the Unified Inbox isn't showing messages from account B properly. To fix this, try a couple of things: first, double-check your account settings and ensure they're all correctly configured. Then, let's reset the Unified Folders view. Go to ""View -&gt; Folders -&gt; Unified"" to toggle it off and then back on. This might refresh the view and show all the messages from both B and C. If the issue persists, maybe try a quick restart of Thunderbird. Hope this helps you get your Unified Inbox working as it should!

Don't worry, we can get this sorted out! It's great that you've already tried reinstallation, which can help sometimes. Let's give this a shot: First, double-check your SMTP settings for your Outlook account in Thunderbird. Make sure they're correctly configured. Also, ensure any antivirus or firewall isn't interfering with sending. Sometimes disabling them temporarily can help troubleshoot. If the issue persists, you might want to try removing and re-adding the Outlook account in Thunderbird again. Sometimes a fresh setup can fix these quirks. Give it a go, and let's see if that gets your Outlook messages flowing smoothly again! If not, we're here to help. </p>",suram080,false,0,4

It sounds like your messages might have been archived automatically. To locate your archived messages, go to the ""Archive"" folder in Thunderbird. If you don't see it, you can check your Thunderbird settings to ensure that automatic archiving is properly configured. You can do this by going to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Options"" &gt; ""Advanced"" &gt; ""General"" &gt; ""Config Editor"" and searching for ""mail.autoArchive."" Make sure it's set to ""true"" if you want automatic archiving. If your messages aren't in the Archive folder and you don't have any backup, it's advisable to reach out to Thunderbird's official support for further assistance. They might have additional steps to help you recover your lost messages. Hang in there, we'll work to get this resolved! </p>",suram080,false,0,1

Since your laptop's Thunderbird is connecting fine, it's likely an issue specific to the new installation. Let's try a couple of things. First, ensure that your antivirus or firewall isn't blocking Thunderbird's connection. Sometimes security software can interfere. Also, make sure you have the correct server settings: incoming (IMAP/POP3) and outgoing (SMTP) server addresses and ports. If Thunderbird isn't saving your password, it might be due to a corrupted profile. Try creating a new profile by launching Thunderbird with the command ""thunderbird.exe -P"" (without quotes) in the Run dialog.

Don't worry, we can get your emails flowing again. To start, let's try a couple of steps. First, make sure your internet connection is stable. Next, check your email account settings in Thunderbird. Sometimes, changes in email settings can affect incoming emails. If everything looks good there, you might want to try restarting Thunderbird or even your computer.

While Thunderbird doesn't directly support importing .wab files, you're right that converting to .csv might lead to losing the organization. What you can try is to use a two-step approach. First, convert your .wab file to a .csv file (I know, it's not perfect). Then, before importing into Thunderbird, organize your .csv contacts into folders that mirror your old structure. This should help maintain some of the organization. When importing into Thunderbird, make sure to choose the option to import into the system address book, and those folders you created should be preserved. It's not seamless, but it should keep your structure intact. Good luck, and let me know if you need more guidance! </p>",suram080,false,0,2

For incoming mail server, choose ""IMAP"" and enter ""<a href=""http://imap.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.aol.com</a>"" for the server hostname. Use ""993"" for the port. For outgoing mail server (SMTP), use ""<a href=""http://smtp.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.aol.com</a>"" as the server hostname with port ""465"" or ""587."" Enter your AOL email address as the username, and you should be prompted to enter your AOL password. Thunderbird will then start downloading your AOL emails to your new laptop.

If the 'Active' folder still gives you trouble, let's attempt a repair. Go to Thunderbird's ""Help"" menu and select ""Troubleshooting Information."" Then, click on ""Repair Thunderbird.""

You can do this by going into the Preferences/Settings and exploring the Appearance or Themes sections. Also, keep an eye on Thunderbird's official support resources or the community forums – they're a great place to find solutions and tips for any KDE-specific issues you might come across.

To migrate your Thunderbird setup and filters from Windows to Linux Mint, you're on the right track with moving the mail data and profile.

To get your filters working on Linux Mint, you'll want to copy this ""msgFilterRules.dat"" file to the appropriate profile directory on Linux. Since you're using the profile ""x1ua9znr.default-release,"" navigate to your Thunderbird profile directory on Linux, find the corresponding ""ImapMail"" folder, and paste the ""msgFilterRules.dat"" file there. After that, when you launch Thunderbird on Linux Mint, it should pick up your filters along with your mail data.
