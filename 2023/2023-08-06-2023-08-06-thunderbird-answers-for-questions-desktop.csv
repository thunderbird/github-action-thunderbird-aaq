The ""Version 102.13.0"" error might be related to your Thunderbird version. Make sure you have the latest version installed, as updates often come with bug fixes. As for the 'Active' folder issue, it's possible that there's a glitch causing this. Let's try a couple of things. First, restart Thunderbird and your system â€“ sometimes a simple reset can do wonders. If the 'Active' folder still gives you trouble, let's attempt a repair. Go to Thunderbird's ""Help"" menu and select ""Troubleshooting Information."" Then, click on ""Repair Thunderbird."" This might help fix any underlying problems. If that doesn't work, consider checking Thunderbird's support page or reaching out to the Thunderbird community for further assistance. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

It's important to access those old emails for legal matters. To address this, you can follow these steps: </p><p>First, open Thunderbird on your new laptop. Click on ""File"" in the top menu and select ""New"" and then ""Existing Mail Account."" Enter your name, AOL email address, and the password associated with your AOL email account. Thunderbird will try to automatically configure the settings. If that doesn't work, you might need to set up the account manually by selecting ""Manual config"" during the setup process. For incoming mail server, choose ""IMAP"" and enter ""<a href=""http://imap.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.aol.com</a>"" for the server hostname. Use ""993"" for the port. For outgoing mail server (SMTP), use ""<a href=""http://smtp.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.aol.com</a>"" as the server hostname with port ""465"" or ""587."" Enter your AOL email address as the username, and you should be prompted to enter your AOL password. Thunderbird will then start downloading your AOL emails to your new laptop. You should be able to access those old emails for your legal matters. </p><p>If you encounter any issues during this process, feel free to reach out for further assistance.

While Thunderbird doesn't directly support importing .wab files, you're right that converting to .csv might lead to losing the organization. What you can try is to use a two-step approach. First, convert your .wab file to a .csv file (I know, it's not perfect). Then, before importing into Thunderbird, organize your .csv contacts into folders that mirror your old structure. This should help maintain some of the organization. When importing into Thunderbird, make sure to choose the option to import into the system address book, and those folders you created should be preserved. It's not seamless, but it should keep your structure intact. Good luck, and let me know if you need more guidance! </p>",suram080,false,0,2
