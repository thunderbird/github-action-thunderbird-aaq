It seems like during the transition from POP to IMAP, moving your emails didn't go as planned. While I'm not sure about your specific situation, it's possible that the dragging process might have caused some issues. However, don't worry just yet! Your emails might not be completely gone. One thing you could try is to check the ""Local Folders"" section in Thunderbird. Sometimes, when you drag emails around, they end up there. If you don't see them there either, it's worth checking if you have any backups, perhaps on an external drive or a cloud storage. In the future, to avoid such situations, it's a good practice to back up your important data regularly. If you're really stuck and can't find your emails, consider reaching out to Thunderbird experts for more specialized help. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

It will probably be a day or so before I know if that has any effect on TB. If it has not turned on spontaneously in three days I will try enabling each extension one at a time to see if one of them may be responsible, I cannot imagine that it would be because I rarely use them and I have not used any of them since upgrading to v 115. </p>",binghamjc1,false,0,0

When I go to turn on troubleshoot mode a box pops up that says: Troubleshoot Mode will disable all add-ons and temporarily use some default preferences. Are you sure you want to restart? I don't know what default preferences it is going to use. I did not turn it on. </p>",binghamjc1,false,0,0

The error message ""Unable to write the email to the mailbox. Make sure the file system allows you write privileges, and you have enough disk space to copy the mailbox"" usually indicates a problem with permissions or available disk space. To fix this, first, make sure you have enough space on your computer. Then, check if Thunderbird has the necessary permissions to write to your mailbox. You might need to adjust folder or account settings. If you're unsure, you can find more specific steps in Thunderbird's support resources. </p>",suram080,false,0,0
