With IMAP everything is managed on the server, and the client (Thunderbird) is just a mirror of what's on the server. The mistake you did was moving messages to the IMAP folder while Thunderbird was not running or offline. Upon re-starting Thunderbird the server erased those messages on the client it didn't know about. </p> <blockquote> There is no backup on this computer. </blockquote> <p>That's the second big mistake. Hopefully lessons learned. </p> <blockquote> They weren't in the Local folders. </blockquote> <p>Because you <strong>moved</strong> them to the IMAP folder. For these kind of transactions <strong>copying</strong> first, and deleting  once copying is completed successfully is the safer way. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

It seems like during the transition from POP to IMAP, moving your emails didn't go as planned. While I'm not sure about your specific situation, it's possible that the dragging process might have caused some issues. However, don't worry just yet! Your emails might not be completely gone. One thing you could try is to check the ""Local Folders"" section in Thunderbird. Sometimes, when you drag emails around, they end up there. If you don't see them there either, it's worth checking if you have any backups, perhaps on an external drive or a cloud storage. In the future, to avoid such situations, it's a good practice to back up your important data regularly. If you're really stuck and can't find your emails, consider reaching out to Thunderbird experts for more specialized help. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

The error message ""Unable to write the email to the mailbox. Make sure the file system allows you write privileges, and you have enough disk space to copy the mailbox"" usually indicates a problem with permissions or available disk space. To fix this, first, make sure you have enough space on your computer. Then, check if Thunderbird has the necessary permissions to write to your mailbox. You might need to adjust folder or account settings. If you're unsure, you can find more specific steps in Thunderbird's support resources. </p>",suram080,false,0,1
