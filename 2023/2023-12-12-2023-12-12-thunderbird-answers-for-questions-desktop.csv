My suggestion would be to first copy all folders in the account to new Local Folders folders.  </p><p>If this is an IMAP account, you need to do this:  - click File&gt;offline&gt;Download and select the desired folders - once downloaded, copy the folders to a new folder in Local Folders area.  These steps ensure that the messages are now separate from the IMAP account and will remain after closing the account. You can then remove the account. Also, since these are import for you, be sure to do a profile backup afterward as these are now the only copy. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My struggles took a couple of weeks, but I'm comfortable now with the new structure. AND, the old menu bar is still the same. If you press the alt key or F10, it appears and the view&gt;sort is still there. If you don't use the menu bar, look to the icon just to the right of the 'quick filter' button above the message list pane, and the sort feature is on that menu. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Some users like the older menu bar, but the direction is toward minimizing the main pane. That sets reliance on the hamburger menu and the two are not consistent.

Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.
