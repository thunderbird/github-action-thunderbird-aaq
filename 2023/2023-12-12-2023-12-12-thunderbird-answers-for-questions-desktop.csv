My suggestion would be to first copy all folders in the account to new Local Folders folders.  </p><p>If this is an IMAP account, you need to do this:  - click File&gt;offline&gt;Download and select the desired folders - once downloaded, copy the folders to a new folder in Local Folders area.  These steps ensure that the messages are now separate from the IMAP account and will remain after closing the account. You can then remove the account. Also, since these are import for you, be sure to do a profile backup afterward as these are now the only copy. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
