And I'm not the guru for that. There should be just one prefs.js file. maving many indicates that, over time, there have been problems. When I copy a profile in windows, I receive no such notices, so maybe Thunderbird was not fully shut down. After copying, you can use windows file explorer to view the copied profile to see the Mail folder and Imapfolder to see what is there. Local folders are in the Mail\Local Folders folder. The fact that the Mac prompted to create an email account is the first clue that it doesn't like the profile, possibly due to the multiple occurrences of prefs.js. BUT, all that aside, if you see missing folders in the Mac, you can use the OS's file management software (the equivalent to Windows' file explorer) to copy the missing folders in. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

This community is just awesome! </p><p>Firstly, it was crashing at ""send later"" yesterday while it was syncing many many mails from my gmail account. I don't know if that was the reason or something else. Then I restarted PC and after a while (next day) it didn't actually crash, it just instantly closes the ""write new"" window and places my message in the Outbox. After your suggestion, I have realised there's no crash log at all. So I thought, there must be something wrong with the user side (me). I've searched the internet and found out that for real a ""send later"" function there must be an add-on installed. I have installed ""Send Later 10.3.3 by Jonathan Kamens, Jonathan Perry-Houts"" and it works flawlessly.  </p><p>Thank you Wayne for your support and patience.
