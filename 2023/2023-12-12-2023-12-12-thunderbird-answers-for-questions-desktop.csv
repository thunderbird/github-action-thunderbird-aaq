And I'm not the guru for that. There should be just one prefs.js file. maving many indicates that, over time, there have been problems. When I copy a profile in windows, I receive no such notices, so maybe Thunderbird was not fully shut down. After copying, you can use windows file explorer to view the copied profile to see the Mail folder and Imapfolder to see what is there. Local folders are in the Mail\Local Folders folder. The fact that the Mac prompted to create an email account is the first clue that it doesn't like the profile, possibly due to the multiple occurrences of prefs.js. BUT, all that aside, if you see missing folders in the Mac, you can use the OS's file management software (the equivalent to Windows' file explorer) to copy the missing folders in. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
