They are discontinuing IMAP access to Outlook UF email. I have been using Thunderbird for 20 years and it would be a big disruption for me to move to Outlook. Can you please suggest a way to still receive my UF emails via MAPI, EWS or EAS protocols (the only ones supported)? Thank you </p><p>IT email: ""If you recall, we had noted that IMAP access to UF Mail was a legacy connection method to UF mail, and I had noted that it could be blocked or removed in the future with little to no notice.  Well, unfortunately that prediction has now come to pass.  Between now and the end of the month (they didn’t give us a specific date), IMAP access to UF Mail will no longer be supported or available.  Since Thunderbird relies primarily on IMAP for access to mail, it will no longer be able to retrieve UF mail. Only mail clients that support mail access via MAPI, EWS or EAS protocols will be supported.  The only UF supported mail client on desktop or laptop computers is Microsoft Outlook.   Apple Mail uses MAPI/EWS, so should continue to work (unless configured to use IMAP). The only supported mobile client is the Microsoft Outlook App, but both the native mail apps on Android and iOS use supported mail protocols and will continue to work."" </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1576567;,venexiano

Network Solutions hosts my domain, and my email is based upon that domain (name@domain.com). I use the most current Thunderbird version (April 2023) for my PC email. Up until recently, my server settings left emails on the NetSol server. I believe they were POP3 settings. I had my Thunderbird folders on my PC all nice, and then a big email bucket on the NS server. Maybe the folders were there, too. I hardly ever looked at my NS webmail app. I just figured it was there as ""backup"". NS recently sent an email advising about an upgrade to a TLS 1.2 server, and providing new server settings: ""We’re updating our security... Due to an increase in attacks and security vulnerabilities in recent years, older versions TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer being used. To make sure your data continues to be safe, we are supporting the more advanced TLS 1.2"". When I reconfigured my Thunderbird settings, I opted for an IMAP set-up, which I thought always left a copy on the server. Later, after watching my Thunderbird with its new settings import 1000s of emails over many hours into my PC, which I then sorted into folders, when I accessed my NS webmail inbox, all my emails, the 1000s that came in, were gone. The new IMAP setting seems to have removed (rather then ""mirrored"") my emails from the NS server. Is this right? I thought IMAP left emails on a server, and POP3 took them off unless a user specified ""leave a copy on the server"". PLEASE can anyone help? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1576578;1576676;1576679;1576708;1576711;1576715;1576716;1577657;1577689;1577700;1577708;1577714;1577733;1577755;1577758;1577848;1577849;1577850;,robertlaporta
