Starting today, I am not able to send an email. I get the following error message:   Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail: Outgoing server (SMTP) error. The server responded:  <a href=""http://p-impout007.msg.pkvw.co.charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">p-impout007.msg.pkvw.co.charter.net</a> cmsmtp Connection Rejected - see <a href=""http://www.spamhaus.org/query/ip/24.106.196.86"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spamhaus.org/query/ip/24.106.196.86</a> AUP#Out-1220.  When I go to that web address, the web page says ""Invalid Input"".  What do I need to do to fix this problem? My email address is gbeale@ec.rr.com </blockquote> <p>When I go to that address I get a detailed explanation of why spamhaus has blacklisted the IP address. </p><p>Try this link <a href=""https://check.spamhaus.org/listed/?searchterm=24.106.196.86"" rel=""nofollow"">https://check.spamhaus.org/listed/?searchterm=24.106.196.86</a> </p><p>Note that the AUP#Out-1220 is internal diagnostic stuff from your ISP.  See <a href=""https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/understanding-email-error-codes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/understanding-email-error-codes</a> </p> <blockquote>Your IP address has been blacklisted by Spamhaus. The owner of the IP address must contact Spamhaus to be removed from the list.  (Note: Spamhaus has sole discretion whether to remove the sending IP address from their lists.)</blockquote> <p>I did a query on the relevant IP address 24.106.196.86  it is part of a block issued to charter communications. <a href=""https://ipinfo.io/24.106.196.86"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ipinfo.io/24.106.196.86</a> </p><p>So as far as I can see,  we have a <a href=""http://charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">charter.net</a> server refusing to connect to an IP address also issued to charter because it is ""exhibiting suspect behavior, is misconfigured, or has a poor sending reputation. "" </p><p>I would suggest you check your outgoing server (SMTP) entry for the account and make sure you are not connecting in Port 25.  Only server should be using that port to transmit mail these days.     The domain <a href=""http://ec.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ec.rr.com</a> does not get a mention in the <a href=""https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/mobile-email-setup"" rel=""nofollow"">published settings</a> on the Spectrum site.  So I would guess you will be using settings for TWC accounts. </p><pre>   Incoming Email Server: <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>    Outgoing Email Server: <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> </pre> <p>In addition to the other settings on that page. </p><p>Otherwise if your settings are correct and you are not affected by the changes to @bresnan.net addresses mentioned on the web site. I suggest you contact Charter in their guise as Spectrum and ask them what they are doing about their internal addresses being blacklisted and them then internally using the blacklist to compromise their own systems. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
