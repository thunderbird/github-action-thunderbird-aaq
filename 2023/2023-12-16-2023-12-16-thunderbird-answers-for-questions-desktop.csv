In ogni caso non ha molto senso mantenere configurato un account non utilizzato. Di solito in questi casi si consiglia di spostare la posta in una o più sottocartelle sotto <strong>Cartelle Locali</strong> o in alternativa usare la funzione Archivia ( <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/archiviazione-messaggi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/archiviazione-messaggi</a> ); quindi rimuovere l'account. </p>",@next,false,0,0

Ha senso (per me, evidentemente ignoro qualcosa...) mantenere l'account su Thunderbird perchè si tratta di una ditta chiusa nel 2020 e per 10 anni devo conservare la corrispondenza cosiccome il resto della documentazione fiscale, che a volte capita di dover consultare. Aggiungo comunque che fino a 2 giorni fa non mi dava quel messaggio e comunque le caselle ""controlla messaggi all'avvio"" erano e sono tuttora senza spunta (vedi foto). L'account di Gmail è stato cancellato quindi è normale che il Programma non possa accedervi ma non capisco perchè cerchi di farlo... Ho provato anche a riabilitare la funzione, dirgli di controllare ogni 17 ore così da accettare il primo messaggio di errore e poter lavorare tranquillo, quindi disabilitarlo nuovamente ma non è servito. Se sposto nelle cartelle locali rischio di perdere qualcosa, configurazione compresa tra cartelle e sottocartelle? Grazie di nuovo, un saluto </p>",ri.ser.leo,false,0,0

Se vuoi mantenere la struttura delle sottocartelle, allora usa il primo metodo e <strong>ricrea la struttura di cartelle e sotto-cartelle</strong> all'interno di <strong>Cartelle locali</strong>. Il secondo metodo invece va usato solo se ti è funzionale una suddivisione cronologica (una cartella per ogni mese e/o anno). </p><p><strong>In ogni caso fai prima un backup integrale del profilo</strong> -&gt; <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/profili-thunderbird#w_effettuare-una-copia-di-sicurezza-del-profilo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/profili-thunderbird#w_effettuare-una-copia-di-sicurezza-del-profilo</a> in questo modo avrai una ulteriore copia di sicurezza che è sempre prudente fare in ogni caso. Nella tua situazione sarebbe anzi consigliabile salvarla su un supporto esterno al PC. </p><p>Un'ultima cosa: se utilizzavi IMAP come protocollo per accedere a Gmail assicurati che le mail che hai salvato siano complete. Con IMAP infatti di solito si scarica solo l'intestazione dei messaggi che poi vengono recuperati per intero solo quando vengono aperti. Potresti cioè avere dei messaggi incompleti se hai usato questo protocollo. </p>",@next,false,0,0

Only one folder is affected but it's my main folder used for friends and relatives so they were all going in the same place as I run 2 email accounts within Thunderbird. Once i exit this folder after getting the emails to show and they go back into it they aren't showing and I don't think I put any sort of filter on so not sure what changed. Thanks </p>,jdp0806,false,0,0

One shows empty when I first open the folder (None of the others have this issue) The other shows the emails that should be staying there. I set my emails up for certain one to go to certain folders. Hope this helps as the repair option did nothing for it.  It's the Jim folder that is giving me the grief. </p><p>Thanks </p>,jdp0806,false,0,0
