I tried simply moving the inbox folder back to where it should be but it will not move. I checked the inbox folder properties and the path is directing it to trash. I tried editing that path to delete the /trash element but I can not change that path.   mailbox:///home/barbara/.thunderbird/jzlrnnn0.default-release/Mail/<a href=""http://pop.gmail-2.com/Trash.sbd/Inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail-2.com/Trash.sbd/Inbox</a> See also screen shot attached I checked the mozilla/thunderbird help pages for any info about this problem and found nothing specifically addressing moving a folder from trash back to its rightful place. How do I fix this and get my inbox back to where it should be. As a sub-question, what happened and why, and how to stop that ever happening again? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1620538;1620802;,barbara_hodgkinson

Now that all my recipients addresses go into the one field, as soon as there are more than 2-3 addresses the To: (or CC or BCC) box expands downwards, pushing everything else down.
