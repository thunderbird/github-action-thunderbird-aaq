If I reply to a message that was sent to an existing identity, I have the option to ""Customize From Address..."" on the menu for the from address.  When I reply to a message sent to one of my extended email addresses, the option to ""Customize From Address..."" is on the menu, but disabled.  Prior to version 115.5.0 this worked and I was able to customize the from address when replying to a message sent to an email address that did not match an existing identity.  I use extended email addressing, so I need the option to customize the from address -- is there some way to enable this option again? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",moseley-mozilla
