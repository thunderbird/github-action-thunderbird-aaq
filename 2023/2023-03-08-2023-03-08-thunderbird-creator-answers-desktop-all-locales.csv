I examined the differences in the configuration of the TB account data and It is identical to the other two gmail accounts except name, login, and the assignment of a trash folder. I selected Advanced settings and forced the addition of the account to TB yet was unable to create folders such as Trash as TB said they already exist even though they are not shown. The only folder shown in the forced account is Inbox. I included window snapshots for each step. I don't understand why the michiaito8@gmail.com account is not being added. The account works at <a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a> via browser and on my iPhone. Please advise.

All my mail from my server gets to my iPhone just fine. At first thought it was a timing issue, so took TBird out of the startup tray. Then deleted Avast virus detection. Sometimes leaving TBird up and open would get emails after hours-long waiting. Have not gotten any new emails int TBird now for 25 hours! What to do? I've cleared cache, deleted a ton of emails from webmail, changed port settings. I prefer responding to emails on the Surface, rather than on my phone...but they aren't on the laptop for me to respond to.  Last Windows Update automatically installed on 2/15/23....hmmm What to do?
