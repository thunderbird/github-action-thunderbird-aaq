I do not recommend using the allmail folder in Thunderbird because it is a repository of everything and causes all your mail to be there twice. Other email services (to my knowledge) do not do this, so that is why I guessed Gmail. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

I want to keep All Mail as back up and there must be a setting that sends my sent mail to the one folder. To further confuse matters - and I've raised this question before - some of my emails disappear altogether. ie I can't find them in In-box, sent mail, all mail or trash. </p>",Bryan1,false,2,0
