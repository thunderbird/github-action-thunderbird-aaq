These companies and individuals have their own Folders and associated Filters to 'MOVE' FROM &amp; TO emails, from the Account's Inbox, to their designated Folder.

That doesn't happen. </p><p>I'm sure I once did something like this, and there was a message that popped up saying the Filters have been updated. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",TheFlapjack

In the Add-on settings we could choose the user and then, among the email accounts that are configured in Thunderbird, choose the accounts that we want to monitor and save a log of all the user's operations in each of the selected accounts. Does anyone know any addon that does what I want, or is interested in developing? Of course I can pay for this development depending on the price.

1419877,2023-08-01 02:10:58 -0700,2023-08-01 02:10:58 -0700,Request for a web version of Thunderbird,"<p>Dear Thunderbird team, </p><p>I am a loyal user of Thunderbird, and I appreciate your efforts to provide a free, open source, and feature-rich email client. I am writing to request that you consider developing a web version of Thunderbird, as I believe it would offer many benefits to your users and enhance your competitiveness in the email market. </p><p>Some of the advantages of a web-based email client over a desktop client are: </p><p>- Accessibility: A web-based email client can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, without the need to install any software or configure any settings. This is especially convenient for users who travel frequently, use multiple devices, or work remotely. - Updates: A web-based email client can be updated automatically and frequently, without requiring any user intervention or downloading any files. This ensures that users always have the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches. - Backup: A web-based email client stores all the email data in the cloud, which means that users do not have to worry about losing their messages, contacts, or other information in case of a device failure, theft, or loss. Users can also access their email history from any device, without having to sync or transfer any files. - Customization: A web-based email client can offer more flexibility and options for customization than a desktop client. Users can choose from different themes, layouts, fonts, colors, and add-ons to suit their preferences and needs. Users can also switch between different web browsers and devices without losing their settings or preferences. </p><p>A web-based email client is not only convenient and efficient for users, but also important for the future of email communication. As more and more people use online services and platforms for their personal and professional needs, email is becoming an integral part of the web ecosystem. A web-based email client can integrate seamlessly with other web applications and services, such as calendars, contacts, social media, cloud storage, and productivity tools. This can enhance the user experience and functionality of email, as well as increase the security and privacy of email data. </p><p>Thunderbird is already a great email client that offers many features and benefits to its users. However, by developing a web version of Thunderbird, you can attract more users who prefer or need a web-based email solution. You can also leverage your existing strengths and reputation as an open source project that values user freedom, privacy, and security. A web version of Thunderbird would be a valuable addition to the web community and a powerful alternative to other webmail services. </p><p>I hope that you will consider my request and look into the possibility of creating a web version of Thunderbird. I am sure that many other Thunderbird users would appreciate and support this initiative as well. Thank you for your time and attention. </p><p>Sincerely, B. R.

Ho controllato nelle impostazioni ed associato il programma di lettura PDF (Kofax Power PDF). Per fare delle prove ho usato anche altri lettori Adobe ed ho lo stesso problema. Se imposto ""visualizza anteprima in Thunderbird"" funziona ... ma non è quello che voglio. Se imposto ""chiedi che programma usare"" il problema rimane: i PDF arrivati me li fa aprire, i PDF che allego ai miei messaggi e vorrei aprire prima di spedirli, non li apre ...
