1419877,2023-08-01 02:10:58 -0700,2023-08-02 01:12:44 -0700,Request for a web version of Thunderbird,"<p>Dear Thunderbird team, </p><p>I am a loyal user of Thunderbird, and I appreciate your efforts to provide a free, open source, and feature-rich email client. I am writing to request that you consider developing a web version of Thunderbird, as I believe it would offer many benefits to your users and enhance your competitiveness in the email market. </p><p>Some of the advantages of a web-based email client over a desktop client are: </p><p>- Accessibility: A web-based email client can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, without the need to install any software or configure any settings. This is especially convenient for users who travel frequently, use multiple devices, or work remotely. - Updates: A web-based email client can be updated automatically and frequently, without requiring any user intervention or downloading any files. This ensures that users always have the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches. - Backup: A web-based email client stores all the email data in the cloud, which means that users do not have to worry about losing their messages, contacts, or other information in case of a device failure, theft, or loss. Users can also access their email history from any device, without having to sync or transfer any files. - Customization: A web-based email client can offer more flexibility and options for customization than a desktop client. Users can choose from different themes, layouts, fonts, colors, and add-ons to suit their preferences and needs. Users can also switch between different web browsers and devices without losing their settings or preferences. </p><p>A web-based email client is not only convenient and efficient for users, but also important for the future of email communication. As more and more people use online services and platforms for their personal and professional needs, email is becoming an integral part of the web ecosystem. A web-based email client can integrate seamlessly with other web applications and services, such as calendars, contacts, social media, cloud storage, and productivity tools. This can enhance the user experience and functionality of email, as well as increase the security and privacy of email data. </p><p>Thunderbird is already a great email client that offers many features and benefits to its users. However, by developing a web version of Thunderbird, you can attract more users who prefer or need a web-based email solution. You can also leverage your existing strengths and reputation as an open source project that values user freedom, privacy, and security. A web version of Thunderbird would be a valuable addition to the web community and a powerful alternative to other webmail services. </p><p>I hope that you will consider my request and look into the possibility of creating a web version of Thunderbird. I am sure that many other Thunderbird users would appreciate and support this initiative as well. Thank you for your time and attention. </p><p>Sincerely, B. R.

On further inspections, they were not missing, you just could not see them due to the inactive tabls having black-text over a near-black background. Only the active tab could be seen. How can I change the text color for the title of inactive tabs? </p><p>Second, the entire UI has changed and no longer respects the color choices made in 102. The bright border lines around the folder window and separating the message header from the body in the reader-view sticks out like a sore-thumb. How can I change or disable the outline? </p><p>Lastly menu-autohide no longer hides the menu completely in the new-message window. You can still see each menu entry below the title bar. It doesn't make any difference whether I check or uncheck the use window manager titlebar setting.
