I did finally get everything working again by reconfiguring the download settings in Thunderbird. The only problem was that this involved downloading every message from my Comcast message store (over 45K messages) into my Thunderbird inbox. I realize I should be deleting old and unwanted messages from Comcast and plan to start doing that to avoid this from happening again. I've been using Thunderbird for many years and love it for organizing important messages.

TB 102.8.0 was installed to both at the same time, and not updated since. Both laptop and desktop say Windows Home Premium Service Pack 1. Again, I believe there is something local on the desktop computer. I have tried disabling just about everything and the connection still fails. Unless there is some better diagnostic tool, I'm giving up. </p>",dgoldman1,false,0,0

This probably explains why you are getting the pop up that says "" “Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username, or password”.

I didn't explicitly say so, but I did ""try every variation"", including your good suggestion,  and it did not work. Originally, I was using 2 step authentication. On Windows 7 desktop, would not authenticate when A) trying to send an email from TB using gmail smtp server, and B) trying to have TB read gmail imap server, as previously explained. Later, I got tired of the repeated 2 step authentication and so disabled it. The results were the same: A) and B would not authenticate on desktop. Later, I tested from a TB install (same TB version) on a windows 7 laptop (same OS version). Authenticated perfectly and easily. Again, I believe there is something local on the desktop computer. Everything in TB and gmail is the same between desktop and laptop, but desktop fails to authenticate. Unless there is some better diagnostic tool, I'm giving up. It is too inefficient guessing.

In secondo luogo Thunderbird è un programma che opera localmente sul tuo computer, nessuno può manovrarlo da remoto. </p><p>Per il resto, le informazioni che hai fornito sono troppo limitate per poterti suggerire delle soluzioni. A me sembra strano che all'improvviso ti arrivino migliaia di email di phishing. Sicura che non sia un problema dell'antivirus? Inoltre, se puoi accedere al server tramite webmail, potresti eliminare tutti i messaggi di phishing evitando di doverli scaricare con Thunderbird. </p>",@next,false,0,0
