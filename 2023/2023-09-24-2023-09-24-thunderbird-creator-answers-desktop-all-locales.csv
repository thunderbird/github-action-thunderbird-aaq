For a long time I have been looking for a feature that would allow me to fit more time on one page of my calendar (in week view). I recently discovered the correct setting to change the number of hours displayed. </p><p>I've always tried using Ctrl+Mouse Wheel to zoom in and out, but it didn't change anything. I thought it would be a nice idea to map the above setting to the Ctrl+Wheel combination for zooming in and out, so you don't have to search through the settings. </p><p>Do you have any experience with this or is there an addon for this? </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",survellow

I started yesterday receiving a message that it could not write emails due to not enough space, etc. A lot of searching on the web and it seemed the best solution was to re-add my gmail account as an IMAP account rather than POP, which I did. Emails now worked correctly coming in. </p><p>I have a large number of folders organizing my emails under my original profile. Within Firefox, I moved them from my POP email to my IMAP email. I waited to make sure this was done successfully, as it would count through them at the bottom of the screen. Once this was done, I deleted the POP account. </p><p>Today, I opened Thunderbird and a lot of the folders are missing. The internet has been very little help, but I did manage to locate them in the Mail folder of the profile folders. If I move them to the corresponding location in the ImapMail folder (the msf and the file with no extension) they show up for a second in Thunderbird, then not just disappear, they are literally deleted from my hard drive. </p><p>Please help me get these emails back. Even if I have to find some way to make them readable outside of Thunderbird, that's fine. These are records I need to have access to. </p><p>It should not take rocket science to move a folder and I am seriously considering a different client now. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Sinaku
