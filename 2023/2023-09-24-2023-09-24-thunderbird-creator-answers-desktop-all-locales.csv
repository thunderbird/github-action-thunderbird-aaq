Thanks and kudos to all those involved! </p><p>I'm a long-time user of Thunderbird (decades) but haven't been a big fan of the preview pane.  That's just me.  However, with the advent of Supernova, I decided to turn on the preview pane particularly since you added the Card View feature.  I use the ""Vertical"" layout with folders, messages and then the preview pane on the right. </p><p>Perhaps I'm just not in the know but is there an ability to open a message in a new tab from the preview pane?  I looked at customizing the toolbars but didn't find an ""Open"" message button.  I thought that double-clicking in the preview pane would open the message in a new tab but alas it doesn't do anything.  I also right-clicked in the preview pane and there was no option on that menu to open the message either. </p><p>Even though I use my 55"" TV for my monitor, I don't give the preview pane 100% capability to view the entire width of a message because I want to see more of the subject in the message column and a complete date and time.  It's very clear that not all messages are created equally so some wrap and fit nicely and other won't wrap and the slider bars appear.  I'm good with how this works.  So when I'm using the slider bars in the preview pane there are times I want to open the message in a new tab to more readily read the larger message.  I hope this makes sense.  Thus my need to be able to open a message from the preview pane either by double-clicking or by using a button in the preview pane.  And, BTW, my ""General"" settings are set to open a message in a new tab when double-clicked.  I prefer to work from tabs (another very nice feature!). </p><p>If this feature doesn't exist then I would appreciate it if you would consider adding it and a button at the top of the preview pane panel to open a message in a new tab. </p><p>I'll look forward to your reply. </p><p>Kindest regards, </p><p>Ken Cox [removed email from public] </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1605933;,starphyter

For example, messages from one of them always have 'WKCC' included in the Subject line, and 'members2members' in the To line.  I've set up innumerable filters based on those features, checking 'Manually Run' and 'Getting New Mail', choosing to filter before or after Junk Classification, and choosing to move the message to the Inbox.  I've also tried choosing to apply the filter 'Periodically, every 10 minutes'.  In every case, after setting up the filter, when I click on 'Run Now', the junk mail is correctly moved to the Inbox, and it stays there.  But future messages are NEVER correctly prevented from going to the Junk Email folder, nor are messages in the junk folder processed every 10 minutes when I request that. </p><p>I'm at a loss, any help would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>-Paul </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",murtaugp

The internet has been very little help, but I did manage to locate them in the Mail folder of the profile folders.
