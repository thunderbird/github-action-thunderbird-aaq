Emails now worked correctly coming in. </p><p>I have a large number of folders organizing my emails under my original profile. Within Firefox, I moved them from my POP email to my IMAP email. I waited to make sure this was done successfully, as it would count through them at the bottom of the screen. Once this was done, I deleted the POP account. </p><p>Today, I opened Thunderbird and a lot of the folders are missing. The internet has been very little help, but I did manage to locate them in the Mail folder of the profile folders. If I move them to the corresponding location in the ImapMail folder (the msf and the file with no extension) they show up for a second in Thunderbird, then not just disappear, they are literally deleted from my hard drive. </p><p>Please help me get these emails back. Even if I have to find some way to make them readable outside of Thunderbird, that's fine.

Thanks and kudos to all those involved! </p><p>I'm a long-time user of Thunderbird (decades) but haven't been a big fan of the preview pane.  That's just me.  However, with the advent of Supernova, I decided to turn on the preview pane particularly since you added the Card View feature.  I use the ""Vertical"" layout with folders, messages and then the preview pane on the right. </p><p>Perhaps I'm just not in the know but is there an ability to open a message in a new tab from the preview pane?  I looked at customizing the toolbars but didn't find an ""Open"" message button.  I thought that double-clicking in the preview pane would open the message in a new tab but alas it doesn't do anything.  I also right-clicked in the preview pane and there was no option on that menu to open the message either. </p><p>Even though I use my 55"" TV for my monitor, I don't give the preview pane 100% capability to view the entire width of a message because I want to see more of the subject in the message column and a complete date and time.  It's very clear that not all messages are created equally so some wrap and fit nicely and other won't wrap and the slider bars appear.  I'm good with how this works.  So when I'm using the slider bars in the preview pane there are times I want to open the message in a new tab to more readily read the larger message.  I hope this makes sense.  Thus my need to be able to open a message from the preview pane either by double-clicking or by using a button in the preview pane.  And, BTW, my ""General"" settings are set to open a message in a new tab when double-clicked.  I prefer to work from tabs (another very nice feature!). </p><p>If this feature doesn't exist then I would appreciate it if you would consider adding it and a button at the top of the preview pane panel to open a message in a new tab. </p><p>I'll look forward to your reply. </p><p>Kindest regards, </p><p>Ken Cox [removed email from public] </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1605933;1606216;1606221;,starphyter

And both the folders have same mails. </p><p>So: Inbox shows 1/2 (one unread, total 2 messages) All mail also shows 1/2 (one unread, total 2 messages) </p><p>As I said earlier, I mostly use Keyboard shortcuts. </p> <ol><li> I open Inbox. </li><li> And read first message (with subject: This is new but unimportant message). </li><li> I find unimportant. So I press 'Del' key to delete that message </li><li> Then I immediately press 'n' to move to next unread message </li><li> Now thunderbird takes me to All Mail folder of GMail </li><li> Since All Mail still does not know that 1st email was deleted from Inbox folder, it shows me same email again in All Mail folder. </li><li> So I press 'Del' key to delete that message (which was already deleted from Inbox but not synced with All mail) </li><li> But by the time I press 'Del' key the thunderbird synced the All Mail folder, and on its own deleted the first message and focus was dropped on 2nd email. </li><li> Now since focus was dropped on 2nd (important) email while I was pressing the Del key, instead of deleting first unimportant email, I accidentally deleted 2nd important email without realizing what happened. (Important message is gone without me realizing) </li><li> This issue was not there earlier (I believe before Supernova). Earlier focus did not fall on 2nd email automatically but thunderbird completely de-focused the pane. So even if I press Del key it would not delete anything. </li></ol> <p>I have had many instances of important email going to Trash because of this newly introduced bug. Noticing mostly after Supernova was introduced. </p><p>In above example there were just 2 emails, so one would immediately notice that How come all emails vanished when I just deleted one email. </p><p>But in reality I have hundreds of new messages and would not realize that Del key was pressed on an important email because thunderbird changed the focus. </p><p>Please look in to the bug and resolve </p><p>Thank you </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1606078;1606344;,amish

From... Subject... Etc.) more visually distinct.  As is, they look exactly the same as a read message -- same font, not bold, no color, etc.  I support some very inexperienced Thunderbird users, and they have a distressing tendency of accidentally clicking on a column heading, which changes the email-list's sort order -- and often confuses them.  I'm thinking that if the column headings had a background color tint (the specific color doesn't matter), it would make it more obvious that the heading row is not just another message.  Taking the idea one step further, if the color for the selected sort-order column was a darker shade than the other columns, it might even be more obvious that the headings are in fact a *control*, not just another read message. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1605969;1605972;1606064;,gfwalker
