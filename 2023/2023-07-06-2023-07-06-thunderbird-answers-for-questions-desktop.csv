The second shot shows one email address selected (in a great big window that blocks out almost all of the list of addresses.) With difficulty, I can scroll down the list above that window and click on other entries, and the third shot shows what happens when, with Ctrl key held down, I tried to drag and drop (four) addresses to another Contact List. The  red circle with oblique line through it suggests to me that it not only doesn't work but isn't meant to. Perhaps someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong? </p><p>The good news for me is that in doing these shots, my second problem (""Send Via the Address Book"") has been answered – but not in the way described in the article that I referenced (a way that used to work.)
