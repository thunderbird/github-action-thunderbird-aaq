It would be Interesting to know the type of computer, OS and version of Thunderbird that David is using. I am adding three screen shots to show what happens when I try to select, then drag and drop individual contacts to a list. The first shot shows a Contact List (“PHISHING”) selected. The second shot shows one email address selected (in a great big window that blocks out almost all of the list of addresses.) With difficulty, I can scroll down the list above that window and click on other entries, and the third shot shows what happens when, with Ctrl key held down, I tried to drag and drop (four) addresses to another Contact List. The  red circle with oblique line through it suggests to me that it not only doesn't work but isn't meant to. Perhaps someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong? </p><p>The good news for me is that in doing these shots, my second problem (""Send Via the Address Book"") has been answered – but not in the way described in the article that I referenced (a way that used to work.) To select the complete Contact List, it is necessary to  - click on the Contact List  - Click on one of the entries displayed in the list, (when Write appears – see shot 2) then  - Ctrl/A to select the whole list. - then click on Write. </p>",EmmBee,false,0,0

I ran a ""move"" filter on a large folder using the ""Run Now"" button. I clicked ""Run Now,"" but nothing (apparently) happened, so I clicked again. Then later the filter log said it had moved a number of messages. But when I looked, they were still in the original folder. And still later there were multiple copies of the messages in the destination folder. </p><p>Then I didn't realize that ""contains"" matches substrings, not just whole words. I applied a short string to message bodies and got a lot of unwanted matches. So now I'm being cautious about that, and  using short strings only in header fields. </p><p>So I'd have some tips about filters for newbies like myself: </p> <ol><li> The filter term ""contains"" matches all substrings, not just whole words. </li><li> Until you're confident about filters, test them for a while with ""Copy"" to a test folder instead of ""Move"". Later you can change it to ""Move"" and run it for keeps. </li><li> If you click something and there's no response, don't assume nothing happened. There isn't always an indication, or it might be subtle. And it might still be happening in the background. </li></ol> <p>Another example of this last: I accidentally deleted an email, hit ctrl-Z hoping to get it back, and nothing happened. (That was my original question.) But actually it was restored, it just didn't show in the folder until I went to another folder and came back. </p><p>I hope this doesn't sound too much like a gripe session. A number of ex-Agent users recommended Thunderbird, and I'm still on the learning curve. But I have fallen into a few traps and am hoping to help others avoid them. </p>",Toolworker,false,0,0
