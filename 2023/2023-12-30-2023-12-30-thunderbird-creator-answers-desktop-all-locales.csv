These I routinely move to a folder for scam mails together with Nigeria letters and what else I get. There are quite a lot of mails in that folder now! A few days ago I wanted to do some statistics on all these mails, and to my great wonder, all sextorsion mails, save one, have disappeared from that folder. All other kinds of spurious mails seem to remain.  Are there anything in Thunderbird that automatically do away with that kind of mail? One of the mails contained nothing but a screenshot, so it did not even have text that could trigger a delete.
