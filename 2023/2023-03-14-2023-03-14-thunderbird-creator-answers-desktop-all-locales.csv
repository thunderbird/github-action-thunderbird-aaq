I'm running 102.8.0 and while I can see the name of my Mac OS X Address Book in Contacts, nothing appears in Thunderbird, despite there being probably 20,000 contacts in my Mac Contacts Address book.   The only way to view contacts in TB, for years now, has been to run Cardbook. I'm wondering if this issue will ever get fixed?  I see you are working on what you seem to think is a big deal with the toolbar for 115 but in reality unless you are paying attention looks pretty much like what is there now.  So while you all think it's huge, it's minor.  When will you do something major like getting this issue resolved.  Just an FYI, I'm a regular contributor and I'd like to see this issue resolved before this toolbar thing that you all seem to be spending an inordinate amount of time on. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",chunnel
