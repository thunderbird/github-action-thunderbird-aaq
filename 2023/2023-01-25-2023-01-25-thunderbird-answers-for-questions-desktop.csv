It is not optimal,  but it does prove the filter is independent.&nbsp;:) </p><p>Most marketing mail, and lets face it the thank you is more about marketing than anything else, skirts the definitions of spam.  It is unsolicited,  generally has embedded tracking data which I at least, see as an invasion of my privacy.  Even if it is only a web beacon it is a tracker. </p><p>Then we look to Thunderbird's junk mail controls which learn from you what you think is SPAM and in doing so has no regard for the email addresses used as they are really not a good indication of SPAM. So of course for some folk the learning filter will include mail from the donations address as spam. </p><p>If I was not aware of Mozilla and Thunderbird's rather odd relationship with the Mozilla company and foundation, as well as the involvement of the MZLA corporation in the building of Thunderbird.  I would question why an email is purporting to come from a mobile sub domain,with a reply to another address on the main domain.  That looks SPAMMY to me. </p><p>Personally I suggest you reply to the address given. It is legitimate, some years ago I used to reply to mail to that address.  Ask why their email to you might be such that the Junk filter identifies it.  It is an issue that those directly involved in the donation process should be aware of. </p><p>Your point is in many ways quite valid,  it is just it does not surprise me that this could occur. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Please run through some checks and offer confirmation of results for each check. Please supply some information so we can understand your particular setup. </p><p><strong>1.  Firewall</strong>. Exit Thunderbird if it is running. Access the Firewall which might be controlled by your Anti-Virus program. Thunderbird must be an allowed program. Please make sure Thunderbird is set up as an allowed and program otherwise your Firewall could be blocking access to required ports. </p><p>Please Confirm you have Thunderbird as an allowed program in the Firewall settings. </p><p><strong>2.

Some think customers will access the information held on their websites and magically know what to look for.

Please see the other post I made where I did provide details of very specific messages in the error console. 1. I am on Linux. As far as I know there is not an issue with a firewall. 2. The idea of a VPN is something that I remember looking into, but I don't remember setting up anything like that, although there could be something I have forgotten about. My web browser works fine though. 3. The accounts I have set up are POP3, and as far as I know I have not changed any settings. There is more than one account set up and all of them are failing, so if it was a case of having accidentally changed the settings on one of these then it would not have affected the others. So I don't believe it is due to settings. I have the accounts set up to ask for password each time, so I put the password in and it fails. (see the error log messages I posted) 4. OS is Linux. The version is 102.7.0 but was a lower version and failing. I then updated to see if it would help. I can't remember what the last working version was. 5. See 3. above regarding settings for the accounts. 6. Yes I tried using the error console and posted a few specific messages on the other post. The only reason I started a new post was that I had not been getting any answers. I have not been able to use Thunderbird for my e-mails now since December. So I have to log in to the webmail interface for the provider I am using. 7. I could try uninstalling, but that would be a lot of work because I would have to make sure all my e-mails were backed up somewhere, and I thought that by posting the details of what was happening, including the specific error messages in the error console would have been a good clue to someone who is one of the proper software developers. I don't think it would be normal for things to break just because of a software update, and to then have to un-install and then re-install the same software. If updating is a problem then maybe that is a bug that needs to be looked into, if the latest upgrades are breaking something. </p>",brian05,false,0,0

However, few folders are shown empty in Thunderbird, and they certainly have some mail - I can see it in the corresponding files. When I look at a problematic folder properties it shows that its location is different from the actual file - some random 8 letters, and Thunderbird created an empty folder with this name. I've tried to remove folderTree.json, folderCache.json, and even global-messages-db.sqlite, and restarted the Thunderbird. The properties of the folder remain the same and the directory with wrong name is created again, and the folder remains empty. Other mail folders are fine - the emails are rescanned.  Where the mapping from local mail file name to Properties/Location is stored? I cannot find it with grep - the only reference I've found was in the files I removed, but the mapping somehow persists. </blockquote> <p>The path to folders is derived from the account directory in account settings plus the appropriate additions of folder names.
