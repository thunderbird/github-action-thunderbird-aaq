But as a general guide I recall people used to find there was a limit of approximately 60 addresses when sending messages if you enter each address separately, but it may be to do with limits imposed by server. However, if you use lists (mail distribution lists) for most of the addresses any limit is imposed by whatever SMTP server you use.  </p><p>Each mail account will connect to a specific server. That mail account may be provided by your ISP or a free one provided by eg: gmail or maybe you have purchased an email address.  All servers have their limits on what you can send and the limit varies between servers. Some limit number of emails per hour and/or per 24 hour rolling period. Most do not permit large scale bulk emails and some offer that ability but you have to pay for it. </p><p>For example - Gmail limits - note there is a difference between limits sending via smtp 3rd party software and sending directly using webmail account. <a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852</a> <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22839"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22839</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Just click file&gt;new&gt;existing account and fill in the server name for input and the port number and authentication and then possibly select 'manual setup' if TB needs to be prompted for the smtp server name that you developed. If you have further problems, just post a screenshot of what you entered and we'll try to assist.  Generally, the setup panes show only the data that is required. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
