But as a general guide I recall people used to find there was a limit of approximately 60 addresses when sending messages if you enter each address separately, but it may be to do with limits imposed by server. However, if you use lists (mail distribution lists) for most of the addresses any limit is imposed by whatever SMTP server you use.  </p><p>Each mail account will connect to a specific server. That mail account may be provided by your ISP or a free one provided by eg: gmail or maybe you have purchased an email address.  All servers have their limits on what you can send and the limit varies between servers. Some limit number of emails per hour and/or per 24 hour rolling period. Most do not permit large scale bulk emails and some offer that ability but you have to pay for it. </p><p>For example - Gmail limits - note there is a difference between limits sending via smtp 3rd party software and sending directly using webmail account. <a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852</a> <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22839"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22839</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

When View Density is set to ""Compact"" but the Message List /Threads panel is more spacious (due to the CSS line height settings),  you can't scroll and click through a long list of messages because every time you click, TB jumps to highlight that message, but it jumps off the visible display of the Message List; apparently the program is calculating where to place the focus and highlight the clicked on message BY NOT USING THE ACTUAL LINE HEIGHT set by the CSS but some other line height (presumably based on ""Compact"" density?) </p><p>If you try to click, or scroll and select (Shift Click) several messages, you can't: they vanish off the visible display after you click 9on them.  </p><p>So TB is not usable in this condition. If scrolling, click, and focus code were aware of the line height that is actually in effect in the message list, I think things would be great.   But at present, this means you can't select, delete, etc., from a message list if it contains more than 10 or 20 messages, if you are seeking a readable line height for the list and a more compressed line height for the folder tree. At this point, after 3 days of trying to cope with this, I am debating downgrading to previous TB.  Will you report this as a bug, or am I expected to do that?  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",kmartinp,false,1,0

(My hardware acceleration is off, by the way).  </p><p>1. Scrollng is fine (usually). The wheel of my mouse works perfectly at any Density setting, and with any number ##px between 18 and 40 for the thread rows,  in the CSS template that you provided to me. Wheel on mouse stopped working for about 30 minutes last night for some unkown reason...otherwise, wheel scrolling is perfect.  [Page down and pg up aren't routinely operative, nor are up arrow and down arrow to scroll, but that's a nasty problem that I'm not focusing on right now).   </p><p>2. Clicking and selecting a message in a Message List, is my problem. The problem is: I click on message in the list (table view), and the click causes a ""jump-scroll"" movement out of the screen ""window"" with the focus and the message that I tried to click on below the bottom cut-off of the ""window"" or ""viewport"" or whatever you call the rectangle on the screen that contains the message list. So I have to scroll after clicking to go find the message I clicked on, and I can't select a group of several messages because the focus is always jumping off the screen and is crazy.  </p><p>3. This problem, #2 above, DOES NOT HAPPEN...can be made to vanish, in only two ways that I have found: </p><p>A) If there  is a userChrome.css file with a ##px value for Thread Row Height of 27 AND the View/Density is set to Default; In this case I can click, select, scroll, select many emails, early in the list, late in the list, it is all stable, predictable and acceptable).  </p><p>B) The problem also does NOT occur if one removes or renames the userChrome.css file that contains settings for row height and tree folder line height settings and Card line height settings as you provided to me.  Without those settings in useChrome.css, Density can be compact or Default or Relaxed, it all works.  </p><p>Outside of these two conditions, the problem happens, big time, and it makes  TB not usable anylonger.  </p><p><br> </p><p><br> .. </p>",kmartinp,false,0,0

If I set the height to 40px with Relaxed density, selecting messages in the Thread Pane (message list) is sufficiently stable, especially in Vertical View.
