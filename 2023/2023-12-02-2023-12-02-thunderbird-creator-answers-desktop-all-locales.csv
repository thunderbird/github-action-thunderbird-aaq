I did a comparison between backup version from before the IMAP server change and there does appear to be some minor changes to the contents of the `[Search Folder name].msf` files. </p><p>Also, why does the directory containing my mail messages: `[profile] &gt; ImapMail &gt; <a href=""http://mail.gandi.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.gandi.net</a>-maildir` Retain the name of the previous IMAP server and not the new one - and, I guess it's more aesthetic than anything, but perhaps it's connected to the disappearing Search Folders.
