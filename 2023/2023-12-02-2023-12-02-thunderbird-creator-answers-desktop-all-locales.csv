It just freezes when I try - and cannot even manually install addons that I download using Chrome. I even totally deleted all files and folders  and reinstalled Thunderbird 115.0 from stratch... what happened?!  </p><p>I found that after total removal - if I install a earlier version... that I can verify and install addons, but not with version 115.  </p><p>I also found that I cannot import profiles from zip or even uncompressed folder. I confirmed the profile is less that 2 gig (1.2 gig) - so size of the profile should not be a problem. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",spaceknight2
