We've tried everything and when following the prompts to reset (tools &gt; developer tools &gt; etc) it won't come up with the evaluate button or reset button. We've tried the online sources but no success and she can't access her emails on her desktop. Please let me know what we can do&nbsp;! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",sonjonev

It just freezes when I try - and cannot even manually install addons that I download using Chrome. I even totally deleted all files and folders  and reinstalled Thunderbird 115.0 from stratch... what happened?!  </p><p>I found that after total removal - if I install a earlier version... that I can verify and install addons, but not with version 115.  </p><p>I also found that I cannot import profiles from zip or even uncompressed folder. I confirmed the profile is less that 2 gig (1.2 gig) - so size of the profile should not be a problem. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",spaceknight2
