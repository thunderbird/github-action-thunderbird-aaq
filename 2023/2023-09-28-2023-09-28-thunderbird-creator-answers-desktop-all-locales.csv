So I came looking for ""115 add-ons"", and the first hit is the [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-115-supernova-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">| TB 115 FAQ</a>] -- but it says nothing about add-ons!   </p><p>IAC, a search for ThunderHTMLedit returns nothing, so that great add-on may be gone anyway, but what is happening with TB 115 and add-ons generally (and why does ""115 add-ons"" get a hit on the FAQ when the FAQ is silent on add-ons)? </p><p>[As much as I like TB 115, this may send me back to 102.] </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",kaufmann

I am not very technically inclined so would appreciate some advice please, thank you. My ISP technical person (at iiNet Australia) did say they were receiving a lot of phone calls today about email and ""blamed"" it on changes to Outlook? If this helps.

I do so successfully and select ""allow"" to give access to Thunderbird.  But then, back in Thunderbird, I see ""Host contacted, sending login information..."" and it never finishes.  Eventually (many minutes) it times out.  I have tried dozens of times with the same result. </p><p>I have a second gmail account configured in the same instance of Thunderbird, with exactly the same settings.  It continues to work fine, and does not display the OAuth pop-up when I get/send mail.  This makes me think that the problem has something to do with my Google account rather than with my Thunderbird settings, but I have not changed anything there either. </p><p>Both accounts are configured for pop3 (<a href=""http://pop.gmail.com:995"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com:995</a>), security SSL/TLS, authentication OAuth2.  Thunderbird is set to accept all cookies and keep until expired.  I deleted all saved passwords for the failing account, but Thunderbird still has the password for the account that is working. </p><p>I've already wasted many hours on this.  I have read and tried all suggestions that I can find online.  Please help! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",larry9850

Auto settings work just fine until it gets to verifying my password where it fails. This is a password that was used for a previous account in Thunderbird on my previous OS where it worked without issue. I can go to my provider and log in using this password without issue.  I have not yet tried changing the password as I can't rationalize why that should matter. Actually, I logged onto this site using that password.

I am currently using 115.3.0, build ID 20230926115257 on Debian Linux. </p><p>It used to be that if you selected the view as ""Unread"", it would stick with that folder, now it just does it until you leave the folder. </p><p>I normally view messages as text since html can be a security issue. There is a button marked ""Show HTML"", which no longer works. Now I have to select ""View"", ""Message Body as"" and then manually select things back and forth. </p><p>I used to be able to have a button for the Filter Function to have filter folder or filter message, not it is only a selection for Filter Functions and then I can select what I want to do. This is going backwards. </p><p>Under ""Unread Folders"", often the count is incorrect and it claims that there is a message which is unread, which is false. If I select ""Compact View"", and then unselect it, the count gets corrected. </p><p>There are also other issues which were caused by updates. There is clearly an issue with regards with a lack of testing to ensure things are not getting broken. </p>",other;tb115;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1606567;,k+firefoxzz
