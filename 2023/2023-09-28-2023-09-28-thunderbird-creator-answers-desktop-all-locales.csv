I made a backup copy of my default profile and then I upgraded to Supernova, the upgrade seemed succesful, but one of my POP accounts was never polled when downolading emails,<strong> Thunderbird skipped retrieving emails from that account</strong>. So I downgraded to 102.15.1 64 bit. But it says that the default profile could not be used because a newer version of TB could have modified it, so it forced me to create a new profile. But in the new profile I lost almost everything: sent emails, received emails, filters, archives. The only thing good is that TB 102 remembers the name of mail servers, so I did not have to configure them again. But I had to download again from the server some 6000 emails (I leave the emails on POP servers for some months, for security reasons), but I lost all sent emails and more. So my old, default profile is useless. What to do? </p><p>If I try to import it in Supernova it gets error: Uncaught (in promise) NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND: Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIFile.copyTo] </p><pre>   _recursivelyCopyMsgFolder resource:///modules/ThunderbirdProfileImporter.jsm:659    _importMailMessages resource:///modules/ThunderbirdProfileImporter.jsm:588    _importServersAndAccounts resource:///modules/ThunderbirdProfileImporter.jsm:248 </pre> <p>2 ThunderbirdProfileImporter.jsm:659 </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1606593;1606890;1606939;1609420;,a.colamartino

Since I'm fully familiar with bulleted and numbered paragraph systems in word processing programs, I am used to; 1) entering the first line, bulleted/numbered, text, then; 2) after ENTER, having the next bulleted line appear for additional text; 3) continuing to build the bulleted text list as long as one desires; 4) if wanting an indented second level of text, merely pressing TAB key, which indents with either a bullet repeated, or an additional sub-symbol 5) the indented second/third/fourth level(s) of bulleted text ARE NOT treated as a new double-spaced paragraph, but rather just the next line in text. 6) attempting to use the OUTDENT Text or INDENT Text icons for such is a total waste of time, since the text may show up as a double-spaced paragraph, attempting to use TAB merely cancels the bullet symbol. </p><p>6) Further frustrating, is that if I attempt to use a TAB while writing this little missive, I am PROHIBITED from having a tab indent in this message, but will be ejected from this message and sent off to somewhere other in this webpage.  Really, really a stupid design! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1606727;,Hikermann
