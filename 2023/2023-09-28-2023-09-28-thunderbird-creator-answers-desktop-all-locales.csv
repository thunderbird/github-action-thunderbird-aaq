I am currently using 115.3.0, build ID 20230926115257 on Debian Linux. </p><p>It used to be that if you selected the view as ""Unread"", it would stick with that folder, now it just does it until you leave the folder. </p><p>I normally view messages as text since html can be a security issue. There is a button marked ""Show HTML"", which no longer works. Now I have to select ""View"", ""Message Body as"" and then manually select things back and forth. </p><p>I used to be able to have a button for the Filter Function to have filter folder or filter message, not it is only a selection for Filter Functions and then I can select what I want to do. This is going backwards. </p><p>Under ""Unread Folders"", often the count is incorrect and it claims that there is a message which is unread, which is false. If I select ""Compact View"", and then unselect it, the count gets corrected. </p><p>There are also other issues which were caused by updates. There is clearly an issue with regards with a lack of testing to ensure things are not getting broken. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",k+firefoxzz

My use case is that I want to easily tell which account (inbox) is associated with each email when using a unified inbox folder. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",helium6072

I am an IT pro and I know how it works. But it seems there is no UI to access that level of detail. </p><p>I try to use open source as much as I can. So on my private PC I use Thunderbird instead of Outlook which is on my work PC.  But my case is very peculiar, I collected 12 email addresses over many years around the globe. And searching in this mess is the challenge! </p><p>So not being able to name the fields in the search query severely limits the possibility to find things in the 14 year backlog over 12 email accounts&nbsp;;) </p><p>I am worried that fixing this might go too deep under the hood to be a reasonable feature request for this project. </p><p>Any ideas? </p><p>Because Outlook is not much fun either&nbsp;:( </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",uvlight2018
