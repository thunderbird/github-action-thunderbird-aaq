You're attempting to download to a prior version of Thunderbird, when the profile is set for a newer version. But, as you say, we don't know what he really did. If his email account is IMAP, the simpler solution may be to just start with a fresh profile. If POP account, he could install the account, but omit entering password to prevent downloading mail. Then, with thunderbird not running, copy the ...\Mail\account folder from old profile to the corresponding folder in new profile and then restart thunderbird.

This appeared to correct the problem. I entered passwords for all accounts upon starting up and confirmed (through settings) that they had indeed all be saved in the password manager. It worked fine for most of the day but asked me for the password to one account towards the end of the day, which was odd. </p><p>This morning when I fired up Thunderbird it asked me for all of my passwords again (twice), which I entered (twice) and then confirmed that password manager saved none of them. </p><p>There are a few files in the profile which appear to be indicative of a problem  </p><p>.startup-incomplete encrypted-openpgp-passphrase.txt.corrupt encrypted-openpgp-passphrase.txt-1.corrupt </p><p>parent.lock was also present following shutdown. </p><p>I then deleted just parent.lock and reinstalled Thunderbird again (ver 102.7.2, previous version was 102.7.1). Upon launching it asked for all of my passwords (once) and I confirmed that none were stored by password manager so the program is essentially functionless as it's not downloading emails. </p><p>Next I shut down Thunderbird and deleted all of the files originally mentioned from the profile plus parent.lock, encrypted-openpgp-passphrase.txt.corrupt and encrypted-openpgp-passphrase.txt-1.corrupt. Upon restarting Thunderbird it asked for all my passwords (once) and then appeared to hang, with a little busy icon going round and round. I could however access the password manager and there was nothing stored in there. </p><p>Next I shut down Thunderbird and deleted parent.lock and opened it in safe mode. To be clear this is a fresh install of Thunderbird with a recently created profile and there are no extensions installed, I haven't even got as far as installing a dictionary yet. In safe mode it asked for all of my passwords again and as I entered them emails began to be downloaded. I confirmed that the passwords did appear in password manager. From the help menu I then immediately selected turn troubleshooting mode off and Thunderbird restarted in normal mode and asked me for all of my passwords again and encrypted-openpgp-passphrase.txt.corrupt was again present. </p><p>To say that this is frustrating is an understatement. If anyone can help to resolve this I would be grateful. Outside of that my only option would appear to be to run it permanently in safe mode.
