Two things I immediately noticed, one is the icon is different, and the other is that the UI looks almost exactly, but not quite, like the old UI.  Not that this is bad, I use TB everyday on my Mac and it is my email client.  But first impressions were underwhelming especially after the hype.  One thing I noticed that's an improvement is that TB now recognized my Mac address book so I no longer need Card Book.  Other than that it's much ado about nothing. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1590775;,chunnel
