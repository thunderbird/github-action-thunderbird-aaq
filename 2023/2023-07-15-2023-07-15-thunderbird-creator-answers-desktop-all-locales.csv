Ideally, for my use case, Thunderbird should not try to import the messages, simply allow me to view them.  I want to use it as a viewer, not an agent. </p><p>Still experimenting.  I'll update if I have a breakthru. </p><p><br> </p><p>Cheers, Raro </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1590631;1590632;1590636;,firefox.raro
