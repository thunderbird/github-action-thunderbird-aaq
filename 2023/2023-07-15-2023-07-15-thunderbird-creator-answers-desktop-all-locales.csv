I have a couple of issues I hope you can help with. </p><p>1. The box that lists incoming messages is way too long, taking up over half the screen. I moved it up as small as it will let me. 2. The second question is the box in between inbox and the message (middle pane) is also way too large. Ideally, I would only like it to display the top line. Remove the to and subject line The attached screen shot hopefully will help you see the issue. Please note that on the bottom of the shot is probably 3/4 way down my screen with very little room to read the message. Perhaps 3 or 4 lines at best. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",kliner
