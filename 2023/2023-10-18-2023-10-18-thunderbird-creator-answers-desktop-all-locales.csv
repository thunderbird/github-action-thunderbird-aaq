Una vera e propria delusione dal punto di vista grafico!! L'elenco delle email tutto attaccato, mentre nelle versioni precedenti c'erano almeno 3/4 mm tra una riga ed un'altra e questo da veramente fastidio a vedersi. Inoltre, la cosa più ""grave"" che sempre nelle versioni precedenti quando andavi su un account l'ultima mail arrivata appariva subito (in alto o in basso dipendeva da come impostata la visone) e quindi di facile consultazione. Mentre ora esce a metà circa, ad esempio prendendo in considerazione la data di oggi 18.10, l'elenco delle mail di un qualsiasi account non visiona questa data ma quella di almeno un mese prima e quindi bisogna andare col mouse nella freccetta e arrivare alla data attuale. Ripeto una grossa grossissima delusione per me che ho Thunderbird da oltre 20 anni. Si spera che si possa risolvere in qualche modo questi due ""problemi"" altrimenti sarò costretto a cambiare gestore di posta elettronica. Ringrazio anticipatamente per la eventuale cortese risposta e porgo cordiali saluti. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1611824;1611919;,zulli.danilo
