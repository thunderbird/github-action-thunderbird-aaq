Spamhaus didn't like this and I was flagged. Now, I have switched the smtp to my own domain, it shows the time I opened the email in thunderbird rather that the time the server received it. Looking at my email account via the web access, the received time is correct. By way of a test, I have Postbox on my pc and I added my account to that.  It did the same thing, showing the time that Postbox viewed it, rather than server receipt time. I have searched on the web and, although I can find time zone issues, I find nothing like this. Can anyone suggest any areas of investigation I should be looking at? Many thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1611815;,gordon47

The only fix I know is to close and open TB until it does, which is usually on the 4th or 5th attempt. 3) The font has been changed. I liked that on previous upgrades, it stayed as is. 4) A whole bunch of menu items are now relocated, requiring me to hunt around just to do the things I have done for years. This is a trash move on the part of Mozilla, something I would only have ascribed to Microsoft. </p><p>If I could go back to the previous version that is still on my laptop, I would.

All emails show on computer two as unread even if they have been read on computer one so I have to mark them as read. If I open the email on number two it does not show on number one.  3.This may have cured itself with the latest updated programme last week but when I sent an email it was storing 3 times in SENT EMAIL?

The problems I had earlier when I tried the upgrade with headers slow to appear seems to be fixed.   Thanks for all the work of the developers in tracking down issues in the new version.

If I leave open the offending email long enough, meaning several minutes often, it will change.   So I guess there is some other minor issue remaining with this function.
