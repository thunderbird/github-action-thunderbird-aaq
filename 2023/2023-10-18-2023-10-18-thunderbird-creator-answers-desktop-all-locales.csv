Ho appena migrato la posta da Outlook a T. e sto cercando di impostare i vari parametri, tra cui la firma che dovrà essere presente in tutte le mail. Come potete vedere dall'immagine allegata, la firma contiene l'immagine col nome della ditta dove lavoro, testo evidenziato e link di collegamento per download di file.  Mi chiedevo come impostare questa firma, visto che posso solo gestire o semplice testo o html nelle impostazioni dell'account. Ho provato vari siti per tradurre questa cosa, ma sembra impossibile e quindi al momento non mi resta che fare il copia/incolla su tutte le mail a mano.

Looking at my email account via the web access, the received time is correct. By way of a test, I have Postbox on my pc and I added my account to that.  It did the same thing, showing the time that Postbox viewed it, rather than server receipt time. I have searched on the web and, although I can find time zone issues, I find nothing like this. Can anyone suggest any areas of investigation I should be looking at? Many thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1611815;,gordon47

Una vera e propria delusione dal punto di vista grafico!! L'elenco delle email tutto attaccato, mentre nelle versioni precedenti c'erano almeno 3/4 mm tra una riga ed un'altra e questo da veramente fastidio a vedersi. Inoltre, la cosa più ""grave"" che sempre nelle versioni precedenti quando andavi su un account l'ultima mail arrivata appariva subito (in alto o in basso dipendeva da come impostata la visone) e quindi di facile consultazione. Mentre ora esce a metà circa, ad esempio prendendo in considerazione la data di oggi 18.10, l'elenco delle mail di un qualsiasi account non visiona questa data ma quella di almeno un mese prima e quindi bisogna andare col mouse nella freccetta e arrivare alla data attuale. Ripeto una grossa grossissima delusione per me che ho Thunderbird da oltre 20 anni. Si spera che si possa risolvere in qualche modo questi due ""problemi"" altrimenti sarò costretto a cambiare gestore di posta elettronica. Ringrazio anticipatamente per la eventuale cortese risposta e porgo cordiali saluti. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1611824;,zulli.danilo
