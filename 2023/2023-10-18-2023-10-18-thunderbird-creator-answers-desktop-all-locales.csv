Questa cosa sta rallentando enormemente il lavoro. Non funziona nemmeno più la funzione di ordine delle mail per data.  Anche la funzione di filtro delle mail sta dando problemi. </p><p>Si stava benissimo con la versione precedente, riuscite ad aggiustare o a mandarmi una versione precedente?

Spamhaus didn't like this and I was flagged. Now, I have switched the smtp to my own domain, it shows the time I opened the email in thunderbird rather that the time the server received it. Looking at my email account via the web access, the received time is correct. By way of a test, I have Postbox on my pc and I added my account to that.  It did the same thing, showing the time that Postbox viewed it, rather than server receipt time. I have searched on the web and, although I can find time zone issues, I find nothing like this. Can anyone suggest any areas of investigation I should be looking at? Many thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1611815;,gordon47

Una vera e propria delusione dal punto di vista grafico!! L'elenco delle email tutto attaccato, mentre nelle versioni precedenti c'erano almeno 3/4 mm tra una riga ed un'altra e questo da veramente fastidio a vedersi. Inoltre, la cosa più ""grave"" che sempre nelle versioni precedenti quando andavi su un account l'ultima mail arrivata appariva subito (in alto o in basso dipendeva da come impostata la visone) e quindi di facile consultazione. Mentre ora esce a metà circa, ad esempio prendendo in considerazione la data di oggi 18.10, l'elenco delle mail di un qualsiasi account non visiona questa data ma quella di almeno un mese prima e quindi bisogna andare col mouse nella freccetta e arrivare alla data attuale. Ripeto una grossa grossissima delusione per me che ho Thunderbird da oltre 20 anni. Si spera che si possa risolvere in qualche modo questi due ""problemi"" altrimenti sarò costretto a cambiare gestore di posta elettronica. Ringrazio anticipatamente per la eventuale cortese risposta e porgo cordiali saluti. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1611824;,zulli.danilo
