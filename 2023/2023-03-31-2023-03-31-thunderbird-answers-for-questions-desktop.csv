First to confirm the local copy ios the latest,  then again to notify the server of the status change in the current folder and in some cases another trip to another IMAP server to notify the creation of a new email in the account.  All of this follows the thread of lost connectivity either to the server or the disk being the underlying cause.

You can create the account online and set up on Thunderbird. You can set it up while you still are a Spectrum user and when you switch to other service, the email will run unchanged. A reminder: if you switch from Spectrum and have a spectrum email address listed with a number of companies, such as your utilities company or others that send invoices and other items automatically, you will need to update all those accounts prior to shutting down Spectrum.
