Ogni cartella di Thunderbird corrisponde ad un file su disco che ne contiene tutti i messaggi. Se hai l'abitudine di archiviare la posta in cartelle non troppo grandi (per esempio per mese) il funzionamento di Thunderbird resta efficiente. </p><p>Se invece accumuli molta posta in una sola cartella (per esempio lasci tutto in Posta in arrivo), con il tempo emergono lentezza, blocchi, e problemi di compattazione. Del resto qualsiasi programma rallenta molto se gli chiedi di aprire un file da decine di GB. </p><p>Quindi più che la dimensione complessiva conta come sono distribuite le email. In genere è ritenuto ottimale che nessuna cartella di Thunderbird superi i 2 GB. </p>",@next,false,1,0
