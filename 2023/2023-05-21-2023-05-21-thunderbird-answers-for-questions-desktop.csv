I am on my Windows 10.  Thunderbird is on my Mac.  I will get to the rest when I am on it again. Here it is the next morning and, now back on the Monterey OS, I confirmed that I used my Comcast email address in the cc: field.  Later today I will telephone my ISP technical support about this abnormality of the last two months.  There is no other address synced with my Thunderbird on this system.  Thank God; otherwise I would have trouble with that address too!  Looking at your question in more detail, the From address is the same as the cc: field.  I am suspicious because someone might have tried to send messages to me who does that on a regular basis.  Those messages may have bounced.  The Get Message command does not seem to do anything.  In the Sent folder the cc: and the From fields show the Comcast address.  Comcast addresses end with @comcast.net while GMAIL ends with @gmail.com.  The Outgoing Server in Thunderbird under Account Settings is <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> and the Port is 465.

Addresses there mean that you only receive from those addresses.  Later I will get on the the Mac again and look further into this.  Now, I just realized that I should have written Monterey instead of Catalina.  Earlier I had to reinstall Catalina and upgrade to Monterey to make available video functions.  Now, I am on the Mac Monterey (not Catalina as indicated in the beginning).  For one thing, my Thunderbird did not come with a Spam folder; so I created one called Junk.  I do not know if that causes conflicts.  On my smartphones I only access my GMAIL, not my Comcast one.  In my Comcast account in the advanced email settings, I do not have use email safe list checked.  What is there is the email address my telephone provider requires for eFaxing.  So, as the technician explained yesterday, having that checked meant that I could send only to that address and expect a response, such as a cc: copy.

I tried to reproduce the error you're getting, by importing events from the same ics file, twice, into the same target calendar. The first import is successful because the target calendar is empty. The second import fails with that exact error, and the Error Console gives the exact reason why the import fails as follows: </p><p><code>There has been an error reading data for calendar: Home.  However, this error is believed to be minor, so the program will attempt to continue. <strong>Error code: DUPLICATE_ID. Description: ID already exists for addItem</strong></code> </p><p>The problem is the IDs of the events you're importing from the file are already in use by existing events in the target calendar. This ID is a unique identifier for each event, and therefore cannot be shared between events in the same database. In other words, duplicates of the ID are not allowed into the database. This therefore means you cannot simply import the same events on top of each other and overwrite the existing ones, thus eliminating duplicates and keeping only one entry of each event. Not in the current version of Thunderbird that I know of anyway. Thunderbird now uses SQlite as its database for calendar data storage. Perhaps there is an add-on for doing that. You could also file a feature request (enhancement request) to skip duplicate items here <a href=""http://bugzilla.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> if one hasn't already been filed. </p><p>You may want to use an external tool to merge the ics files from the two calendars into one ics file, then import that into a new blank calendar. I can't offer any recommendations for such a tool as I've simply not had to do this before. Google Calendar apparently automatically merges duplicates. You could use that and then export the resultant calendar. </p>",stancestans,false,1,0

I does let me select the items I want to import. I will try importing only the new stuff if I can remember which are new. Maybe I will try one at at time and see what happens. </p>,jdevlin,false,0,0
