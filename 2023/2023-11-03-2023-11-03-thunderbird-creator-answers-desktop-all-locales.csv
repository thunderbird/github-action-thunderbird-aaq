After about 30 seconds it Thunderbird automatically scrolls up to the top of the email again and again without even touching the mouse. Thus making it difficult to read the entire email. </p><p>This version of Thunderbird is installed on a Macbook Computer booting up to Windows 10 operating system. </p><p>I've tried turning off auto scrolling and hardware acceleration with no change in behavior. </p><p>Should I roll back to an older version of Thunderbird or does anyone have a solution to try? </p><p>Thanks you for any suggestions. </p>,fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1615720;,jtroxel

A few months ago I updated to a newer version than this (it may have been beta, don't recall), which I found very difficult to use, and the new format didn't work well at all for me (including window size listing unread emails) and how I use the software for multiple email accounts.   </p><p>Also, in reverting back to an earlier version I somehow permanently lost 20 years of saved emails that I regularly use to reference things from that 20 year time period.  So, I was finally able to install the version above, which has all the features I want and need.   </p><p>The problem is I keep getting prompts, several times a day, to update to a newer version of Thunderbird, presumably like the one that caused me all the problems.  Aside from being annoying, I worry one of these times I will carelessly click on the wrong part of that notice window and start an update!!  I've researched how to stop update prompts, but most are 3 or more years old, and, when I followed those old instructions, they didn't work including changes in the Registry, but, I continue getting prompted multiple times each day.   </p><p>I can't find anything in the settings or elsewhere to stop update prompts.  Is there any way for me to do this that works with this (102.14.0 (64-bit)) version?  Thanks so much. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615745;,florestanschumann
