Thus making it difficult to read the entire email. </p><p>This version of Thunderbird is installed on a Macbook Computer booting up to Windows 10 operating system. </p><p>I've tried turning off auto scrolling and hardware acceleration with no change in behavior. </p><p>Should I roll back to an older version of Thunderbird or does anyone have a solution to try? </p><p>Thanks you for any suggestions. </p>,fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1615720;,jtroxel

A few months ago I updated to a newer version than this (it may have been beta, don't recall), which I found very difficult to use, and the new format didn't work well at all for me (including window size listing unread emails) and how I use the software for multiple email accounts.   </p><p>Also, in reverting back to an earlier version I somehow permanently lost 20 years of saved emails that I regularly use to reference things from that 20 year time period.  So, I was finally able to install the version above, which has all the features I want and need.   </p><p>The problem is I keep getting prompts, several times a day, to update to a newer version of Thunderbird, presumably like the one that caused me all the problems.  Aside from being annoying, I worry one of these times I will carelessly click on the wrong part of that notice window and start an update!!  I've researched how to stop update prompts, but most are 3 or more years old, and, when I followed those old instructions, they didn't work including changes in the Registry, but, I continue getting prompted multiple times each day.   </p><p>I can't find anything in the settings or elsewhere to stop update prompts.  Is there any way for me to do this that works with this (102.14.0 (64-bit)) version?  Thanks so much. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615745;,florestanschumann
