Then start TB, click account settings and change the local folder pointer at bottom of pane to point to the new location. Do the same for the Local Folders folder. Exit and restart TB and verify that all is working satisfactorily from the other drive and then you can delete the account folders from the Mail folder. On your question, yes, you can move the entire profile. You would then need to start profile manager to connect to the relocated profile. Users sometimes have problems doing that and that is why I offer the simpler approach. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Only the main UI and Write (created a new email) track the settings. </p><p>Thanks again for your detailed response. As a developer, to me this is 1) a design decisions that popup should have smaller UI, or 2) something got overlooked or overeridden.
