Then it went into Safe Mode. And lo! Thunderbird and my blocked web site worked again...once! After accessing them, I tried again (actually, the first thing I did was to try to mark this issues as ""solved"" and it wouldn't connect to this site) and it no longer will connect to these sites. This also happened after I did a minor update to my major Thunderbird upgrade, i.e. worked once and then stopped. I guess I have some awkward troubleshooting to do. If you happen to have a good link to a ""how to troubleshoot in Safe Mode"" that would be great! Mostly when you do a search you come up with a million guides to get INTO Safe Mode....not what I need. Thanks for your help. </p>",ps34,false,0,0

This disables anti virus and software firewalls and should offer a glimpse that may determine if that is the root issue if Thunderbird can do those things in safe mode with networking. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
