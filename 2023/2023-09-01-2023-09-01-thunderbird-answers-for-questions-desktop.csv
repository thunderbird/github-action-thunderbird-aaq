I cannot test on a MAC, so I would be interested to hear your comments on what results you see and what size you used. </p><p>There are various ways to set font size. I'll mention all of them. Each effects different areas and if set up incorrectly can end up confusing Thunderbird display. </p><p>I would remove whatever is currently set up in the 'userChrome.css' and as a heads up Thunderbird uses pixels not points. </p><p><strong>Generally the following should increase/decrease font size unless there is something set up which is overriding settings.</strong> </p> <ul><li> Via Menu icon &gt; Font Size &gt; click on the + or - icons to increase/decrease in increments - size is shown. </li></ul> <p>Via Menu Bar toolbar&nbsp;:  </p> <ul><li> View &gt; Font Size &gt; select 'Increase font size' or 'decrease font size' to increase in increments. </li></ul> <p>However - I do notice this fails to effect the 'New Tasks' window. I'll check to see if there's a bug report on this. </p><p><br> <strong>Alternative to increase ALL the font size in ALL areas:</strong> Make sure all other font size settings are back to default first. I notice this settings does effect the 'New Task' window. </p><p>Do this via the config editor. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Scroll down to bottom and click on 'Config Editor' </li></ul> <p>It opens in a new tab </p> <ul><li> In top search type: <strong>pixels</strong> </li><li> You are looking for this line:<strong> layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</strong> </li></ul> <p>The default setting is a <strong>negative</strong> number <strong>-1.0</strong> </p> <ul><li> Click on the pencil icon on the right - this allows editing. </li><li> clear all contents. </li><li> Type required size into the text editing area - but read the following first. </li></ul> <p><strong>For Windows users:</strong> I would advise starting with a <strong>positive</strong> number <strong>1.25</strong> and adjusting in increments until text is suitable size eg: 1.25, 1.5, but do not jump straight to a very large number otherwise you may discover you cannot access things and will need real guidance on editing in the actual profile files that store that data. </p><p><strong>For MAC users,</strong> these computers tend to use a much smaller pixel size and have more pixels in screen resolution. So small increases as used in WindowsOS are not so obvious.  I would advise starting with a <strong>positive</strong> <strong>3.0</strong>, to see what effect it produces, you may find you can increase in larger increments. Eg: 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 </p> <ul><li> Click on the tick icon to save. </li></ul> <p>You will notice effects immediately, so do not need to leave that Config Editor until you are happy with size. If you have the 'Menu Bar' enabled then you can easily access the 'Events and Tasks' &gt; 'New Task' to see what it looks like. </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>IF you only want to increase the font size of content in received emails:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Scroll to 'Language &amp; Appearance' </li><li> Fonts &amp; Colours section </li><li> click on 'Advanced' button </li></ul> <p>For those using English... </p> <ul><li> Select 'Fonts for: 'Latin' </li><li> Set Proportional Size: eg: 16 </li><li> Set Monospace Size: eg: 16 </li><li> Set Minimum font size&nbsp;: eg: 12 (or set as 16 if you want all but larger font sizes to be the same) </li></ul> <p>Also set up.... </p> <ul><li> Select&nbsp;: Fonts For: 'Other Writing Systems' </li><li> Set up exactly the same as previous for 'Latin' </li><li> Set Proportional Size: eg: 16 </li><li> Set Monospace Size: eg: 16 </li><li> Set Minimum font size&nbsp;: eg: 12 (or set as 16 if you want all but larger font sizes to be the same) </li></ul> <p>If you use any other languages eg: Freek </p> <ul><li> Select: 'Font for&nbsp;: Greek' </li><li> Use same process and set up font size as above. </li></ul> <ul><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

At this time, everything setup okay, no userchrome, DPI -1 (I tried several positive settings but the size of the popups remained significantly smaller as the other grew huge), and the font in all popup dialogs are small and don't respect the Settings. Notice the size difference in the UI labels, textboxes and toolbar buttons for the popups in the new image I attached to this post. Only the main UI and Write (created a new email) track the settings. </p><p>Thanks again for your detailed response. As a developer, to me this is 1) a design decisions that popup should have smaller UI, or 2) something got overlooked or overeridden. I know they're different window types, but hopefully the UI can remain consistent in terms of size for accessibility and useability.  </p><p>If I can help test further, please let me know. </p>",nonoya.bidniss,false,0,0

Then start TB, click account settings and change the local folder pointer at bottom of pane to point to the new location. Do the same for the Local Folders folder. Exit and restart TB and verify that all is working satisfactorily from the other drive and then you can delete the account folders from the Mail folder. On your question, yes, you can move the entire profile. You would then need to start profile manager to connect to the relocated profile.

You might want to talk to hostmonster as suggested in the link you posted. </p> <blockquote> If this is a shared server, please call your hosting company or ISP! Why was this IP listed?  122.3.175.206 has been classified as part of a proxy network. There is a type of malware using this IP that installs a proxy that can be used for nearly anything, including sending spam or stealing customer data. This should be of more concern than a Spamhaus listing, which is a symptom and not the problem.  The proxy is installed on a device - usually an Android mobile, firestick, smart doorbell, etc, but also iPads, and Windows computers - that is using your IP to send spam DIRECTLY to the internet via port 25: This is very often the result of third party ""free"" apps like VPNs, channel unlockers, streaming, etc being installed on someone's personal device, usually a phone. Technical information  Important: If this IP operates as a mail server, it should look and behave like a mail server. As it stands, the HELO used appears to be dynamic and this may cause confusion as that is behaviour commonly observed in malware/proxy networks.  Recent connections:  (IP, UTC timestamp, HELO value)  122.3.175.206 2023-09-01 01:05:00 <a href=""http://122.3.175.206.pldt.net"" rel=""nofollow"">122.3.175.206.pldt.net</a>  Important points:      The HELOs are often dynamic-looking rDNS and usually claim to be from geographically very different networks OR spoofs of major brands.     They can include impossible HELOs like ""<a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>"", ""<a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>"", ""<a href=""http://comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">comcast.net</a>"" - Gmail, Outlook and Comcast do not use these. These are all fake.     If the HELO does not make sense for the IP generating it, it should be looked at closely.     There is often more than one compromised device.     Guest networks should also be secured.  This is a simple explanation of how it can work: <a href=""https://www.spamhaus.com/resource-center/when-doorbells-go-rogue/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spamhaus.com/resource-center/when-doorbells-go-rogue/</a>  Any devices with ""free"" VPNs, TV streaming, channel unlocking, or 3rd-party apps installed are the first things to check. What should be done about it?  We very strongly recommend securing your firewall to not allow any packets outbound on port 25, except those coming from any email server(s) on your local network. Remote sending of email to servers on the Internet should still work if web-based, or configured properly to use port 587 using SMTP-AUTH. Guest networks should be secured too.  After port 25 is outbound is secured, the proxy needs to be found and removed. We can only see what's coming from the NAT (public) IP; anything inside your network is visible only to you. You can start logging at the router or firewall to see what's trying to use port 25 and that should lead you right to the compromised device(s).  </blockquote>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
