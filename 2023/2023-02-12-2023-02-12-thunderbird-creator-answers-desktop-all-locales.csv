Unfortunately, the proxy failed without warning. I can still access my inbox and sent files but, of course, I am no longer receiving or sending messages. I have temporarily established an Outlook account, to make sure that anything I do to Thunderbird doesn't mess everything up, but I would much prefer to continue with Thunderbird. To my non-tech mind, my Thunderbird files are floating around without an account with a local provider. Can you please suggest a way that I can link in the existing Thunderbird to an account that I can establish locally? </p><p>Thank you in advance, Best regards, </p><p>Brian Ellis </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",b_ellis02
