Neither CTL-click or SHIFT-click works. I tried rolling back to 115.4.1 and 115.3.3 but had the same problem. I finally reverted to pre-Supernova 102.15.1 and that fixed the problem. Any idea what the issue is with this operation in the newer builds? </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1616912;,chris317

Vers. 115 requires me to spend time and effort to re-learn software I had already pretty much mastered. I see no improvements I wanted and can use none of those I was provided efficiently.  I wish to backdate my version of Thunderbird and lock that version in place. How can I do those two things? </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",Larrydeb
