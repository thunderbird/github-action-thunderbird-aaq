Neither CTL-click or SHIFT-click works. I tried rolling back to 115.4.1 and 115.3.3 but had the same problem. I finally reverted to pre-Supernova 102.15.1 and that fixed the problem. Any idea what the issue is with this operation in the newer builds? </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1616912;,chris317

Vers. 115 requires me to spend time and effort to re-learn software I had already pretty much mastered. I see no improvements I wanted and can use none of those I was provided efficiently.  I wish to backdate my version of Thunderbird and lock that version in place. How can I do those two things? </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",Larrydeb

BUT the message list is constantly changing so users always need to at it more closely and frequently as messages are constantly arriving.  </p><pre>  So more space more is more important for the message list than it is for the folder tree view.  And if you have many folders, as I do, you may want a more compact view of the folder tree to reduce need for constant scrolling....even though you may want--or need--an easy  to skim and see view of the message list, as I do.  </pre> <p>After the redesign in the current version 115.4.25, it has now become either all too small, or all too spacious, but no longer possible to have a compact tree view for the folders and a more spacious or default view fpr the message list and contents.   </p><pre>Can you please separate the density setting for the folder tree from the setting for the message list, or otherwise permit a setting that looks like ""compact"" for the folder tree list displayed at left, but also permits a more spacious, or ""default"" spacing for the message list when displayed horizontally above the message content? </pre>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1616930;,kmartinp
