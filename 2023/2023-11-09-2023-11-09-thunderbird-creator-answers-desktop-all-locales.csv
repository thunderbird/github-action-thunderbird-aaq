Recently I installed her new PC and restored her account profile using the profile folder on her old PC. So far so good. The problem is that her mails are not organized in folders on the mail server but she has a whole collection of folders in her Thunderbird mail client and is concerned about loosing her mails if the new PC (or the disk) would crash at some point. Of course she could just re-install Thunderbird after fixing the crash problem and sync with the mail server, but then the folder structure would be lost. First I considered using a back-up program to keep a back-up of her Thunderbird profile using cloud storage. My second thought (should have been my first thought...) is that she already has a back-up, namely the mail server. The ISP does a better job than any local back-up program to keep her mails safe. Only the missing folder structure remains a concern. So here is the question: if I change the setting to sync all folders with the mail server, what will happen: 1 - the folders in Thunderbird will disappear (only the folders, not the mails) because there are no folders on the mail server 2 - the folder structure from Thunderbird will be mirrorred on the ISP's mail server.
