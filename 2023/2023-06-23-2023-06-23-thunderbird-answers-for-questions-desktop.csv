It is not even really related t the topic or the application in question. </p><p>First I suggest you review the account settings. </p><p>Check in Copies and folders that Thunderbird is not making a copy of sent mail on the gmail account.  GMail forces it's own copy v so unless you use BCC,  just disable it in Thunderbird.  As google remove the BCC addresses from all mail stored (I would say idiots but who am I to argue with a multinational corporation),  set the Thunderbird sent folder to a local folder if you need to have a record of who was BCC'ed on an email. </p><p>Check the folder specified as ""drafts"" in copies and folder is the correct folder.  Just sometime it get mangled on setup. </p><p>Now lets look at external issues.  You appear to be having issues when you institute what is essentially encrypted network activity.  Enter the antivirus.  Do you have one? I have seen some pretty nasty crashes and connection failures caused by anti virus products and simply settings in them like ""monitor encrypted connections"" can see mail grind to a halt. I am not a fan of mail scanning as I am yet to be convinced it is really necessary.  But even for folk who routinely disable email scanning this scanning of encrypted connections which is generally considered to be web stuff can bite IMAP mail accounts. </p><p>Try if you can restarting your computer in safe mode with networking as see if you have the same issues. That does disable browser scanning and other AV functions,  so I would not recommend it long term nor would I suggest extensive browsing while you test if Thunderbird is still affected. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Deleted Parent folder #1 from Thunderbird. </p><p>In <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> created new Parent folder Checked Thunderbird, new folder appeared via sync. In <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> created new Child folder Checked Thunderbird, new Child folder appeared via sync. In <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> created copied a folder with messages into Parent folder Checked Thunderbird, new Child folder and messages appeared via sync. </p><p>At this point I believed all was now set to proceed with main upload to <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> </p><p>Copying a handful of folders at a time (exact number varied due to the number of messages in each folder) old message folders were moved to the new, “proven good”, Parent folder. Checking in <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, the uploaded Child folders and their messages were shown. </p><p>Thunderbird at first appeared slow to recognise the new Child folders, although it did appear to be checking.  This did not concern me, as there was a lot of new data for Thunderbird to now sync. After leaving Thunderbird running over the weekend, when no new Child folders appeared, this is when I started to question if Thunderbird was seeing or sync’ing <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> as desired … that investigation has finally brought me here asking for other input. </p><p>I think the about process is very similar to what you are suggesting?  I am happy to run small tests and trials if you think they might help? </p><p><em>Comment</em> I am becoming concerned that Thunderbird often isn’t sync’ing with <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> – in your trials too you saw folder changes not being reflected in Hotmail (<a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>).  In my research into this issue I am seeing similar threads on forums for Thunderbird, with both <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> and Gmail, going back to 2010.  <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> and Gmail use different email structures and stores (labels are similar to, but distinctly different from, folders), the common thing for both these is the IMAP protocol.  I am now beginning to question if Thunderbird truly is fully compatible with <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, or worse is Thunderbird’s IMAP implementation not compatible with Microsoft and Google? </p>",firefox2355,false,0,0

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue: </p><p>Verify Thunderbird version: Ensure that you are using the latest version of Thunderbird. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that may address issues with message sorting. </p><p>Reset view settings: In Thunderbird, go to the folder where you're experiencing the issue. Right-click on the column headers (such as ""Date,"" ""From,"" etc.) and select ""Customize."" In the ""Customize View"" dialog, click on the ""Reset Columns"" button to reset the view settings to default. This can help eliminate any conflicting or corrupted settings. </p><p>Check folder-specific settings: Sometimes, the message sort settings are remembered on a per-folder basis. Make sure you're applying the desired sorting settings to all folders where you want them to be applied. Right-click on a folder, select ""Properties,"" go to the ""General Information"" tab, and verify the sort settings. </p><p>Regards, Jimmy </p>",techguy150,false,0,0

I always keep all my inbox folders configured for sort by order received, ascending, threaded. And they sporadically forget their sorting primary key (instead of order received, all of a sudden, <strong>nothing at all</strong> is checked), although it still shows ascending and threaded as being checked. </p><p>I would try your suggestion of resetting the columns to defaults and restoring any of my changes (if there are any), but I have to say that seems like it has an extremely low probability of having any effect -- especially since the sort order isn't really related to what columns are being <em>displayed</em>. </p><p>And now that I try to follow your instructions, I don't see any ""Customize View"" dialog.  When I right-click on a column (e.g., Subject), I'm shown the ""Select columns to display"" dialog. There is no ""Reset Columns"" choice, though perhaps you mean ""Restore column order""? But again, I don't quite understand how the column display selection and order would have any effect on the message sorting order. </p>",firefox2357,false,0,0

Those left or right pointing arrows only appear if using the 'Correspondents' column header. I do not use 'Correspondents'; I use 'From' instead as that tells me same information but without the arrows. Suggest you select to use 'From' and uncheck the 'Correspondents' option. </p><p>The one on the far left has space for reply/forward icons. In version 102.12.0 All my accounts folders (except one) do not have the extra massive space . </p><p>In beta 115.0b4, I have one test imap gmail account and it also displays the super massive space, but I'll have to report it as a bug because it should not appear in unthreaded view. </p><p>Important info: IF you have the setting to use 'threaded' view then the super massive space is required for the 'threaded arrows'.   IF you currently do not have any actual threaded emails then you will still see the massive space. Fix: View &gt; Sort by &gt; select 'Unthreaded' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,2,0
