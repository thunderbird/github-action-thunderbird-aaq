If so, you can easily copy the mail folders from the old profile to the new profile, BUT as separate folders. Once copied, you could optionally move from one folder to the other. Here are the basics: - POP mail folders are typicallly in the Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; folder (e.g., inbox, inbox.msf) and can be copied to new profile in Mail]Local Folders folder when TB is not running.
