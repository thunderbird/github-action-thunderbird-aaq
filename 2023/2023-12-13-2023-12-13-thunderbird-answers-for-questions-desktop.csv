But just fyi, McAfee only supports individual file Excluding now; you cannot Exclude folders, even with a backslash. </p><p>A complexity with McAfee is that on their website, they still have ""help articles"" way back to 2011 accessible, that DO tell you have to exclude Email Attachments and other settings. They don't seem to bother keeping their support info up to date... </p><p>BTW, I have used both TB and McAfee Total Protection, both, for at least 4 or 5 years together, and I have never had this issue before, and at least for now, I am not having it now.
