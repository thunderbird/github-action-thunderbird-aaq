If so, you can easily copy the mail folders from the old profile to the new profile, BUT as separate folders. Once copied, you could optionally move from one folder to the other. Here are the basics: - POP mail folders are typicallly in the Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; folder (e.g., inbox, inbox.msf) and can be copied to new profile in Mail]Local Folders folder when TB is not running.

They are generally with two names, such as inbox and inbox.msf - copy them and paste into the Mail\Local Folders folder of new profile.  - restart TB and the messages should be viewable.  </p><p>You should now be complete, with messages in multiple folders. If you wish to merge the messages, you can do that within TB by highlighting and copying from the new folders in Local Folders back to the primary folders. Be sure to do that when NOT downloading new messages. To be safe, I suggest clicking File&gt;offline&gt;work offline prior to doing that.
