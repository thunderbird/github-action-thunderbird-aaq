I've read the threads on this site but they don't quite address my problem. I'm not using gmail but rather a proprietary email address, so I'm not sure about the instruction to uncheck ""save to Sent folder"". Also, as stated above, the problem is intermittent. Just at the moment my messages are being saved as expected but often (all day yesterday) they aren't and I get a message to say it couldn't save to sent folder and to try again, save or cancel. Is this a problem at my end or is it a server issue?  Thanks for any help you can offer. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1560250;1560428;,com12
