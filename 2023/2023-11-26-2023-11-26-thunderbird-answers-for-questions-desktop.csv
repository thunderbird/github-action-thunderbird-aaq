Thunderbird does not run javascript on email bodies,  like having ammunition in your home,  it is not dangerous unless it is loaded in something that can make it go bang.  Like Microsoft Outlook, which will execute the javascript.  In Thunderbird all it does is consume a few bytes of space.  Completely inert.  </p><p>The file you have identified is a plain text file,  It is an MBOX file (RD variant) with a small Mozilla twist in the formatting of the From line.  MBOX is the default mail storage file format for Thunderbird. There is nothing to extract from it other than text so of course 7-zip is not going to extract anything, nor is Esets deep scan.   </p><p>You can open the file and read it in windows notepad if you want to see what is in it.  What you will see is the raw text that makes up the emails source in the folder one email following he other. essentially a stack of EML files. <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000385.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000385.shtml</a> </p><p>I have no idea what rubbish the Eset folk are selling you in their support, I did used the product until a couple of years ago and around 10 years ago it was very good.  A couple of years ago I figured the money I was giving them for a load of alarmist warnings about javascript marketing and tracking code on web pages was a poor exchange. So now I use defender.   </p><p>Generally antivirus scanners actually decode the mime portions of emails so they can examine the HTML body and attachments.  Apparently Eset do not do this.  Personally I wonder why they do this scanning at all in text files.  For years I have been recommending to people that they exclude the Thunderbird profile from all scanning activity other than periodic scans, because A/V usually causes more issues with email than it solves ad this is a perfect example. </p><p>Eset have consumed your time,  and now mine discussing what is in essence a false positive as it can not actually take any action on your computer unless you save the email as HTML and open it in a web browser.  I am sure some people do that,  but the A/V product will get two more bites of the apple,  once when the HTML file is written/saved,  and again when it is loaded in the web browser.  They fed you full of rubbish about deep scans for a text file.  What they think they can extract from a text file I have no idea at all. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Perhaps the worst thing you can do is remove the account and add it again in the hope some magic will happen and what did not work will start to. </p><p>Generally issues post update fall entirely at the door of your chosen antivirus product and it's attendant firewall component. Preventing them from messing with the connection though uninstalling them or running the operating system in safe mode with networking is the normal diagnostic for that.

Ok, now on to business.  So for this, what if I start the logging process as you mention how to do in a pervious article/message.  Then try and reinstall the mail account that I'm having trouble with.  Shouldn't that give you some clue as to why I can't not connect to gmail with Thunderbird?  I will await for your reply before I start. Thanks Dan Regalia P.S.  I did read your piece on this config. editor, I found it, and the first one ""mail.wizard.logging.dump to all"" was there and it was set to true.  The second one ""mail.wizard.logging.console to all"" wasn't there, so I added it, and it is set to true.  So now that I have done this, should I go ahead and add my new account (from Gmail).  If it errors out again, where are these logs at and how can I get them to you? Thanks Again. </p>",timlab55,false,0,0
