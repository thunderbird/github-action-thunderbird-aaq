This is very common with old servers that have remained on old versions of software and outdated security for years, often decades old security is what private mail servers are using unfortunately. </p><p>However I am really confused, because when I look up the mail server settings for your provider on their web site <a href=""https://telnetcommunications.com/support/how-to/basic-email-setup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://telnetcommunications.com/support/how-to/basic-email-setup</a>  None of the server names they say to use match those in the error message. </p><p>I suggest you check both your incoming account and the outgoing account on outgoing servers (SMTP) and make sure you are actually using the setting your provider requires. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

That is, if the password appears as a long code, that is the actual password. Gmail is a good example of that.  - the password is displayed as-is without masked characters because your Thunderbird has the option of a primary password. If you do not want the passwords visible, use a primary password. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
