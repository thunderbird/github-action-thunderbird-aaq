This is very common with old servers that have remained on old versions of software and outdated security for years, often decades old security is what private mail servers are using unfortunately. </p><p>However I am really confused, because when I look up the mail server settings for your provider on their web site <a href=""https://telnetcommunications.com/support/how-to/basic-email-setup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://telnetcommunications.com/support/how-to/basic-email-setup</a>  None of the server names they say to use match those in the error message. </p><p>I suggest you check both your incoming account and the outgoing account on outgoing servers (SMTP) and make sure you are actually using the setting your provider requires. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

While the message readibng pane is accessible from the developer console,  it responds to the CSS in the message,  which may well over ride what you are trying to set. </p><p>The background colour is one of those thing that many email clients from big players like Microsoft and Apple specify in the message,  along with the users choice of font (which is often very very wrong outside their personal system) and font colour </p><p>You might do better if you change the setting to allow emails to specify other fonts but those you choose, and force the readers default colours in the HTML style section of the settings. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

That is, if the password appears as a long code, that is the actual password. Gmail is a good example of that.  - the password is displayed as-is without masked characters because your Thunderbird has the option of a primary password. If you do not want the passwords visible, use a primary password. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So there is no other way than some custom scripting...?
