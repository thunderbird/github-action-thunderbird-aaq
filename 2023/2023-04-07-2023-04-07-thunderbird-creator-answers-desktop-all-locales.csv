For the past few years I've been accessing it via webmail. The webmail has been getting harder to work with in recent months, and I finally decided to go for the client route. I went for Thunderbird as I used to use it a few years ago, I'm a fan. </p><p>I wanted this account configured for IMAP, as the emails aren't mine. The next person in my position needs to access them, so the syncing to webmail was the obvious best option. </p><p>Version 102.9.1. Windows 10 64 bit. </p><p>It has been more than a week, and Thunderbird still seems to be syncing with the server. There is always a message like: abc@xyz.com: Downloading message 79 of 60 in <em>Folder Name</em> at the bottom. It jumps around a bit between folders, it is often nonsensical (79 of 60 for example), and it has been in this state for more than a week. New emails arrive in the inbox just fine. It just seems odd, should I just try to wait it out? Or is it in some sort of infinte loop. The email account is not huge, I don't know how big, but call it 30 folders, maybe on average 60-70 emails per folder... nothing compared to some users. </p><p>What's really scaring me, is that the emails are now all screwed up in my webmail. A couple folders seem blank, and some folders have half the messages that only say ""No Subject"" I can tell there is an attachment, I can see the size of the email (600kB for example). But I can't see a sender, I can't see the real subject, and if I click on the message body I get nothing (image attached). It seems like the emails that are in ""no subject"" state change, I'm assuming this changes as Thunderbird continues to work on it. So unfortunately I can't even fall back on webmail right now. I'm kind of stuck.  </p><p>So far I'm just hoping that Thunderbird eventually finishes syncing, and at that time all of the emails in my webmail will be rebuilt. Is that a viable strategy? Or should I be taking steps to do something else. </p><p>The webmail/mailhost is <a href=""http://easyhosting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">easyhosting.com</a> if that's interesting to anyone. </p><p>Thank you for your time. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1574734;1574761;1575133;1575658;1575844;1575984;1576536;,kraher99
