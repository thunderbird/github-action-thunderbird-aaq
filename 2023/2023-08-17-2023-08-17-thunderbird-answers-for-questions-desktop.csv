They load up their site just fine. It's only Thunderbird that is then unable to display the page and so this right here is valid. I am sort of complaining about the way in which Thunderbird loads the external site, because that (!) is what prevents me from logging in. And this isn't a complaint, I'd like to actually solve this! If I configured anything wrong or if this is my fault, then please point that out because I only want to get this to work. So far, Thunderbird has not worked right on this new laptop, ever. </p><p>I tried CTRL and plus long ago, again also with the on screen keyboard (and I make sure that the login window is the only window in focus, always after fresh restarts with fastboot OFF, Thunderbird being the only thing open) as well as mouse wheel scroll, num keys, I even specifically got logi options to assign a new zoom feature to my mouse and even that had no effect on the scaling in the window. I have never been able to influence that in any way. </p><p>With that, i can only again claim <strong>that there is no user-end way to change how the page is displayed</strong>. </p><p>And so these findings conclude that the issue comes down to the fact that Thunderbird needs to display the page right.

Those two folders have some different files, true. If you try using the portable version on your new computer, it will create a ""profile"" folder in a Data folder inside the Thunderbird Portable folder, and if you copy the files from inside the profile folder on your old machine into the profile folder on your new one (replacing the original files), that profile should carry all of your settings and email messages to the new machine. If you find that the ""profile"" folder on the old machine is inside a ""Data"" folder, my guess is right.

Can you set a snail mail filter to have mail delivered that you do not want to be bounced by the post office, or even by your letter box when someone tries to poke the mail through the slot? </p><p>unlike snail mail your mail is accepted by your mail provider on your behalf.  When the sending server tries to deliver mail to your provider on your behalf your provider checks that the email address exists on their service.  If it does exist it accepts the mail for delivery.  If it does not exist it refuses accept the message for delivery (bounces) the message.  The problem with these assorted products that send belated bounce messages about mail accounts post the delivery of the message to the server is that 6they are clearly a lie if anyone bothers to check the rejection times against the initial delivery. </p><p>Then there is the issue of who cares if the message bounces.  Apparently you do,  or would like to.  However no spammer is going to be interested. They expect significant delivery issues in their mailings and as it costs them essentially nothing to send emails,  they are not in the business of culling dead email address from their lists.  Least of all addresses that are supposedly dead minutes of hours after the mail server accepted mail to that address for delivery. </p><p>Then we have the third group.  Those that offer access to web sites in exchange for you accepting delivery of marketing emails.  Sure they will check that the mail they are sending is not bouncing.  if it is, they will block your access the the relevant web sites that accepting mails is a condition of access.  Rather inconvenient you you,  nothing to those cancelling your membership based on a terms of service violation. </p> <blockquote> I think that having a set filter that merely deletes the unwanted sender's message is not adequate albeit somewhat useful. </blockquote> <p>In my use case it is perfect.  I decide what I want to see and see only that. The sender is not in the loop. </p> <blockquote> Also, I would like to have the ability to set up things so that only people who are in my address books can send me messages.  </blockquote> <p>That is quite simple using a filter.  You just filter the to to be in a particular address book.   <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-17-22-55-12-38a9ac.png""> Just be careful how you set it up however as when your bank sends your bank statement you will not get it unless the address is already in your address book.  The same sort of caveat goes for most true commercial operations.  Things I get by email like my payslip come from an address I do not have in my address book,  it is my employers accounting provider.  I did not even know they were associated with the provider until after I got my payslip. </p> <blockquote>  Can anyone oblige and do an add-on or build these features into a Thunderbird update? </blockquote> <p>Personally I see Thunderbird already delivering the filtering capability you require.  The bounce message services offered by mail servers are really outside the scope of a mail client that gets mail long after it is actually delivered to the mail server. </p><p>However if you feel that you have a legitimate suggestion there is a feedback forum <a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">here </a>for you to make such suggestions. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
