With IMAP you should be really careful what you're doing while online, particularly deleting stuff. Everything you do in Thunderbird is mirrored on the server instantly , so it's very easy to erase messages or entire folders you didn't want to delete in the first place. </p><p>What instructions did you follow?

If you go to Help in the Menu bar of Thunderbird on the old machine and choose More Troubleshooting Information and scroll down to Profile and click Open Folder and the window location bar (the white long horizontal space) shows that you're in the ""Profile"" folder, you have a portable version. If, instead of ""profile,"" you see an alphanumeric string followed by something like .default-release in that location bar, you're using an installed regular version, and we can help you find the right profile folder whose contents you need to transfer to the new machine. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

Those two folders have some different files, true. If you try using the portable version on your new computer, it will create a ""profile"" folder in a Data folder inside the Thunderbird Portable folder, and if you copy the files from inside the profile folder on your old machine into the profile folder on your new one (replacing the original files), that profile should carry all of your settings and email messages to the new machine. If you find that the ""profile"" folder on the old machine is inside a ""Data"" folder, my guess is right. If not, you're probably copying the files in the wrong profile you're finding inside the ""profiles"" folder. </p><p>Remember, you copy the <em>contents</em> of a profile folder, not the folder itself. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0
