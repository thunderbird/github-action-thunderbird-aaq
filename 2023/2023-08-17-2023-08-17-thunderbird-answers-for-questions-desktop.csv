I'm still having Thunderbird timezone problems no matter whether I set Thunderbird to use the system timezone or I set it manually in Thunderbird. </p><p>I'm harping on this because I saw earlier a message somewhere that somebody solved a problem with being unable to dismiss reminders by adjusting their timezone. </p><p>So, in the hope that it will help somebody help me, here are the details: </p><p>Win 11, Set time automatically = on, Adjust for daylight saving time automatically = on, Time zone = (UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada). </p><p>Thunderbird Settings/Calendar: Use system timezone is selected (although, the greyed-out timezone pick box where I would select one if I'd chosen ""set timezone manually"" has America/Toronto greyed out - if I were indeed picking manually, that's the one I'd pick being in Canada and in the same timezone as Toronto). </p><p>I restart Thunderbird, start up Error Console, and I get my 70-ish reminders come up.

Those two folders have some different files, true. If you try using the portable version on your new computer, it will create a ""profile"" folder in a Data folder inside the Thunderbird Portable folder, and if you copy the files from inside the profile folder on your old machine into the profile folder on your new one (replacing the original files), that profile should carry all of your settings and email messages to the new machine. If you find that the ""profile"" folder on the old machine is inside a ""Data"" folder, my guess is right. If not, you're probably copying the files in the wrong profile you're finding inside the ""profiles"" folder. </p><p>Remember, you copy the <em>contents</em> of a profile folder, not the folder itself. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0
