Those two folders have some different files, true. If you try using the portable version on your new computer, it will create a ""profile"" folder in a Data folder inside the Thunderbird Portable folder, and if you copy the files from inside the profile folder on your old machine into the profile folder on your new one (replacing the original files), that profile should carry all of your settings and email messages to the new machine. If you find that the ""profile"" folder on the old machine is inside a ""Data"" folder, my guess is right. If not, you're probably copying the files in the wrong profile you're finding inside the ""profiles"" folder. </p><p>Remember, you copy the <em>contents</em> of a profile folder, not the folder itself. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

It changes layout often. We lose emails and ""views"", and there is no understandable user help without complex terms and technical instructions. All we want is to receive, reply, use email without errors. Thx. </p>",amh.ajg,false,0,0
