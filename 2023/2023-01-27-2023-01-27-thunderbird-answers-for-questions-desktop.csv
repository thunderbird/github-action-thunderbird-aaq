The reason is that Thunderbird does do some profile ""migration"" actions between major versions, e.g. when address book storage format has changed, just to give an example.

This has not changed, except that their penetration of apple products has gone way up in recent years.  Expect between a 10 and 40% performance hit from an anti virus product.  In Thunderbirds case it will be in the high range as they tend to lock the profile files when Thunderbird tries to open them so they can scan them,  make internet access slow due to their further scanning and as time make internet access fail entirely with their dodgy self signed encryption certificates and often cause issues with passwords if they have some sort of vault thing. </p><p>Then there is this new trend to using VPN's to mask your physical location.  These mess with mail in a big way.  Many simply do not support it at all,  others have some sort of exception process that sort of works but is slow.  If you have one, it would be a prime place to start troubleshooting why things are slow for you.

That was about a couple of years ago at least. I think my latest version was 78. I then moved to mail for Mac, but I have never been entirely happy with it. It has some functions that just don't work well (for me), so now and again I try again TB. My issue this time was that TB wouldn't start anymore. All I could see is the spinning wheel of death. I tried in safe mode, I tried a new profile, an old profile... nothing. I think that in all my attempts I managed to get it to start only once. The suggestion to remove it completely came from one of the mods in the Italian forum (all my data is safely stored).  Anyway, in the last few days there has been a development: I have downloaded postbox (never heard of it before and found it mentioned in one of the FAQs) and that goes superfast and has no issues at all. It is interesting because based on an older version of TB, so I wonder why that does work, while TB does not. If it works consistently I don't mind paying the little money they ask for something that has a TB feel (which I like) and that it works. </p>",andrea33,false,0,0

Your link is for Windows 7, and I'm running Windows 10, so the info wasn't exactly applicable, but I did try some things using the ""View"" menu and ""hidden"" tabs, and now I do see the AppData subdirectory.  So thanks much, because I thought that was a dead end.   </p><p>David, your comments are very helpful, and I understand much more.  Silly me for not looking under ""Tools"" for exporting and importing data.  I may have screwed myself for not using this utility, but I do have (I think) the critical Thunderbird user files saved from two previous versions.   </p><p>Is there a way to access this previous data without losing current data?  Might there be a way to create different users that make use of my saved data?  This way, I could open Thunderbird via these different users and access the data.  Would this mean installing more than one Thunderbird programs, or can I use one installment with different users.  Would defining different ""users"" in Windows 10 be the way to do this? </p><p>Is all the necessary data (inbox, address, outbox, etc.) stored in the one file in the ""Roaming"" directory?  For instance, I have two files in the ""Profiles"" subdirectory: bit0jsmf.default-release and cg2yiab2.default. It seems the first file is the one Thunderbird is currently using, because I tried changing the file name while Thunderbird was running and I got a message saying I can't do that because the file is in use.   </p><p>I tried the following. I closed Thunderbird and successively changed the name of the .default-release file.  I then pasted into the ""Profiles"" subdirectory another .default-release file that I copied from a previous Thunderbird (before a computer crash).  I re-started Thunderbird and got a message that the required data file ""cannot be found.""  So I guess my question is, how do I tell Thunderbird what Profile file to use? Or, is the best way to do this by defining additional users? </p><p>I realize this is getting to the nitty gritty and it's all a result of my carelessness, but I'd appreciate any help.
