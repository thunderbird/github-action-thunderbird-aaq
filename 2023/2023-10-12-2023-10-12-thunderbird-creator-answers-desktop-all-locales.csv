I have PGP enabled, and I have a valid private/public key pair, but the emails Thunderbird is ""partially decrypting"" weren't encrypted to begin with. </p><p>The correlation between email subjects and bodies in my inbox appears to be corrupted for many of my emails, and those email bodies are shown as raw SMTP headers followed by HTTP, even though I have ""View ...

Menú&gt;impostazioni&gt;generale&gt;lingua e aspetto&gt;caratteri e colori&gt;colori Nei quadratini che appaiono il testo é GIÁ selezionato sul nero e lo sfondo sul bianco (?????) Ho spuntato la casella  ""utilizza colori personalizzati"" , ""sostituisci i colori specificati nella pagina con quelli selezionati"" con selezionato ""sempre"". Cambiando i quadratini su qualsiasi colore seguito da seleziona&gt;OK non succede assolutamente nulla, ovvero accetta il comando ma i colori dello sfondo e del testo rimangono invariati con sfondo nero e testo bianco, provato e riprovato in tutti i modi ma niente da fare, i colori sono bloccati cosí su tutto Thunderbird indipendentemente dal colore dei quadratini (ho provato varie combinazioni). La dimensione dei caratteri invece si puó cambiare senza problemi (e anche tutte le altre impostazioni sembrano funzionare correttamente).  Il computer momentaneamente non é collegato alla rete internet (mancanza di cavo ethernet attualmente in utilizzo su altra macchina) ma non credo che per rendere effettivi i cambiamenti sia necessario un collegamento alla rete...(lo accenno ""just in case""). Anche in menú&gt;impostazioni&gt;composizione i quadratini sono GIÀ testo nero e sfondo bianco ma il messaggio é a sfondo nero e testo bianco. Devo dire che a parte Thunderbird questa versione di Mint appare di default con sfondo nero e testi bianchi, sono riuscito a cambiare il tutto tranne che nella barra degli strumenti dove riesco a cambiare lo sfondo ma non il testo che rimane bianco non lasciando molte opzioni se non lo sfondo di detta barra nero o comunque scuro.
