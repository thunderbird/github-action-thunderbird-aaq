Somehow also the text is more difficult to read and I don't trust it in the same way I did the previous version.  Wish I'd not updated.  So, how do I put a 'tag' icon in the header bar, so I can easily tag my emails?

The ""Subject"" displayed in the reading pane is ""coming your way"" but the body of the letter is completely unrelated. </p><p>In another example, I received an email from The Washington Post notifying me about one of their articles, and when I click on the subject for that email, I see the raw email headers followed by text from a completely different email from a club to which I belong. </p><p>In addition, Thunderbird appears to be interpreting unencrypted email bodies as having been partially encrypted with OpenPGP.  I have PGP enabled, and I have a valid private/public key pair, but the emails Thunderbird is ""partially decrypting"" weren't encrypted to begin with. </p><p>The correlation between email subjects and bodies in my inbox appears to be corrupted for many of my emails, and those email bodies are shown as raw SMTP headers followed by HTTP, even though I have ""View ... Message Body As ... Original HTML"" selected. </p><p>This behavior has only been occurring after Thunderbird automatically updated to v115.3.2 64-bit.
