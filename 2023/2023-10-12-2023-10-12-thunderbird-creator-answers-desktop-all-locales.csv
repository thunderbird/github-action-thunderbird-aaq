Suddenly in this morning my company email disappeared from Thunderbird. I tried to re-setup the email, but I failed. It shows an error: Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password. (When I first setup this account, it automatically logged without setting any configuration manually.) I checked my company IT and no ammendments were made on the server settings recently. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",elisekang.sy

So I backtracked, installed 102.9.1.  But running that, my long list of Local Folders no longer appears.  Searching for help leads to solutions that do not pertain to the file structure on 102.9.1.  I.e., under Local Folders, there my local folders are, but messages are contained in folders named XXX.mozmsgs, with XXX files and XXX.msf.  But running the Thunderbird program does not list these local folders.  Help for older versions does not apply.  How can I get these Local Folders to appear when running the program? Thanks for help. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",nickfromiowa
