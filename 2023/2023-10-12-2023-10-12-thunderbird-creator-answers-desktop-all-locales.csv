I have tried reconnecting to them but have not been able. The accounts are ok and I can access them via outlook or web browser. But I want Thunderbird back. I use the OWL plugin. The loss of accounts seems to have coincided with the latest Thunderbird release on 10 October. I'm assuming this is some kind of bug and that I'm not the only victim. Has anyone else suffered this? If so, is there a fix? Thanks Wayne </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",wayne.m.best

1427211,2023-10-11 19:32:57 -0700,2023-10-11 22:09:30 -0700,Can't make message list less than 1.5 inches high,"<p>A few weeks ago, after upgrading to release 115 (upgraded to 115.3.2 today), I can't make the height of the  message list box at the top of the screen be less than 1.5"".  At the previous release (112.x?) I could use the  double pointer to shove the horizontal line up until the message list box contained only 4-5 lines (maybe about  1/2""-3/4"" in height?).  I can't go back to release 112.x to verify what the minimum height of the message list  box was that I could set, but I know it was a LOT less than the 1.5"" mininum height it is now.  </p><p>I would like to keep the message list heght as small as possible in order to maximize the amount of space for  the actual messages in the lower part of the screen.  I can certainly understand why there has to be a minimum  message list box height, but IMHO that minimum should be 1/4"" or a max of 1/2"", not 1.5"" as it is now.  </p><p>I would greatly appreciate it you would allow us to be able to reduce the message list height to 1/4""-1/2"", or  at least to the same value it was in release 112.x.  </p><p>Thank you very much. </p><p>Will Hern </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1610287;,wjh123

All other email clients that I have tried work and of course webmail works. I expect that there is one email on this IMAP account which causes Thunderbird to make an invalid request of the server.

I.e., under Local Folders, there my local folders are, but messages are contained in folders named XXX.mozmsgs, with XXX files and XXX.msf.  But running the Thunderbird program does not list these local folders.  Help for older versions does not apply.  How can I get these Local Folders to appear when running the program?
