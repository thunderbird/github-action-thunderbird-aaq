I cannot see attachments in some emails, apparently those with multiple recipients.  The attachment’s links are simply not visible. </p><p>2.	The ability to adjust message magnification/font size  with Conntrol “+” and “-“ has disappeared.  I have to copy message contents into Word now to enlarge enough to read. </p><p><br> 3.	Messages I do not want to see (at that time) are opened uncontrollably, sometimes in large numbers.  Apparently related to multiple recipients on a thread.
