Everything worked just fine until my last working day. I came back today, Manjaro did a general update including Thunderbird (to 115.2.0-3) and now I have an issue with it. The ""message list pane"" is not showing any messages in neither account. Synchonisation is fine. The number of read/unread messages in the folder pane changes automatically when I do something in the webmail (e.g., Gmail). In addition, I can search for any messages in the general search, including the ones just sent/received. (But if I search for messages, I get the message ""msgWindow.domWindow.gMessageDisplay is undefined"" in the status bar.) Filter is not working though. I have already checked if I have accidentally selected any filter feature that conceals all messages. It doesn't seem to be the case. I have also checked in the Manjaro forum and it doesn't look anyone has had issues with it, so it doesn't seem to be a global problem. </p><p>Could anyone help me in this? Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1604413;1604651;1605166;1605334;,talestomaz

Or at least get pointers on where/how to hook into notifications via an add-on? Is there a coding-subcommunity for Thunderbird add-on developers?
