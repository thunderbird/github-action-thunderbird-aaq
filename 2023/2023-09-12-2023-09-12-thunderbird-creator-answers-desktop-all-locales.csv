The ""message list pane"" is not showing any messages in neither account. Synchonisation is fine. The number of read/unread messages in the folder pane changes automatically when I do something in the webmail (e.g., Gmail). In addition, I can search for any messages in the general search, including the ones just sent/received. (But if I search for messages, I get the message ""msgWindow.domWindow.gMessageDisplay is undefined"" in the status bar.) Filter is not working though. I have already checked if I have accidentally selected any filter feature that conceals all messages. It doesn't seem to be the case. I have also checked in the Manjaro forum and it doesn't look anyone has had issues with it, so it doesn't seem to be a global problem. </p><p>Could anyone help me in this?

Make sure you properly follow these instructions so that users can follow them. Because many users are unable to master technological techniques. The manual method takes a lot of time.

Data loss does not equal recovery. </p><p><strong>Manual Method: Export Emails from Thunderbird to EML</strong> </p> <ul><li> On your PC, launch Thunderbird. </li><li> Choose the folder, such as your Inbox or Sent folder, from which you wish to export emails. </li><li> To pick an email for export, click on it. </li><li> Go to the ""File"" menu and choose ""Save As."" </li><li> Make sure to pick ""EML"" as the ""File type"" in the store As dialogue box when choosing a place on your computer to store the email to. </li><li> Press ""Save.""
