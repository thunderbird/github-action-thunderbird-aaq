Everything worked just fine until my last working day. I came back today, Manjaro did a general update including Thunderbird (to 115.2.0-3) and now I have an issue with it. The ""message list pane"" is not showing any messages in neither account. Synchonisation is fine. The number of read/unread messages in the folder pane changes automatically when I do something in the webmail (e.g., Gmail). In addition, I can search for any messages in the general search, including the ones just sent/received. (But if I search for messages, I get the message ""msgWindow.domWindow.gMessageDisplay is undefined"" in the status bar.) Filter is not working though. I have already checked if I have accidentally selected any filter feature that conceals all messages. It doesn't seem to be the case. I have also checked in the Manjaro forum and it doesn't look anyone has had issues with it, so it doesn't seem to be a global problem. </p><p>Could anyone help me in this? Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",talestomaz

Make sure you properly follow these instructions so that users can follow them. Because many users are unable to master technological techniques. The manual method takes a lot of time. In this procedure, users risk losing their data. But even if you carefully follow these instructions, you might still lose all of your data if you forget one step. Data loss does not equal recovery. </p><p><strong>Manual Method: Export Emails from Thunderbird to EML</strong> </p> <ul><li> On your PC, launch Thunderbird. </li><li> Choose the folder, such as your Inbox or Sent folder, from which you wish to export emails. </li><li> To pick an email for export, click on it. </li><li> Go to the ""File"" menu and choose ""Save As."" </li><li> Make sure to pick ""EML"" as the ""File type"" in the store As dialogue box when choosing a place on your computer to store the email to. </li><li> Press ""Save."" For each email you want to export, repeat those steps. </li><li> To convert all of your emails to PST, repeat this process. </li></ul> <p>This process is very long and time tekan. I used multiple applications and explored through Google looking for the issue, but just one tool was able to resolve it. I recommend using <strong>Thunderbird to PST Converter for Mac Software</strong>. This application converts one and bulk Thunderbird Mailbox files to PST file format. </p><p><a href=""https://devfolio.co/projects/mailvita-thunderbird-to-pst-converter-for-mac-8b6b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devfolio.co/projects/mailvita-thunderbird-to-pst-converter-for-mac-8b6b</a> <a href=""https://www.mailvita.com/blog/accurately-transfer-thunderbird-emails-and-attachments-in-outlook-pst/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mailvita.com/blog/accurately-transfer-thunderbird-emails-and-attachments-in-outlook-pst/</a> </p><p>Here are the steps for converting emails and attachments from Thunderbird to PST: -  </p> <ol><li> Download and install <strong>Mailvita Thunderbird to PST Converter Software</strong> on your PC. </li><li> Launch the software select the <strong>Load Default Location</strong> and <strong>Enter Manually</strong>. </li><li> <strong>Enter the Thunderbird Location</strong> and Click on the <strong>Search the list of MBOX files from the Thunderbird</strong> Button. </li><li> Show the <strong>preview</strong> of the MBOX file </li><li> Choose the <strong>Output Option</strong>:- Single and Multiple Thunderbird Files </li><li> Click the <strong>Browse</strong> Button and <strong>Select the destination path</strong> where you want to save the PST file. </li><li> Click on the ""<strong>Convert</strong>"" button to start the conversion process. </li></ol> <p><a href=""https://www.mailvita.com/thunderbird-to-pst-converter-for-mac/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mailvita.com/thunderbird-to-pst-converter-for-mac/</a> <a href=""https://www.trickyenough.com/thunderbird-mailbox-converter-export-thunderbird-attachments-to-pst/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.trickyenough.com/thunderbird-mailbox-converter-export-thunderbird-attachments-to-pst/</a> </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mateowillson_09
