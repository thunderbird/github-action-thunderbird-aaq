I click any recent 'good' email. Perhaps the subject is ""XYZ"". Clicking any of the 'bad' emails will show the good email's From, To, and subject of  ""XYZ"". It seems to last for, maybe 20 incoming emails, then the issue stops. It has happened several times over the last year. If I go out to Xfinity the same emails do not have this issue.  How do I fix this? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1602999;,JimJamie

I can send emails from 1 but not the other after updating TB from 102.15 to 115.2.  Everything else seems to work. I've changed no settings and they seem correct as far as I can tell. When I try to send mail from the problem account, a blank browser pop-up comes for a few seconds (authentication?) then disappears; then, the ""sending"" bubble comes up and then times out giving this error message: ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> timed out. Try again."" What is a solution for this? Thanks in advance. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1602998;,natehathaway
