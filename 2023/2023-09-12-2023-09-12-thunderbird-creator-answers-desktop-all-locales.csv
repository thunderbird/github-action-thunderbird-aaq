I choose the corresponding option in the account settings page. </p><p>With the latest version however: When I select the option to delete the mail immediately from the server in the account settings, <strong>The mail is only marked as read in web Gmail and not deleted.</strong> When I select the option ""Move to trash folder"" the mail is correctly sent to Trash on Thunderbird AND the server but I don't want to have to empty trash manually. </p><p>What can I do to reproduce the old behavior? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",leraleur

So I then in select all and move all the emails into [Inbox]- bam no problems...but now when I go into the gmail account in the chrome browser I don't see them. IMAP and POP are enabled on the account, they're also not in the [All mail] folder. They just aren't there. I've quit thunderbird and restarted, and did the same to the gmail account. Switched the SMTP port for thunderbird from 465 to 587. Nothing </p><p>TLDR - I can pull the emails up in thunderbird no problem. But i don't see them in the gmail inbox.
