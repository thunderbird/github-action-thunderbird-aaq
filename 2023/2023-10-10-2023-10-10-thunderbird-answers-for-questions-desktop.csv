Hence, Verisign explained it me along the lines:  any reference to an email address needs a current SPF, DKIM or DMARK record or domain. If it has such it can be verified by google/gmail. Verification requires proof of ownership of the underlying domain, ie, bit to the right of the @. Verifying requires a TXT record, which requires the appropriate DNS for that domain. If you using only an ISP email, then that ISP is responsible for verification, on the other hand if the client owns the domain, it isn't the ISP that is responsible it is the client. Maybe in this example Thunderbird is generating an intermediary into the authentication process prior to the ISP, hence could be leading to the authentication challenge, ie, a mismatch between, say the sending and recieving DNS. </p>",longinthetooth,false,0,0

TB will not allow me to create a new password.  I have deleted my old TB password as well as tried to create a new one on both my PC and android and TB does not recognize the old or new password on either device.  That is why I contacted yahoo as I am able to receive and send emails on my webmail account with them which is my default TB account @ *******@att.net Somehow I am locked out of TB through their password verification.  I have used TB for over 20 years and this has never happen before.  I would hate to lose my archived emails and also am unsure whether reinstalling TB would solve the issue as I believe it would recognize me when I entered my information which would be the same as the old account. </p>,Bob9754,false,0,0
