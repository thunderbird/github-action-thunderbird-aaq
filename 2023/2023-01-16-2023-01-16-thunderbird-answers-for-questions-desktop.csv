I would NOT follow my approach unless you have the ability to reinstall ver 38. Anyway, here's my thought:  - exit thunderbird - do a full backup of the proflie. very important - uninstall ver 38 and install latest version of release level - set up accounts, but do NOT include passwords (because I don't want you retrieving messages yet). - exit thunderbird - from backed up profile, copy the Mail and Imapmail folders into the new profile  - restart thunderbird  - import old addressbook  </p><p>This would require redoing any settings or addons, but it has its benefits too. I post my suggestion only because I see you've been waiting a day for a response. There is a risk, but it may work ok. Again, I wouldn't attempt this unless you can readily restore ver 38.

This is needed because Thunderbird does some ""profile migration"" actions between versions. You should go through the versions as follows: 38 -&gt; 45.8.0 -&gt; 52.9.1 -&gt; 60.9.1 -&gt; 68.12.1 -&gt; 78.14.0 -&gt; 91.13.1 </p><p>Once you're at v91, do Help &gt; About to get the latest 102 version (currently 102.7.0).  </p><p>Intermediate versions are archived at <a href=""https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/</a> </p><p>As Stans already pointed out, do a full backup of the Thunderbird profile prior to each step. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

La configurazione hardware richiede invece almeno un processore di classe Pentium 4 (o equivalente) e 2 GB di RAM. Si tratta però di una configurazione minima che va alzata in caso di uso gravoso. </p><p>Setto questo, nello specifico la causa del problema potrebbe essere la dimensione dei file di archivio.
