Ensure that the SMTP server hostname, port number, and connection security settings match the requirements of your email provider.

That includes Address Books, Calendars, mail accounts, emails, filters etc etc. A Profile can have many mail accounts. Very useful because you can see all emails for all folders in all accounts in the same view and all have access to the various address books. </p><p>Each mail account is for an email address which can be set up as either Pop or Imap. Each mail account gets displayed in the left Folder Pane along with it's own set of folders. </p><p>Below is an example images showing how the left Folder Pane displays various mail accounts - one per email address. Some are pop and some are imap and of course at the bottom is Local Folders. I'm using the Thunderbird dark theme and do not worry about the folder icons because I had altered them.  </p> <ul><li> The first image shows 4 mail accounts plus Local Folders. I have collapsed 3 of them, thus decluttering the area. </li><li> The second image shows those 'collapsed' accounts now expanded to see all their folders, the top main account is just showing part of it's folders - I would need to scroll up to see them. </li><li> The third image is slightly different, I've selected some folders to be 'Favourite' folders then abled the Favourite view so those folders get displayed at the top. </li><li> The fourth image is different again. This time I've switched on 'Unified' view. At the top you see all the default folders. These are virtual display folders. eg: Inbox now contains all the emails from all the various account Inboxes. Note how it has a &gt; chevron on the right of Inbox - click on it and then you see all the individual Inbox for each account.  Below all the Unified default folders then comes all the separate accounts and all the folders I created display within each account. </li></ul> <p>Hopefully this will explain how several mail accounts get displayed within the Folder Pane. You can expand or collapse them as required. You can set up different types of view. </p><p>To create a new mail account: </p> <ul><li> Menu icon &gt; New &gt; Existing Mail account. </li></ul> <p>OR if using the top Menu Bar toolbar&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> File &gt; New &gt; Existing Mail account. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It seems like some unexpected folders have been added to your account, and you're having trouble removing them. Additionally, you're facing slow loading times, disappearing emails, and emails reappearing in the trash folder. I understand how frustrating this must be for you. </p><p>To address these issues, I would recommend the following steps: </p><p>Make sure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Sometimes updating to the latest version can resolve certain issues. </p><p>Try repairing your Thunderbird profile. You can do this by going to ""Help"" &gt; ""Troubleshooting Information"" and then clicking on the ""Open Folder"" button next to ""Profile Folder."" Close Thunderbird and rename the file named ""parent.lock"" to ""parent.lock.old"". Then, reopen Thunderbird, and it will create a new ""parent.lock"" file. </p><p>You mentioned that you have uninstalled and reinstalled Thunderbird without any changes. However, you can try performing a clean reinstall. This involves uninstalling Thunderbird, deleting any remaining Thunderbird folders, and then reinstalling it. Make sure to backup your Thunderbird profile before doing this to avoid losing your email files. You can find your Thunderbird profile folder using the instructions in step 2. </p><p>If the above steps don't resolve the issues, you can seek further assistance from the Thunderbird Support Forum. Our volunteers there are knowledgeable and experienced with Thunderbird and can provide more specific guidance based on your situation. They will be able to help you with troubleshooting and finding a solution. </p><p>I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

They have not changed that on the e-mail server.  Just added more folders, (which was part of the initial issue). </blockquote> <p>My guess,  and in the dearth of useful information here I have to guess, is your provider has changed their server software to Microsoft Exchange.  That would explain the change to using sent Mail and Deleted Items.  Trying to fight that is like trying to stop the flow of the amazon river.  When in rome do as the romans do has been a long term saying and it is very relevant here.  refusing to accept the folder names the server imposes it futile and will lead to ongoing issues going forward.  you will not even be able to effectively emply the trash.  in the end you account will crash because it is full. Or you will be buying more space with the provider to store your undeleted mail.  It is not about just getting the folder you like to see visible. </p> <blockquote>The ""Junk"" folder shows up every time I subscribe on my account.  So I'd  say it still exists on the server, correct? </blockquote> <p>Yep I would say it exists.  You can even tell Thunderbird to use it in account settings.  But what happens to the mail the server considers junk and places in it's chosen spam folder is you will not see them.  I would guess missed mail in your future unless you use whatever the server designated junk/spam folder is.  Generally Thunderbird is notified of a folders status when it connects and allocated the correct special folder icon to designate it's special function. </p> <blockquote> I was able to correct this the last time, about a week ago, when the same thing happened.  It was a different folder that I was having an issue with trying to get it back.  I'm uncertain what I did to remedy it.   </blockquote> <p>You probably simply restarted Thunderbird as certain subscription changes are not reflected until you do.  Force deleting the foldertree.json file in the profile directory forces a rebuilding of the folder pane from source rather than use that cache on the next start.  Just don't try deleting it with Thunderbird running. </p> <blockquote> Anyway, I'll keep plugging away at this and hopefully someone with the right answers will be able to help me restore Thunderbird to the way it was before all these changes happened.    </blockquote> <p>You might try simply running Thunderbird on your system once you restart it in safe mode with networking.  It is truly incredible the number of issues caused by external sources like antivirus programs that when they do not load in safe mode just go away for the duration of the safe mode session. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
