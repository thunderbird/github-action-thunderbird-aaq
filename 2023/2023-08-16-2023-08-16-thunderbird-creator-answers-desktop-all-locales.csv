I then set the Authentification method to ""Password, transmitted insecurely"",  but then Thunderbird produced a window saying, ""login to account 'outgoing SMTP' failed"" and telling me  ""Login to server <a href=""http://mail.whiteboxtechnologies.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.whiteboxtechnologies.com</a> with username yjhuang@whiteboxtechnologies.com failed"" and to either Retry, Enter New Password, or Cancel.  All passwords I tried were rejected.   How can I either set the Authentification method to OAuth2,  or enter the correct password?  Are there cookies that I need to clear out&nbsp;? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",joehuang
