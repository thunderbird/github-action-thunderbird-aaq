After a minute or two, it apparently gets done with whatever background process it is doing, and everything is normal again. </p><p>For what it's worth, I notice that when this happens other mozilla apps like Open Office Writer and Open Office Calc are also locked up. So whatever is going on it must be part of the common kernel used by Thunderbird and these other apps. </p><p>This behavior just seemed to begin recently (last several months), and it makes trying to use Thunderbird and writing emails very frustrating and time-consuming.

In addition every setup with 1, 2 or 3 monitors gives a different window scaling.
