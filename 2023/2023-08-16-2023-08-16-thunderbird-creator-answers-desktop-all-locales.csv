La procedura di import si avvia correttamente e dal Task Manager posso vedere il processo lavorare; il file (C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\xxxx\Mail\Local Folders\Import Outlookxxxx.sbd\xxxxx.sbd) del profilo locale di Thunderbird aumenta di dimensione man mano che vengono importate le email. Dopo diversi minuti però tutto si ferma, il processo smette di lavorare ed il file di import su filesystem si blocca a 6.033.766.701 byte. </p><p>Thunderbird non restiuisce messaggi di errore e la finestra di avanzamento resta ferma allo 0% </p><p>Il file di origine è un PST da 36GB </p><p>Avete qualche suggerimento? Grazie </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,it,"",magnum2000

For example -A general correspondence email, invoice email, events email and a bookings email.  These have multiple folders and I use message filters to file correspondence into various folders.  Currently there is no easy way to write one message filter rule and apply it to multiple email addresses.  I can send corresponded from one email address to another using the filter but to manage multiple chains of correspondence from the same client, I have to write the same rule into all the email accounts separately.   My dream is to write one message filter and select the email accounts to apply this one rule too. </p><p>I want to be able to apply one rule to rule them all.   </p><p>For example - Spam - I currently have a message filter that grabs 16 plus phrases and sends them to spam but i have to create this rule multiple times for multiple email addresses - i should be able to apply it to all or a select number of email addresses.  Can anyone help </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",leegunn1471

I then set the Authentification method to ""Password, transmitted insecurely"",  but then Thunderbird produced a window saying, ""login to account 'outgoing SMTP' failed"" and telling me  ""Login to server <a href=""http://mail.whiteboxtechnologies.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.whiteboxtechnologies.com</a> with username [edited] @whiteboxtechnologies.com failed"" and to either Retry, Enter New Password, or Cancel.  All passwords I tried were rejected.   How can I either set the Authentification method to OAuth2,  or enter the correct password?
