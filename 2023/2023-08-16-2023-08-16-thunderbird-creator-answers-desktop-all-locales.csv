Sometime in the past year, after one of the Thunderbird updates, Thunderbird became EXTERMELY slow to open. It takes over a minute. I have looked for solutions here for the past year...no luck (I've read through most all of them here, that have to do with slowness of Thunderbird opening, as well as on Reddit).  I've tried basic troubleshooting e.g. clearing Thunderbird cache, increasing cache to huge size. I've seen references to the slowness being related to ""multiple calendars"". I don't use calendars on Thunnderbird and went as far as to delete/disable the default one that was there. Still no improvement. I know its a Thunderbird specific problem since: </p><p>a. I don't have this slowness opening any other program on my Mac (opening it or using it) b. I don't have a problem with performance of Thunderbird once it finally opens c. It all started in 2022 immediately after one of the Thunderbird updates. </p><p>I am on: Mac Air M1, Ventura 13.2, 16 GB Ram Thunderbird 102.14.0 (64-bit) </p><p>I hate to ditch Thunderbird after using it all these years and being a very early user since it came out, but I am at wits end.

A value between 1.1 and 1.7 sort of works, but not consistently.  </p><p>I use a Retina MacBook with external screens. Thunderbird seems to counter the efforts that MacOS puts in to make windows appear a similar size on screens with different pixel densities. So I end up constantly adjusting that advanced setting depending whether I have the thunderbird window on the builtin laptop screen or an external monitor. In addition every setup with 1, 2 or 3 monitors gives a different window scaling. Not a small effect, the difference is between only seeing the first 20 characters of each line in an email (that is large on a 27"" screen) to an unreadably small font size. </p><p>There must be a better way to fix this for MacOS.

It regularly freezes up (like every few minutes) while some background process is working.

After a minute or two, it apparently gets done with whatever background process it is doing, and everything is normal again. </p><p>For what it's worth, I notice that when this happens other mozilla apps like Open Office Writer and Open Office Calc are also locked up. So whatever is going on it must be part of the common kernel used by Thunderbird and these other apps. </p><p>This behavior just seemed to begin recently (last several months), and it makes trying to use Thunderbird and writing emails very frustrating and time-consuming.
