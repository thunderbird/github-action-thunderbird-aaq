If I try again, it is however immediately send. I never had this problem using Outlook. Is there a way to simply solve this problem? Thanks in advance.

It is set to display the Thunderbird Start Page in the Message Window.  But whether this appears in the Message Window or not is temperament - sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  Likewise, when I click on an email to open, on those days when the Thunderbird Start has not displayed, the body of the email won't display in the Message Window.  I use 3 email accounts with Thunderbird:  two are gmail accounts, one is <a href=""http://plus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">plus.com</a> (a UK provider).  When messages don't open in the Message Window, this impacts emails in all 3 accounts.  Other than closing down Thunderbird for a while and praying - which sometimes works! - how to I fix this? Many thanks in anticipation of a helpful reply. Cathleen </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",cgmainds

This is how it works in TB in my other laptop, is the normal behavior. I have 2 more google accounts, and 2 more institutional outlook (microsoft) accounts (another institution). <strong>All of them work with Oauth2 perfectly fine</strong>.
