I guess we are looking for a reason the file might not be updated for you out of the millions of Thunderbird users. </p><p>Some common reasons are; </p> <ul><li> The computer has it's power lost before the files are written to disk. (ie just turned off) </li><li> The profile files are stored somewhere other than the local hard disk. (NAS storage, cloud synced locations and streaming backup included here) </li><li> The profile folder files are being scanned by the antivirus product and the relevant file is locked by the scanner as the time the write attempt is made. (This often results in prefs(1).js through some huge numerical number of files being written on each shut down and then ignored on startup.) </li></ul>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
