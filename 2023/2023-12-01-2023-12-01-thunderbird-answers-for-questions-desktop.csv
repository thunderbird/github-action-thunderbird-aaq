It has pointed me in what looks like the right direction but I've still got a challenge. </p><p>File manager told me that prefs.js did not exist.

First I ran sfc /scannow which located and fixed some corrupt files. Second, I checked my Avast Free antivirus(v23.11.6090)and the firewall was off, Windows firewall is on. According to this article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1375468"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1375468</a> ""Thunderbird must be an allowed program"" through the firewall, and yet it is not in the list for allowed apps., so I added TB to the list. I had previously checked cookies (which is set to accept all cookies), and checked that there were no exceptions. I had also checked the Java setting using the config editor, and it was enabled. I also checked these things in this article <a href=""https://help.mashme.io/support/solutions/articles/29000036898-how-to-see-if-windows-firewall-is-blocking-a-port-or-program"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.mashme.io/support/solutions/articles/29000036898-how-to-see-if-windows-firewall-is-blocking-a-port-or-program</a> and everything seemed fine. None of the above actions made a difference BTW. In terms of checking local host, I`m not that knowledgeable, and had to look this up. I don`t know how I would set about checking if software is redirecting to local host.  I can say that my pc is a personal one, not gaming, not hosting web sites, and I`ve covered the firewall, ports etc already. As for setting both web outlook accounts to OAuth, this is what happens. </p><p>If I use the settings from this article <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/pop3-and-imap4/pop3-and-imap4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/pop3-and-imap4/pop3-and-imap4</a> the incoming mail still works (as it always has). However, if I try to send on either outlook accounts(I`ll call them owl1, and owl2), I get the error  </p><pre>        ""Login to server <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> with username owl1@outlook.com failed.""

Please check the password          and verify the 'Authentication method' in 'Account Settings|Outgoing server (SMTP)'  </pre> <p>Additionally, despite being two separate outlook accounts, if I change the port number in one account, it changes the other account as well. And, the username in both accounts is the now the same, and If I try to change it, it gets changed in both accounts, so one of my accounts has always got the wrong username. (ie., when editing the smtp settings, under ""account settings"") I checked the Google article you suggested. The cookies and Java steps I mentioned earlier. I checked the stored passwords. My GMAIL account which has always worked has passwords for IMAP, SMTP and an OAuth token. My owl1 account also has all 3, and the IMAP &amp;  SMTP passwords are the same (It is a Microsoft App generated password). My owl2 account only has the OAuth token. BTW, Microsoft sent me a email saying they noticed the login attempts on my owl2 account, and told me to set up using a MS App generated password, which is what I`ve been doing. (and how it was originally set-up). </p><p>As for your suggestion to change settings on my Yahoo account according to your link, I had tried these settings previously, and I tried them again with authentication set to OAuth2, and no change.  </p><p>The errors are </p><pre>            ""Sending of message failed.

The fact that you mention changing one account also changes the other indicates you are using the same SMTP server for both accounts. You can verify this by clicking 'account settings', scroll down left side to Outgoing Servers SMTP, and listing the entries. There MUST be one for each account. Edit each with a different description and then check the account pane to see which smtp server it links to. This indicates you are emailing for one account and using a different account for sending, resulting in failure. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

However, when I checked the ""outgoing server (SMTP)"" under ""Account Settings"" there was some irregularity (I think you were right about the same smtp server used on both accounts) So, I selected a different server from the ""Outgoing server (SMTP):"" drop down box under ""Account Settings"". Then selected ""Edit SMTP server..."", and checked the settings especially the username. This is all good.
