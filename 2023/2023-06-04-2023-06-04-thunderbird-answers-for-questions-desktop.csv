With this nearly-reassurance, transferring the first load of emails was tried and seems to have worked fine.  Unexpectedly, not just the Inbox contents came over but also Sent and a couple of other 'labels' that I had set up for things I wanted to stay in Gmail.  (Presumably another Gmail thing I don't understand.)  Fortunately I had opted for Do not delete from web server, just in case, so not a problem. </p>",BishopJ,false,0,0

I think the problem has to do with the size of my wife's gmail inbox (rather large).  I am advising her to move some messages to an offline location.  My theory is that a large IMAP store keeps Thunderbird busy synchronizing and compacting, and that sooner or later such activity will generate an error.   </p><p>If anyone wants to try to diagnose the specific cause, I have backups to before the time the nstmt files started accumulating, which I guess is when things began to unravel.  If the problems recur, I will use one of them to restore the account, though I will have to preserve the local folders first.  But if someone wants to try to find the root cause, let me know and I can put the files in a shared location. </p><p>Thanks again for the help.
