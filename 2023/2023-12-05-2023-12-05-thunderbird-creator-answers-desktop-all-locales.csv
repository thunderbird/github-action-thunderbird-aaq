One of my small pet dogs was in my lap, resting its head near my keyboard. I was in Thunderbird, reading a message, when all of a sudden all of my messages in INBOX were suddenly deleted. I thought maybe exiting Thunderbird might bring them back. BAD IDEA!!  Since I have empty Trash Bin on EXIT checked. Unfortunately that worked just fine. </p><p>I have a laptop that also is setup with the same IMAP accounts.  I disabled the Internet connection on that computer, and the emails are still there as long as I don't connect to the internet.  I tried copying all the files in the profile from the laptop to the desktop, but as soon as I launch Thunderbird, it sees that the inbox is empty, and removes (or basically updates) that inbox. </p><p>I tried export/import (export msgs from laptop, import to desktop) but maybe I don't fully understand the import process, because that doesn't seem to work for me. </p><p>One other option might be to  make that account OFFLINE (so it doesn't connect anymore) change the name of that email account, and recreate the account. </p><p>I'm open to suggestions - there are 240 msgs in that INBOX that I need to keep for reference.

Right now I have lost access to 6 emails I use pretty much daily. </p><p>Does TB have any plans on tweeking the program so when someone using TB and has gmail accounts will actually be recognized by gmail as a legit sign-in?

Apparently not. </p><p>Also, after the last update, TB is not handling gmail folders very well. I have to wait to see what I deleted, saved, etc..compared to before. It looks like TB is signing into gmail for each and every process instead of the one time per account? Why?

I finally got fed up with viruses/crashes, having to rebuild the mailboxes, but I was never able to find anything to take its place and have frankly been limping along ever since. I regularly need to find things going back months, years, and even decades. It used to be simple with Eudora. Recently, one of my parents passed away and I'm kind of the family scribe, so I really need to pull together all the past communications, from Eudora (going back to almost 1990), gmail, yahoo, my website, icloud, my college alumni address, my Ronin Institute address, my 15 Sonic addresses--and there's probably a few I'm forgetting offhand.  I really need to consolidate them. I tried various email clients, including years ago a previous version of Thunderbird, but they were a lot of work to set up and couldn't handle all the email addresses. </p><p>I see better reviews of Thunderbird now. Can Thunderbird really handle all those email addresses? Since my Eudora mbox files are still on OS Snowleopard, and I'm running Macbook M1 with the latest OS now, what's the best way to incorporate the entire archive of messages and also start hopefully wrangling current messages (like I haven't been able to since I had to stop using Eudora)? Eudora pretty much only did POP well, and I actually did appreciate having my data on my own computer, but now there are some email accounts I'd prefer as IMAP and others as POP. Is it possible to mix them? Is it possible to download AND keeps messages available for viewing by phone? This situation has been a problem for me for years--I was just wondering if there might be any volunteers at Mozilla who might be willing to spend a few hours on the phone with me to help me bring my email into the 21st century? Nearly every day of my life I have to let someone down over something I can no longer do or find because I don't have Eudora. But the problem doesn't go away just because I find another program that does some of the things Eudora did--I really need some help integrating everything.
