TB is set up for Gmail exactly as prescribed in the GMail site.  We are travelling and I am using Linux Mint (system info attached) with a Huawei 3G data router and WorldSim payg sim (We have had some issues with French sites that block us using these). Just recently, within the last week, instead of Thunderbird logging on to Gmail and downloading mail, a ""Google"" login screen appears (screenshot attached). It does this even if I log onto google and Gmail with firefox. If I click on ""Next"" an error screen appears (attached) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1622120;1622139;,suederekmax

One of my small pet dogs was in my lap, resting its head near my keyboard. I was in Thunderbird, reading a message, when all of a sudden all of my messages in INBOX were suddenly deleted. I thought maybe exiting Thunderbird might bring them back. BAD IDEA!!  Since I have empty Trash Bin on EXIT checked. Unfortunately that worked just fine. </p><p>I have a laptop that also is setup with the same IMAP accounts.  I disabled the Internet connection on that computer, and the emails are still there as long as I don't connect to the internet.  I tried copying all the files in the profile from the laptop to the desktop, but as soon as I launch Thunderbird, it sees that the inbox is empty, and removes (or basically updates) that inbox. </p><p>I tried export/import (export msgs from laptop, import to desktop) but maybe I don't fully understand the import process, because that doesn't seem to work for me. </p><p>One other option might be to  make that account OFFLINE (so it doesn't connect anymore) change the name of that email account, and recreate the account. </p><p>I'm open to suggestions - there are 240 msgs in that INBOX that I need to keep for reference. (And I will no longer keep msgs in the INBOX, I'll move them to new folders!!) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",skyguy2

Right now I have lost access to 6 emails I use pretty much daily. </p><p>Does TB have any plans on tweeking the program so when someone using TB and has gmail accounts will actually be recognized by gmail as a legit sign-in? One would think gmail's system would treat a sign-in by TB the same as it does physically being on gmails site to sign-in...right? Apparently not. </p><p>Also, after the last update, TB is not handling gmail folders very well. I have to wait to see what I deleted, saved, etc..compared to before. It looks like TB is signing into gmail for each and every process instead of the one time per account? Why? This might explain why gmail keeps telling me ""You have attempted to sign into your account too many times...please come back later"" This is after one attempt to physically sign-in on each of these 6 accounts. Now they blocked sign-ins to all of them thinking I'm a hacker. </p><p>I'm not complaining, just trying to understand. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",TheNightowl
