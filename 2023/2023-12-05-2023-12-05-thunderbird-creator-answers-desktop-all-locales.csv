I finally got fed up with viruses/crashes, having to rebuild the mailboxes, but I was never able to find anything to take its place and have frankly been limping along ever since. I regularly need to find things going back months, years, and even decades. It used to be simple with Eudora. Recently, one of my parents passed away and I'm kind of the family scribe, so I really need to pull together all the past communications, from Eudora (going back to almost 1990), gmail, yahoo, my website, icloud, my college alumni address, my Ronin Institute address, my 15 Sonic addresses--and there's probably a few I'm forgetting offhand.  I really need to consolidate them. I tried various email clients, including years ago a previous version of Thunderbird, but they were a lot of work to set up and couldn't handle all the email addresses. </p><p>I see better reviews of Thunderbird now. Can Thunderbird really handle all those email addresses? Since my Eudora mbox files are still on OS Snowleopard, and I'm running Macbook M1 with the latest OS now, what's the best way to incorporate the entire archive of messages and also start hopefully wrangling current messages (like I haven't been able to since I had to stop using Eudora)? Eudora pretty much only did POP well, and I actually did appreciate having my data on my own computer, but now there are some email accounts I'd prefer as IMAP and others as POP. Is it possible to mix them? Is it possible to download AND keeps messages available for viewing by phone? This situation has been a problem for me for years--I was just wondering if there might be any volunteers at Mozilla who might be willing to spend a few hours on the phone with me to help me bring my email into the 21st century? Nearly every day of my life I have to let someone down over something I can no longer do or find because I don't have Eudora. But the problem doesn't go away just because I find another program that does some of the things Eudora did--I really need some help integrating everything.

Nothing I saw prior to updating to v.115 a few weeks ago led me to realise that my combined Inbox would be broken apart. I did ask for a ""downgrade fix"" pretty immediately, but have had no reply. Looking at other users' questions about v.115, I see many people with similar problems after upgrading. I now have to look in all those of my accounts which appear beneath the top Inbox header (which with trouble I found and have made visible), but also in other haphazardly located inboxes further down the mailbox hierarchy or listings, to pick up those messages not appearing with the bulk of the others. The suggested fixes for lack of global inbox were far too technically intricate for me to tackle and all I really want is my old display of emails back. I do appreciate that as a highly technical person, but with no experience of the most consistent mailbox settings, I may have somewhere gone wrong over the years and this could have helped the current confusion. Thunderbird has become a current hardly usable jumble. But until now, there really weren't any problems. Can anyone help me revert to my previous working Thunderbird layout, without my having to re-program the beast? Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1622231;1622244;,rickbon
