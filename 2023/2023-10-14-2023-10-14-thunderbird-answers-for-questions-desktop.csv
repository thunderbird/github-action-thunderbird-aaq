It's about (as simple as) adding or removing '&gt;' in front of some (block of) text, which is the good-old-indentation marker of email;-)  Yes, I can go through the text manually and change the start of a few to 100 lines of quoted email, but there ought to be a simpler way to do this. </p><p>I am not worrying on how it is displayed for me (Thunderbird does fine here) nor the receiver (their MUAs also do that right). </p><p>NB: right now I copy the text to Emacs, adjust the starts of all lines, then copy back.

There is an addon, external editor, that may help, but I have no experience with it. You also face the issue of whatever font the recipient is using. Generally, if you're emailing to private individuals, it's a tossup on whether their email client is set for HTML or not, so messages that are dependent on formatting, may not achieve the objective. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
