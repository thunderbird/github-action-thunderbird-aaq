The simplest way I can advise is the find/replace feature that can go line by line or all to remove the '&gt;' character. Another option is not to select 'reply' but 'edit as new message', which removes '&gt;' characters.

Thanks for your reply When I want to see all the toolbars, I go to Menu Bar, View, Toolbars - and there I can only see 4 options:  Menu, Quick Filter, Spaces and Status.  No sign of the new Unified Toolbar.  Please can you help me find it.   (In my old Mail Toolbar, I had a 'Get messages for all accounts' button, which I used every day.  I suppose I could do without Unified Toolbar, if I could set a 'Get all' button somewhere else.  Any thoughts on that?  Thanks). </p><p>Murray </p>",MurrayKerr,false,0,0
