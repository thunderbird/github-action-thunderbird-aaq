It causes the folder to be hidden and you would need to unlock prior to starting Thunderbird and lock again when done. Otherwise, it would be difficult for an email client to protect all data components, since they are accessible outside the application. This utility eliminates the issue by hiding the folder. I did check the current status of the password control you prefer and it's been in discussion for over four years due to the many side questions it raises.
