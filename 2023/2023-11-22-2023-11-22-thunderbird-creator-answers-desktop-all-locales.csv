It appears from my update history that 115.2.3 was the most stable of the 115 versions. I'd rather go back to 102 but it seems that the profile was modified in 115 so that it is no longer compatible with 102. Thus a 102 rollback might require quite a bit of work to reimport the profile into a clean install. And I have gigabytes of important mail. </p><p>I'm not on 115.4.3 and it is close to unusable, as they screwed up regression in a major bug, and my bugzilla on it has sat unanswered, other than requesting I be nice to the devs. So as a lower-risk option might be to roll back from 115.4.3 to 115.2.3.  Has anyone tried anything like that, or know the safest way? I don't know what booby traps they've planted to prevent any rollbacks. Thanks! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1619349;1619361;,fred37

However, as a test I send to myself, and the text arrives in the in box in black font only.    I have received emails from others,where they have indicated for example, see green notes.  However there is no green text?  So it looks like when I receive any emails, that have any colour included in the text, I only see all text in black? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",santec1

God only knows what it will take to get it working again. i'm tired of fooling with fixes that don't work so if mozilla doesn't fix it i will have to move on to something that does work. if it ain't broke, please don't fix it. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",wglass.90
