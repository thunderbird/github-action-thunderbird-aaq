It appears from my update history that 115.2.3 was the most stable of the 115 versions. I'd rather go back to 102 but it seems that the profile was modified in 115 so that it is no longer compatible with 102. Thus a 102 rollback might require quite a bit of work to reimport the profile into a clean install. And I have gigabytes of important mail. </p><p>I'm not on 115.4.3 and it is close to unusable, as they screwed up regression in a major bug, and my bugzilla on it has sat unanswered, other than requesting I be nice to the devs. So as a lower-risk option might be to roll back from 115.4.3 to 115.2.3.  Has anyone tried anything like that, or know the safest way? I don't know what booby traps they've planted to prevent any rollbacks.

Latest update Supernova (now using 115.5.0 but this happened a few weeks ago) has eliminated the yellow Gmail IMAP folder and now those folders are listed in Folder pane on the same level with TB folders and icons. The result is confusing as to which are TB and which are Gmail. Two Drafts folders, a Bin and a Trash folder, a Junk and a Spam folder as well as a Sent and Sent Mail folder. In previous versions, Gmail was a yellow folder that, when expanded, listed all Gmail IMAP subfolders. Now it's hard to tell what's what. Any suggestions as to revive the previous - and much clearer - layout where Gmail was its own yellow folder and IMAP Inbox, Sent Mail, etc. were underneath as subfolders?
