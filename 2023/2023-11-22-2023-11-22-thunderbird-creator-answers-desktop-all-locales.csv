Latest update Supernova (now using 115.5.0 but this happened a few weeks ago) has eliminated the yellow Gmail IMAP folder and now those folders are listed in Folder pane on the same level with TB folders and icons. The result is confusing as to which are TB and which are Gmail. Two Drafts folders, a Bin and a Trash folder, a Junk and a Spam folder as well as a Sent and Sent Mail folder. In previous versions, Gmail was a yellow folder that, when expanded, listed all Gmail IMAP subfolders. Now it's hard to tell what's what. Any suggestions as to revive the previous - and much clearer - layout where Gmail was its own yellow folder and IMAP Inbox, Sent Mail, etc. were underneath as subfolders? Thanks in advance to the good guys in here who generously give their time and efforts helping out confused customers such as myself!  Your efforts ARE appreciated...
