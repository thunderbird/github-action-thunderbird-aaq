My computer crashed and after recovering it, Thunderbird can't see my mail profile. I've had it on a different partition, and no solution works, believe me, I've already tried every obvious thing (I wouldn't be asking here if I didn't). The thing is nothing works - fixing the path in profile.ini, importing the profile through the app and pointing to that folder, copying the files to a completely new profile - nothing! It's as if some files, that should show Thunderbird that ""this is a profile"", are broken. So here's my question - I still have the large files containg all my emails (inbox etc.) in this broken profile folder - is there any way to recover the contents of those files (and maybe bring them back to Thunderbird)? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1563641;,michal.bebenek

The one that is not downloading is a computer that I did not use for about 2 months. However Thunderbird has always been used on that computer before this all happened with no problems. When I put it back in service a few days ago no new email was downloading. Reminders did not download either. However some new Reminders will pop up once in a while. Very perplexing.

We do NOT use another email with Thunderbird. (I have Gmail, but it is separate.) When messages have failed to save to Sent, I have always until today blamed our horrible ISP.
