It does not get mail until I click on get mail, (at least the wait time is long enough that I have to initiate the first batch of mail manually.  I click on get mail and TB contacts the mail server and the mail server asks for a password.  TB relays that request to me with a password window.  If I get that window then everything is working fine but I am not getting that window and I don't know if the problem is TB not negotiating an SSL connection or if there is some problem with the TB software that causes it to pause.  There is no message at the bottom of the screen that says, ""Host contacted, sending login information""  I have attached a screen shot that shows what it looks like when it is working and prompting for a password.  When it doesn't work, I click on ""get mail"" and nothing happens, nothing, that is why it is so hard to troubleshoot. </p>",wcp38,false,0,0
