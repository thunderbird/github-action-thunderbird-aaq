Penso deva fare un aggiornamento di thunderbird, ma nel programa non vedo il menu menu Aiuto ne la voce Informazioni su Thunderbird. Cosa meglio fare? </p>",rolando.morales,false,0,0

This is for a friends desktop that I have rebuilt and I've been playing around with this for two days now and it would seem that it works sometimes and then not. I seem to have it all sorted then when I go to my friends desktop, triumphantly saying I know how to recover all his lost calendar events, it doesn't work! Arggghhh!!! </p><p>I have now tried three ways: 1. Import from the profile folder that I have working on my laptop 2. Import from an ics file that I have just exported from the working profile on my laptop 3. Simply copy the sqlite file from my working profile to another profile </p><p>the results are: 1. sometimes works but usually not, appears to have worked but I have no events in the calendars 2. again sometimes works but sometimes get an error message and no events and calendar is suspended 3. again, sometimes works but sometimes get no events </p><p>So as you can see, I'm somewhat dumbfounded as to why its so inconsistent! And when I go to my friends desktop, I can't get any of the three to work! (well I couldn't yesterday, I will try again tomorrow!) </p>",jimc.lea,false,0,0
