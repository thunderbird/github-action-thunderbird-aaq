It's the amount of space in a folder or file. </p><p>Emails are appended to the relevant text file. eg: Inbox folder in reality is an mbox text file. Emails get written/appended to the text document file in the order downloaded.

I manually compact those three at the end of each day. </p><p>Is it possible you have auto compacting switched on? Compacting means a copy of file is created within the same mail account folder then it reads down through file, copying all the wanted not marked as  deleted emails (emails which have been 'moved' either to another folder or deleted) to new file. Finally it saves new file and removes the old one. If this auto compacting is operating and there's insufficient space to compact all files at once then it might trigger that not enough space error. </p><p>Suggest you switch off auto compacting and then perform manual compacting when it's more convenient for you.
