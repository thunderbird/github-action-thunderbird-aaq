The one called 'prefs.js' is the one you are currently using. The one called 'prefs-8.js' was the one previously used. It has a modified date of 9th June 2021 - so it's been some time since used. This means the error is not caused by a sudden change in use of this file. However, you only need 'prefs.js' file. All the other 'prefs-N.js' (one's with numbers) can be deleted. </p><p>You have a lot of virtualFolders.dat files. The one called 'virtualFolders.dat' is the one in current use.  The last one is called 'virtualFolders-19.dat' last used 19th May 2023, so again that was some time ago. However, you only use 'virtualFolders.dat' file. All the other <em>virtualFolders-N.dat</em> (one's with numbers) can be deleted.  It's possible that 'virtualFolders.dat' file may be causing a problem as it is to do with Unified folders. So we'll delete that as well. </p><p>In the 'Mail' folder there is a 'smart mailboxes' folder dated 15th Sept 2023 time 3:49 PM, which is about the time you first reported an issue.

I can created new calendar entries and they appear in the calendar, but all my previous entries are missing. I've tried to send a new message, but no new windows opens for the message composition.

It I think comes from leaving a web page logged in and the cookies that hold it open in the browser so the best site you access can use them to access your mail.  FOlk appear to think mail is a web site and it is not. </p><p>Certainly there is an authentication process,  there may even be one every few minutes,  because the process is connect, check for new mail and end the session.  Connect send the mail end the session.  Getting mail occurs on a default frequency of every 15 minutes,  but I have seen folk setting is as frequently as a couple of minutes others have it set to thirty minutes. </p><p>Then there is the ""modern"" complication of calendars and contacts synchronization et. al. which has it's own authentication protocols and methods. </p><p>Can you be sure that Thunderbird is not connected to a session when you click the close button.  Not really. But one of two things will occur.  The active task will sent an exit command and will close the session, or in some instances the shutdown will be delayed while the task completes.  If you crash out like just pull the plug from the wall or force close using the task manager,  then the server will time you out in a couple of minutes.  Exactly how long is something that is set on the server by the server administrator, but it is rarely longer than 2 minutes.  This is where antivirus programs complicate things because the often cause timeouts by being slow in acting so sessions end early. </p><p>You probably do not like this answer any better than the others you have found.

IF this were the case, you would have to input your password every time the system wanted to connect to send or receive e-mail (unless you have your computer remember it, which I do not allow mine to do.  This is also how I got my account hacked--by NOT logging out of my email account on my home PC before I deployed over-seas.  My Daughter let a friend use the PC and they found my open session (about a year after I deployed) and hacked the email account.  MOST email servers (yes I know the difference between an Email Server and a Website and a sharepoint (I'm an admin)) have a menu selection where you can view open sessions.  Those sessions will stay open forever unless you manually close them--or the server crashes. Let's see if we can find someone who actually knows if there is a setting somewhere in the menu section of Thunderbird to allow you to manually logout of the server--or if the program (app) is set to auto-log if it is shut down.

One then failed when changed to Supernova, so I deleted the account from TBird, expecting to set it up again immediately. I have tried MANY times without success and get a 400 error from Google.  I tried the idea of clearing the startup cache (from Thunderbird, not Firebird! I think that was probably a typo!) but that didn't work either. In case it makes any difference, I want to set it up as POP, not IMAP.  If I were to try setting it up in IMAP, would that like work better?  Then could I change it back to POP?
