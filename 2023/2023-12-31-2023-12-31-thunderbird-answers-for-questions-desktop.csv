I really don't know, but I do not think so. </p><p>If you are trying to offer feedback,  you might want to use the link on the Thunderbird help menu, or <a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://connect.mozilla.org</a> (Same thing) </p><p>This is a peer support forum,  and since the Thunderbird team put a feedback link on the help menu, the number of folk coming here to offer feedback to their fellow Thunderbird users has grown not reduced to Zero as it should have. </p><p>I am not sure what you mean by "" I used to use most of your products""  Mzla and the Thunderbird council has but one product. Thunderbird.  They are not linked to the Mozilla company that makes Firefox and distributes other products listed here. <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/</a> </p><p>Thunderbird is almost 20 having reached Version 1 release on 7th December 2004 and in most of the decade after Mozilla cut it free in 2012 simply maintaining the product in a state where the source code would build was about all the volunteers that were doing the development could mange.  In the past few years donations have allowed a growing number of developers to be hired to try and pay down some of the technical debt that accrued in the lost years.  I have many personal misgivings about the direction the project is now taking,  but it is at last moving. My misgivings are about the team concentrating on the user interface design in their migration away for XUL.  Much of the back end is in the process of being rewritten in JavaScript.  Never been a fast way to execute anything in my experience, but it fits with their desire to use ""web technologies"" on the desktop. It is also probably no slower that using Microsoft managed code which most windows store applications use now. </p><p>Profile migration is, as you have said, an utter mess and I really think it will get worse long before it gets better.  The profile import tools makes no attempt to migrate passwords.  Personally I consider moving them one of the important bits.  I don't know them and looking up some 20 passwords is not what I consider migration.  Setting up accounts is not hard,  remembering passwords.  That is hard. </p><p>The profile migration code also makes no attempt to migrate mail in the IMAP mail folders.  The argument is that synchronization will soon replace any missing mail. </p><p>The Migration tool is limited to 2Gb profiles.  Most folk have more than 2Gb if mail these days so a profile migration tool that can not cope with a more common 10 or 20 Gb profile is really not all that useful. Mine is more than 40Gb and I have exactly no use at all of these new but fatally broken tools which assume I have a mail store akin to what I had when the server allowed my 5Mb of storage. </p><p>Then you get told just copy the profile.  It sure used to work,  and work well if the copy included the folder with  profiles.ini in it and everything under it.  But someone at Mozilla built a <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"" rel=""nofollow"">profile per install</a> ""feature"" that largely means that now it will basically only work like it used to if both the version of Thunderbird you are leaving and the one you are going to are the exact same version, and who updates their software on the machine they are abandoning immediately before they turn it off for the last time. </p><p>Soon to be released is a Firefox like synchronization Thunderbird Sync,  but what is not clear is exactly what that will Sync.  As they are using Mozilla sync servers, I would assume the amount of data is strictly limited. So a multi gigabyte profile folder will probably not be what we get.  But I hear talk of account settings and address books.  I guess the address book sync will relieve them of the urgent need to fix the profile per install which periodically just decides you need a new profile when Thunderbird updates. </p><p>With all that going on, it is far easier to just allow the new version to create a new profile and then copy the files from the old profile folders into the new one, overwriting the existing files in the new profile.  No fighting the various ""features"" and it always works. That is if you copied all the files and sub folders in the profile folder (something that appears to exceed the abilities of many windows users.) and Thunderbird was not running while you replaced the files it uses to actually present your mail. </p><p>I do encourage you to use the feedback tool.
