The AV could be scanning all files that opened, so every time you select a folder or to read an email a file gets opened. If using imap and you move or delete a file then a file gets opened and there is synchronisation between server and imap folder. Maybe you are composing an email and it gets an auto save to drafts, then a file gets opened to write to the file and then folder gets synchronised to server.  Maybe you are or scanning all incoming and/or outgoing mail. </p><p>It is commonly advised to make Thunderbird profile folders exempt from scanning and switch off the auto scanning of emails you download.  This is not as alarming as it sounds. Thunderbird by default does not allow remote content and it is advised you do not choose to allow it unless you are 100% sure of the sender and the type of content it contains. Do not open any links without checking what the real link is pointing to and do not open any attachment unless you know what it is and that it comes from a legit source.  Do not allow curiousity to get the better of you because spammers etc are banking on you being courious to open stuff that should just be deleted and never opened. </p><p>Remember to compact folders on frequent basis. The three folders that need compacting more frequently are 'Inbox', 'Drafts' and 'Junk/Spam'  as these folders get the most 'moves' or 'deletions' of emails. </p><p>Good info links that offer excellent explanations and other potential things that can effect performance: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Performance_-_Thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Performance_-_Thunderbird</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders</a> </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Nothing like a dead slow drive top make fringe issues big issues.  But I do not see that as the issue here </p> 2. Who is the mail provider involved?  There are many spam filtering actions that occur on servers and many providers simply do not allow you the option to turn them off.  Yahoo, AOL, Verizon and ATT to mention a few off the top of my head.  You state <blockquote> It is not IMAP setting. SPAM assassin and all server side SPAM settings are OFF</blockquote>  and you can vouch for this how?  Simply assuming they are off because you have disabled all setting you can find is not helpful to you or anyone trying to assist you. <p>3.  Your assumption that Thunderbird's junk filter is simply not working is rather unlikely to be correct.  With a user base in the millions  I see very few turning up in these forums with issues.  What I do see are lots of people that do not understand what spam is, trying to have specific addresses declared by Thunderbird to be SPAM. I see even more folk complaining that they have Thunderbird spam filters turned off and they are still filtering spam because they are not aware there is a non opt out SPAM filter on the IMAP server.  </p><p>So to move this forward;   </p> <ol><li> What mail provider are you using? </li><li> What mail server? </li><li> what operating system? </li></ol>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
