I believe every Thunderbird user needs to know all they can about profiles. When you've finally understood what a profile is, head over to <a href=""/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">Profile Manager - Create and remove Thunderbird profiles</a> and use the information there to create a new profile and launch it. The idea is to start with a fresh new profile and see if you can successfully setup your email account on that new profile using the password that has been confirmed to be working on webmail. A lot of times, issues users face with Thunderbird are a result of their profiles getting messed up or corrupted in some way, and starting afresh with a new profile is, in my opinion, the most effective approach in the long run, and also a good troubleshooting step to ascertain if the problem lies within a certain profile or elsewhere. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0
