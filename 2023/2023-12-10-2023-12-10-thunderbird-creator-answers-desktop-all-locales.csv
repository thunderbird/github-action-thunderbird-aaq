I discovered that after adding icons to the toolbar something triggers new windows to suddenly pop up when shifting between tabs. It happens as soon as the cursor moves across the Inbox tab when switching from the Settings or Addons tab. I don’t need to click the mouse for this to happen. If I restore the toolbar to its original state then the bug disappears. The screen recording below is on the latest nightly (122.0a1) but it happens in v115.5.1 as well.
