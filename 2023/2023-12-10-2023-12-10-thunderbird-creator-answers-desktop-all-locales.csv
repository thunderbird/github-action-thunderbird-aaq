I use it as a partial replacement to Outlook since the latter doesn't play nice with backup systems, hogging way too much disk space than necessary, and as a substitute to Apple Mail as it doesn't allow me to use the ""send later"" function I routinely need. </p><p>However, <strong>many issues persist</strong>, the most annoying being that <strong>incoming messages are almost always marked as spam (red flame icon)</strong> when I click to read them, no matter the account it was received on, no matter the folder. Now, all the accounts obviously have the ""don't check for spam if sender is in my contacts"", and indeed, these are the few that aren't marked as spam. However, this isn't practical at all as I routinely receive automated messages from mailing lists I subscribe to and a few legitimate commercial newsletters. There's no way I will put these among my contacts. As a comparison, those same messages read in Apple Mail aren't marked as spam, confirming it's just a TB issue. </p><p>From the [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages|Help"" rel=""nofollow"">page</a>], <strong>TB is supposed to learn from the user's actions</strong> and properly mark messages afterwards. Well, except it doesn't.  </p><p>Almost every time I want to read a message, I have first to select it, then click on the flame to mark the email as legitimate, then move it to a select folder if needed. Apple Mail does provide a 1-click sort button which greatly speeds up sorting in that client when I don't need Exchange compatibility. It also speeds up creation of a local filter. No such thing in TB, just the Quick Move extension which doesn't learn anything or the filter creation dialog where it's way too easy to screw up something. </p><p>Questions:  </p> <ul><li> how can TB junk filter be more effectively and reliably trained, without having to download all said messages first? Say, that messages older than X in a given folder could be marked as legitimate without the user intervention? Also excluding trashed messages? (Trashed doesn't mean they're spam!) </li><li> On Mac, can TB be set so as to copy the already existing Apple Mail filters without having to recreate them? </li><li> Can TB be set so as to synchronize mails in all folders, but not display a notification? It's disrupting as I especially set up filters to avoid being disturbed in the first place (although I don't buy into the ""inbox zero"" fad). </li></ul> <p>As much as I wouldn't use anything other than Firefox as a daily browser, TB's bloated and unstructured interface (come on, <em>two</em> search boxes??) is in dire need of a redesign to make it an streamlined email client, not one when every single action takes at least 3 or 4 steps. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cubytus
