Per evitare blocchi del programma procedi a gruppi di qualche centinaio di messaggi per volta. </li></ul> <p>La procedure comunque è abbastanza laboriosa. Ovviamente potresti anche utilizzare la versione portable come una sorta di archivio e la versione installata solo per la nuova posta. </p>",@next,false,0,0

However, I had already checked these: </p><p>- the messages on the server are not in the Spam folder, they are in the Inbox - I am far below server quota, anyway that is not the problem as the messages are present on the server. - View&gt;Folders and View&gt;Threads are both on All - View&gt;Sort by is on Unthreaded - No highlighted icons or old serch value in the Quick Filter bar  - I have two filters, sorting messages to a different mailbox in Thunderbird. Could not check logs as these were not enabled. Have now removed one obsolete filter. - Spam folder and Junk folder on the server (Roundcube webmail) both are empty. - About removing an email: the situation does not persist, the next time I press Get messages it works again. So this is not about a faulty email that jams the process. </p><p>As this only happens occasionally it is difficult to find what might be wrong: I have no clue... </p>",lennings,false,0,0
