So you have instant view of new mail when selecting Inbox for first time. But If you scroll down and reading another emails and a new mail comes into folder then it does not auto jump to the top.  </p><p>Likewise, you are using Sort by 'Ascending' upon start up Thunderbird and selecting 'Inbox', you should see instant view of new mail at the bottom. But if subsequently scroll up to read another email and new mail comes into Inbox, it's not going to auto jump to it. </p><p>If you are already using Inbox then you may get annoyed if the scroll kept jumping around whilst you are trying to read or select other mail. </p><p>But you know there's new mail because the folder in Folder Pane will display the new mail star icon. Meaning you need to scroll to see email. </p><p><strong>re&nbsp;:it's impossible to have a partially blank space [where new mail would go] below the last message.</strong> </p><p>You only see a blank line area if there is actual space. If you have too many emails then you have used up the space and a scroll bar appears on the right. </p><p>You may still see new mail appear if there are really are just a few emails in the list and the Message Pane is set about half way.  Example:  Message pane is at a position to show 10 emails in list, but currently there is only five in list, so you automatically have space - a gap for up to 5 new emails - anything new is still going to be instantly clearly visible. You do not need to scroll - infact there should not be a scroll bar if it's not required. </p><p>But as more emails arrive the empty space reduces until it disappears from view. Sometimes moving the Message Pane down a bit reveals it again but it may not be so convenient. </p><p><br> If I close the Message Pane using shortcut key F8  then look at the list - does the list it fill the space from top to bottom? Or is there only some space near the bottom? </p><p>Note: press F8 again to get Message Pane back. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That action did *not* affect the headers already showing.  Instead in the current release, moving the divider downward causes *more* message headers to fill from the top of the pane.

Generally the issues relate to either the software firewall disabling Thunderbird from accessing the internet (this is obvious if you are setting up a mail account from a known provider listed here <a href=""https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/</a>.

Thunderbird maintains it's own trusted certificates manager and builtin chain of trust.  Windows which is used by just about every other platform has automation that allows malware to insert their own self signed certificates in the store just as the antivirus products do. Basically negating the benefits of encrypted connections. Thunderbird is more secure,  but requires manual intervention in the certificate issue if you want to waste time scanning mail. I don't, so use Microsoft Defender which has no mail scanner. </p><p>Each antivirus vendor has instructions on how you can manually add their self signed certificate to the chain of trust in the certificate store of Firefox and Thunderbird, as both use the same technology in this instance. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
