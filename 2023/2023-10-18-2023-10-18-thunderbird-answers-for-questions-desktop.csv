I recently migrated to Thunderbird 115 from an older version and am a little confused about its behavior. After launching the app and receive new messages, the scroll position of the message list in each tray seems to change randomly, so it is annoying as I need to scroll to see the new messages each time, each time and each time. Is this specification or bug? or is it possible to set to display new messages after receiving messages? </p>",yneko,false,0,0
