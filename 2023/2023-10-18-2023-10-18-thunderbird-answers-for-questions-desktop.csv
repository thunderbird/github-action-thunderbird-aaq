My suggestion is this: - rightclick the unified toolbar and click 'customize' - drag all the buttons you would normally use, such as get messages, write, forward, delete, etc  - if menu bar is on, click view&gt;toolbars and UNtick it  - click view&gt;folders and UNtick the folder pane header (This is optional. I happen to like that header, but omitted from my screenshot to give you a view close to 102.)  </p><p>Now you have a clean view. Instead of menu bar, you have the hamburger menu in upper right. This view is now close to 102, but in doing so, you lose some of the features of the folder pane header. This new design completely removes the need for the old menu bar and gives you full control of what features you want. Okay, I may seem biased, but I was like you at first. I didn't like the view and I insisted on keeping the menu bar. Now, I prefer the new view. And THANKS for being open to this change. So many post here with anger that the view is different.

It might be related to this being a domain account, as my consumer Hotmail account works without fail with the same server settings and OAuth2 for incoming and outgoing.  There was a <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1424172"" rel=""nofollow"">bug in earlier versions related to obsolete entries left over from profiles used in 102</a>, but if you have the latest release, now 115.3.3, that shouldn't be an issue. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

After doing that that when it next needs to contact Microsoft for IMAP it prompts me for a new OAuth2 login, as expected.  But it doesn't have any effect on Thunderbird's behaviour when sending emails.  In particular it doesn't display an OAuth2 login for smtp.</p> <p>But your comment did trigger an idea for me.  I temporarily changed the IMAP login to ""Normal Password"" leaving smtp on OAuth2, deleted the login password mentioned above and then pressed [Send] on an email.  I wanted to see what smtp does when it has no way to authenticate.  It results in the OAuth2 login being displayed with a URL like <a href=""https://login.microsoft.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?responde_type=code&amp;client_id=....&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalho"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.microsoft.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?responde_type=code&amp;client_id=....&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalho</a>..., which immediately redirects a couple of times ending up at <a href=""https://idp.DOMAIN.NAME/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://idp.DOMAIN.NAME/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php</a>.  That page is blank, and after a second or so it disappears without asking for input.  But the oauth:// password entry is recreated nonetheless, and looks to be valid because when I revert the IMAP login to OAuth2 I don't get prompted to get a new OAuth2 bearer token.  So sending with SMTP is traipsing  down the OAuth2 path, but in the end it fails in the way I described in my first post.  Ie, it presents the dialogue with then [Enter New Password] button.</p>",russell+accounts.firefox.com,false,0,0

I recently migrated to Thunderbird 115 from an older version and am a little confused about its behavior. After launching the app and receive new messages, the scroll position of the message list in each tray seems to change randomly, so it is annoying as I need to scroll to see the new messages each time, each time and each time. Is this specification or bug? or is it possible to set to display new messages after receiving messages? </p>",yneko,false,0,0
