Example:  Message pane is at a position to show 10 emails in list, but currently there is only five in list, so you automatically have space - a gap for up to 5 new emails - anything new is still going to be instantly clearly visible. You do not need to scroll - infact there should not be a scroll bar if it's not required. </p><p>But as more emails arrive the empty space reduces until it disappears from view. Sometimes moving the Message Pane down a bit reveals it again but it may not be so convenient. </p><p><br> If I close the Message Pane using shortcut key F8  then look at the list - does the list it fill the space from top to bottom? Or is there only some space near the bottom? </p><p>Note: press F8 again to get Message Pane back. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That action did *not* affect the headers already showing.  Instead in the current release, moving the divider downward causes *more* message headers to fill from the top of the pane.

The one that does not has 3 saved passwords and the one that does has two, one of which is the same as the one I am trying to save.   The other saved password, on the machine which will send is for gmail.  I also have a gmail other the one that does work.  I think that the one that does work is using gmail for sending all email out. (Only thing I could think of why). </p><p>The other thing which is strange is that I have a single password for google.  That password is not the same password which is being used for google in thunderbird.  Oh, the other thing is that the saved passwords in the machine that works will not allow the user to either look, nor edit, or change the saved passwords. </p><p>I think I am in trouble.
