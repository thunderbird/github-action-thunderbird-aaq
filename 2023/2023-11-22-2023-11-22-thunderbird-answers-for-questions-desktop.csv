Only gave me an even MORE confusing - and larger - layout (see screenshot). The earlier layout allowed me to easily administer my 4 email addresses within a reasonably-sized window without having to do a whole lot of scrolling. Any advice or additional suggestions you can give would be appreciated. From an extensive search of the archives here it appears I'm not alone in disliking the new version and it would appear I have two options: revert back to an older version (102 seems to be the fave but the actual amount of absurdity involved with trying to do somewhat advanced-level tweaks and re-installation are daunting and dangerous for a mid-level user such as myself) or simply give up on TB entirely and use Gmail, Outlook and my local web-based. It's a pity the TB programming team aren't being more empathetic and responsive to the obvious disappointment of end-users. 'Supernova' certainly appears to be living up to its name...our beloved TB has exploded into an unusable mess. This app that used to work wonderfully for me has suddenly sucked up FAR too much of my time attempting to learn how to do a work-around after an update that really ruined the functionality and convenience it once had for me, and, it would appear, hundreds - if not thousands - of other users. Never thought I'd have to give up on a Mozilla product but here we are. Again, thanks for your most valuable time! Ted </p>",teddybearable,false,0,0

It's fair enough to say it's not a priority, but it's in the right place... Your response seems quite dismissive. </p><p>And where did I ask for a UI for gmvault?

What it will not do is work with compressed files created by your chosen software.  It might be nice for those using the software to have a way to use it with Thunderbird.  But that is something that software developer would provide.   Hence my view your request is misplaced. </p><p>While the English language uses the word compressed to discuss file compression generally,  you are talking about specific algorithms (Gzip)  and implementations.  In some parts specific to your chosen product gmvault, such as the JSON parts of your topic. </p><p>Based on your initial request I had to infer from the information that you supplied that the files used the GZip algorithm.  You then went further and wanted the application to do something with JSON files that were somehow entangled in your use of the term compression.  There are probably a dozen popular in use compression algorithms,  so you request as it stands is both specific and requiring implementation of support for gmvault and the storage formats it uses for files. </p><p>An I dismissive.  No,  I think it would be a great addition to the gmvault  offering.  Do I think it stands a snow balls chance of being supported by Thunderbird's core developers given is will benefit a very very small percentage of Thunderbird user base. No I do not.  But I do not make such decisions,  just make educated guesses.

Usually in this instance the number of mails that are duplicated increases every time Thunderbird connects as new nail arives and the download of the old never completes.  The solution here is to log into the web mail and first delete the contents of the spam folder as usually a malformed mail will also be spam.  Failing that disable the scanning of incoming mail until you actually successfully get you mail and the server has deleted the item that is making the antivirus croak. </p><p>In the case of IMAP,  there are server actions that will see the contents of the server folder downloaded again.  These are usually one off things that are a result of software upgrades on the mail server (or sometimes a new mail server hardware). </p><p>But as I do not know which mail protocol you use I offer the most common scenario for both. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Those connections are a total of connections you have made and that includes accessing via Thunderbird on one computer and via a phone or another computer.

If you then started up Thunderbird again and not switched on phone then connections should be ok. But phones are notorious for not clearing cached connections because many people do not switch them off for good periods of time.  </p><p>It's also worth checking if you have another email client on computer which may still be operating in the background. I have come across someone who previously used Outlook. Unknown to the user, Outlook was still receiving emails - all in the background and this was using up a load of cached connections. They then made sure Outlook did not have the email address set up by removing it and closed it again. </p><p>Also note the connections are specifically to that emails address, so then the question is - could someone else have access to the same account? I came across someone who shared their email address with a partner and they were accessing it on another computer. Could this apply to you? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
