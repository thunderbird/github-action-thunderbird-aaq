Only gave me an even MORE confusing - and larger - layout (see screenshot). The earlier layout allowed me to easily administer my 4 email addresses within a reasonably-sized window without having to do a whole lot of scrolling. Any advice or additional suggestions you can give would be appreciated. From an extensive search of the archives here it appears I'm not alone in disliking the new version and it would appear I have two options: revert back to an older version (102 seems to be the fave but the actual amount of absurdity involved with trying to do somewhat advanced-level tweaks and re-installation are daunting and dangerous for a mid-level user such as myself) or simply give up on TB entirely and use Gmail, Outlook and my local web-based. It's a pity the TB programming team aren't being more empathetic and responsive to the obvious disappointment of end-users. 'Supernova' certainly appears to be living up to its name...our beloved TB has exploded into an unusable mess. This app that used to work wonderfully for me has suddenly sucked up FAR too much of my time attempting to learn how to do a work-around after an update that really ruined the functionality and convenience it once had for me, and, it would appear, hundreds - if not thousands - of other users. Never thought I'd have to give up on a Mozilla product but here we are. Again, thanks for your most valuable time! Ted </p>",teddybearable,false,0,0
