I did as you said, but the text was still jumbled when it was transfered to the e-letter I wanted to send. I ought to mention that this problem began after I attempted to enlarge texts so that I could better see them, due to difficulties with my eyes. I have gone through the enlargement procedures, but see nothing that may be a problem, but I may be missing something. As you may remember ,this may not be the first time. </p><p>Cheers, James S. </p>",Jamesrsamec41,false,0,0

Decided to try regular reboot: One profile tried, opened okay. </p><p>I then backtracked to your instructions. Opened in Safe/networking. Opened (one profile of) TB in troubleshoot. Opened okay. </p><p>Closed TB and launched four profiles (of the five I normally have open). All opened okay. </p><p>Rebooted into regular Windows. Opened all the other apps I normally have open, then relaunched TB. All five profiles opened okay, are working fine. </p><p>The only thing I noticed is that on that first regular reboot, my anti-virus updated itself. I guess we'll never know if that was the problem or part of it. </p><p>I'm guessing I just need to reboot Windows more often, clean out junk in memory. </p><p>Thanks for your help! </p>",mdforme,false,0,0
