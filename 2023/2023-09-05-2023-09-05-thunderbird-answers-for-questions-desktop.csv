Even if you download full copies, you cannot consider an imap account to be a separate independent copy.  If you access gmail webmail via a browser or use a phone and delete emails then you will find as soon as you open Thunderbird and it sychronises with server , all those emails will also auto get deleted from the imap account because they do not exist on server. Downloading full copies is useful because it means you can create a backup of your Thunderbird profile. But because imap folders can only show what is on server, it means it's not truelly an independent copy. Lose emails off server and you've lost them in Thunderbird imap account. If your Anti-Virus messes about with any imap mbox email storage file and clears it of emails, then it may end up wiping a load of emails off server.  To all intents and purposes the server and an imap account are one and the same. </p><p>gmail stores all of your emails (incoming, outgoing, archived) in one folder called 'All Mail'. But gmail knows this is useless and unworkable, so it creates a method of displaying emails in a virtual folder style method. It applies 'labels' which act like a virtual display method. If email in 'All Mail' has a label called 'Inbox' then you see email in the 'Inbox'. The benefit of this means you can display same email in any number of folders. </p><p>So, in Thunderbird, if you can see an imap folder called 'All Mail' then you are just duplicating everything. You do not need to subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>The Gmail quota is set by gmail not Thunderbird. It means how much space you are using on the server for storage of emails and images etc. </p><p>When you delete emails in an imap gmail account, you must have it set up to put the deleted emails into the imap gmail default Trash folder. Then gmail will auto clear any emails that have been in the TRash for 30 days. Gmail will then remove the email from the 'All Mail' folder so it really has been deleted. </p><p>Please make sure you compact folders to remove all traces of previously deleted or moved emails. Right click on folder and select 'compact'. </p><p>If you have a load of photos attached to emails, then sort through them. Save any that you really want - store them in a suitable folder somewhere on your computer - not in Thunderbird.  Then you can delete the attachment or even delete the whole email. </p><p>Gmail quota: <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9312312"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9312312</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

WHY? because it contains aload of strickly MS code which cannot be used by other programs.  So there's no problem copy pasting between MS products eg: MS Word. Microsoft charge people to use their products. They pay/employ coders to create very complicated pieces of software specifically designed to perform designated jobs.  </p><p>When you copy/paste anything from any MS product, you are not just copying a pretty image or text. When you copy something you are also copying a massive bunch of code. Microsoft do not allow non-microsoft companies to use that same code and it's way too complicated for a simple email text system. So parts of the code are easily understood but not all. </p><p>That's why it is usual and normal to attachment documents to emails. This means whatever document you have got saved with data which is in MS Excel or MS Word etc  can be attached to the email and sent to recipient. Then the recipient can open the document using the appropriate program. However, even in these situations, you do have to understand that not everyone uses MS products.  I do not use MS products. I use OpenOffice Calc to open MS Excel documents. It's not always perfect but it's ok. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
