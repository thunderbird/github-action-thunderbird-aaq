Which do you suggest unsubscribing to?  I do have 2 gmail accounts in Thunderbird. One is personal and one is everything else.

WHY? because it contains aload of strickly MS code which cannot be used by other programs.  So there's no problem copy pasting between MS products eg: MS Word. Microsoft charge people to use their products. They pay/employ coders to create very complicated pieces of software specifically designed to perform designated jobs.  </p><p>When you copy/paste anything from any MS product, you are not just copying a pretty image or text. When you copy something you are also copying a massive bunch of code. Microsoft do not allow non-microsoft companies to use that same code and it's way too complicated for a simple email text system. So parts of the code are easily understood but not all. </p><p>That's why it is usual and normal to attachment documents to emails. This means whatever document you have got saved with data which is in MS Excel or MS Word etc  can be attached to the email and sent to recipient. Then the recipient can open the document using the appropriate program. However, even in these situations, you do have to understand that not everyone uses MS products.  I do not use MS products. I use OpenOffice Calc to open MS Excel documents. It's not always perfect but it's ok. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
