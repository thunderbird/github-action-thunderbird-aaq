TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. (and your none the wiser,  and really neither am I.)  I just know it is encryption on the connection to the server.  It is immensely complex under the hood and heavy on the mathematics (it is cryptography after all)  but it just works for you and me.  So it is also simple.

I enabled the 2 extensions, and drag &amp; drop still worked. I exited t-bird &amp; restarted, &amp; drag &amp; drop still worked.
