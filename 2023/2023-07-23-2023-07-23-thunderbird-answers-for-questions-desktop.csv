I don't recall restarting t-bird then, but prob did so. I did not completely reboot laptop. But on booting up (laptop) today, and starting to disable the few extensions I use, I saw no prob. showing the ""add attachment"" pane for drag &amp; drop (which worked). I enabled the 2 extensions, and drag &amp; drop still worked. I exited t-bird &amp; restarted, &amp; drag &amp; drop still worked. Maybe a bored AI bot could have found a temp code error in w11 file mgr somewhere that disappeared on laptop shutdown, but no human would be bothered, I think. </p><pre>I will call the issue ""solved"" here, tomorrow or asap after that, fwiw. </pre>",linusr,false,0,0
