In my old mailprogram, when using HTML, I could compose texts from different sources, then format the text altogether, regardless where they came from and the text appeared as intended at the recipient.  In Thunderbird I never really succeeded with that. When I compose text from different sources in a mail, I find no way to assign the same font size to it, not to speak about font type. When I check by sending mails to myself, the texts appear in different sizes, whatever I do.  A solution at the moment is to compose the mail in a Word processor, format it there and then copy &amp; paste it to the Thunderbird mail window. But that can hardly be the only way.... Is there any way to format mail when the content consists of texts from different sources? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",newsletters2
