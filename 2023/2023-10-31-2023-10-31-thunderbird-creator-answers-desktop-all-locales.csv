I would very much like for my feed to show up to people who subscribe to it with an icon, so if anybody knows why this would be happening or can suggest debugging steps that would be awesome. For all I can tell, from using inspector, my RSS feed is set up just like the feeds that have icons, and my site has its favicon set up in the same way as the sites associated with the feeds that have favicons. </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ask.yourself92

In my old mailprogram, when using HTML, I could compose texts from different sources, then format the text altogether, regardless where they came from and the text appeared as intended at the recipient.  In Thunderbird I never really succeeded with that. When I compose text from different sources in a mail, I find no way to assign the same font size to it, not to speak about font type. When I check by sending mails to myself, the texts appear in different sizes, whatever I do.  A solution at the moment is to compose the mail in a Word processor, format it there and then copy &amp; paste it to the Thunderbird mail window. But that can hardly be the only way.... Is there any way to format mail when the content consists of texts from different sources? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",newsletters2
