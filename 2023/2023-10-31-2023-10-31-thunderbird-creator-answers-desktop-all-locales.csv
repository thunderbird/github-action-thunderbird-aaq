I can no longer download email from my Godaddy Microsoft 365 account.  I use POP.  Prior to the new release it worked fine.  SMPT still works.   </p><p>Are there setting changes I need to make with this release? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Randy </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",randy68

However, I can not get it to load the favicon for my own site. I have used .png and .ico, but I am getting nowhere. I would very much like for my feed to show up to people who subscribe to it with an icon, so if anybody knows why this would be happening or can suggest debugging steps that would be awesome. For all I can tell, from using inspector, my RSS feed is set up just like the feeds that have icons, and my site has its favicon set up in the same way as the sites associated with the feeds that have favicons. </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ask.yourself92
