When I check by sending mails to myself, the texts appear in different sizes, whatever I do.  A solution at the moment is to compose the mail in a Word processor, format it there and then copy &amp; paste it to the Thunderbird mail window. But that can hardly be the only way....

I have several mail accounts that all use IMAP.  For my mail account that syncs to Roadrunner (TWC) mail, local filtering of messages to local folders is no longer syncing with the server.  I have an extensive set of filters that takes mail from my Inbox and moves it to various local folders.  The problem is that the messages are not deleted from my Inbox on the IMAP server which sends Thunderbird into a loop of continually downloading and filtering the same message over and over again.  If I manually delete a message locally, or move into a folder that is mapped to the server, that seems to work properly.  It is only when I move a message to a local folder (manually or with the filters) that the problem occurs. </p><p>I appreciate your insight, and I am happy to supply more information as needed. </p><p>Cheers, Frank </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",flthiel5
