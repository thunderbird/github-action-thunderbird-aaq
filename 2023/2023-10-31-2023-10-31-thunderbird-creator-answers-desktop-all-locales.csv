However, I can not get it to load the favicon for my own site. I have used .png and .ico, but I am getting nowhere. I would very much like for my feed to show up to people who subscribe to it with an icon, so if anybody knows why this would be happening or can suggest debugging steps that would be awesome. For all I can tell, from using inspector, my RSS feed is set up just like the feeds that have icons, and my site has its favicon set up in the same way as the sites associated with the feeds that have favicons. </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ask.yourself92

The mail server responded: you must enable authentication to use this mail server.,"<p>Hi, </p><p>My Thunderbird browser stopped sending emails yesterday. I rang my email provider and logged in to the webmail where I found I couldn't send from there either as my account had been black-listed. This was due to someone else accessing my account from abroad so I changed my email login and it seemed to have fixed the problem. I even sent a test email from Thunderbird to myself which worked OK.  </p><p>This morning the problem has resurfaced on Thunderbird but my webmail is working fine. I got the following error message when i sent an email from Thunderbird: </p><pre>Sending of the message failed. </pre> <p>An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: you must enable authentication to use this mail server. </p><p>This was the same error message that I got yesterday When the account had been black listed.

Example: clicking on a message does not always change it from unread to read. It will show some folders as having unread mail but nothing in there that is unread. Connecting to the server says many times now "" Failed to connect"" and I have to close and restart to get it to connect. </p><p>I never had these issues before I installed the VPN. I have not tried turning off VPN before connecting to see if that makes a difference but would be willing to try that if anyone else has had this problem. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",damcar

I recently installed Thunderbird from the command line in a virtualized Linux environment on a Chromebook. After some difficulties (problematic attempt to import the profile, failed attempt to recover the labels, etc.) I managed to configure and everything seems to work. What absolutely doesn't work is the add-ons section: when I try to install one, at the end of the procedure, Thunderbird freezes and starts again only after restarting the virtual machine. I updated and upgraded the virtualized distro but to no avail. I also tried booting into ""troubleshooting mode"" but, again, Thunderbird crashes. Has anyone encountered similar problems on other Chromebooks? Thank you. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,it,1615013;,mauriziodelladio
