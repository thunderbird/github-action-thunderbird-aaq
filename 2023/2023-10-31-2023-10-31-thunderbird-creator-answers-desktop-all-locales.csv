I recently installed Thunderbird from the command line in a virtualized Linux environment on a Chromebook. After some difficulties (problematic attempt to import the profile, failed attempt to recover the labels, etc.) I managed to configure and everything seems to work. What absolutely doesn't work is the add-ons section: when I try to install one, at the end of the procedure, Thunderbird freezes and starts again only after restarting the virtual machine. I updated and upgraded the virtualized distro but to no avail. I also tried booting into ""troubleshooting mode"" but, again, Thunderbird crashes. Has anyone encountered similar problems on other Chromebooks? Thank you. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,it,1615013;,mauriziodelladio

When I check by sending mails to myself, the texts appear in different sizes, whatever I do.  A solution at the moment is to compose the mail in a Word processor, format it there and then copy &amp; paste it to the Thunderbird mail window. But that can hardly be the only way....

I have several mail accounts that all use IMAP.  For my mail account that syncs to Roadrunner (TWC) mail, local filtering of messages to local folders is no longer syncing with the server.  I have an extensive set of filters that takes mail from my Inbox and moves it to various local folders.  The problem is that the messages are not deleted from my Inbox on the IMAP server which sends Thunderbird into a loop of continually downloading and filtering the same message over and over again.  If I manually delete a message locally, or move into a folder that is mapped to the server, that seems to work properly.  It is only when I move a message to a local folder (manually or with the filters) that the problem occurs. </p><p>I appreciate your insight, and I am happy to supply more information as needed. </p><p>Cheers, Frank </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615325;1615402;1615414;,flthiel5

A pop-up window keeps appearing requiring me to re-sign into my Microsoft account, for some reason, but whenever I press ""continue"" to sign in, nothing happens, and selecting ""cancel"" also has no effect.  I'm already signed in to my Microsoft account on my laptop, anyway, so I don't know why this window keeps appearing, but I assume it's related to the fact that I'm having trouble sending e-mail.  I have to keep closing the Thunderbird program and re-opening it every time I want to send new messages.  This is becoming very tiresome.  I've already tried closing and re-opening the Thunderbird program, but that doesn't fix the problem. I'm working on a Mac, with the latest iOS.
