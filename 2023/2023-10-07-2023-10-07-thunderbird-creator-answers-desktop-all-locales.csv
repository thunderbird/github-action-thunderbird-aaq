There is no ""crash report"", my computer locks up and has to be rebooted to recover. (No Blue Screen, just a lock up. Sometimes the mouse still works, sometimes everything freezes and I have to use the power button on the computer to reboot.) If I can open Task Manager, its appearance is scrambled and it has a strange font.  Prior to the new Thunderbird, I would routinely route photos from applications (such as Faststone, Lightroom) that could export photos directly to an e-mail client. With the new Thunderbird, I have to open Thunderbird and then add them as attachments, otherwise I get the systemwide crash as described above.  It's workable, but I miss not being able to port photos directly to Thunderbird any longer.  Wondering if anyone else has had this problem? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mpuscas

I am on a MacBook Pro, 2015 11,4 running OS 10.13.6 and have never experienced any malfunction (at least that I ever observed).  When the program was evidently updated in late September, I didn't like that some useful tools were deleted from right above the message field, the most troubling to me being the ""tags"" tool, which I use regularly.  Yes, I could activate the ""equivalent"" by checking ""tags"" under the ""Folder Modes"" menu to display them at left, but upon clicking one file to highlight and then clicking one of the tag colors, a sizeable group of files suddenly appears in the messages field and all receive the chosen highlight, whereupon I have to choose them all and choose ""remove all tags"" under the Messages menu. </p><p>HOWEVER, as much as it's been inconvenient to work around the ""tags"" situation, this problem pales in comparison to how my primary e-mail address window now behaves.  When I open Thunderbird and select that profile to open, the window opens ok (including three additional tabs--pdf files previously double-clicked) and the password window drops down as normal; however, when I try to type the password in, no characters appear, and the busy-dots in the tabs keep moving.  Hence, the normal opening of the program and chosen profile produces a hung screen every time, the same way.  Poking around, I did find a work-around as follows:  I open the profile after choosing ""work off line,"" and after waiting for a couple minutes I can cancel the ""off line"" under the file menu, then click the ""download messages"" icon and the password window drops down as normal.  At that point, text can be typed into the password line and from there the program behaves as it always has (receiving and sending messages, copying messages to drafts or sent folder, etc.).  Other potentially relevant information:  Troubled profile is a Spectrum hosted e-mail in central New York State having a ""@twcny.rr.com"" address.  It also happens to be the only one of the five Profiles that needs the password typed in upon opening; I have the others set up to make that unnecessary. </p><p>I would appreciate any insight about these issues you can provide.

TIA for anyone who tries to help me out! </p><p>I'm using a Windows 10 pc.  I tried to move my TB profile from my C: drive to free up space.  My C: is a small SSD.  My D: is a very large conventional drive.  I tried to copy and paste the profile.  I changed the Local Directory in Account Settings/Server Settings to the new D: folder.  It appeared to be working.  A dialog box said it was copying 27,467 files and 99 folders and it took about 10 minutes to complete.  However, when I opened up TB, my Local Folders were almost all missing.  The only folder with any emails in it was the Local Folders/Sent, but it only contained 12 emails from March, 2023 (a mere fraction of what's in that folder).  Very strange. </p><p>When I opened up the new D: folder in Windows Explorer, I could see the original folders, and all the files that are supposed to be in there.  Explorer shows there are 7,625 items (files) in the Inbox.mozmsgs folder and 7,814 items in the sent.mozmsgs folder.  But when I opened up TB, it didn't see these files. </p><p>Also, when I went back to the original C: location, Explorer showed all the files were still there.  So, I concluded that the Copy and Paste routine worked, but for some reason TB could not access the files, even though they apparently had been transferred. </p><p>So then I decided I better delete the profile folder on the C: drive, since I had verified that all the folders were now in place on the D: drive.  I thought TB might be getting confused by having files in different places.  But, apparently, while deleting the files on the C: drive, I must have deleted some critical files, because when I now opened TB, it wanted me to create a new email account.  I could not find my original account, so I created a new account using my existing credentials.   </p><p>I feel like I'm almost there, but I still can't read my original Inbox or Sent folders, even though I see them in Explorer.  I went back thru Account Settings again and found that the address for the Local Folders/Message Storage was still shown as the original C: location, even though I had changed the Server Settings/Message Storage to the new D: location.  I then tried to change the C: location to the new D: location, but I got a dialog box saying ""A parent directory of the directory specified in the local directory setting is already used by the ""XXX"" account.  Please pick a different directory."" </p><p>This Message Storage address crops up in two places under Account Settings.  Seems redundant to me.  I am now at the end of the road and have no idea where to go.  I'm hoping someone can guide me thru this issue.  By the way, I've used TB for many years and have always liked it.  I guess Copy and Paste was not the right way to move the files off my C: drive! </p><p>Again, thanks for any help! </p><p>Tom. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1609147;1609167;1609285;1609345;1609346;1609347;1609348;1609446;1609449;1609455;1609552;,AccordionTom
