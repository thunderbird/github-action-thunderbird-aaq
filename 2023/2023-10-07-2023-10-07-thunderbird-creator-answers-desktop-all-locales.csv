On these accounts, Thunderbird transfers incoming mail directly to the All Mail box- but not ALL of the mail.  Some of the messages manage to get grabbed by the filters and manipulated correctly. <strong>THIS ONLY HAPPENS WITH GMAIL ACCOUNTS</strong> </p><p>As best as I can tell, I cannot set up filters to affect the All Mail box - only the main Inbox. </p><p>Help </p><p>Thunderbird Version: 115.2.3 (64-bit) Windows 10 Pro Version:  22H2  OS Build 19045.3488 (64 Bit) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1608918;,cottonadealec

Many of the graphical elements are hard to see.  e.g. the arrows that show that a message is reply, etc.  Is there any way to increase the contrast?   </p><p>Searches pointed to a Theme Font and Size Changer extension but neither of the two versions shows as compatible. </p><p>I also looked for themes optimized for accessibility but didn't find any.

I am running Thunderbird version 115.3.1, recently upgraded to. With the current upgrade a number of visual features changed and I can feel the more streamlined and faster nature of Thunderbird; however, something changed that is causing me much grief. </p><p>When I go to move an email from my inbox to any other folder, the folders are opening way to quickly! When I drag an email to drop it in a folder and am going down my list of folders, every folder I even touch - OPENS UP TO REVEAL SUBFOLDERS. I have a large folder hierarchy so as I am dragging an email I used to be able to go down the folder list and drop the email without anything opening. Now, if the folder I want is 15 folders down the list, I open 15 folders getting there.  </p><p>This is a new problem as of the last update that significantly changed the visual interface. Is there a setting I can change to delay for a couple of seconds, that a folder opens to show subfolders when the mouse touches that folder? If not can this option PLEASE be added. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Steve Brown 14-year Thunderbird user. </p><p>PS - I am otherwise happy with the new interface. The font size is smaller but I am expecting that is adjustable, just need to figure it out. I really like the flow of the new interface. I miss the ""Get Mail"" words up where the new get mail icon is now. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",steve570
