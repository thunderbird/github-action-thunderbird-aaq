I have a large folder hierarchy so as I am dragging an email I used to be able to go down the folder list and drop the email without anything opening. Now, if the folder I want is 15 folders down the list, I open 15 folders getting there.  </p><p>This is a new problem as of the last update that significantly changed the visual interface. Is there a setting I can change to delay for a couple of seconds, that a folder opens to show subfolders when the mouse touches that folder? If not can this option PLEASE be added. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Steve Brown 14-year Thunderbird user. </p><p>PS - I am otherwise happy with the new interface.
