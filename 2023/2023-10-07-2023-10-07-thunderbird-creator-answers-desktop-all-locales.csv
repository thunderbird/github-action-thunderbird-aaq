Now there only seems to be a FORWARD button which gives the default option as determined by the settings. I know I can right click and FORWARD AS but AFAICS that only works when the message is closed. The only button I can see in CUSTOMISE TOOLBARS is the single option FORWARD. There seems to be no FORWARD AS button. </p><p>I would love to have back that choice from within the message that I had before.

There is no ""crash report"", my computer locks up and has to be rebooted to recover. (No Blue Screen, just a lock up. Sometimes the mouse still works, sometimes everything freezes and I have to use the power button on the computer to reboot.) If I can open Task Manager, its appearance is scrambled and it has a strange font.  Prior to the new Thunderbird, I would routinely route photos from applications (such as Faststone, Lightroom) that could export photos directly to an e-mail client. With the new Thunderbird, I have to open Thunderbird and then add them as attachments, otherwise I get the systemwide crash as described above.  It's workable, but I miss not being able to port photos directly to Thunderbird any longer.  Wondering if anyone else has had this problem? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mpuscas

Unfortunately Thunderbird does not (for years) support that feature. It seems quite easy to implement and there seems also be request for it but Thunderbird never added it.  So I ask again to add it. What is the reason Thunderbird is not willing to do so? Is it really that complex that it cannot be done? Why should such a basic feature only be available by using an add-on? But add-ons - as we see now - often become disabled because Thunderbird redesigns its interfaces with new versions.  Why does Thunderbird put so much effort in big changes while there are small features that would be easy to implement and make users happy? </p>,customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",lysathor

I am running Thunderbird version 115.3.1, recently upgraded to. With the current upgrade a number of visual features changed and I can feel the more streamlined and faster nature of Thunderbird; however, something changed that is causing me much grief. </p><p>When I go to move an email from my inbox to any other folder, the folders are opening way to quickly! When I drag an email to drop it in a folder and am going down my list of folders, every folder I even touch - OPENS UP TO REVEAL SUBFOLDERS. I have a large folder hierarchy so as I am dragging an email I used to be able to go down the folder list and drop the email without anything opening. Now, if the folder I want is 15 folders down the list, I open 15 folders getting there.  </p><p>This is a new problem as of the last update that significantly changed the visual interface. Is there a setting I can change to delay for a couple of seconds, that a folder opens to show subfolders when the mouse touches that folder? If not can this option PLEASE be added. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Steve Brown 14-year Thunderbird user. </p><p>PS - I am otherwise happy with the new interface. The font size is smaller but I am expecting that is adjustable, just need to figure it out. I really like the flow of the new interface. I miss the ""Get Mail"" words up where the new get mail icon is now. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1608989;,steve570
