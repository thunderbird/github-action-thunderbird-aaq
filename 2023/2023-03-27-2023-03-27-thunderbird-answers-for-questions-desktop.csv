So yes, if using drag and drop method the horizontal view is important at the moment. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:All I was trying to do  was either import the corresponding .csv files into my lists. </em> </p><p>As previously mentioned....When advising about importing the .csv files - I suggested you import *.csv files directly into the 'Personal Address Book'. NOTE: If you add them to the existing 'Personal Address Book' - then you can create Mailing Lists as sub lists to the personal Address Book - then drag and drop selected contacts into the various Mailng Lists. </p><p>If you have followed this advise then you would not have all those imported address books and  you would also easily drag and drop into mailing list.  </p><p>It would have been so much easier for you if you had followed this advise. I have no idea why you chose to ignore this information. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:When I tried to copy and paste the separate address book file contacts into my list files I was unable to do so.</em> </p><p>Correct, as I already mentioned ...you have to import into the address book that has the sub-mailing lists. So, that means if you imported the .csv files and set up as separate address books  (It appears you decided to import as completely separate address books) then you would have to drag and drop the contacts from the imported address books eg: Family into the address book that has the sub- mailing lists - which in your case is  'Personal Address Book'.   </p><p>Currently, you cannot drag and drop contacts from an unconnnected address book into a Mailing list of another address book.  </p><p>As already mentioned...You cannot import anything directly into a mailing list because the mailing list is not a separate file. It is like a display of filtered contacts - it's a virtual list.  The contacts have to be imported into the address book that contains the mailing lists. </p><p>There are some bugs that relate to this situation which I'm hoping will get some serious attention before the next big upgrade as fixing them would make using the address book and mailing lists much more convenient. </p><p>Bugs: Drag and drop of contacts to a mailing list in another address book no longer works See bug&nbsp;: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1782397"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1782397</a> </p><p>I have also posted a bug requesting enhancement so it becomes easier to move/copy into list perhaps via right click menu option. </p><p>Contact right click menu has no option to add to a mailing list, or move/copy to address book See bug: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1782397"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1782397</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

Meaning it would be possible to read emails even if you went into Offline mode.  it's also useful if you need to create a backup of emails. This synchronise x number of days is not limiting the download of message headers. </p><p><strong>Senario 1:</strong> If you selected 'keep messages in all folders....' meaning all folders could download full copies AND you clicked on 'Advanced' button and ALL folders were selected then you would get downloaded full copies of all emails in all the folders selected. But if you also selected 'Sync last 60 days of emails', then only the last 60 days of emails would get fully downloaded and all the others would only get headers downloaded. </p><p>So you will see Message List showing all your emails, but those older than 60 days would only be headers. </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>Senario 2:</strong> If you unchecked /did not select 'keep messages in all folders....' and you clicked on 'Advanced..' button to make sure NO folders were selected; it means it is not possible to download full copies of any emails, so everything downloaded is just headers. Then nothing is going to synchronised. In this situation, the 'Sync last x days of emails' option is rendered useless because no folders are being synchronised.  </p><p><strong>Senario 3:</strong> If you unchecked /did not select 'keep messages in all folders....' AND you clicked on 'Advanced..' button  and selected/checked specific folder like 'Inbox', but did not select any other folder.  Then the 'Inbox' folder will get synchronised to download full copies and all other folders would not get synchronised, so will only download headers. </p><p>In this situation, the 'Sync last 60 days of emails' option will now only synchronise the last 60 days of emails that are in the 'Inbox' folder. All older emails in Inbox would only download headers. </p><p><br> Basically, if you tell Thunderbird not to download any message bodies and you have not selected to allow full download, you can't limit the no. of message bodies to be downloaded to 'the most recent x days' because no message bodies are being downloaded. You will still see a list of all emails. </p><p>Downloading only the headers means a huge amount of space is saved yet it allows access to read the email. It would get retrieved from server on demand and stored in a temp cache to faciliate viewing. </p><p><br> </p><p>Hope this helps to clarify what is occuring. </p><p>More info: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The index and journal on the drive becomes somewhat unwieldy as the file numbers get very large. I have seen suggestions that degraded performance can be seen on NTFS on p[latter disks with as few as one thousand files in a folder.   I also modified the file properties in the windows file explorer to remove the profile folder from windows search indexing entirely, not only from within Thunderbird.  This also reduced random hangs.

No real issues there. The HD seems to be fine. I have 32 GB RAM and am running 3 hard disks (desktop computer). The main ""applications"" drive is 1TB, and the other two are 3TB each. No problems with them. I use one for backup, and the other for most of my data from various programs. I run programs (including TB) from my main C: drive (either in ""Program Files"", or ""Program Files (86)"" ). My Thunderbird data is all stored on the main (C:) drive. </p><p>I did NOT, in fact, see the ""rebuild global database"". I renamed the ""global-messages-db"" file to "".OLD"" . It was 100MB in size. I restarted TB and it created a new db file, which is now 1.2MB. So, a significant difference there. And yes, things seemed a lot speedier. But after a few minutes, it froze again. I've restarted a few times, rebooted the computer, but it's now freezing again, especially if I attempt to write an email. I've opened the Activity Manager, but it shows nothing going on.  </p><p>My sense is that it's searching/scanning emails and files somewhere, but I can't get a handle on that. I have made sure the Windows Search is not connect to TB (or anything else.... I've disabled it).  </p><p>@Matt: when you say you deleted 100,000 files, exactly where did you find them? I can find my emails, folders, etc within my profile, but I'm not sure whether they're necessary or just copies. I've been trying to figure this out. I have my ""Local Folders"", with all the subfolders, and my mail is stored there. But I also have ""All Mail"", and that contains the same set of subfolders. I have reset all my email accounts to point to the ""Local Folders"", but I don't know if the program still scans ""All Mail"". As far as I can tell, Gmail uses that to sync, but I certainly could be wrong about that.  </p><p>Also, I just discovered that the file used to launch TB is in the ""x86"" Program Files (32 bit) folder:  ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe""  There is no folder for Mozilla TB or Thunderbird in my Program Files (64 bit) folder.

During the 2.1s places-opening jank, there's nothing happening in the TB processes; we're just calling CreateFileW to open a file, and it's taking two seconds to come back to us. That's....awful. *Something* about disk access is really, really slow. </p><p>The font-related jank, then, is similar: we make a simple API call such as IDWriteFontFamily1::GetFont, but this causes DirectWrite to open the underlying font file, and if that takes seconds instead of milliseconds, we're stuck.  </p><p>So the question is why these file-access operations are so painfully slow, and I don't know what the answer to that is. Corruption? Contention? Malware? </p><p>I wonder if the user has some kind of virus-protection or similar ""security"" software, or some system-administration tools, that could be causing every disk access to be intercepted and checked -- so that when we try to open the places DB, for example, something steps in and blocks that call until it has scanned the entire file. And likewise when we cause each font file to be opened -- even though we're only reading a small amount of metadata, maybe each of the entire multi-megabyte CJK font files gets painstakingly scanned by.....something. </p><p>The other thing that occurs to me is to wonder if TB is subject to some sort of ""protection"" like this because it's not ""trusted"" in the same way as other Windows applications?

I have a few things to finish, and I don't want to take down my computer until I get them done. Probably in the next couple of days though. Will report back here after I've migrated Windows. Thanks again.  --john </p>",johnegenes,false,0,0

Here's what I've done:  </p><p>I ran chkdsk for the umpteenth time and this time, it said I had 4 bad sectors on my main hard drive. I ran various software apps (EaseUS, AOMEI, Seagate, Windows Disk Mgr, etc), but could not fix the bad sectors. I had an extra 2TB hard drive so I formatted it and cloned my C: drive to it. That took a LONG time. None of the programs could do it successfully, and all failed after getting to about 96% finished. This was maddening and very time consuming.  Finally, I was able to do a sector-by-sector clone using good old Windows Disk Manager. Once I had migrated my Windows 10 and everything to the new drive, I made it the C: drive and all was good. I backed up my original C: drive to an extrernal drive, just in case.  My computer has 3 drives on it, so I swapped a few things around and managed to get all three reformatted and running smoothly, with all my data intact and backed up.  </p><p>And Thunderbird seems to be back to its original self, running smooth and quick! This is a real blessing, as I have tried a few email clients as alternatives, but none of them did what TB does for me. So, I'm happy again.  </p><p>I wouldn't have thought that just 4 bad sectors on a 1TB hard drive would have wreaked that much havoc, but they must have been in a critical spot, because they certainly caused a lot of headaches. I'm still not sure why they didn't show up all the other times I ran chkdsk, but at this point I don't care.  </p><p>Thanks again for all the help and suggestions.  </p><p>best, --john </p>",johnegenes,false,0,0

Until the last couple of times, it always gave me a clean bill of health. I ran chkdsk from a DOS (cmd) prompt, which then required me to reboot. Then, it would run through its paces and, finally, launch Windows. The Wininit log file never showed anything bad until the last couple of times. I'm guessing those 4 bad sectors were in a critical spot on the hard drive, because it would not let me repair them and work around them.  --je </p>",johnegenes,false,0,0
