When I reset the computer, all programs (except TH) print normally, until TH hangs with an attachment (interestingly, TH displays printers with a few attachments and suddenly stops with a random one). I uninstalled all printer drivers and TH itself, reset the print settings in TH, then installed TH and one printer, nothing helped. I can't go back to an older version of TH because after copying the profile files, TH won't start.
