I could neither read or write messages.  I've set up Thunderbird using the ports specified by my ISP (<a href=""http://lmi.net"" rel=""nofollow"">lmi.net</a>) without fixing the problem.  My provider says that I may be overloading the server for some reason, and the mail server is blocking my ISP address under the assumption that the overloading is a spam attack. </p><p>I've discovered that there is another generic mail client on my PC that was apparently installed when I upgraded to Windows 10.  I remember being asked for my email address when I installed Windows 10, but never thought they were asking for client email installation.   </p><p>Have you run across any problems like this? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",albanyguy

Upon reinstall, discovered emails from inbox, sent mail, subfolders were lost. In simple terms, can all of the years and years of emails from the AOL account (inbox, sent mail, subfolders) be retrieved and visible on TB again? Can go back to my computer support network for assistance but would like to give it a try myself. Novice. Thank you in advance for kind words and step by step instructions for dummies.
