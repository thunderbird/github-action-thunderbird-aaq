The ones that are business accounts have emails that are probably years old. I've discovered that my mobile data is being used up by my email. </p><p>So my question is: When I download new emails, is it just the new email that is downloaded, or is it an updated file with the new email added to it? </p><p>As said, with the amount of emails that are stored would mean a full email file download would be extremely large. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",BigDingus

Podle Vaší nápovědi jsem si v Nastevení- Soukromí a zabezpečení zaklikla ""Povolit vzdálený obsah ve zprávách"", ale i po tomto ""zakliknutí"" mi stále chodí email ( z jedné konkrétní adresy) bez zobrazených obrázků. Používáme email od ""gmail"" a od seznamu. Když si email otevřu přímo v google a nebo na seznamu, tak je email vč. obrázků. Tak že to mám zablokované v Thunderbird, ale nemohu najít kede. </p><p>Moc děkuji. Přeji krásný den.
