When I reset the computer, all programs (except TH) print normally, until TH hangs with an attachment (interestingly, TH displays printers with a few attachments and suddenly stops with a random one). I uninstalled all printer drivers and TH itself, reset the print settings in TH, then installed TH and one printer, nothing helped. I can't go back to an older version of TH because after copying the profile files, TH won't start. I guess maybe a format would help, but I don't want to do it this way and I'm asking for some solutions.

And yes, I know OAuth 2 key is needed for email client fetch .... that key was set and has been working for a long time too.  Other details: - On fetch start, a brief window pops up and disappears so quickly I can't read it or respond if response is necessary... but it looks like the window presented when there's a problem with the password or other aspect of session start up. -I updated my iMac to the latest version of BigSur just before this started happening - but since that OS update, I do not have this problem with other email accounts for which I use POP protocol. -I am aware that MSN has ""improved"" its Outlook service ... anyone know if this has caused a widespread problem for Thunderbird users (or even other 3rd party client side apps)? -I have poked around in help in the online MSN Outlook support area, to no avail. </p><p>Can someone in the Mozilla community help me? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dncollins
