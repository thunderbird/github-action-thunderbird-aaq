This means I have no means of saving them as .ics file to import into my Google calendar and have to create my own entry, often losing important information.

There is an export tool on the webmail site, and that seems to go fine - it creates a .vcf file. If I open that document, it has all of my contacts there. Then I open Thunderbird and use the import tool - that appears to go fine, but after I hit ""finish"" and look in the contacts, there are no addresses. I have shut down and rebooted, closed Thunderbird and re-opened it, tried all of this several times, but nothing changes. </p><p>I searched on here for threads on this and found things from 2015 saying that a .vcf file is for individual addresses only, but I'm thinking that must have changed?

Maybe I've explained myself in a not so clear way? I'm going to try again, hoping to getting better luck this time around. Here it goes. </p><p>Big profile backup is out of control when restored. I'm on OSX. </p><p>Backup is a normal zip file of the profile folder, created on the same machine. </p><p>I know in theory, I should just create a new profile, quit TB, and then replace the contents of the newly created profile with my backup's contents. Next time I start it up, I should see my profiles' content. </p><p>However, that doesn't happen. And this is what I've seen after several dozen (?) times attempting it: </p><p>[list] [*] the first time starting after the restore, it takes a while to start. Then I'm shown a series INBOXes named with '-n' at the end, for an arbitrary (?) number of n. Such as 'INBOX', 'INBOX-1', ..., 'INBOX-25', some 3 to 5, others 40 or 50. </p><p>The last, according to this numbering, appears to be the one that contains the actual Inbox with messages. This happens in almost all accounts in the profile (about two thirds). I can also see several 'INBOX-n.msf' files (1kb) in the filesystem, with one corresponding final 'INBOX-n' file. This, as one could guess at this point, was not part of the original backup. </p><p><br> [*] after restarting TB, it takes even longer, and I lose access to all other folders. Everything below the account name disappears, except for the 'INBOX' that remains listed as a folder in the left pane, and when clicked on, shows no messages, none. For every account. </p><p><br> [*] every subsequent restart is then very quick, and I don't get access to the folders anymore. Even the maimed access the first time around seems now to be gone. There are only the empty INBOX folders, again and again.<a href=""/list"" rel=""nofollow"">/list</a> </p><p><br> Profile folder size goes from ~24GB to ~16GB throughout this, though in TB's folder pane, it looks as empty as it could be. </p><p>I've repeated this dozens of times, with two different profiles which lead to the same result. </p><p>I might have tried a restore once on Windows machine to test it out, a long time ago, which I think went smoothly. So I can't vouch for it now, but I'd guess the problem is in OSX. Which is a problem, because it's what I'm using. </p><p>Am I doing something wrong? Does it have anything to do with permissions? What can I do to get this restore working? Anyone experienced the same on OSX? </p><p>I feel silly going through the trouble of backing up weekly, don't feel safe at all by failing to restore these backups. When I need the backup, I don't think I'm going to have one. I've had a few scares, and one of these days, it's bound to happen. </p><p>Below are the pictures when I restore this backup in OSX, in the first run it shows a corrupted folder structure, and from then on I have no access to the emails anymore. </p><p>Would appreciate any help with this long running issue. </p><p><br> Here's the pictures of the situation: </p><p>[b]First Run:<a href=""/b"" rel=""nofollow"">/b</a> </p><p>[img]<a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jqs03d7fdcna1.png?width=324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ddc6a11b9da6d0413b8a81921bb3e618879b5f73"" rel=""nofollow"">https://preview.redd.it/jqs03d7fdcna1.png?width=324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ddc6a11b9da6d0413b8a81921bb3e618879b5f73</a><a href=""/img"" rel=""nofollow"">/img</a> </p><p><br> [b]Second Run:<a href=""/b"" rel=""nofollow"">/b</a> </p><p>[img]<a href=""https://preview.redd.it/mvqtvi5hdcna1.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f44319dd7f06fa25df4a5cb3d931e103f59b2eeb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://preview.redd.it/mvqtvi5hdcna1.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f44319dd7f06fa25df4a5cb3d931e103f59b2eeb</a><a href=""/img"" rel=""nofollow"">/img</a> </p><p>EDIT: Attached pictures of files on both profiles, profile 1 and profile 2. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1572474;1572518;1572550;1572774;1572850;1573284;1573304;1573573;1573666;1573953;1574014;1574063;1574110;1574140;1574141;1574142;1574147;1574896;,hotpink8
