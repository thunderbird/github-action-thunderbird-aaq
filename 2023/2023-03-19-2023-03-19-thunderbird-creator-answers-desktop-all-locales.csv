I am a long-time Thunderbird user who is used to the old screen and organization and I want to find out how I can get the old screen and organization back.  I've attached a screenshot so you can see which version of Thunderbird is causing me so much trouble.  Why change the traditional  top-of-the-screen menu:  (File, View,Tools, Help)?  It was so logical and so easy.  The movable mish-mash that exists now is driving me crazy. </p><p>For instance, I used an app under Tools that presorted certain emails and routed them to assigned folders.  Not only has the sorting gone wrong, I haven't got the faintest idea where the app is?  The emails that were once successfully sorted and rerouted are not working.  And they're turning up as read in random folders. </p><p>Firefox also changes things that don't need to be changed, but my experience there is that an add-on or extenstion soon turns up that restores the features that users like. </p><p>In my preliminary search on my problem, there was not one article.  In fact, my search came back with the message that no article appeared to match my query.  I guess I must be the only person that is not happy with this interface. </p><p>Is there a way I can get the old version back?  I'm sorry if I seem grouchy, but I am 83 and not being able to find what I need and what I used to have makes me a tad tetchy. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1571470;1571478;1571482;,bdjim

I can't remember if I did this with this email.  But if I did not I went to the SENT folder and moved the email to my saved folder.   I wanted to open this email to make sure of what I had sent in the last email to this person.  When I opened it all I saw was code, screenshot attached. In looking at this email with notepad I discovered that the dates are from April 2018.   I assume all is lost. Is there anyway to resolve this? Each week I save the profile.  I have another PC that does not have email installed.  I installed Thunderbird, recovered my saved profile with the date of 03/01/23, and imported it to Thunderbird.  I found the email in question in my INBOX and it was corrupt.  It appears that it is showing information from a April 2018 email.  That email is in the INBOX and it displays correctly.  Is there anything that can be done to recover the February 28, 2023 email?  What I don't understand is that the Subject, Correspondence, and Date are correct in Thunderbird. The good news is that I know my backup works. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ConeWH

I get 30-40 per day every single day, day after day after day.   The spammer is clever and has managed to elude being caught by the Bayesian filtering of both Gmail and Thunderbird so they pretty much all end up in my 'Inbox'.  ( he is spoofing the sending domain with 128 random characters so no two messages are ever seen to be from the same sender).  Very frustrating!!  But there is a possible way to trap and discard this trash **IF** I can use Unix style regular expression wild cards in my filter rules. </p><pre> My question is this --- when setting up a new email filter in Thunderbird, what (if any) wild cards are supported in the ""Sender Contains"" argument field?  For example can I use "".........."" to match any 10 character string?   I need to be able to specify the number of characters I want to match, so something like ""*"" would not work since it matches without regard to the number of characters.   I need to specify how many characters are to be matched. </pre> <p>I can supply details as to why this is needed, but I won't bore you with the details unless you ask. </p><p>Thanks for any input. </p><pre> John Moses </pre>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1571511;,carswellb58
