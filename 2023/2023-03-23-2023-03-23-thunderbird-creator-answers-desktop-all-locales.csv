Ho provato l'opzione ordina per stato, tuttavia le mail non lette sono contrassegnate in 2 modi: ovvero ""nuove"" se appena arrivate o ""non lette"", e a causa di questa suddivisione queste due categorie rimangono agli opposti (credo unicamente per ordine alfabetico, preciso inoltre che il tag ""non letta"" viene visualizzato come campo vuoto). Se qualcuno conoscesse come modificare queste opzioni o magari un'estensione da installare gliene sarei grato. Grazie Beniamino </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,it,"",beniamino88

I'm working in offline mode. The old PC runs on Windows, the new on Debian Linux. </p><p>All of the email addresses show up, but NONE of the emails are displayed. The folders appear as empty. Interestingly enough, I can search among the emails though using Ctrl-K: upon entering a keyword, emails containing it are found and enlisted, however, I cannot read the full email: clicking on them leads to an error message saying email cannot be loaded since I'm working offline. Ctrl-Shift-K does not work. </p><p>I have tried the same process on a different PC running on Windows: here at least some of the emails are displayed, but not all of them, although I have followed exactly the same procedure as before, as described above. </p><p>I'm out of ideas. What could be the problem? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1572218;1572248;,NemFontos

I need to recheck the information and they have become unreadable and seem to not be related to the original topic.  As this involves some payments to Paypal, I would like to be able to resolve the problem. Thank you </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1572219;,aviva172
