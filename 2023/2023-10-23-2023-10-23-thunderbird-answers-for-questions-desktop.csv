Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.

(You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

The product has scaned your system and can find nothing.  So what exactly is it ever going to find leaving a system it has certified clean? </p> <blockquote> Don't let your anti-virus software scan attachments. </blockquote> <p>An unfortunate fact of life is what antivirus products excel at is corrupting attachments in email.  To scan them, they need to; </p> <ul><li> open the mail </li><li> detect the attachment boundaries in the text of the email </li><li> Extract the mime encoded text representation of the attachment from mime encoding back into it's original binary format. </li><li> Scan the resultant file object they have decoded  </li><li> and for some reason I fail to understand they then try and put humpty together again.  Poorly. </li></ul> <p>If you have no attachment scanning; </p> <ul><li> You select the attachment to save or view. </li><li> Thunderbird extracts the mime encoded text representation of the file. </li><li> Decodes it and writes it to disk. </li></ul> <p>At this time any antivirus product worth it existence will scan the new file,  be it in the temp folder or some other saved location and stamp on an virus, long before it can be executed. </p><p>Why scan something that will be scanned before you can access it,  except to slow down you fetch of mail? </p> <blockquote> Don't let your anti-virus software intercept your secure connection to the server. </blockquote> <p>Given that most of the scanning of secure connections uses man-in-the-middle hacking and self signed certificates issued on the fly by the antivirus product,  you best really trust them to not be malicious and to not ever be hacked or infected. Despite the fear sold with malware detecting software and email is a text file.  SO is fundamentally inert in transit.  It is what is done with that text file upon receipt that can lead to issues.  Most modern mail application run scripts in the email body.  Thunderbird does not.  It renders the HTML in the body and even then certain HTML statements are ignored for security reasons.  Thunderbird can and will show you the sanitized HTML without ever reaching out to download linked malware via scripts. As attachments only become more than glorified text when you try and do something with them,  they to are safe while at rest in your inbox. So really this scanning caper of time consuming and risky in it's own way without any real tangible benefits that I can see. </p> <blockquote> Remove any add-ons your anti-virus software may have installed in Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately none of the anti virus programs that inject their garbage into Thunderbird respect the addons environment.  Some do not even bother to have an entry in Thunderbird for the user to disable their offering when everything goes pear shaped,  usually every time there is a major upgrade.  So yes,  you will find support folk suggesting that you disable the virus like approach of modifying applications with untested code changes. </p> <blockquote> So basically remove all virus protection??? </blockquote> <p>Not at all.  Just reigning in some of the excesses that the security vendors like to sell to people in their usual manner of selling fear.  I personally use Microsoft Defender, it has no email scanner of any sort.  It just monitors the hard disk for changes,  something that will occur when you get mail! and when attachments are acted upon. </p><p><br> </p> <em><p>johnlerrington1 <a href=""#answer-1613237"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> but I cant see how to correlate the account number with the account settings in server settings. </blockquote> <p>It is a little tricky,  and needs you to jump through some hoops in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">Config Editor</a>. </p><p>Open the config editor and look for mail.account.account14.identities.  This will give a reference to at least one identity usually in the form idXX with the XX being a number.  Perhaps it will be id14 for that account, but it just as easily may not as each account can really have an unlimited number of identities associated with it. Now search for that Id number in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/config-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">Config Editor</a> and the assorted returned values for the Identity will make it clear which account the number is.

Do not enable the option 'Display attachments inline' as a default setting - this is something you may enable if and when you need it and then only for email you know are legit. Do not click on links before you have checked they are correct - always check where they are really pointing to first - hover over link and look in Status Bar for the real link. Do not click and open attachments unless you really know who they came from. Don't let your curiosity get the better of you.
