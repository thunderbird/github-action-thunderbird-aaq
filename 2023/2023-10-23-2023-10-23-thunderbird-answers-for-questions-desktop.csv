So providing you do not switch that off then any image of any size containg remote content - including tiny pixel size things you could not see do not work. Do not enable the option 'Display attachments inline' as a default setting - this is something you may enable if and when you need it and then only for email you know are legit. Do not click on links before you have checked they are correct - always check where they are really pointing to first - hover over link and look in Status Bar for the real link. Do not click and open attachments unless you really know who they came from. Don't let your curiosity get the better of you. I get loads of nefarious people pretending stuff like here is the invoice when I know it's just not true.  Delete the email and then compact the folder and the bad stuff is nuked. </p><p>All of the above is just basic good practise. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The product has scaned your system and can find nothing.  So what exactly is it ever going to find leaving a system it has certified clean? </p> <blockquote> Don't let your anti-virus software scan attachments. </blockquote> <p>An unfortunate fact of life is what antivirus products excel at is corrupting attachments in email.  To scan them, they need to; </p> <ul><li> open the mail </li><li> detect the attachment boundaries in the text of the email </li><li> Extract the mime encoded text representation of the attachment from mime encoding back into it's original binary format. </li><li> Scan the resultant file object they have decoded  </li><li> and for some reason I fail to understand they then try and put humpty together again.

Despite the fear sold with malware detecting software and email is a text file.  SO is fundamentally inert in transit.  It is what is done with that text file upon receipt that can lead to issues.  Most modern mail application run scripts in the email body.  Thunderbird does not.  It renders the HTML in the body and even then certain HTML statements are ignored for security reasons.  Thunderbird can and will show you the sanitized HTML without ever reaching out to download linked malware via scripts. As attachments only become more than glorified text when you try and do something with them,  they to are safe while at rest in your inbox. So really this scanning caper of time consuming and risky in it's own way without any real tangible benefits that I can see. </p> <blockquote> Remove any add-ons your anti-virus software may have installed in Thunderbird. </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately none of the anti virus programs that inject their garbage into Thunderbird respect the addons environment.  Some do not even bother to have an entry in Thunderbird for the user to disable their offering when everything goes pear shaped,  usually every time there is a major upgrade.  So yes,  you will find support folk suggesting that you disable the virus like approach of modifying applications with untested code changes. </p> <blockquote> So basically remove all virus protection??? </blockquote> <p>Not at all.  Just reigning in some of the excesses that the security vendors like to sell to people in their usual manner of selling fear.  I personally use Microsoft Defender, it has no email scanner of any sort.  It just monitors the hard disk for changes,  something that will occur when you get mail! and when attachments are acted upon. </p><p><br> </p> <em><p>johnlerrington1 <a href=""#answer-1613237"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> but I cant see how to correlate the account number with the account settings in server settings. </blockquote> <p>It is a little tricky,  and needs you to jump through some hoops in the <a href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=config+editor"" class=""new"" title=""Page does not exist."" rel=""nofollow"">config editor</a>. </p><p>Open the config editor and look for mail.account.account14.identities.

However, the recent update to 115 isn't helpful (or are there still bugs with basic functionality now, months later?) For example, the really annoying display of the first line of an email in the list of emails should be only opt-in - currently it seems the user can't even opt-out (in spite of claims it should be possible). In today's (5 Jan 2024) new install of Thunderbird (115.6.0) on a newly installed OS (Linux Mint 21.2, 64-bit) there is 1) NO Table View anywhere in the menus 2) NO icon next to the Quick Filter button 3) NO card view in a drop-down which can be de-selected. In short no method to get rid of that annoying first line (it's wasteful too). The only solution appears to be to go back to the previous version (or choose another email client). We do admire and are very thankful to those fantastic people who write Thunderbird, but it is super annoying when things which have worked so well for ages are suddenly changed and there is no clear, intuitive way to opt-out of really annoying changes. </p>",mgapes,false,0,0
