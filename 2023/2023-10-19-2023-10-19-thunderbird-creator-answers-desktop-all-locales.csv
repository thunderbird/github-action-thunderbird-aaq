The print menu only selects for ""Save to PDF""; all of the other installed printers are not available.  For awhile, restarting my PC restored the printer list, but ""Save PDF"" remained the default.  Now, only the ""Save to PDF"" is available as a printer.  This happens in both Windows 10 and Windows 11.  (All of the available installed printers appear in the print menus of Firefox, Microsoft Office programs, and Adobe Acrobat.) </p><p>2. When opening Thunderbird, several tabs automatically appear above the list of messages that say ""Thunderbird privacy notice.""  These can deleted manually, but they reappear each time Thunderbird is opened. </p><p>3.  Messages marked as Junk email are not automatically moved to the Junk folder, despite our settings to do this by default.  When we manually try to collectively move the marked messages to the Junk folder, we get a message that Thunderbird is unable to write to the folder and that we need to compact our folders.  We have done so several times and the problem and message still persists.  We can click on the Junk icon for each marked message and transfer each to the Junk folder individually, but this often results in finding duplicate messages in the Junk folder.  Fortunately, we routinely empty the folder; the problem persists, however, the next time we ""Get Messages.""  Individually moving Junk messages is tedious and runs counter to the intent of our program settings. </p><p>Thunderbird has been a superb email client that we have used for years using the POP3 protocol.  We rely on the program to manage our emails into folders and to save the results annually.  The above glitches appeared over the last 10 days while we were routinely using this client as always.  Of the above, the printer menu problem is the most serious, possible fatal, turning SuperNova into more like a Black Hole.  Please help!  --  wayne </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",wbell2

Although the port listed 587 has a ""default"" port number listed to the right as ""465"" ..... the number of the port and the default (993) on the Incoming Server match.  Is this the problem?  There's no way to change/edit the 465. Is this a systemic issue? I see several other posters with problems with Outgoing Server/stmp issues.

Ok, tutto perfetto, importo la posta e la rubrica da outlook, ma poi, quando vado a vedere di passare all'ultima versione, non mi propone alcun aggiornamento. A quel punto passo a mano l'eseguibile dell'ultima versione e, appena si apre thunderbird aggiornato mi richiede la password dell'account di posta e lo fa PER TUTTE le volte che scarico i messaggi o invio messaggi. Se vado a vedere nella sezione privacy - password, la finestra è vuota. In modalità risoluzione problemi, invece, funziona e la salva regolarmente nelle password, però vorrei precisare che non ho estensioni nè temi installati perché appena installato..... Se invece io installo direttamente l'ultima versione di thunderbird questo problema non si presenta, però non mi permette di importare la posta da outlook. Ho letto una vagonata di articoli tra qui e online, ma direttamente con l'ultima versione non riesco in nessun modo ad importare la posta. Come posso fare per avere botte piena e moglie ubriaca?
