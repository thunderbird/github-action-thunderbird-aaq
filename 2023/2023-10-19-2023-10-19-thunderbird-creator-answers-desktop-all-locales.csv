There was a time, in the past, when I used to get Delivery Status Notifications. It gradually got less and less and I assumed it was due to settings of the destination servers. There is the ""Options, Delivery notifications"" on every email I write but I never get a delivery notification of any kind. So I started looking for a setting to require delivery notifications by default, but, there isn't anything like that in version 115.3.3 that I use on Ubuntu 22.04.3. There was a DSN Settings add-on but that only worked on old versions 3.0 and 3.1 Please help me find out why I cannot get Delivery Status Notifications.

Ok, tutto perfetto, importo la posta e la rubrica da outlook, ma poi, quando vado a vedere di passare all'ultima versione, non mi propone alcun aggiornamento. A quel punto passo a mano l'eseguibile dell'ultima versione e, appena si apre thunderbird aggiornato mi richiede la password dell'account di posta e lo fa PER TUTTE le volte che scarico i messaggi o invio messaggi. Se vado a vedere nella sezione privacy - password, la finestra è vuota. In modalità risoluzione problemi, invece, funziona e la salva regolarmente nelle password, però vorrei precisare che non ho estensioni nè temi installati perché appena installato..... Se invece io installo direttamente l'ultima versione di thunderbird questo problema non si presenta, però non mi permette di importare la posta da outlook. Ho letto una vagonata di articoli tra qui e online, ma direttamente con l'ultima versione non riesco in nessun modo ad importare la posta. Come posso fare per avere botte piena e moglie ubriaca?

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, and it is still the same.  Is there a way to get rid of those settings and go back to the defaults without doing it inside the program? I have enclosed a screenshot of it.  I love my Thunderbird and am lost without it.  Please help. Someone.

Does NOT read messages.  Fortunately if I Right Click on account I can choose Get Messages and read mail that way. 2. Two of my family are in a panic because they cannot Send mail at all, since the update. 3. For me TB crashes sometimes. That has NEVER happened in past. 4. If any Developers are reading this ... I have read other posts about changing other Font specs etc and it requires creating new css file and writing css code, etc. While I can do all that myself the average TB user cannot. They will be intimidated by it. It is quite unfriendly. How about just put ALL settings in the about:config area? </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;!! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1612010;1612121;1612125;1612138;,rp108
