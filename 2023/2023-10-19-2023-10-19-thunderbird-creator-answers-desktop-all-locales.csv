I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, and it is still the same.  Is there a way to get rid of those settings and go back to the defaults without doing it inside the program? I have enclosed a screenshot of it.  I love my Thunderbird and am lost without it.  Please help. Someone.  Anyone. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1611991;1611992;1611995;1611997;,peepmissrudyandlt

Does NOT read messages.  Fortunately if I Right Click on account I can choose Get Messages and read mail that way. 2. Two of my family are in a panic because they cannot Send mail at all, since the update. 3. For me TB crashes sometimes. That has NEVER happened in past. 4. If any Developers are reading this ... I have read other posts about changing other Font specs etc and it requires creating new css file and writing css code, etc. While I can do all that myself the average TB user cannot. They will be intimidated by it. It is quite unfriendly. How about just put ALL settings in the about:config area? </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;!! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",rp108

Traveling  away from the office with Thunderbird on my tablet I lose access to emails stored in folders in my main PC.
