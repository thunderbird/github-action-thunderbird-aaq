So all that information is not irrelevant.  Just an FYI,  the issue was to do with how variables were defined in the C++ language and had nothing really to do with 32 or 64 bit versions.  Although the issue did limit Linux and Mac to 2Gb at the time. </p><p>The can not write mailbox problem as you define it is mostly the result of anti virus products locking files in the profile folder while they scan them in their typical pedestrian manner.  It is for this reason this forum is full of recommendations to exclude an on access scanning from the Thunderbird profile folder.   </p><p>However the real issue is file contention,  something Thunderbird simply can not handle,  having grown up in a world where your files were available immediately and exclusively.  So while I tend to reach for the antivirus card as the problem usually surfaces post update,  anything that causes file contention can cause issues.  So streaming backups,  the profile being stored on a ""cloud synced"" location (something we are seeing more of),  the profile not being stored locally on the system hard disk (while local network drives are supposed to work,  they can be problematical and other things like NAS, and USB drives can also have built in contention issues. </p><p>Again just an FYI.  I have an inbox on local folders of 7.4Gb containing almost 175,000 emails.  I also have a GMail account connected as IMAP  which has a 6.5Gb inbox with some 225,000 messages in it.  While I do see ""not responding"" issues for which I have no solution (or even real cause)  your issues will most likely be something external to Thunderbird,  but that could include spam/Scam tools injected into Thunderbird by antivirus products that have not received the message their tools are not welcome in the running program. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My unified inbox has 4 different inboxes from different email addresses merged into one.

When you have a linked inbox in outlook or apple mail, this behavior is the default - those clients always use the TO address of the email you received as the FROM address of the email you are replying with.

When it is attached to an email the original file is disassembled and the contents is encoded in a text format called MIME.  Then the email is send as a long sequence of plain text, indecipherable for most folks, but still plain text.  When you receive the email and you ask to view or save the ""file"" which is listed in the attachment pane.  The very first thing is this mime encoding has to be reversed to turn the pseudo ""file"" back into a file.  This process occurs largely in memory,  and on windows systems in the system temp folder where the resulting file is written.  On mac systems the resulting file is written where ever the settings say.  The issue is that the antivirus programs are so slow that at times the file is written and simply not available for the next step so the content is essentially corrupted. </p><p>Try in the first instance without an antivirus product. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
