I had attempted 2-3 times to compact all mail folders, both Local folders and Inbox folders (presumably on the mail server). I forget whether Local folders or Inbox folder, a warning message appeared saying not enough disk space or something like that for several folders. Quite understandable given Macintosh HD was very low on disk space at the time, less than 300 MB. </p>",davesailor,false,0,0

DO NOT attempt to merge old folders onto current folders as the old will overwrite the other.  - restart Thunderbird and the messages should be there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
