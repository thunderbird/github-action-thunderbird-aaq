Either corrupting the email in transit with their ""scanning"" or more frequently in the building of the file in memory and in the system temp folder when you choose to open or save it. </p><p>The issue comes about because a ""file"" is not sent via email.  When it is attached to an email the original file is disassembled and the contents is encoded in a text format called MIME.  Then the email is send as a long sequence of plain text, indecipherable for most folks, but still plain text.  When you receive the email and you ask to view or save the ""file"" which is listed in the attachment pane.  The very first thing is this mime encoding has to be reversed to turn the pseudo ""file"" back into a file.  This process occurs largely in memory,  and on windows systems in the system temp folder where the resulting file is written.  On mac systems the resulting file is written where ever the settings say.  The issue is that the antivirus programs are so slow that at times the file is written and simply not available for the next step so the content is essentially corrupted. </p><p>Try in the first instance without an antivirus product. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It talks about Thunderbird 78 but I think that came out in 2020, so that is a non issue. My email protocol is configured right and I turned off my Norton's firewall and that didn't help. I can see my emails by going to my web based interface so the problem is not with my provider. And my password is correct.  </p><p>I have seen a variety of things happen since the update. I couldn't get my new emails and I restarted my computer and the new emails came over at one point and then that stopped. At some point in time, I had a very brief pop up that said I needed to reenter my password but that went away immediately.  </p><p>What else can I try? Thanks, Kathy </p>",kathylubbers1,false,0,0

If it was already set up, then exit Thunderbird. Access Firewall, block Thunderbird and ok it. Then go back into Firwall and set Thunderbird as allowed. Why do this&nbsp;? Because I have discovered in the past that Norton seems to think an update in Thunderbird was a new different program and it was confused. See image below as a guide. </p><p>On another occasion, I discovered that Norton had auto switched on it's VPN which plays havoc because then you discover the servers do not like it, so they may be refusing access to server.
