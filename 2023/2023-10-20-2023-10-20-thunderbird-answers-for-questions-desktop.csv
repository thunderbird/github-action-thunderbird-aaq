There is also potential for connection initiated encryption downgrades that leave the servers ""more"" prone to denial of service attacks. </p><p>If you understand the stuff enough,  knowing what blocklist they used to block your IP may help you in the future.

When you receive the email and you ask to view or save the ""file"" which is listed in the attachment pane.  The very first thing is this mime encoding has to be reversed to turn the pseudo ""file"" back into a file.  This process occurs largely in memory,  and on windows systems in the system temp folder where the resulting file is written.  On mac systems the resulting file is written where ever the settings say.  The issue is that the antivirus programs are so slow that at times the file is written and simply not available for the next step so the content is essentially corrupted. </p><p>Try in the first instance without an antivirus product. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So while I tend to reach for the antivirus card as the problem usually surfaces post update,  anything that causes file contention can cause issues.  So streaming backups,  the profile being stored on a ""cloud synced"" location (something we are seeing more of),  the profile not being stored locally on the system hard disk (while local network drives are supposed to work,  they can be problematical and other things like NAS, and USB drives can also have built in contention issues. </p><p>Again just an FYI.  I have an inbox on local folders of 7.4Gb containing almost 175,000 emails.  I also have a GMail account connected as IMAP  which has a 6.5Gb inbox with some 225,000 messages in it.  While I do see ""not responding"" issues for which I have no solution (or even real cause)  your issues will most likely be something external to Thunderbird,  but that could include spam/Scam tools injected into Thunderbird by antivirus products that have not received the message their tools are not welcome in the running program. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
