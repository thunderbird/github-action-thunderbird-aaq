I would have received an order confirmation by email, and then might get another message when it is delivered.  But depending on the vendor's practices, these messages might not say ""flashlight.""   A year later,  suppose I want to know where I ordered the flashlight.  If the messages refer to an order number but do not say ""flashlight"", I don't have a simple way to find this out.  What I would like to do, when I archive the message (or subsequently), is to edit the body (or subject) to include this keyword.  Is there any straightforward way to do this in Thunderbird? Thanks for any advice. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",taxpayer
