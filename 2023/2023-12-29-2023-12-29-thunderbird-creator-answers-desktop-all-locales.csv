But with Win 11, TB 115.6.0 (64-bit) they definetly CAN be created and they are ALSO DISPLAYED (see pic). In order to display folders even more specifically, after that you can also make individual grouped folders favorite folders and display them as such. ONE / THE ONLY PROBLEM: If you close TB and open it again, those (and even no) folders are displayed anymore. However, the grouped folders and their settings are still there and will (only) be displayed again if you check the appropriate box for their display. I hope that it's not that difficult - and would be excellent - to implement so that the grouped folders and favorite folders (and also the ""normal"" or all previously displayed folders) and their view are just displayed unchanged even after restarting TB. So, in the simplest case, it's just a matter of the appropriate checking of the box for the folders display are set ""automatically"" when you restart TB / the computer (at least for the grouped folders, but keeping the Favorites folder would also be good, of course). In addition, after restarting TB, you wouldn't be shocked that all email accounts or folders seem to have disappeared. Could this be FIXED /  IMPLEMENTED PLEASE? Then TB would be perfect!
