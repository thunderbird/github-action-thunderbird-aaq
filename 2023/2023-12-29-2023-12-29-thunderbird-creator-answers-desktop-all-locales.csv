I would have received an order confirmation by email, and then might get another message when it is delivered.  But depending on the vendor's practices, these messages might not say ""flashlight.""   A year later,  suppose I want to know where I ordered the flashlight.  If the messages refer to an order number but do not say ""flashlight"", I don't have a simple way to find this out.  What I would like to do, when I archive the message (or subsequently), is to edit the body (or subject) to include this keyword.  Is there any straightforward way to do this in Thunderbird?

While Thunderbird is user-friendly, it lacks a built-in calendar and has integration constraints, which pushes customers to migrate from Thunderbird to Outlook. Microsoft Outlook, a vital Office tool, excels in terms of functionality, solid security, Office 365 integration, and cross-platform compatibility, making it a popular choice for businesses. Because of Outlook's additional capabilities, including increased email security, task automation, and cross-platform flexibility, businesses prefer Thunderbird to Outlook migration. The manual migration method is risky in terms of data loss and complexity, but the Mozilla Thunderbird Backup Tool provides an easy-to-use option that ensures effective data conversion and smooth export to multiple email clients.

But with Win 11, TB 115.6.0 (64-bit) they definetly CAN be created and they are ALSO DISPLAYED (see pic). In order to display folders even more specifically, after that you can also make individual grouped folders favorite folders and display them as such. ONE / THE ONLY PROBLEM: If you close TB and open it again, those (and even no) folders are displayed anymore. However, the grouped folders and their settings are still there and will (only) be displayed again if you check the appropriate box for their display. I hope that it's not that difficult - and would be excellent - to implement so that the grouped folders and favorite folders (and also the ""normal"" or all previously displayed folders) and their view are just displayed unchanged even after restarting TB. So, in the simplest case, it's just a matter of the appropriate checking of the box for the folders display are set ""automatically"" when you restart TB / the computer (at least for the grouped folders, but keeping the Favorites folder would also be good, of course). In addition, after restarting TB, you wouldn't be shocked that all email accounts or folders seem to have disappeared. Could this be FIXED /  IMPLEMENTED PLEASE? Then TB would be perfect!
