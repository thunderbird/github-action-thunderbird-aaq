I got a new computer for home using Windows 11 to replace my Windows 10 older computer. I have installed Thunderbird on the new computer using the exact same settings as the other two computers. Problem: When starting Thunderbird, it sits on 'contacting host' for a long time (3-4 minutes) then says no new messages. However, I know there are new messages as I get them through the old computer and I also see them on Microsoft 365 web based email access. I have checked all the firewall settings, etc. Everything is set the same as the old computer sitting next to the new computer.  I am stumped as to why it won't download new messages as it's connecting to the server. Please help....thanks. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",toddj98

I used to use Phoenity Icons and Buttons but got a bit fed up with them and started using Old Icons which worked a treat but for some reason they no longer appear.  They flash up briefly when I start Thunderbird but revert to default after a millisecond.  Has anyone got any idea how I could restore these Icons?  Sorry if this is a stupid question and I am missing something obvious but I don't seem to be able to find a solution.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, disabling and re-enabling but nothing seems to make any difference.
