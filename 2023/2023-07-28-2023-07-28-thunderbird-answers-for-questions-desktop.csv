The images themselves are not a really a separate thing, they are considered part of the email which is determined by the sender.  The image data is appended and usually has Content-Transfer-Encoding: using base64. </p><p>A 'folder' eg: Inbox as displayed in Folder Pane is not a real folder. If you have downloaded full copies and use message storage type 'file per folder' then emails are stored in an mbox text file. Emails are appended to the file in the order downloaded, they are not separate files.  So if you think of a folder as a single text document and the emails are like paragraphs within the document.   </p><p>I've seen addons which allow you to resize an image which you want to attach to an email you are creating, but received emails are a different case.  </p><p><strong>If this is causing a real problem with file/folder size on your computer and you are using an IMAP mail account set up:</strong> If you are using an IMAP mail account then all emails are stored on server and the imap account can only display whatever is on the server.  However, this does give you the option on whether you download full copies or just headers.   OR you can choose to download full copies, but then restrict it to eg: 60 amount of days.  This means you end up with just headers for all emails except for most recent 60 days. You do need to compact more frequently to maintain this so anything older than 60 days is properly removed and only shows as a header. </p> <ul><li> Account Settings &gt; Synchronisation &amp; Storage section </li></ul> <p>See more info: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization#</a> </li></ul> <p>This does have the desirable effect of reducing the amount of space used.

It is a pain when people just send large files when it's not always necessary.  I must admit, if it's something I want to keep then I use the detach option, then should I lose the email, I've still got the image.

If you want to sync your existing Google contacts with Thunderbird you'd have to create a new CardDAV address book for Google Contacts first. Thunderbird supports CardDAV natively, so no add-on is required. Open the Address Book tab. From the 'New Address Book' drop-down menu, select 'Add CardDAV Address Book'. For Username, enter your Gmail email address. Leave 'Location' blank, and continue. You'll be prompted for your Google credentials.

It may also be from may years ago if you have previously tried Thunderbird.  Caldav sync including detecting contacts and calendars, is available at the time of account addition,  under one of those handy ˅&gt; things that hide details.  Generally in my experience the option is hidden. </p><p>But I do understand your issue,  and unfortunately I do not see things improving. Both Microsoft and Apple love having a walled garden where what they sell works flawlessly together and nothing else works at all.   </p><p>There is a ratified global standard for contact exchange and syncing.  it is called cardDav and Thunderbird supports it.  So does Google and so does apple (despite you having to know that) I believe the URL you will need to use in the add address book to Thunderbird is <a href=""https://contacts.icloud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://contacts.icloud.com/</a> </p><p>The outlier of Microsoft.  They have their ""people"" thing and are essentially enforcing it.  They just do not offer accepted standards as being required.  Their sales to the converted makes it clear they do not.  You do not implement their exchange active sync,  you don't get to sync with their contacts. </p><p>So you can largely standardize on a single carddav source for all things not Microsoft and it will work out.  Be that Google, iCloud or one of the other carddav providers.  You will just have to actively decide to use that contact provider and none other. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
