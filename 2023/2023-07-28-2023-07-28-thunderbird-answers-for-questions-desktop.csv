In the menu bar, the title Tools reveals a clickable choice Add-ons and Themes. Choose that and Search (in the window that comes up) for Manually Sort Folders. Install that. Hit OK a couple of times. </p><p>Now that it's in TBird, go back to Tools, and you'll see the name Manually sort folders in the menu. Click that and read the contents of the panel that opens, to familiarize yourself with the layout. Then either choose the default Account name or click the down arrow next to it and you'll see Local Folders. Depending on whether you want to re-order folders under your account name in the folder panel OR folders under Local Folders in the folder pane, chose one or t'other, and then in the next line down, click the down arrow and choose Use a manually defined sort function (which means ""put 'em where you want 'em). Now click a folder you want to move, and use the green arrows to move it, and finally, click the Refresh folder pane button and (if you're finished) Close. If you want to move another folder, do it by selecting it and using the arrows. Then Refresh. Close when done. </p><p>That was easy enough for even a novice old man, wasn't it? </p><p>If you hit any roadblocks c'mon back and tell us about 'em. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

I retain every version of Tbird that has existed for 2O years from their own website. Up until about 2 years ago . If I preferred an older version of Tbird. I could and did roll back to a previous version. 2 years ago they stopped allowing you to do that. And began to warn . That if you attempted it they wouldn’t take responsibility if you lost your data (Emails) folders . This is very sad. This should not be happening. I could delete Outlook and reinstall any version I want to.There are at least 5 since 2007. Not Tbird. Open source has its drawbacks. No one at Tbird will take responsibility for the program. All their community resources care about is that any questions or comments are Not “ offensive.” What do they think happens to someone’s frustration level when they confront a problem like I’m having . I prefer a standalone email program that works. For years there are only 2 good ones. Outlook and Tbird. All the rest are web based.
