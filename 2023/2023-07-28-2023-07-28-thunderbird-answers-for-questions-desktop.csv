It may also be from may years ago if you have previously tried Thunderbird.  Caldav sync including detecting contacts and calendars, is available at the time of account addition,  under one of those handy ˅&gt; things that hide details.  Generally in my experience the option is hidden. </p><p>But I do understand your issue,  and unfortunately I do not see things improving. Both Microsoft and Apple love having a walled garden where what they sell works flawlessly together and nothing else works at all.   </p><p>There is a ratified global standard for contact exchange and syncing.  it is called cardDav and Thunderbird supports it.

They have their ""people"" thing and are essentially enforcing it.  They just do not offer accepted standards as being required.  Their sales to the converted makes it clear they do not.  You do not implement their exchange active sync,  you don't get to sync with their contacts. </p><p>So you can largely standardize on a single carddav source for all things not Microsoft and it will work out.  Be that Google, iCloud or one of the other carddav providers.  You will just have to actively decide to use that contact provider and none other. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If you want to sync your existing Google contacts with Thunderbird you'd have to create a new CardDAV address book for Google Contacts first. Thunderbird supports CardDAV natively, so no add-on is required. Open the Address Book tab. From the 'New Address Book' drop-down menu, select 'Add CardDAV Address Book'. For Username, enter your Gmail email address. Leave 'Location' blank, and continue. You'll be prompted for your Google credentials. Follow the prompts, and give the new address book a unique name, e.g. like 'Google Contacts'. </p><p>I have no idea about Outlook, but in general it would have work the same way. </p><p>How your contacts in the Thunderbird Address Book got populated in the first place, I don't know.

Lastname"" as the email address then shows an error because its not an actual email address. </p><p>Then I noticed if I added a new contact using gmail webmail, that contact is not synced to TB. So what it looks like to me is: - TB imports all existing contacts in the gmail or outlook accounts, but does it wrong - does not continuously sync contacts if they are created using a different mail app or web app. </p><p>If I go and fix all the email addresses in TB, they do not show as changed in other apps.

But that the userinterface is trying to offer some feedback sound like a distinct improvement to me.  Historically it just lost the plot and didn't transfer some of the mail. </p> <blockquote> I just selected a brace of about 817 emails in a Hotmail folder to be moved to the locally stored Thunderbird folder.

There are emails which amount to data streams being added and removed from remote servers and there are other data streams being appended to existing local files in the case of local folders.  There will also be various IMAP commands around marking message as deleted (not around deleting them),  both locally and on the server. There might even be an expunge being executed on the server and a compact on Thunderbird to actually finally delete the data.  Either after each email, or once only.  It depends on setting and servers. </p> <blockquote> If I look elsewhere, I can see indication that the files are being moved, but the quirky flashing really looks like there is some error.  When the files to be moved finally all disappear from the source window, I then get a notification that slides in from the top right, saying, ""The operation on XXXX failed because there was"" and this is the *next* problem, because (1) the window is too small to display the complete message, (2) it slides away much too quickly to be read at a normal pace, (3) there is no way to retrieve and read the complete message, and (4) the movement of emails HAS, in fact, been completed. </blockquote> <p>You visual that something is complete is not a guarantee that is is so.

I don't know the version was but was the latest version before 115.0.1. Accounts had set up without any problem. The Security Risk warning to outlook account is strange. I thought someting might happen between Mozilla and Microsoft so that outlook is put in blacklist. Seems this is not the case as it works with you. I may revert back to earlier TB vesion and see.

Yes I have tried disabling Avast premium antivirus for up to an hour. At least 10 of the failed reinstalls. I don’t much  like Outlook. Too bloated I will try to not   give up trying to reinstall Tbird. But it’s inexcusable that I can’t acquire a clean install. I retain every version of Tbird that has existed for 2O years from their own website. Up until about 2 years ago . If I preferred an older version of Tbird. I could and did roll back to a previous version. 2 years ago they stopped allowing you to do that. And began to warn . That if you attempted it they wouldn’t take responsibility if you lost your data (Emails) folders . This is very sad. This should not be happening. I could delete Outlook and reinstall any version I want to.There are at least 5 since 2007. Not Tbird. Open source has its drawbacks. No one at Tbird will take responsibility for the program. All their community resources care about is that any questions or comments are Not “ offensive.” What do they think happens to someone’s frustration level when they confront a problem like I’m having . I prefer a standalone email program that works. For years there are only 2 good ones. Outlook and Tbird. All the rest are web based. And even Outlook has sorta switched to a web based client called Microsoft 365. On subscription only. Thanks for trying. </p>",expo21,false,0,0
