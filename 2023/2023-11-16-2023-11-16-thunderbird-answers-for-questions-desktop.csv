Your request for support also has issues,  primarily you do not appear to be aware Lightning has been gone from Thunderbird for years and that caldav is a protocol like carddav, IMAP or POP. Apparently you have found something that refers to the use of caldav,  I do not have the benefit of knowing what that is,  so have no idea where it goes off the rails,  or even if it does. As David explained in that topic you linked to,  you don't get to pick the caldav protocol,  you get to input the URL to the caldav server that will offer the calendar. </p><p>This is slightly different for some calendar providers like Google where Thunderbird actually knows the link, so it finds your calendars for you. </p><p>At the end of the day,  what caldav provider are you trying to use?   If it is the apple product you are in for a world of pain,  because Apple hides the endpoint and you have to read arcane apple setting files to find it.  If it is google,  you simply enter your gmail user name and password when prompted.  Other providers requirement vary,  so knowing which is being invoked makes the whole support thing immeasurably easier. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Thunderbird uses Bayesian filtering so it needs training. You do need to train the Junk adaptive controls to learn what is junk and also what is not junk. It ends up performing thousands of filtering options on your behalf. It takes a couple of weeks to get up to a good level.  I find it works really well and therefore my filters deal with sorting out what good mail goes to what folder. I do have a couple of special filters designed to cope with a few more unusual spam emails particulary those using my name in the 'from' as they have been designed by spammer to get around filters. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
