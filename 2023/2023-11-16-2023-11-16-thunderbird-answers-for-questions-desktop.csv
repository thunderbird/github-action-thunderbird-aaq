Your request for support also has issues,  primarily you do not appear to be aware Lightning has been gone from Thunderbird for years and that caldav is a protocol like carddav, IMAP or POP. Apparently you have found something that refers to the use of caldav,  I do not have the benefit of knowing what that is,  so have no idea where it goes off the rails,  or even if it does. As David explained in that topic you linked to,  you don't get to pick the caldav protocol,  you get to input the URL to the caldav server that will offer the calendar. </p><p>This is slightly different for some calendar providers like Google where Thunderbird actually knows the link, so it finds your calendars for you. </p><p>At the end of the day,  what caldav provider are you trying to use?   If it is the apple product you are in for a world of pain,  because Apple hides the endpoint and you have to read arcane apple setting files to find it.  If it is google,  you simply enter your gmail user name and password when prompted.  Other providers requirement vary,  so knowing which is being invoked makes the whole support thing immeasurably easier. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,1

I find it works really well and therefore my filters deal with sorting out what good mail goes to what folder.

So far, filtaquilla is doing exactly as I want while being more accurate. Other base features are nice, just needed better filters. Now if only I could filter by gmail group. With gmail, you can have folders on there and I tried to get most of the filter work to be done by Google and the deletion filters done locally but that does not work unfortunately... It's either email or local folder. </p>",matthewtiggers99,false,0,0

Although Hotmail and Gmail users can simply stop saving sent mail and the server updates the sent folder (and makes the issues worse).  It can be ameliorated somewhat by preventing antivirus scanning of mail connections </p><p>Other causes can be a lack of connections to the server.  This is exacerbated by Apple products actually using ALL available connections to make their app look faster and offering no way to limit that grab.  So we see folk here with issues saving mail because their phone has hogged all available connections. </p><p>BTW your email address is TWC, but your account is with spectrum and unless they get a mention you can find it difficult to get current advice as TWC hits on google are now getting very dated. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
