But status bar on lower right shows activity, then just times out with no emails downloaded. We can see there are emails on Earthlink server by using their web based interface. Seemingly at random times, email will eventually download into T-bird. But not when we manually check for new mail ourselves. Contacted Earthlink, checked all server settings. Restarted T-bird and computer. No change. The duration of this problem roughly corresponds to the most recent update to 102.8.0 on 2/17/23. I saw in release notes that 102.8.0 fixed what sounds like a very similar issue with Gmail accounts. Wondering if by fixing Gmail issue, they broke Earthlink? Any suggestions?
