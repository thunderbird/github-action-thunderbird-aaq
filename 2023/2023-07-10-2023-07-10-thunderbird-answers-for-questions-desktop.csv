My way of doing this is simple: I select the message(s) I want to archive, right-click and select ""Copy to,"" and choose one of the folders I've created under Local Folders. Then I delete the message from the Inbox, and later, when I close down for the night, I empty the trash. That leaves only one copy of each copied message on my computer, and no copies of it on the server. Thunderbird has a neat trick to speed this process up for you: when you copy a message to one of your local folders, TB will add an item to the right-click menu that says ""Copy to folder X again"" where ""folder X"" is the name of the folder you last copied a message to. The next time you want to archive a message to that folder, you have a built-in command right in the menu. So, it's just a two-step process: ""Copy to"" and ""Delete."" But don't forget the trash. Your server will keep deleted messages in its Trash folder for quite a while, until/unless you delete them from that folder. And the easy way to do that trick once a day is to right-click on the Trash icon in Thunderbird and choose Empty the Trash. </p>",danawilson001,false,1,0

TB is probably 64-bit, but if Canon is 32-bit, it won't send files to TB 64-bit automatically.

So you are correct. You should see: </p> <ul><li> Online orders.sbd </li><li> Online orders </li><li> Online orders.msf </li></ul> <p>'Online Orders' no extension would be a top level folder and any of it's subfolders would be contained in the 'Online orders.sbd' folder. The Online orders.msf is just an index file used by Thunderbird - it contains no emails. </p><p>Please note: Thunderbird must not be running - so exit first. Access profile folders. copy paste the backup 'Online orders' no extension file back into the same folder that contains the 'Online orders.sbd' folder. Delete the 'Online orders.msf' file - it gets recreated when you start Thunderbird. </p><p>Files should not be auto deleted by anything, but that does not prevent some software especially Anti-Virus products  trying to fix files and end up deleting the entire file because the AV cannot understand that an email is just a small part of the entire file, so it kills all of it. </p><p>Suggest you see if you have something scanning files eg: Anti-Virus Access Anti-virus and set the Thunderbird profile folder exempt from any scanning by anything. </p><p>Have you ever deleted any emails fromn 'Online orders' folder&nbsp;? Have you ever moved emails from 'Online orders' folder into another folder or subfolder&nbsp;? If you have answered yes to either or both of the above: Have you compacted the 'Online orders' folder to remove all those old deleted references to emails that no longer exist in 'Online orders'&nbsp;? If no then do it as it may reduce that file size. Then create a new backup. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
