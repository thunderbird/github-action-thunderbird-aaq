My way of doing this is simple: I select the message(s) I want to archive, right-click and select ""Copy to,"" and choose one of the folders I've created under Local Folders. Then I delete the message from the Inbox, and later, when I close down for the night, I empty the trash. That leaves only one copy of each copied message on my computer, and no copies of it on the server. Thunderbird has a neat trick to speed this process up for you: when you copy a message to one of your local folders, TB will add an item to the right-click menu that says ""Copy to folder X again"" where ""folder X"" is the name of the folder you last copied a message to. The next time you want to archive a message to that folder, you have a built-in command right in the menu. So, it's just a two-step process: ""Copy to"" and ""Delete."" But don't forget the trash. Your server will keep deleted messages in its Trash folder for quite a while, until/unless you delete them from that folder. And the easy way to do that trick once a day is to right-click on the Trash icon in Thunderbird and choose Empty the Trash. </p>",danawilson001,false,1,0

But you haven't removed those messages from the server until they're deleted from an IMAP folder (above Local Folders) and then removed from the trash. You can copy messages from any of your TB folders to your hard drive. The <strong>copies</strong> are then no longer in Thunderbird or on the server. The originals are still in Thunderbird, though. The messages that are in your IMAP folders are both in TB and on the server. The messages you've put into TB local folders are on your hard drive and in Thunderbird's files. The messages you've deleted (and un-trashed) are no longer in Thunderbird or on the server. To copy messages from TB folders to another folder (on your hard drive and outside TB, <strong>use right-click ""Save as ...""</strong> Try it. You'll get the hang of it quickly.

There is nothing above Local Folders in the left panel of TB; my Inbox is under Local Folders. When I log into the server remotely with my ISP's webmail it does not differentiate between msgs in the Inbox and those in Archives, hence the issue I am trying to rectify.

Please tell me what you mean by ""pieces you saved"", as I am unsure about what this may mean. The backup I do does a complete copy of everything in my default.release folder, and subsequent copies update all files in the target (copy) folder that have changed since the previous week. My understanding of Thunderbird is not great but I have used it for many years (I am 73) so have some awareness of the file structure, but this is not by any  means comprehensive. My understanding of your reply suggests (I think) that I should re-install Thunderbird and create a  new profile along with that, then copy into this the data elements (sqlite tables?) from my original profile. If I have this right then I could see this being a solution, but I do not know the full list of elements to be copied. Is there a definitive list of these held anywhere in the support base? </p>",mike.rampling,false,0,0

If you have a constant habit of pressing Enter then only you can teach yourself to stop doing it when it is not required. </p><p>It's got nothing to do with whether the box is hidden or not. If you did not see the information in pop up box then you would complain it opens search across all folders when you press Enter and you did not see any info warning you. You still have to not press buttons or keys that are not the ones you want to press. </p><p>It is part of the functionality on search  - if no results ask if user wants to search other folders - if user presses Enter then perform search across all folders. </p><p>As you are performing a search on some letters in Quick Filter Search, then as you type and it auto displays results. Your next action would not be to press Enter, the next action maybe you would select an item in search results or choose to modify the filter or clear the search etc. In fact the only time you would press Enter as next action would be if search had no results and you want to continue the search in other folders. </p><p>Other than the advice offered by Wayne, if you have a bad habit of hitting Enter like a reflex action then try hitting the 'Backspace' button usually located above the Enter' key. As focus is still in the search text area, it will remove the last typed letter in search text box. </p><p>On a more serious note, it's not a good practice to have a habit of pressing the Enter key as you may end up performing actions you never intend whether that be in Thunderbird (albeit a minor nuisance in this case) or any other software or browser webpage. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
