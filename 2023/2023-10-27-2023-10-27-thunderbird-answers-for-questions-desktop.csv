I can instantly see the difference in the same view. </p><p>The various options are tailored in such a way as to offer the best for everyone because computer screens are not identical. People use different screen resolutions (number of pixels available) and different sized screens (14 inch, 21 inch etc) and people have different eyesight requirements which may change over time. </p><p>The options had to adapt to what people needed and that has been the improvement. </p><p>All the info below presumes you are using the default font size  for comparing Density options. </p><p>The 'Compact' is more compact - less space between items in any of the list formats.  People did ask for a compact version that was a bit more compact and the developers responded. The space previously used to display 13 items in a list now displays 14. </p><p>The old option 'Normal' is now called 'Default' Spacing has increased. The space previously used to display 14 items in a list now displays 12. </p><p>The old option called 'Touch' is now called 'Relaxed' Spacing has increased but not a lot - it's very small The space previously used to display 19 items in a list now displays 18. </p><p>However, and this is the important factor - the Density spacing is also effected by the 'Font Size' you select and that has not changed at all. If you choose a larger size of font then it will require a minimum amount of space in order to display that font size. </p><p>Example: If you are using 'Density': 'Default' Then you choose to significantly increase the Font Size, you will discover it uses more spacing. So you could use a larger font and then change the 'Density' back to 'Compact'. This keeps the larger font but can now reduce the spacing without causing lines to overlap. </p><p>As I said there is more control now than ever before. Previously, it became a problem when increasing the font size, it conflicted with the density controls. Now it does not and you can manipulate it more. </p><p>So you are correct. The Density options do not exactly match as before, now they work with the 'Font Size' controls in a more harmonious method.

Perhaps ""refresh"" was the wrong term for me to use and I should have instead said something like ""request new mail from the server"".  To give you an idea of what I thought double-clicking the Inbox in the folder pane should do, I thought it would ""request new mail from the server"".  I got this idea by searching the web as well as asking Bing AI how to ""refresh"" the Inbox, and there were many answers that stated that double-clicking was how to ""refresh"", but again I was probably asking the wrong question.  I am just switching over to Thunderbird after many years of using TheBat! so I apologize for my naivety. </p><p>I found out about the little cloud icon a few hours after posting my question and came back to my posting to delete it.

Except for Thunderbird, which is new to me, and Eudora, which I stopped using long ago, the other clients have been polling the servers used by BlueHost, FatCow, DotEasy, and Gmail for many years without any problems whatsoever. </p><p>Thanks for your interest&nbsp;:-) Ray </p>",RayMitchell1,false,0,0

That also explains the ""grayed out"" phenomenon I previously noted when I went to New/Calendar.

An error occurred while sending mail.  The mail server responded: [your email address] send rejected.  The email address you are sending as must match the email address you used to auth.  Please check you SMTP settings.  AUP#Out-1500.  Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again.” </p><p>Probable cause: If you have multiple accounts with the same provider, a Thunderbird update has applied the same outgoing server info to all.  In my case, I have four email accounts with Spectrum, formerly Time Warner Cable.  Sometime between December 14 and 20, one of the four was made the “default”, so it’s info was reported to the server, even when I was trying to send from one of the others.  I was suddenly unable to send from three of my accounts. </p><p>How to fix this: Amazingly, it’s not under “Server Settings.”  In the left hand panel, right click on the problem account name and choose Settings.  At the bottom of the main page, you’ll see the wrong email address in the Outgoing Server box.  DO NOT change this yet, because it will simply make it the new “default” (I tried this first). </p><p>Instead, scroll to the very bottom of the left hand panel to find OUTGOING SERVER (SMTP).  When you click it, the main screen will show the default account.  Click ADD to add the outgoing server information for your problem account.  In my case, it was identical to the default, except for the user name.  Go back to the left hand panel and click on the problem account.  In the Outgoing Server box, there will now be a drop-down list where you can choose the correct info.   </p><p>After taking these steps, I had to enter my password (clicking the save password box) the first time I sent a test email.  Hope this helps someone. </p>",jldobson,false,0,0

The third party outfit is called ""The Messaging Company"" and uses the same login details as the old westnet webmail, it also looks exactly the same once logged in. My problem is that Thunderbird doesn't even seem to attempt logging in, the bar at the bottom of the Thunderbird program that tells you if you are online or offline and login progress does not show any attempt by the program to login, it would say ""connecting to account ****"" and if it tried and failed you would get a failed to connect notification, but there is nothing. I use avast anti virus  and malwarebytes could that have become a problem </p>",brett.christoffel,false,0,0

Blocking port 25 for domestic customers also forces commercial customers to pay for the business product to host their own mail servers. </p><p>So is the mail server you are attempting to connect to provided by your ISP and they tell you to connect on port 25?  If not who is the ISP? </p><p>What is the source of the message?  I just edited an SMTP entry in my version of Thundbird 115 to use port 25.  It was happy to do so.  No message no mess no fuss.  The vague error you mention sounds like a server refusing to connect on port 25.   Or perhaps some sort of third party software blocking outgoing connections on port 25 (something third party antivirus product do frequently) </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Could not get anywhere with the 'solved' message button in your email or the response choices it was wrapped in. I think it's SOLVED.  As for isp etc I think those questions are answered at the bottom of the original - that page is the entire content of their knowledge base regarding email setup. <a href=""http://oigp.net"" rel=""nofollow"">oigp.net</a> is THE isp and mail server and it  seems to require IMAP...outgoing port 25 - no other choices. Roundcube will get me through a silly deadline - been a few years since I used it AND I no longer seem to have 'copies' on the server. Doesn't look like IMAP. I'm comparing results with another Thunderbird which works. I will definitely check out virus checkers [They differ between the systems] etc. Pretty sure it's not Mozilla VPN [which got me around the ISP for everything but email, Thunderbird is the only app in their bypass list for me]. OIGP could not connect with the local bank! Anyway, I have many things to check for this port 25 taboo...oigp kept the 25 when they went from POP!?

I am guessing you have an antivirus program scanning mail as it is downloaded as well? Disable the email scanner and see if the issue suddenly fixes itself.  That is the most likely. </p><p>Next is actual file scanning.  Antivirus programs are in the habit of scanning the file system when files are opened.  Unfortunately Thunderbird does not hang around waiting for hem to finish.  If the file is not available it gets by without it.  The result for POP mail accounts that leave mail on the server is that at times the updated status of what has been downloaded is not saved in the popstate.dat file in the accounts folder in Thunderbird's profile. The result is,  the old information is what is available when the next fetch occurs.  Hence duplicate emails because the downloads are not logged.  This time you need to exclude the Thunderbird profile folder from on access scanning in the antivirus program. </p><p>Let me know how it goes. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You mention that I should exclude the Thunderbird Profile Folder, but where do I find this folder? By the way, I have been using Total AV for more than 2 years. I never had a problem with duplicating emails before. The problem only started recently when Thunderbird was updated to the new page layout.
