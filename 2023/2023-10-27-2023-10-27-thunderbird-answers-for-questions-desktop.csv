Folk here are fellow Thunderbird users.  There are no folk that you get to heap abuse of that are paid to make you feel good about the product.  We use it and generally like it, but that is about it. </p><p>Personally after more than a decade of responding to folk about not getting mail the forums are full of folk being told to look at their antivirus post upgrade and being asked for actual information about what error messages they get and what provider they use.

""I am not getting messages"" is the electronic equivalent of the ""postal service did not deliver a letter today""  the reasons why that may be are myriad and certainly may exceed the number of minutes in the day the delivery failed. </p><p>The fundamental most common cause of mail receipt issues post an upgrade to Thunderbird is the software firewall on your antivirus product or one of the components of same that they inject into the running Thunderbird instance.  It is difficult to build in reliability when external forces think they know better.  Generally you do not see support articles directly blaming these products,  even if such blame is earned.  Then we have user resistance to the issue being anything but Thunderbird.

Obviously I would prefer to just a single account for the same email address, but really can't see what is wrong with the old account. The new account's settings is using a POP Mail Server (port 995), SSL/TLS connection security, normal password authentication; I've ensured the old account is exactly the same but still no result. I'm nearly certain it has something to do with the update, but I can't see what the update could possibly have done that would just stop it working after 9 years with no hassle. </p><p>Cheers! </p>",thejustinian,false,0,0
