Propagation of DNS changes can actually take weeks to get to all the more remote corners of the internet (read you home server in that). </p><p>I would suggest setting the DNS to something like cloudflare (over HTTPS for best results) or Google DNS servers and see if the issue goes away.

On your router? </p><p>Have you tried using the treacert command to see if the domain is routing to your new or old host? </p><p>What about disabling IPv6?  I have seen all sorts of oddities with that as providers try and get with the program, often with remarkable failures. </p><p>Then there is the issue of what appears to be a firewall or VPN port. 2080 is not a standard port for email.  I have seen it used in intranets as a gateway port for web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) generally so everything is sent through a proxy to filter content, sometime an edge apliance for malware detection.  But far more commonly the port is 8080. </p><p>When I was googling the issue I noticed some mob called hostpapa used the port for synchronizing contact and calendars. <a href=""https://www.hostpapa.com/knowledgebase/synchronise-calendars-contacts-cpanel/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hostpapa.com/knowledgebase/synchronise-calendars-contacts-cpanel/</a>  so perhaps part of the issue is not email.   </p><p>Does your new host even redirect port 2080, or just drop it as the firewall?  Most hosts would have the port closed at the firewall I would guess as the recognized use of the port is by Autodesk Network Licence Manager (NLM).
