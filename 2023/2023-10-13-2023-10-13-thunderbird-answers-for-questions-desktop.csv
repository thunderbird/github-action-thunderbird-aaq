This is intended as information for the human recipient       rather than for any automatic processing. </pre> <pre> (2)   PADDING -- the number of bits of padding that were       appended to the bit-stream comprising the actual       contents to produce the enclosed 8bit byte-oriented       data.  This is useful for enclosing a bit-stream in a       body when the total number of bits is not a multiple of       8. </pre> <pre>Both of these parameters are optional. </pre> <pre>An additional parameter, ""CONVERSIONS"", was defined in RFC 1341 but has since been removed.  RFC 1341 also defined the use of a ""NAME"" parameter which gave a suggested file name to be used if the data were to be written to a file.  This has been deprecated in anticipation of a separate Content-Disposition header field, to be defined in a subsequent RFC. </pre> <pre>The recommended action for an implementation that receives an ""application/octet-stream"" entity is to simply offer to put the data in a file, with any Content-Transfer-Encoding undone, or perhaps to use it as input to a user-specified process. </pre> <pre>To reduce the danger of transmitting rogue programs, it is strongly recommended that implementations NOT implement a path-search mechanism whereby an arbitrary program named in the Content-Type parameter (e.g., an ""interpreter="" parameter) is found and executed using the message body as input. </pre> <p>See <a href=""https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/octet-stream"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/octet-stream</a> </p><p>A PDF file which this image claims the content based on the file name (something that has no relevance in this setting except to suggest a default when saving the file, it should be transmitted as application/pdf <a href=""https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf</a> </p><p>I would expect the arbitrary binary date to not be forwarded at all beyond the initial receipt.
