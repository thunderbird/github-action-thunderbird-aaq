The set of currently defined parameters is: </pre> <pre> (1)   TYPE -- the general type or category of binary data.       This is intended as information for the human recipient       rather than for any automatic processing. </pre> <pre> (2)   PADDING -- the number of bits of padding that were       appended to the bit-stream comprising the actual       contents to produce the enclosed 8bit byte-oriented       data.  This is useful for enclosing a bit-stream in a       body when the total number of bits is not a multiple of       8. </pre> <pre>Both of these parameters are optional. </pre> <pre>An additional parameter, ""CONVERSIONS"", was defined in RFC 1341 but has since been removed.  RFC 1341 also defined the use of a ""NAME"" parameter which gave a suggested file name to be used if the data were to be written to a file.  This has been deprecated in anticipation of a separate Content-Disposition header field, to be defined in a subsequent RFC. </pre> <pre>The recommended action for an implementation that receives an ""application/octet-stream"" entity is to simply offer to put the data in a file, with any Content-Transfer-Encoding undone, or perhaps to use it as input to a user-specified process. </pre> <pre>To reduce the danger of transmitting rogue programs, it is strongly recommended that implementations NOT implement a path-search mechanism whereby an arbitrary program named in the Content-Type parameter (e.g., an ""interpreter="" parameter) is found and executed using the message body as input. </pre> <p>See <a href=""https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/octet-stream"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/octet-stream</a> </p><p>A PDF file which this image claims the content based on the file name (something that has no relevance in this setting except to suggest a default when saving the file, it should be transmitted as application/pdf <a href=""https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf</a> </p><p>I would expect the arbitrary binary date to not be forwarded at all beyond the initial receipt.

Thunderbird. Have made several donations previously, but recent security upgrade came with a lot of detriments. Not quite enough to drop Thunderbird, but VERY disappointing that someone felt it necessary to add all sorts of glitzy noise - what Edward Tufte calls ""chartjunk"" - that degrade my user experience.

Happy for any security improvement; have not seen any performance/usability benefit. </p><p>- On average, it now required 2x to 3x number of movements/clicks for every task. </p><p>- Whole folder trees now open when making a single-click selection. Real PITA to have to collapse it all again to see the the folder pane top level. </p><p>- Yet, often have to double click just to select (not open) another message or folder, then click again to open. </p><p>- Extremely annoying: system defaults to Threaded sort, no matter how many times I make the change to Unthreaded on any folder. Made the suggested change in advanced settings, but it still reverts to Threaded. </p><p>- Userchrome is apparently now non-functional, and default settings are visually unpleasant and make it harder to get work done. E.g., the grey circles with unread count are distracting and a waste of real estate, but I haven't found a way to disable the ""feature."" No userchrome means no way to remove wasted screen space, e.g. reducing menu-bar height. </p><p>- Columns auto-space in inconvenient ways. When I re-set them to my preference, there seems to be no global option - and they quickly revert anyway. </p><p>- Single-account download has been removed. This is very inconvenient when one has many accounts and wants to do a quick re-check on just one, e.g. to get an incoming urgent message. </p><p>- When selecting/opening a folder, it seem to wind up at some random point in list, rather than top (by my sort, most recent). </p><p>- Context menus ever more crowded and (I suspect) largely irrelevant to most users. There hasn't been a compatible context-menu editor extension for some time; this really should be a native feature when the list has grown to dozens of items. </p><p>Sure hope the next revision corrects some of these, and - especially - restores UserChrome functionality. </p>",cten,false,0,0
