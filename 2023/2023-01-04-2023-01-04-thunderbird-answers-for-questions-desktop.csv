I actually considered reaching out to the FSU IT department but since that's a cumbersome process I tried to do as much troubleshooting as possible first. </p><p>I checked all the FSU IT pages and confirmed I am set up as instructed. Also, this has never been a problem with the native windows email application. I'm able to send emails from this account using TypeApp mobile from my android phone which similarly allows for multiple mailboxes to be managed in a single interface.

This leads me to believe this is not an FSU IT problem, OS problem, VPN problem, or firewall problem; this appears to be application-specific in that Thunderbird is the only application of the many email applications I have access to that won't send emails from this account.

Instead, there is probably something unique about your system that is the cause of failure.  Try running Windows in safe mode to test for the effect of startup apps, among other factors, and add the TB profile folder as an Exclusion in Windows Security settings.  Try adding the account to a new, unmodified profile, from Help/More Troubleshooting, about:profiles.

The reality here is that Thunderbird doesn't work on a standard Windows 10 OS to send emails from an exchange account.  If the solution is for me to go deep into computer settings to change the machine to allow the program to work, it's just not a program I'm going to continue to use when the native email application works just fine.  If I'm comparing free software, the free software that came with the computer is working but the software I downloaded from Mozilla does not function as intended.  Perhaps if I was a computer scientist with the patience to reconfigure my entire machine around one application this would work but I'm just a lowly aerospace engineer and I think we've reached the end of my willingness to work around the issue.  The solution to this problem is to simply not use this software.  Never thought I'd say this, but chalk up a win for Microsoft I guess lol.

It's also not a problem in Thunderbird as you can open it and print the email from within Thunderbird. </p><p>The saved .eml files are not saved in Thunderbird. They are completely independent files stored on computer. .eml Files do need to be opened first in order to be printed. This is not a sudden change. Windows has worked that way since forever for these specific types of files. You will find Microsoft Winbdows forums will also advise you to choose an email client to open those emails in order to print them. </p><p>Why? Because an *.eml file is written with all the coding and if it uses base64, all you will see is a load of letters and numbers and nothing will make any sense. If email has any attachments then you will see pages of letters and numbers. If you try to use 'Notepad' or change the extension to .txt then it will print all the source code and it will not look easy to read. It is a fultile operation trying to print a .eml file because it may look unreadible. This is why it is necessary to use a program that can interpret all the coding and produce something that is legible and readible and look like the typical email you would read in an email client eg: Thunderbird. Then when you choose to print, it is printing the email as you would see it when opened in Thunderbird. </p><p>If you select an email you have received so you can read it in Message Pane - click on 'More' and select 'View Source'. Some emails will look simple text if created and sent as Plain Text. Others that use HTML will look far more complicated especially if some created that email using eg: Outlook or via any MS product. If converted to Base64 then it will be totally unreadible. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Leaving the OS aside, I still think that it should be possible to print .eml files from Explorer.  I think that it should be possible to print from Explorer files of any file type that is associated with an application that can handle the printing.  The application would still be involved in the printing; it just wouldn't display the file in question in a visible window.  I was able to demonstrate this for myself for MS Word files and for PDF files.  The ability to do this has been noted by others, for example, see <a href=""https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-can-i-print-a-file-directly-from-windows/89d5b49d-a3c5-4791-ae28-77c1e3b11947"" rel=""nofollow"">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-can-i-print-a-file-directly-from-windows/89d5b49d-a3c5-4791-ae28-77c1e3b11947</a>. </p>",dresnick1,false,0,0

It's got nothing to do with where is the 'Print' or fixing a 'Print' option. The link you mention has nothing to do with your situation. It is an entirely different issue. It evens discusses how to put  a Printer in a Send to list. There are plenty of cases where you can fix your computer to print any standard text or word type file. </p><p>The .eml files are not simple text documents, they have to be decoded to display what you see as an email. Only a third party email client can do it, so it has to be opened first in the application. That means the print then works from the decoded info, so you need to use the print from within the program. </p><p>As an example, I opened the source of an email, this is a what it's contents look like . I've not displayed all of it, the initial part is full of all the various headers which would take up one sheet of A4. </p><p>The point is this. It's a lot easier if you are printing any form of text document where what you see is what the file contains. That is not the same for .eml files. In most cases they look like jibberish. See image below as an example. </p><p>This specific problem has nothing to do with Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I've examined the content of some of my .eml files in Notepad, and the content looks very similar to that of .html files, which means that it consists of ordinary text characters, but includes sequences of characters, such as HTML tags, that can be interpreted not as ordinary text by a suitable software application.  In contrast, the content of .docm (MS Word) and .pdf files for the most part does not look at all like ordinary text.  I add as evidence the case of JPEG files (.jpg), which are not text files at all.  I'm attaching an image that shows the Print command as available for a .jpg file. </p><p>By the way, I do not disagree that a .eml file would need to be opened by Thunderbird, in order for the file to be printed.  I suggest that if Thunderbird had registered with Windows the capability of printing .eml files, then when a user selected a .eml file in Explorer, then right-clicked it, Windows would list a Print command.  If the user then selected the Print command, Windows would launch Thunderbird in such a way as to request that it open the .eml file without displaying its contents in a window, then print the file. </p>",dresnick1,false,0,0
