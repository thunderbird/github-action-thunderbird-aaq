I can see they exist somewhere, as they are indexed, and I can read the first few lines, date and address etc, but not open them fully. I found this earlier which mentions sqlite? I don't know what that is or whether it might be part of the solution. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1018203"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1018203</a> </p><p>If anyone knows how to retrieve the content of these emails I'd be very grateful.

""Will the new Supernova interface and Thunderbird redesign cause problems with or disable old extensions?"" </p><p>It's very frustrating to have to spend hours finding extension replacements when the old ones no longer work. The last time a TB update changed things like this, I had to waste a lot of time doing this. I had to hold off on updating TB for weeks in fact, because doing so would have disabled so many critical extensions that I was using. Eventually, I was able to find replacement extensions (usually having to embrace feature degradation though) and in other cases simply had to give up conveniences that I had grown to take for granted. </p><p>I don't welcome the prospect of having to do this kind of thing all over again. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1582816;1582953;1582991;1583310;1583316;1583358;,r9jmg0

However, I am wanting to get my Apple Mail program on to the Thunderbird platform and do away with Braxmail. This is because of where I live, using the BraX2 phone is not working for me. I want to access my mail from my iphone, which isn't supported on the Brax phone. (That phone is Google and Apple free.) I want to be able to change over all my Braxmail info on to the Thunderbird version of Apple Mail, and then do away with Braxmail. But because Braxmail is already using Thunderbird, is it actually possible to set up another Thunderbird version for Apple Mail? I can't delete Braxmail, as there's too much valuable info there. I need to import it to Thunderbird' Apple Mail equivalent. Can anyone steer me in the right direction? Thanks!
