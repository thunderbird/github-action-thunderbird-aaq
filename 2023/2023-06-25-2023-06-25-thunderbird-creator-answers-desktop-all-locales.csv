Seguo tutti i passi indicati: - Aggiungi account di posta. - Inserisco nome, cognome, indirizzo mail e pw. - Spunto il protocollo IMAP (ho provveduto ad attivare questo protocollo sulla mia casella di posta). Cliccando poi ""fatto"" mi si apre una finestra che mi dice: ""Accedi con il tuo accounto Google"" Inserisco il mio accounto email e clicco su avanti, ma non succede niente. Intanto nella schermata dove ho inserito i dati continua a girare ""Controllo password"". Alla fine mi da questo errore: ""Impossibile autenticarsi sul server. La configurazione, il nome utente o la password potrebbero essere errati."" Sono sicuro che tutti i dati sono inseriti sono corretti. D'altronte ho provato, con successo a configurare l'app E-mail di Sansung sul mio smartphone senza nessun problema. Grazie per l'aiuto Allego tre screen di tutti i passaggi. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1587135;,raffdono
