I can not manage, where it will be stored and the certificate appears in the  'People' tab instead of 'Your certificates'. Deleting the certificate, restart the program, download the newest version - did not help. When I click to a 'View' button, than the certificate is listed with all parameters - please see pictures in attachment. I did not get any error message during importing: just added a pssword and it was all. As this certificate is not listed as mine, I can not choose it to use for a signing. Did you encountered a situation like this&nbsp;? Can you advise me, how to correct it&nbsp;? In the past I generated certificates and never was in a situation like this. Thanks for your help.
