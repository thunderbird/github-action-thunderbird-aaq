Since you've mistakenly set up a POP account and then an IMAP account, you're experiencing problems with message downloading and sending. To resolve this, you can start by going to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Account Settings"" in Thunderbird. Select the POP account and disable it by unchecking the option to ""Check for new messages at startup."" For the IMAP account error, make sure you've entered the correct credentials and server settings. Also, double-check your internet connection. If the issue persists, you might need to adjust your Office 365 security settings to allow Thunderbird access. You can find more detailed steps in the Thunderbird support documentation or reach out to Microsoft's support for Office 365. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

This can be caused by a few things. First, make sure you're entering the correct password and check for any typos. If that's not the issue, it might be due to a connection problem or a security setting on your email server. You can try removing and re-adding your email account in Thunderbird, making sure to double-check the server settings and ensuring that your account is properly configured. Additionally, some email providers might have security measures in place that could cause this behavior. You can try enabling ""App Passwords"" if your email provider supports it, or adjust any security settings on your email account. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

The fact that the other accounts work fine suggests this is specific to the MS365 account. Since you've already tried clearing cache and removing extensions without success, let's try a couple more things. First, double-check your email server settings for the MS365 account. Make sure they're correct and up-to-date. Also, try creating a new profile in Thunderbird and adding only the MS365 account to see if the issue persists.

It sounds like your emails are being blacklisted by spam filters due to some suspicious behavior from your IP address.

You can try contacting your email service provider and see if they can provide any insights or help with delisting from the CSS Blocklist. Additionally, you could consider reaching out to Spamhaus directly for further assistance. It's also worth confirming that your Thunderbird settings are correctly configured for outgoing emails.

Find the filter causing the problem, select it, and click ""Remove."" After that, recreate the filter and see if the ""Run Now"" button works.

In Thunderbird version 102 with Lightning Calendar, setting up email reminders can be a bit tricky. Currently, Lightning offers only the ""Show an alert"" option, not the ""Send an email message"" one you're looking for. Unfortunately, Thunderbird 102 might not support sending email alerts directly. You're right, in a previous version, there was an ""Send an email message"" option. I suggest checking if future Thunderbird versions might bring this feature back. For now, the Attendees list might help with email notifications, but I understand you're looking for something specific like a 1-hour-before reminder.

Don't worry, we can definitely help you sort this out. To address the issues you're facing, let's try a couple of steps. First, let's deal with the cookies and security error – make sure your browser settings allow cookies and try disabling any security add-ons that might interfere. Now, for the missing emails, it seems there might be a hiccup with your profile. You can try creating a new profile and see if that helps. If you want to import your old emails, it's best to do it manually – copy the email files from your old profile's Mail folder to the new one. Also, the 'prefs.js' error could be due to a corrupted file, so creating a new profile should also address this. Remember to back up important data before trying these steps. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

Currently Thunderbird is not updating to the new supernova, so if you got a mention of an update to Supernova it means you have some Update Software running on your computer and it located that particular version. </p><p>You say ""very cramped text viewing area display"". I'm presuming you are talking about the 'Message Pane' - the area which shows the content of a selected open email. </p><p>I'm not seeing any difference so this has to be due to some settings which may have been set up by default. </p><p>The new supernova design offers two ways of viewing the 'Message List' otherwise known as the 'Thread Pane'. One is 'Table View' (old method as used in 102*) and the other is 'Card View' which is new. At this point you have not mentioned which one you are using. You will see a new header toolbar above the Message List. It contains the name of the folder and number of messages. On the right will be the 'Quick Filter' button and a new icon - that new icon allows you to choose 'Table View' or 'Card View'. </p><p>If you are using 'Card View' then each email in the list will use more vertical space. So to see more of the list you end up with less height for the Message Pane. Note you can still  drag the splitter upwards to reveal more of the Message Pane, but then you have a very short Message List. The 'Card View' is really designed to be used when using 'View' &gt; 'Layout &gt; 'Vertical View'. This means you see a lot more emails in the Card View list and get a full length Message Pane.  Perfectly ideal for people with wide screens. </p><p>If you prefer the old method as used in version 102*, then you need to use 'Table View'. This means you can raise the Message Pane height and still see more of the list of emails. The 'View' &gt; 'Layout' &gt; 'Classic View' works best when using 'Table View'. </p><p>As in 102*, you can also control the Density - space between items in lists such as 'Folder Pane' ,'Message List' and Menus.  Menu app icon &gt; Density &gt; three options available. This is also available on the Menu Bar under 'View'.

Yes, I have this problem too, although I only just received the invitation to upgrade to Supernova 115.2 today (27 September, 2023), and I otherwise like the new appearance and functions very much. The problem appears to be that when using the 'classic' horizontal view with the preview pane below the message list pane (and regardless whether you have the folder pane open at all, or the message (preview) pane in wide or classic view), there is a control slider if you hover over the dividing line between 'message list' and the 'message (preview) pane. Whilst in previous Thunderbirds (and the 152 version), the control (with a 2-direction arrow) will slide up and down to a minimum of about a tenth of the total pane vertical height, but on supernova 115.2 it will only go to a minimum of about one-third of the height being dedicated to the message list.  I am thinking that adjusting the settings of the computer screen settings, rather than the internal thunderbird/supernova settings, will alter the screen geography somewhat, and enable a larger area of the message to be read in the message (preview) pane, this is something that most people will not want to do.  I think the best option, and it looks like it might make a number of disgruntled users very much happier, would be for the limits on the extent of this slider control to be adjusted, and would suggest a minimum of about 10% of available space. Now, I know that developers may be using different screen resolutions, and so to quote that distance in pixels might not be terribly helpful, so maybe this will help: In my previous version, I could reduce the message list pane (horizontal view) to a minimum of 3 lines of text, or 3 message items. (and increase it to 20 or 30, depending on resolution and screen size). In Supernova, the smallest I can make this message list pane section is 10 lines of 'dense' messsages, or 5 items of 'relaxed' messages (I like the dense and relaxed options, this is really good). If we could reduce it to a limit of 3 dense lines, or possibly even 1 relaxed line, I think this would satisfy people who do not like the current limit.  Obviously, if it were possible to reduce it to zero, people would be at risk of accidentally hiding it completely and possibly unable to find it again. Would this be possible for next update perhaps? </p>",d.church,false,2,0
