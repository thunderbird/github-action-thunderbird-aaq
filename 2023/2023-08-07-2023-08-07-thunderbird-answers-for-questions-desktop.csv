If you suddenly see a login prompt after years of using it, it might be related to some changes or updates. Even though you might not remember setting up a password, it's likely that you did.

Don't worry, we can definitely help you sort this out. To address the issues you're facing, let's try a couple of steps. First, let's deal with the cookies and security error – make sure your browser settings allow cookies and try disabling any security add-ons that might interfere. Now, for the missing emails, it seems there might be a hiccup with your profile. You can try creating a new profile and see if that helps. If you want to import your old emails, it's best to do it manually – copy the email files from your old profile's Mail folder to the new one. Also, the 'prefs.js' error could be due to a corrupted file, so creating a new profile should also address this. Remember to back up important data before trying these steps. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

In Thunderbird version 102 with Lightning Calendar, setting up email reminders can be a bit tricky.

Unfortunately, Thunderbird 102 might not support sending email alerts directly. You're right, in a previous version, there was an ""Send an email message"" option. I suggest checking if future Thunderbird versions might bring this feature back. For now, the Attendees list might help with email notifications, but I understand you're looking for something specific like a 1-hour-before reminder.

For the IMAP account error, make sure you've entered the correct credentials and server settings. Also, double-check your internet connection. If the issue persists, you might need to adjust your Office 365 security settings to allow Thunderbird access. You can find more detailed steps in the Thunderbird support documentation or reach out to Microsoft's support for Office 365. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

It sounds like you're having trouble adding <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> accounts to Thunderbird. Don't worry, we've got you covered! The issue might be related to some security settings on your <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account. Firstly, ensure you've enabled IMAP or POP access from your Outlook settings. Then, try setting up the account again in Thunderbird, making sure you're using the correct server settings (IMAP: <a href=""http://imap-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap-mail.outlook.com</a>, Port: 993; POP: <a href=""http://pop-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail.outlook.com</a>, Port: 995). Also, make sure you're using the right username (your full <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email address) and password. If you're still facing issues, it's a good idea to temporarily disable any antivirus or firewall software that might be causing conflicts. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes!

To migrate your Thunderbird setup and filters from Windows to Linux Mint, you're on the right track with moving the mail data and profile. For the missing filters issue, you're correct that the filters' details are stored in ""D:\ThunderbirdMail\ImapMail\<a href=""http://imap.googlemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.googlemail.com</a>\msgFilterRules.dat"". To get your filters working on Linux Mint, you'll want to copy this ""msgFilterRules.dat"" file to the appropriate profile directory on Linux. Since you're using the profile ""x1ua9znr.default-release,"" navigate to your Thunderbird profile directory on Linux, find the corresponding ""ImapMail"" folder, and paste the ""msgFilterRules.dat"" file there. After that, when you launch Thunderbird on Linux Mint, it should pick up your filters along with your mail data. If you encounter any hiccups, don't hesitate to ask for more help. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

You might not face any big problems, but in case you do, here's what you can try: First, make sure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Sometimes, updating can resolve compatibility issues. If you notice any glitches, consider tweaking Thunderbird's settings to better fit your KDE environment. You can do this by going into the Preferences/Settings and exploring the Appearance or Themes sections. Also, keep an eye on Thunderbird's official support resources or the community forums – they're a great place to find solutions and tips for any KDE-specific issues you might come across. Hope this helps! If you still face any troubles, don't hesitate to ask for more help on our forums. </p>",suram080,false,0,1
