It sounds like you're having trouble adding <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> accounts to Thunderbird. Don't worry, we've got you covered! The issue might be related to some security settings on your <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> account. Firstly, ensure you've enabled IMAP or POP access from your Outlook settings. Then, try setting up the account again in Thunderbird, making sure you're using the correct server settings (IMAP: <a href=""http://imap-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap-mail.outlook.com</a>, Port: 993; POP: <a href=""http://pop-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail.outlook.com</a>, Port: 995). Also, make sure you're using the right username (your full <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email address) and password. If you're still facing issues, it's a good idea to temporarily disable any antivirus or firewall software that might be causing conflicts. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes! If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

Create a subfolder of Local Folders in TB, name it e.g. WLMimported.  Size the TB and Explorer windows so they each occupy half the screen.  Select the eml files in the folder (Ctrl+A to select all), then add them to WLMimported by drag and drop. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

To migrate your Thunderbird setup and filters from Windows to Linux Mint, you're on the right track with moving the mail data and profile. For the missing filters issue, you're correct that the filters' details are stored in ""D:\ThunderbirdMail\ImapMail\<a href=""http://imap.googlemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.googlemail.com</a>\msgFilterRules.dat"". To get your filters working on Linux Mint, you'll want to copy this ""msgFilterRules.dat"" file to the appropriate profile directory on Linux. Since you're using the profile ""x1ua9znr.default-release,"" navigate to your Thunderbird profile directory on Linux, find the corresponding ""ImapMail"" folder, and paste the ""msgFilterRules.dat"" file there. After that, when you launch Thunderbird on Linux Mint, it should pick up your filters along with your mail data. If you encounter any hiccups, don't hesitate to ask for more help. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

It's great that you've already taken some steps to troubleshoot. Since you mentioned that deleting emails helped temporarily, it's possible there might have been a server glitch. Sometimes these things sort out with time. To further troubleshoot, you could try restarting Thunderbird, checking your account settings to ensure they're correct, and also verifying if any add-ons are causing conflicts. You might also want to clear your cache. Remember, these things can be a bit tricky, but with some patience, you'll likely get it back on track! </p>",suram080,false,0,0

You might not face any big problems, but in case you do, here's what you can try: First, make sure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Sometimes, updating can resolve compatibility issues. If you notice any glitches, consider tweaking Thunderbird's settings to better fit your KDE environment. You can do this by going into the Preferences/Settings and exploring the Appearance or Themes sections. Also, keep an eye on Thunderbird's official support resources or the community forums â€“ they're a great place to find solutions and tips for any KDE-specific issues you might come across. Hope this helps! If you still face any troubles, don't hesitate to ask for more help on our forums. </p>",suram080,false,0,1
