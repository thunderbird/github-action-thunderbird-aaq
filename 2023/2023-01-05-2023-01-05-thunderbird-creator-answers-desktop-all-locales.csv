I have a long existing account, hosted by godaddy.  They forced me to move to Office365.  Actually I have multiple accounts with multiple domains at godaddy in this situation.  </p><p>Recently one of the accounts quit working.  It would pop up with a demand that I enter the password.  Password entries all failed.   I was able to continue accessing the email via Office365 web interface using my normal password. </p><p>I tried talking to godaddy support which was a waste of time. </p><p>I cross checked all of my settings with other email accounts to make sure this one wasn't set up strangely.  It was not, and changes didn't help. </p><p>The breakthrough was to mangle the existing account settings to give myself a faulty email address (I could have just deleted the account in T-Bird), then go through the new account auto setup.  Using the same password as always, that worked fine.  Now I am using it again just like I was. </p><p>Enough has happened that my memory is not exact, but I believe that there was a ""choose a new password"" dialog that I had to brush off when I first went to web interface after the first failing of T-bird.  So my suspicion is that there is some kind of old-password dialog going on with Office365 that T-bird is not handling well.  I did not have to change my password, I'm still using the same one.  So maybe it was my imagination.  But still have that niggle in my mind that it was a password age issue. </p><p>I did the usual google searching in my effort to find relief and it seems to me this problem between T-bird and Office365 is a regular recurring issue.  It stays around for awhile and then evaporates (or the user gives up).   </p><p>I believe there is a real problem under there somewhere. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1558056;1726848;,SumoBot
