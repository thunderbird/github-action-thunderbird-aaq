Surely there should at least be a hotlink to a web source where one could search topics as there is in Firefox!  I had to do a google search to get some where for help!

Generally, everything works just fine - I can see and edit events and tasks. </p><p>However, there is one issue: When I'm sent an invitation, I don't see those calendars listed in the ""Select calendar"" dialog that shows when I click on ""Accept"". </p><p>When I click on ""More""-&gt;""Save copy"", they are displayed. </p><p>What I tried/verified: - The calendars are not write-protected. - Each calendar has an associated email address. - Each email address is only associated to a single calendar. </p><p>Do you have an idea why Thunderbird doesn't show those calendars in the ""Accept"" dialog? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1573780;1573781;1575514;,mozilla415

But it won't go. I press the down arrow to move down through the inbox and I see there are unread messages. But ""T"" doesn't work anymore. So I figure I'll close and reopen TB and maybe it'll fix itself.  </p><p>But when I reopen TB, all my profiles are gone!! Instead of going into TB, Profile Manager is opened, and there's NOTHING in the list! No Default; No Default-Release. Nothing. Just a blank list!! </p><p>I go to C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles, and I see there's a default-release folder. And under its Mail subfolder, I see the two subfolders for my two email accounts, and a Local Folders subfolder, and a smart mailboxes subfolder. My Inbox files are both there and both seem to be the right size. </p><p>So it seems to still be there. But in profile manager, there's nothing in the list. default-release exists and it's in the right place.

I have TBird installed on one Windows desktop and three windows laptops using POP3 and I want to change the accounts to use IMAP. Doing so should save me time having to manually delete the same emails on all machines. If I do not save the emails etc before I switch the accounts from POP to IMAP what, if anything, will I lose? My primary email accounts are Gmail. Some are personal and some are business. Switching those to IMAP is simply a few mouse clicks in the Gmail webmail settings. But changing TBird accounts to IMAP is a whole new kettle of fish, I imagine.

My purpose is to create an historic archive of essential emails from my recently deceased father's gmail account that I will be able to access after I delete his account. So I went from Google Takeout to a download of his emails in mbox format to creating a Thunderbird account in which all his gmail messages that we want to retain are now legible and accessible. </p><p>But ...... will I still be able to access these messages in Thunderbird if I proceed with the final step of deleting the original gmail account? I don't dare proceed with deletion until you can confirm that the messages will remain accessible after deletion of the core account, which is no longer needed. </p><p>I appreciate your assistance with this. I was unable to find an article or FAQ that addressed this question, so thanks in advance for your help. </p><p>Sincerely yours, </p><p>Joel Charny jrcharny@gmail.com </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1573834;,jrcharny
