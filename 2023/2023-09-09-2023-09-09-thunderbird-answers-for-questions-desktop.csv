And examining other parameters.  Other recent problems with Thunderbird include not being able to change font colors;  not being able to accurately determine acceptable non-junk emails;  not properly determining read and unread emails;  having no distinguishing font characteristics like bold/non-bold and color differentiation for read and unread emails;  failing to go from a  Thunderbird email to a website within a given email; etc.  It seems that the version 115.x.x was not thoroughly tested.
