Now the majority of the screen is taken up with a list of messages with only a small box on the right for the actual message.""  which leaves plenty of room for guessing. </p><p>Thunderbird V115 has instituted as default a ""view""  which has been available for more than a decade.  The vertical view.  This copies the outlook layout of having three columns across the screen.  One with folders,  the next with a list of mails and finally the actual content.  Personally I find this entirely frustrating as I left the outlook fold to get away from exactly this sort of mess. </p><p>Fortunately you can still change the ""View"" using the  <img class=""wiki-image frameless"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2017-10-22-15-37-15-18c775.png"" alt=""Fx57Menu"" title=""""> &gt; View and selecting either the wide or classic view.  These two layouts have very little difference, until you enable the reading pane (f8) at which point the wide view utilises the entire bottom of the screen for email and the classic view only uses the part below the message list.  The folder list reaching from the bottom to the top of the screen on the left. </p><p>Version 115 also changes the way we see emails into this new card view.  I find it entirely useless as most of my email in threaded and the card view fails on that dismally.  SO I have reverted to the good old list view.  To change this setting one has to have the ""Message header"" pane enabled. <img class=""wiki-image frameless"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2017-10-22-15-37-15-18c775.png"" alt=""Fx57Menu"" title=""""> &gt; View &gt; folder pane header.
