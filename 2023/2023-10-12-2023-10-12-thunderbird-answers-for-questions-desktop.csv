Interestingly enough, TB and Hotmail are using the same Junk folder, probably because I have the TB junk settings set to use the ""Junk"" folder. Perhaps TB is smart enough to recognize Hotmail's use of Junk as the Spam folder name. Anyway, that would account for things in the Junk folder that shouldn't have been. </p><p>FWIW Hotmail's junk settings are abysmal. There's no way (I have found yet) to click on the sender's name and include them in your whitelist. Apparently each has to be typed in. </p><p>Oh well, it looks like I'll have to run my script regularly on the Junk folder, to resurrect messages I didn't want junked.
