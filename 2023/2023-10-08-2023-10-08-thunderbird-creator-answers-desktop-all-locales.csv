The counters that are displayed against the inbox folders and at the head of the message pane only return to zero after coming out of Thunderbird, maybe even closing and restarting. Similarly emptying the deleted items does not reset the counter immediately (so it still shows a number of emails even though there are none.) I am using unified view if that makes any difference. Is this a bug or am I doing something silly? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",old_nic

I have been programming for over 20 years so, yeah! I do have a clue as to at least some of the problems, issues, complexity etc. On the other hand I am a sole developer trying to do this so clearly I am completely insane. Sorry for the jokes. </p><p>So micro-payments. Perhaps the largest problem with the internet is that there is no business model that works very well for the kind of market that is the internet. The internet is a *very-high-volume*, *very-low-cost* market. Some open source repositories have *millions* of downloads a week, but the maintainers make no money from them. Why? Because there is no economically feasible way for 1 million people to pay $0.0001.  </p><p>We all suffer from clickbait because it is the only thing that comes close. You don't have users pay, you have advertisers pay because you track people and can target them. At this point we may be starting to realize exactly how damaging this targeting can be. To quote twitter code ""if isDemocrat show DemocratFiles, elseif Republican show RepublicanFiles.""  </p><p>So what to do? Come up with a way so that open source maintainers can charge $0.01 (USD) for downloading a copy of a library. Or perhaps even less. There are many issues with making this work and I would be happy to discuss my thinking. Probably the largest issue is that any micro-payment system would need to be tied to a sticky identity. Like a phone number.  This should raise alarm bells about privacy, but what if the sticky identity server just passed out random ids? AFf9fdazfsdaf talks to 9fzf8834489faa, for example.  </p><p>Okay sticky ids now come present anonymous identities and so anonymous miscreants can now ride into town, rob the bank and run off. Except if you have a stick ID, what about attaching a reputation to that ID? </p><p>As you can tell this whole think gets pretty complicated pretty fast. On the other hand we have the openid, login with apple, login with google kind of stuff that demonstrates that the technology works. The way it is used is a problem, but login with Apple lets sites get sort of sticky IDs and tied to phones. Just not all phones. </p><p>On a practical note, I am trying to build a community newspaper that uses micro payments. So people can buy a copy of the newspaper online for $0.10 USD. That is my target use case for micro payments and sticky ID's.  </p><p>But it sure would be nice to have some other eyes and some other use cases, for example what about a micro-payment based kick starter program to build new features in firefox or thunderbird? Etc. </p><p>So if you have anyone or know of anyone I would be very glad to talk. </p><p>I read something at Y-combinator once about the what makes Silicon Valley different from many places. They said when someone there heard a new idea, the reaction was  </p><p>""If this did work what would that be like?"" </p><p>So if micro payments were available, what would that be like for Mozilla? </p><p>Thanks Terry Braun tab@tabraun.com </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tab43
