I decided to install the flatpak version,  as I don't like appimages, and that is what the standard version appeared to be. It seems there's no deb or rpm versino any more. But when I started it it did not open my existing profile, but instead offered to create a new profile. I started it with the ""-P"" option, and my existing profile was not displayed on the list.  I tried everything I could think of but I could not get TB to open my profile. So I installed the appimage version, and it worked fine. It didn't immediately recognise my profile so I had to start it with the ""-p"" option but my profile was in the list, and from then on every time I started TB it started with my profile.  So why doesn't the flatpak version find my profile? Is there something I've missed? All advice gratefully received. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",mogplus8
