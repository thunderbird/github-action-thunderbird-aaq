Happens as well in the 102.x as the new 115.x branch: </p><p>i have noticed, that every time I get an e-mail from outside my timezone, which is UTC+2, and I then want to forward this e-mail, the format of the forwarded date-header is different from what the timestamp is in my inbox. For example: I receive an e-mail on Thu, 24th May, 2012 at 17.57 (this is what is the timestamp in my inbox). I forward that e-mail, the date-header is Thu, 24 May 2012 08:57:20 -0700. </p><p>Well, UTC+2 and UTC-7 means 9 hours time shift. This is plausible, the person, which sent me that mail has his office somewhere in SFBA, so he will probably have started his day at around 8am and not long after have replied to me. So for me, the date-header in the forwarded message is valid, and the origin time of sender plausible. </p><p>How ever, I'd rather have also in the forwarded mail the translated local time then the origin-sender time + Timeshift. Not everybody can, want or has time to calculate timezones... So this is my question: Can I parametrize thunderbird, so that it displays the date-header in the localtime format so that it matches the one from my inbox? </p><p>Thank for your help, regards, Felix </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",felix.joussein

I decided to install the flatpak version,  as I don't like appimages, and that is what the standard version appeared to be. It seems there's no deb or rpm versino any more. But when I started it it did not open my existing profile, but instead offered to create a new profile. I started it with the ""-P"" option, and my existing profile was not displayed on the list.  I tried everything I could think of but I could not get TB to open my profile. So I installed the appimage version, and it worked fine. It didn't immediately recognise my profile so I had to start it with the ""-p"" option but my profile was in the list, and from then on every time I started TB it started with my profile.  So why doesn't the flatpak version find my profile? Is there something I've missed? All advice gratefully received. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",mogplus8
