Have used TB for 25 years.   </p><p>Running on an HP Desktop (mini-tower) PC running Windows 10, fully updated per last Microsoft update </p><p>The Default Profile (which I have renamed ""Personal"") worked fine after starting PC that morning.  Later that day, with TB continuing to run, the Inbox and other folders disappeared fromn the screen.   </p><p>I have two other profiles that open fine and work normally, but the Personal profile does not.  Below are the details. </p><p>TB was still showin on the Task Bar, but nothing was visible on the viewing part of the monitor screen.  The icon on the Task Bar was unresponsive to left and center clicks, but a right click popped up a list of several .jpg files.  When I clicked on any one of those files, an empty ""Create"" email box opened, ready for composing.  But frame showing existing Inbox and other folders did not launch. </p><p>Shutting down TB and reopening the same profile momentarily showing the words ""Inbox"", then shows ""Address Book."" As I am writing this now, I see ""Address Book - Mozill..."" on the Task Bar, but clicking on it does not take me there.   </p><p>When navigating using Alt-Tab to rotate through the open programs, when I get to ""Address Book,""  I can see a thumbnail of the address book, but it will not open when I try to stop there. </p><p>I found the three folders containing each profile's files.  Comparing the three, all files seem to be present. </p><p>I need help badly, because this Personal profile has 99% of all my emails in it from four email addresses. </p><p>Thank you.

Happens as well in the 102.x as the new 115.x branch: </p><p>i have noticed, that every time I get an e-mail from outside my timezone, which is UTC+2, and I then want to forward this e-mail, the format of the forwarded date-header is different from what the timestamp is in my inbox. For example: I receive an e-mail on Thu, 24th May, 2012 at 17.57 (this is what is the timestamp in my inbox). I forward that e-mail, the date-header is Thu, 24 May 2012 08:57:20 -0700. </p><p>Well, UTC+2 and UTC-7 means 9 hours time shift. This is plausible, the person, which sent me that mail has his office somewhere in SFBA, so he will probably have started his day at around 8am and not long after have replied to me. So for me, the date-header in the forwarded message is valid, and the origin time of sender plausible. </p><p>How ever, I'd rather have also in the forwarded mail the translated local time then the origin-sender time + Timeshift. Not everybody can, want or has time to calculate timezones... So this is my question: Can I parametrize thunderbird, so that it displays the date-header in the localtime format so that it matches the one from my inbox? </p><p>Thank for your help, regards, Felix </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",felix.joussein

I decided to install the flatpak version,  as I don't like appimages, and that is what the standard version appeared to be. It seems there's no deb or rpm versino any more. But when I started it it did not open my existing profile, but instead offered to create a new profile. I started it with the ""-P"" option, and my existing profile was not displayed on the list.  I tried everything I could think of but I could not get TB to open my profile. So I installed the appimage version, and it worked fine. It didn't immediately recognise my profile so I had to start it with the ""-p"" option but my profile was in the list, and from then on every time I started TB it started with my profile.  So why doesn't the flatpak version find my profile? Is there something I've missed?
