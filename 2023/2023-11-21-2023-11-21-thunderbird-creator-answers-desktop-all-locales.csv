Regardless, at some point, something got corrupted and it ask me to create a new account rather than showing all my old ones. I was able to import into seamonkey and it has all my accounts and folders. Thunderbird has the emails e.g. if I search it will pop, but the accounts/folders aren't showing. I might have updated Thunderbird as well but I can't tell you if that was part of me trying to fix or before, possibly a cause? </p><p>%du -h --max-depth=0 .mozilla/seamonkey/5acxdfjg.default 9.2G    .mozilla/seamonkey/5acxdfjg.default %du -h --max-depth=0 .thunderbird/68hg5gdd.default-release 21G     .thunderbird/68hg5gdd.default-release </p><p>I need to get this fixed. I don't want to move either profile completely as I don't have a large drive anyway and now, many of the emails are duplicated. Can I try replacing files? Which file(s) hold account info... even if I try importing...I need to avoid moving emails.... I'll just run out of room...maybe it was while updating... I just don't know it's been a few days... </p><p>Can someone confirm that the default-release directory ...is the profile directory? This help isn't organized well, so searching brings up old answers that may or may not be valid for my release. I know, I have the information and I don't want to start over...  </p><p>%lsb_release -a Distributor ID: Ubuntu Description:    Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS Release:        22.04 Codename:       jammy %thunderbird -v Thunderbird 115.4.3 </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1619117;,larrysjunk
