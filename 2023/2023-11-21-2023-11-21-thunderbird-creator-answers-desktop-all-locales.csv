So if I push ""delete"" again, some other area of the text will be deleted. See attached images, recorded in Thunderbird in ""Troubleshoot mode"" to make sure all add-ons were disabled (and in version 115.4.3). I believe the cursor moves backwards by a number of characters equal to the number of characters deleted. </p><p>When I use the ""backspace"" key, the cursor moves back by one (i.e. it stays in place once the word and preceding space are deleted). Also, if I double-click a word, erase it, then command-Z to undo (erased word remains highlighted) then forward delete, this time it will correctly delete the highlighted word and leave the cursor in place (but no extra space before is deleted). </p><p>I would like to use the ""delete"" key in situations where I need to delete a portion of text. Double-clicking on the first word to delete is very quick, then I hit delete multiple times to erase all I want, I find this faster than click, drag to highlight all the text I want to erase and no more, then delete. But with the cursor jumping back, it messes up my text and I need to re-type. </p><p>I have not tested the latest Thunderbird in a Windows environment. I know MacOS keyboards do not have naturally a forward delete key, but with an external USB keyboard, we can get that easily. </p><p>Is this something others have experienced? I could not find anything similar with a quick search in the support section. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",vincent41

It appears from my update history that 115.2.3 was the most stable of the 115 versions. I'd rather go back to 102 but it seems that the profile was modified in 115 so that it is no longer compatible with 102. Thus a 102 rollback might require quite a bit of work to reimport the profile into a clean install. And I have gigabytes of important mail. </p><p>I'm not on 115.4.3 and it is close to unusable, as they screwed up regression in a major bug, and my bugzilla on it has sat unanswered, other than requesting I be nice to the devs. So as a lower-risk option might be to roll back from 115.4.3 to 115.2.3.  Has anyone tried anything like that, or know the safest way? I don't know what booby traps they've planted to prevent any rollbacks.
