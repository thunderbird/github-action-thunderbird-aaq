Regardless, at some point, something got corrupted and it ask me to create a new account rather than showing all my old ones. I was able to import into seamonkey and it has all my accounts and folders. Thunderbird has the emails e.g. if I search it will pop, but the accounts/folders aren't showing. I might have updated Thunderbird as well but I can't tell you if that was part of me trying to fix or before, possibly a cause? </p><p>%du -h --max-depth=0 .mozilla/seamonkey/5acxdfjg.default 9.2G    .mozilla/seamonkey/5acxdfjg.default %du -h --max-depth=0 .thunderbird/68hg5gdd.default-release 21G     .thunderbird/68hg5gdd.default-release </p><p>I need to get this fixed. I don't want to move either profile completely as I don't have a large drive anyway and now, many of the emails are duplicated. Can I try replacing files?

I just don't know it's been a few days... </p><p>Can someone confirm that the default-release directory ...is the profile directory?

It's been very unreliable with my collection of RSS feeds assembled in Thunderbird over the past ~15+ years. So I've been working on recreating my feeds account and after a few times it's been working more reliably with my 200+ RSS feeds. But I've noticed the behavior of the RSS feeds only updating every 100 minutes or so per the new default.  </p><p>I did re-import my feeds after changing the account settings default of ""Check for every new messages"" to say every 10 minutes rather than every 100 minutes, but it didn't affect existing feeds or new feeds added after that point. </p><p>As a longtime Thunderbird fan it's been quite frustrating especially with long relying on the RSS feeds. Is there anyway to force-override how often all RSS feeds are updated? Or any guidance to where those individual settings are stored so I can find/replace the values all much more quickly than updating on a per-feed basis? </p><p>Thanks many, Michael </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",michael644

I click on the bar at the right of the Date field header and drag it to the right. All columns to the left are widened.  The Date column barely widens.   I click the side of the window and widen it. All columns widen (not a problem). Date widens a bit.  I try to widen it using the bar at the right of the field.  Same trouble. I widen the window to full width of the screen.  Same trouble. The names of months with shorter names show in full, but not, for example, 'November'. Still can't see date on some; can't see year or time on any. I move the window to the left so all columns are off the screen except Date, Total, and Location. I widen Data. Correspondents appears on the screen (I guess that all columns are being widened). I widen the window all the way to the right of the screen. Now Recipient and Correspondents show, very wide, mostly blank (when there is only one name); there is a very wide column to the left, all blank, the column name invisible off the screen to the left.  I can now see most Data data, but, for example, 'November 11, 2023, at 10:2'.  I push the window further to the left off the screen.  I now see Correspondents (mostly blank to the right of a single name (the one I searched for), Date, Total, and Location; I see the date and time in full. I can't see any column to the left of Correspondents; in particular, can't see Subject. I move the window all the way to the right edge of the screen again. Now I can see the ""blank column,"" Recipient, and Correspondents (mostly blank space), Date with all dates and times showing in full, Total always blank), and Location (short mailbox names, so all show in full. </p><p>Why was this design chosen by the project? What was wrong with the ability to change the width of any column without affecting the others? Why was the decision made to not have a scroll bar on the bottom? </p><p>Thanks in advance for responses from the team. </p><p>Cordially, Joaquin </p><p>There is not scroll bar at the bottom, so I can move the data in the window back and forth. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",joaquin.oakland
