Regardless, at some point, something got corrupted and it ask me to create a new account rather than showing all my old ones. I was able to import into seamonkey and it has all my accounts and folders. Thunderbird has the emails e.g. if I search it will pop, but the accounts/folders aren't showing. I might have updated Thunderbird as well but I can't tell you if that was part of me trying to fix or before, possibly a cause? </p><p>%du -h --max-depth=0 .mozilla/seamonkey/5acxdfjg.default 9.2G    .mozilla/seamonkey/5acxdfjg.default %du -h --max-depth=0 .thunderbird/68hg5gdd.default-release 21G     .thunderbird/68hg5gdd.default-release </p><p>I need to get this fixed. I don't want to move either profile completely as I don't have a large drive anyway and now, many of the emails are duplicated. Can I try replacing files?

I just don't know it's been a few days... </p><p>Can someone confirm that the default-release directory ...is the profile directory? This help isn't organized well, so searching brings up old answers that may or may not be valid for my release.

It's been very unreliable with my collection of RSS feeds assembled in Thunderbird over the past ~15+ years. So I've been working on recreating my feeds account and after a few times it's been working more reliably with my 200+ RSS feeds. But I've noticed the behavior of the RSS feeds only updating every 100 minutes or so per the new default.  </p><p>I did re-import my feeds after changing the account settings default of ""Check for every new messages"" to say every 10 minutes rather than every 100 minutes, but it didn't affect existing feeds or new feeds added after that point. </p><p>As a longtime Thunderbird fan it's been quite frustrating especially with long relying on the RSS feeds. Is there anyway to force-override how often all RSS feeds are updated? Or any guidance to where those individual settings are stored so I can find/replace the values all much more quickly than updating on a per-feed basis? </p><p>Thanks many, Michael </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",michael644
