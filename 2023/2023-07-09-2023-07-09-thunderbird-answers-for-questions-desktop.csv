When opened, it had all my email accounts intact and I figured I wanted a complete uninstall.   Removed the accounts (only 3 of them) then uninstalled. Opened TBird and reconfigged for the 3 email accounts I use. </p><p>Went to my primary account and started a new email - ""Write""  Entered email address, subject and the word 'test' in the message body. Started a new line, went to file manager, found an image, copied it, went to the new email message pasted the image and . . . NOTHING!!!!! it still does not work!!

If you have another word processor program, use that. It won't work in an ordinary text editor like Notepad. Try copying a small pic and pasting it into that word processor program on a page.

I've been using Tbird since the beginning of time - and the procedure you outlined is exactly how I normally do it. - all the way down to win-v to check if I need to see if the image is in the clipboard - sop </p><p>Hence the reason for my posting my problem here.   It is not doing what I am expecting it to do. When I Ctrl-V into the email message body, nothing happens except for the cursor jumps up to a single line space.   that's it  I see no image or outline box, nothing.   Similarly, using the menu insert/image. After selecting the file, all that shows in the message body is an outline, no picture and if I send it - same thing appears in the received email, outline box and no image. </p>",rlgrafx,false,0,0

There was the picture that I had copied. So then I sent that message with a picture in it to myself, and a moment later, when the message arrived, I opened it, and there was the picture. </p><p>Successful experiment, as Dr. Frankenstein would say. </p><p>I'd like you to try again, but this time, to be sure that the picture you Ctr-C'd (copied) is IN THE CLIPBOARD before you try to paste it, use the Windows key + V to see the contents of the clipboard. If the picture is there, and right at the top, then close that panel, go into your TBird, address a message to yourself, type some text in the message panel, and Ctrl-V to paste the pic, and if that doesn't work immediately, right-click and choose Paste. Then Send. </p><p>If the picture copied and pasted and the message comes back to you with the picture in it. All's well. </p><p>Otherwise, come back and tell us what happened.
