Thunderbird can and will sync with your IMAP server, but not with <a href=""http://contacts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">contacts.google.com</a>. The syncing thing you want is just plain impossible, so far as I can see. I just went to <a href=""http://contacts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">contacts.google.com</a> to look over the landscape, and when I asked it to show me my contacts, the list was exactly and only my GMail contacts list, which is synced with my TBird Address Book. Any change I make in my TBird Address Book goes directly to my GMail contacts list, and v.-v. But that's because my mail server is GMail. I was able with a click on an icon top-right-ish at <a href=""http://contacts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">contacts.google.com</a> to Export (UP arrow with a square bracket under it) as .csv, and then I could have imported that file (which contacts.google put directly into my default downloads directory in Windows without my telling it where to put it) directly into my TB addy book had I wished to, but of course I didn't because what I exported from Contacts is exactly what I already have in my TB addy book.

Select a message in your Inbox and type Shift+j (=cap J), and it will be marked Not Junk, and the filter learns from that action.

I think I need to go to my ISP's website and access my mail from there and then ""Mark as Spam"" before they know I've marked it.

The 2nd screenshot requires the ""Message Pane"" view, and using that view automatically opens any message which is highlighted.  If you want to weed out junk email before opening it (to stop web beacons and other trackers from letting the sender know it was opened), you cannot use ""Message Pane"" view if you need to view the headers to confirm whether something is spam or if it's from a legitimate sender. </p>",ajp1228,false,1,0

Personal Privacy has moved on in recent years. Do you really think that Thunderbird is that insecure? Thunderbird by default does not allow remote content. And if you are still not convinced you do realise you can go into Offline mode and read the emails in perfect safety. If they are bad then delete emails and compact folders before you go back to online mode. </p><p>But if you have deliberately changed the default settings in Thunderbird in order to allow remote content then opening an email may send tracker info back to source.

The area it displays in is called the 'Message Pane' and it contains an opened email.  </p><p>There is no difference between opening an email in the 'Message Pane' or in a new 'Tab' or in a new 'window'.
