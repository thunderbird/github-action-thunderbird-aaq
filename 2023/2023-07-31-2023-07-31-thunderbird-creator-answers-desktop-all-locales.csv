Ho questo problema: quando allego un PDF alla mail in uscita, non riesco ad aprirlo per ""controllarlo"" prima di spedirlo; appare un messaggio warning che dice che ""il programma non è associato e dovrei andare nelle impostazioni per associarlo"" Apro normalmente quelli in arrivo (col doppio click sopra - oppure con ""tasto destro + Apri""). Ho controllato nelle impostazioni ed associato il programma di lettura PDF (Kofax Power PDF). Per fare delle prove ho usato anche altri lettori Adobe ed ho lo stesso problema. Se imposto ""visualizza anteprima in Thunderbird"" funziona ... ma non è quello che voglio. Se imposto ""chiedi che programma usare"" il problema rimane: i PDF arrivati me li fa aprire, i PDF che allego ai miei messaggi e vorrei aprire prima di spedirli, non li apre ... Qualcuno mi sa aiutare&nbsp;? Grazie fin d'ora Tamara </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,it,1594304;1594308;,t.dalto
