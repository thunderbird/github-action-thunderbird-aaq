Durante problemas de atualização do sistema, fiz errroneamente atualização parcial do sistema. Em resumo, terei que fazer reinstalação do Manjaro. Estou resgatando todo o conteúdo do SSD. A minha outra preocupação está nas confirmações das pastas / abas do meu Thunderbird. Faço uso do Gmail. Por questões profissionais tive que criar várias pastas e subpastas e preciso levar essa configuração para o Thunderbird no lapto reinataldo. Tem como? Ou essa configuração será automática pois as pastas ficam também configuradas no Gmail? Obrigado. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,pt-BR,"",johnb.acad

What are the possibilities now for changing the appearance so that it looks like it was before?,<p>The screenshot shows version 102. Many people already know what Thunderbird looks like now. What can be done at the moment? I have not set up accounts with mailboxes yet and there are no messages. I'm afraid there will be surprises too... Look at those huge buttons in the upper right corner and the generally thick panel. Why are they like this? 9_9 </p><p>Thank you! </p>,customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",booya
