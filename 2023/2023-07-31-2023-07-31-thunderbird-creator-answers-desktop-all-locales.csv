I actually like the spaces toolbar and would like to use it to navigate through my main spaces (mail, calendar, address book). Ideally, when I want to change the space, e. g. from Mail to Calendar, the currently open tab should be reused. Otherwise I don't get the purpose of the spaces toolbar. If all spaces are opened in a new tab then I can use the tabs to switch between the space and the spaces toolbar gets useless. </p><p>In my opinion it would be nice to have an option to open spaces selected in the spaces toolbar in the current tab. In my case I would usually have just one tab open which is fortunately hidden and the layout is nice and clean.  </p><p>Or is there already such an option. </p><p>Many thanks eyght </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",eyght
