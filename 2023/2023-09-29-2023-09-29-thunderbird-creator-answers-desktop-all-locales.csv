Firstly, thanks for the help on the previous topic, it really helped. Second, I'm perfectly aaware of the thunderbird groups io service for the blind. In spite of having posted there multiple times, my message is waiting for approval from the moderators, I don't know why. This issue has been bugging me for days, and I'd appreciate a solution. And when I mean solution, I don't mean things described in a visual way, such as do this and this with the mouse. If there are any visually impaired users that use jaws or NVDA here, I'd really appreciate it if you can help. Okay, now onto my problem. The problem is copying attachments from a file that somebody sent me. Yes, I know there is the save as or save all attachments option, and the attachment extractor tool, but that's not what I'm talking about. My problem is this I open the email. I go to the toggle button and press it with the enter key. There the list of attachments shows. Rather than having to click save as and brows for the folder I want, I want to be able to copy the attachment to the clipboard and then paste it into the folder of my choosing as it is sometimes more efficient than having to brows, especially if you need to paste 5 different attachments in five different folders. I know outlook can do this. So I have two files in the attachments list from the test message I sent myself. I press control c to copy and paste into the folder. Though it copies the last attachment file, I can't copy the first file. So the first file I have is a siron sound effect, and the second is a song. The song file, which is the last, it is pasted into the folder I want. However, when I arrow to the first file, which my talking program can read, it reads the file. But when I press control c to copy it to the clipboard, it doesn't copy for some reason. What can I do to get around this issue? Is there an addon that can help? Also, please give keyboard only solutions. If there isn't an addon that can fix this, would someone kindly make an addon for this for the benefit of everybody else? I know outlook has this feature so I thought it would be good if thunderbird also has it. Best regards, Muhammad. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",muhammed3198
