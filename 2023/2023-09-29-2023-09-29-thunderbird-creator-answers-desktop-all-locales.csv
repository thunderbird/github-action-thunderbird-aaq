My use case is as follows: </p><p>I use Thunderbird as my primary email client to manage my Gmail account. I have a large number of messages in my Gmail inbox, and I am trying to archive older ones to free up space in the inbox and keep it manageable. </p><p>Here’s the workflow I am following: </p><pre>   I archive a set of older messages from my Gmail inbox (e.g., messages older than six months).    Later, I decide I need some of those archived messages back in the inbox. I move those selected messages back to the Inbox using Gmail’s web interface.    I notice that Thunderbird synchronizes these 'recently moved' messages back to the Inbox, even though they are older messages, seeming to prioritize them in the synchronization process. </pre> <p>My issue is that these 'recently moved' but older messages appear to be treated as recent by Thunderbird, getting synchronized, while other messages that are indeed more recent (by reception date) aren't immediately synchronized. </p><p>My questions are: </p><pre>   Is there a way to make Thunderbird synchronize strictly based on reception date and not on when messages were moved or modified?    Are there specific settings I should adjust in Thunderbird to achieve this desired synchronization behavior? </pre> <p>I appreciate your help and guidance in advance. I've gone through the documentation and support forums but haven't found a clear answer to this specific issue </p><p>Thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1606835;,julian.fernandez

I've created 2 new <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> accounts. </p><p>I've got both gmail accounts functioning in Thunderbird properly. </p><p>Here's my 2 issues... 1-I used to be able to hit ""get messages"" and have all 7 of my accounts checked with 1 click. Now I have to click the arrow beside ""get messages"" and select ""get all"". Is there some way to default the stupid button to just check everything? </p><p>2-I have a ""local folders"" folder, followed by a LOT of sub folders. Instead of using the ""inbox"" in local folders, both of my gmail accounts have their own folders and I can't seem to find a way to make them use the local folders collection. When I set up the accounts in Thunderbird I selected the choice to store emails on my PC and not to sync with gmail. </p><p>I'd love some help.

Sometimes when msg within a thread is deleted, instead of it 'disappearing', it is replaced by an empty message dated 1Jan70.

Work-around is to re-start TB, and affected threads become corrected.
