Subject column width will not go wider than about one-fifth of Tbird window width; dragging handle goes to almost one-third width but once released, snaps back to about one-fifth of window width. Date column width will not go smaller than about one-third of window width. Can still shrink From | Recipient columns however doing so only increases Date to be about HALF of Tbird window width. </p><p>115.3.0 breaks Tbird for me.  Thinking I need to go back to 102.15.1 via Time Machine unless this bug can be identified and addressed. </p><p>Thanks for any help. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dave321

If I go to the providers ""Webmail"" site I can generate and send emails. Error message I get is as follows The mail server responded: mf-505: Sender Policy - Relay Denied. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. I have iinet as the server provider. I have checked their recommended SMTP settings and they are correct. Nothing else has changed since the day before yesterday. No upgrades that I am aware of, so very confused. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",fraserd98
