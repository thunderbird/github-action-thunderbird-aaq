When I get an E-Mail with an Invite or Appointment, it says: ""No wirable calendars are configured for invitations, please check the calendar properties."" But for addon calendars it is not possible to assign an e-mail address. And even if it was, I wouldn't be able to assign it to multiple mail accounts. </p><p>However, when I save the attached ics file and then open it with Thunderbird, I'm able to select my calendar. It would be nice to skip the save the attachment and reopen it in Thunderbird part and just be able to add the appointment to the calendars... </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",agowa

I had to use Task Manager to close it and then reboot the PC to get back into Thunderbird. Now I can't send emails or save drafts. I've tried repairing folders and compacting. I've tried deleting the drafts folder from the profile and I've tried pointing the account to a different drafts folder.
