However the mouse wheel does work, scrolling through the folders tree view. Looking very closely it looks like there something like a one pixel high dialog on the screen but trying to send Enter or esc to it makes no difference. Clicking on it makes it flash as if it's being redrawn. I've captured a short video to demonstrate. <a href=""https://Navigator.tinytake.com/msc/ODYwMDIxOF8yMTk1NDIyMw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://Navigator.tinytake.com/msc/ODYwMDIxOF8yMTk1NDIyMw</a> Once this happens the only solution is to kill the task via task manager. </p><p>[later] I have eventually managed to resize this one pixel high dialog (using some old forgotten keyboard shortcuts), but it's just a grey dialog with no text (see image). </p><p>Oddly if I close it, then I can redirect the mouse scroll bar to either the folder pane, the inbox pane or the actual message pane by clicking in them, but I can't click on any specific folder/email, nor on the menus. Closing the dialog doesn't allow the filters to continue. </p><p>Any suggestions/solutions&nbsp;?
