I have tried to eliminate it in the thunderbird options and then when I click to send the email it asks me for the password and to perform Microsoft two-step authentication. It authenticates me correctly but after a few seconds I get that login error message again. I have changed the password in Microsoft, I have deleted it in thunderbird, I have logged in again and nothing. All equal. </p><p>The configuration is correctly detected by Thunderbird when I select the IMAP mail mode.

In the Azure configuration, I have the application correctly created, with its ID and the 4 permissions it asks for have been approved at the administrator level. In the connection log of that application, it appears that I have been logged in correctly when Thunderbird asks me for the credentials. </p><p>I'm running out of ideas. I have contacted Microsoft support but they tell me that they do not support other applications and that I should look for my life (with kinder words).

It could be harder to compact folders if they are too large; compacting removes all traces of previously moved and deleted emails thus helping to reduce file size and maintain a healthy file. It is much harder to open very large text files should you ever need to try and rescue emails; in some cases it can crash a computer due to the excessive use of RAM.  Suggest each year you 'Archive' the sent emails.

I found a help file called Automatic Account Configuration that stated that IMAP is more modern and allows me to keep mail on both the server and local machine. That sounds like I would need to open webmail occasionally and manually delete old mail. That looks safer than POP mail where I might not realize that deleting local mail also may delete the same mail on the server. </p><p>Yours, Michael F </p>",Mike_NH,false,0,0

In other words,  - go to C:/Users/(MyUserName)/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles - copy all the files and subfolders of the profile I want to use (including all the address book, extension, history, ""impab"" files, etc.) - paste those files and subfolders into the default profile folder - say yes to all overwrite warnings </p><p>Is that right? If so, I have 2 further questions: 1. What is the difference between the ""default"" and ""default-release"" profiles? Does it matter which one I make the default before I paste over it? 2. Tbird has already imported all my 1000's of Gmail messages into the Inbox of the default profile. On my old system those messages were organized into dozens of Inbox subfolders, which were populated through message filters, and local folders. Once I overwrite the new profile with my backed-up profile will all that be reproduced? I don't want to end up with 1000's of messages in my Inbox that are already in subfolders (or deleted from them). </p><p>Really I have one more question that I hesitate to ask: Thunderbird has been around a long time. Why isn't there a simple way to do this? Like a startup switch, ""Create new profile or Browse to select existing profile""? I would have thought it was obvious that Thunderbird users who upgrade to a new computer might want to transfer their entire profile as is. I never expected to have to do all this file manipulation to accomplish it. </p>",tonyalt1,false,0,0
