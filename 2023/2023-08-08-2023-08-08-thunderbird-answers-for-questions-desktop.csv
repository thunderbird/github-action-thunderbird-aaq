I spotted 'Thunderbird font-size of composed messages tiny...' under 'See also' on the right hand side of this page. I made the 'Latin' and 'Other Writing Systems' settings the same and now the font-size is fine. Strangely, increasing the setting 'Latin' &gt; 'proportional' &gt; 'size' from '14' to '17' did the trick. I expected the optimum size to be '14' because 14pt usually appears large enough. I guess that parameter is using different units. Either TB installed itself with the wrong settings or it ignores the knock-on effect of having different font-sizes under 'Latin' and 'Other Writing System' but, as you say, they should be identical. I've never had this problem before after updating TB. It looks like the developers have introduced a configuration error and this should be put right and a new minor update issued immediately. </p>",dev45,false,0,0

It's not uncommon to come across some quirky behavior while using Thunderbird, but seeing double emails in the preview pane isn't expected. This could be related to a glitch in Thunderbird's display settings or possibly an add-on causing a little hiccup. To troubleshoot, let's try a couple of things. First, make sure you're using the latest version of Thunderbird. If you are, let's give Thunderbird's Safe Mode a shot. You can do this by holding down the ""Shift"" key while launching Thunderbird. This mode disables add-ons and themes temporarily. If the issue disappears in Safe Mode, it's likely an add-on causing the problem. You can then start enabling them one by one to identify the culprit. Give these steps a try and let me know how it goes. </p>",suram080,false,0,2
