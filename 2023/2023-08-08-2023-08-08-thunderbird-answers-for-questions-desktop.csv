It's not uncommon to come across some quirky behavior while using Thunderbird, but seeing double emails in the preview pane isn't expected. This could be related to a glitch in Thunderbird's display settings or possibly an add-on causing a little hiccup. To troubleshoot, let's try a couple of things. First, make sure you're using the latest version of Thunderbird. If you are, let's give Thunderbird's Safe Mode a shot. You can do this by holding down the ""Shift"" key while launching Thunderbird. This mode disables add-ons and themes temporarily. If the issue disappears in Safe Mode, it's likely an add-on causing the problem. You can then start enabling them one by one to identify the culprit. Give these steps a try and let me know how it goes. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

It's possible that the new version might be causing this issue. To troubleshoot, you can try a few steps. First, ensure you have a stable internet connection. Next, you might want to restart Thunderbird and see if that resolves the problem. If not, you could try disabling any add-ons or extensions temporarily to see if they're causing the conflict. Additionally, you might want to check your email account settings to make sure they are configured correctly. If these steps don't work, you could consider reinstalling Thunderbird or checking for updates. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

The solution is to have separate smtp servers for A and B, which have the same settings except different User Names (email address), and to point each account to the correct smtp. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1350593"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1350593</a> </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I totally get how frustrating that can be. Since you're using the flatpak version, it might be related to some compatibility issue. Here's something you could try: first, make sure you have the latest updates for both Thunderbird and Elementary OS. If that doesn't solve it, you could give a shot at running Thunderbird in Safe Mode (you can find this option in the ""Help"" menu) and see if it prints fine. If it does, it might be an extension causing the crash. If all else fails, you're doing the right thing by reporting it here. The community is super helpful, so someone might have come across the same thing and could share their fix. </p>",suram080,false,0,1
