This to be done with TB not running on old pc when copy created and TB installed and not running on new PC. That approach ensures integrity of the profile and the profiles.ini file.  If you are just copying the profile itself, I suggest you let TB do the work and use tools&gt;import&gt;import from another installation. Yes, if you have already moved the profile to wherever, you can directly edit the profiles.ini file in default location, but that can also be a can of worms if not careful. A safer option there would be to start profile manager and, with TB's help, select 'create profile' and then select the location of where you stored the profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I spotted 'Thunderbird font-size of composed messages tiny...' under 'See also' on the right hand side of this page. I made the 'Latin' and 'Other Writing Systems' settings the same and now the font-size is fine. Strangely, increasing the setting 'Latin' &gt; 'proportional' &gt; 'size' from '14' to '17' did the trick. I expected the optimum size to be '14' because 14pt usually appears large enough. I guess that parameter is using different units. Either TB installed itself with the wrong settings or it ignores the knock-on effect of having different font-sizes under 'Latin' and 'Other Writing System' but, as you say, they should be identical. I've never had this problem before after updating TB.

However I did find that if one sets up another account (IMAP), the instructions say to change the email address or at least to not delete the POP account without deleting the email address.  Well, I've had my business email address for about 25 years and cannot so easily change it.  So I am just baffled how/why, after years of using TB with the current setup, it suddenly changed. I was out of town for a week and everything blew up.   I only see mass confusion if I have both a POP account to receive email and an IMAP account to send email (how does one reply to a client who sends a message to the POP email account and have to reply from an IMAP account with a different email address?). As I wrote to my hosting service, very responsive but not TB folks, I could just cry now. Any other advice? Margaret </p>",margaret3,false,0,0

If you do not need the POP account, just delete it. You do NOT need both as that could be confusing. Even if you kept both, you could read and respond on either one. Customers would not know or see any differences. You are the one who will get confused if you use both. If you want to use IMAP, my approach would be:  - set up the IMAP account for ongoing business - review POP account to be sure you have it set to leave messages on server - review the messages in POP message folders. Are there any that are not online? Probably. Create a safe haven for them in local folders. You can still reply from local folders.  - Once all reviewed, you can delete the POP account </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I hope you are able and willing to guide me. When I said the account was changed, all I know is that the day before I left on Jan. 20, I was able to send messages and, so far as I know, the 3 accounts on my website server host were set up as POP accounts as directed a few years ago.  My gmail account was set up, per directions, a few months ago, as IMAP. On my return yesterday, I could no longer send messages from any accounts through TB.  The host folks sent me information for the SMTP settings and IMAP incoming server settings.  But when I looked at incoming, I saw that each (except gmail) was POP Mail Server.  And the port is wrong - I guess.  I did not make any changes.  I don't know if my host server changed something, TB changed something or what.  It worked Jan. 19 and did not work Jan. 28 and I did nothing in between. </p><p>Apparently my web host now says incoming must be IMAP so I began looking into how to change it - which apparently I cannot - easily. From your help and their KB (form 2020 for Mozilla/Thunderbird), it seems I can only add another IMAP account and hope and pray for the best.  Just as tax season has begun and I need to communicate with my clients. Sigh... </p><p>Here is the message I was getting: Send Message Error: Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail.  The mail server responded: SMTP AUTH is required for message submission on port 587. Please check the message recipient ""anyone I sent to"" and try again.   The host support said this: Please ensure that you are using the following settings for the email accounts in your email client: </p><p>Outgoing server SMTP Host: <a href=""http://nanj1.armadaservers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">nanj1.armadaservers.com</a> SMTP Port: 465 ( SSL ) / 25 (NO-SSL) </p><p>Incoming server IMAP Host: <a href=""http://nanj1.armadaservers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">nanj1.armadaservers.com</a> IMAP Port: 993 ( SSL ) / 143 (NO-SSL) </p><p>So I did change the SMTP port to 465 as it was 587 on those email accounts on that server.  And now I can send a  message from one specific account to another specific account but not all.  Kind of making me crazy. I think I mentioned before, I could cry. Thanks again for your help.
