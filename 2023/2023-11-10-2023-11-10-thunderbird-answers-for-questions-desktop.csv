All you can do is report the issue to Optus and watch them muddle like they usually do. </p><p>I did check a specialist black list group <a href=""https://check.spamhaus.org/not_listed/?searchterm=211.29.132.42"" rel=""nofollow"">https://check.spamhaus.org/not_listed/?searchterm=211.29.132.42</a> and they have no reported issues with the sending IP address,  so this is a fight between Hotmail and Optus which requires remedial action by Optus. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I tried modifying the settings you suggested but they had no effect on how the text is displayed in the message creation/editor window.  When I write a new message with the font set to Arial and size set to medium, the size of the text on screen is very small - like a font size of 4 or 6. I can zoom the editor window and that gives me what I'm looking for but it seems to be a volatile setting so it resets every time I open the editor. Is there a setting somewhere that sets the relationship between the font size selected (Small, Medium, Large etc) and the size of the text as shown in the editor window on screen.  I think that's what I'm looking for. Kevin </p>",kevin242,false,0,0

I could not change the domain in the email address because my correspondents could not response to me if I did. Well, I did drop the pp from the domain and put it back again and lo &amp; behold the thing started working!
