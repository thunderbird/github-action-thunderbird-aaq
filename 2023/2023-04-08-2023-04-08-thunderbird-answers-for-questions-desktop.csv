When the Inbox is full they offer users a subscription service to extent the storage capacity or to delete contents. They don't appear to have automatically changes the POP3 protocol to IMAP but have cut off the POP3 interrogation from client applications like Thunderbird. </p><p>BT support pages declare it is possible to transfer emails from one bt account to another so it may be possible to set up another btconnect (IMAP) account under a different alias then transfer the contents of the POP3 account to the new one. Thunderbird should be able to synchronise with the new alias account. </p><p>It should also be possible to redirect incoming POP3 mail to the new account which means your senders can continue to use the POP3 address until you advise them differently.  </p><p>So far I have been unable to unravel the way to open another btconnect account as their website is a nightmare. Maybe this is because my actual management account shows my btconnect as a free service. (You now need two passwords for a BT account one for management access and the other for the email.) </p><p>Meanwhile, pro tem, I have opted to redirect all new incoming btconnect POP3 emails to another service provider email address where I will be able to use POP3 or an IMAP service. As my btconnect is nearly full I will, one by one, forward all the emails trapped on the service to my new external account the only down side being they will dated by the forward date and not the original sent date.  </p><p>If anyone can suggest a better solution I am sure we would all like to know. </p>",raymondwlpowell,false,0,0

The problem continues though substantially improved which I think may be because I'm now on a bigger monitor.

The picky is to say that if I hesitate over a file for way under a second the dialogue assumes that's the folder I want ... which brings me to the sticky.  That is when I do pause momentarily over the wrong folder it seems to become stuck there and I have to back out with the escape key back to the action/folder allocation start (i.e. I can't just back up one level if I've gone into a level of my folder hierarchy, I have to back right out of that and start it over again).
