You therefore don't need to know a whole lot about how Thunderbird's email storage system works (leave that to its developers and engineers). It should be enough to know that; </p><p>1. Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files 2. It also maintains an index of messages, known as the Global database, used by the Search feature. 3. The mbox files contain the actual messages, while 4. The Global database is just an<strong> index </strong> (or catalogue) of the messages stored in the mbox files </p><p>When you perform a search in Thunderbird, it's the Global database (index of messages) that facilitates the results you see. When you perform a search, the mbox files which contain your messages, are not accessed directly to find the messages that match your search terms. If that was the case, searching would have taken extremely long to return the search results because of how big the mbox files tend to become. In fact, the mbox files are the largest files you will find in your Thunderbird profile folder. Instead of reproducing details about the Global database on this post, you can re-read all about it here <a href=""/en-US/kb/rebuilding-global-database"" rel=""nofollow"">Rebuilding the Global Database</a>. It's the same article I linked to in my first reply. It states why you may want to rebuild the Global database. While Thunderbird generally does a good job of keeping that database updated, so that it only contains references to messages that actually still exist in the mbox file, sometimes it falls behind and ends up with references to messages that have since been deleted from the mbox files. This causes the scenario you're facing now, whereby the search results include the message you're looking for, but that message no longer exists in the location pointed to by the database. This can <strong>mislead</strong> you into thinking the message is not really lost/gone when it is in fact gone from the message storage files (files). </p> <blockquote>It would seem that to ensure that I don't potentially lose emails I need to create a separate back up folder and copy them daily.

I like Thunderbird but I'm not sure that another platform such as the Gmail platform would be better suited. Do other platforms also have this issue where, as you say, emails data can be lost?</blockquote> <p>There's always the risk of losing data, regardless of platform, and the only way you can ensure against loss, is to have a backup copy of that data. The level of risk differs from platform to platform. There are many ways you can approach the issue of data backup. It eventually boils down to what works for you economically and practically. The simplest backup strategy you can arguably have is that daily copy, but it doesn't have to be that tedious. </p><p>There are other steps that you can take to minimize risk of Thunderbird's data loss, and key among them is to make sure your security program (antivirus software) does not interfere with Thunderbird's filesystem operations. You can do this by adding your Thunderbird profile folder to the antivirus' list of exclusions. There is a long history of antivirus programs causing havoc with Thunderbird's normal operations, and that includes deleting entire mbox files (and all messages contained therein), when a scan finds or suspects an infected message inside that mbox file! However, before we veer way off target, first confirm if that lost message is also gone from Gmail platform.
