Here is an abridged version: I use a MacBook Pro 9.2 (2012), v. 10.15.7 (Catalina). I have mistakenly deleted my Thunderbird app. I’m not sure what version I had last, probably the latest version.  I have a download 68.2.2 which I tried to reinstall, but this notification appeared '<strong>You have launched an older version of Thunderbird... Create new profile, or Quit.'</strong> I don’t know what I should do, my main concern being not to lose all my settings, my emails saved in folders, as well as being able to receive and send.  The Library shows T’bird, including Profile but I’m not sure it is the full working profile as it was modified yesterday morning. The last full profile backup I have saved is dated 2023.06.22. My last Time Machine backup is dated 2023.07.24. I would be so grateful if someone could help me reinstate my app.  Many thanks. </p>",gfinley,false,0,0

We used Eudora <strong>exactly</strong> as we now use Thunderbird! All of our messages saved in Eudora were imported to Thunderbird about 12 years ago after Qualcomm stopped supporting Eudora. Our ISP for 15 years has been Windstream and we both had Windstream addresses. I didn't realize that AT&amp;T no longer offered email except through Yahoo. </p><p>Now to the good part:  You may have solved my problem! I, too, have been concerned about Gmail and privacy. Thank you for mentioning GMX. I have a friend who uses that. If we can set up GMX addresses for both my husband and me and then get those to work in Thunderbird, the problem is solved. My older Gmail account can still be totally separate. </p><p>If the GMX addresses are brand new, then there will be no merging problem. Thank you. I still need to reread your message and see if I can understand it, but it looks good so far. </p>",EastTenn,false,0,0

They have used a contracted service with yahoo for probably the last 10 years and it has at best been a dogs breakfast.  Special passwords and odd setting to get yahoo to work with the ATT email. </p><p>There are many mail providers out there.  Google is not the only one.  Personally I have a weakness for GMX,  because the parent company is based in Germany and must use German privacy laws,  they don't retain much information about you at all.  Where as the US folk do their utmost to retain everything about you they can. but that list is far from complete.  Try googling free email providers on google,  they list close to 30. </p><p>Now we get to the real issue.  I assume your mail is currently downloaded as POP,  as IMAP mail will not survive the closure of the mail account on the server. </p><p>You worry about ""Merging"" stuff.   </p><p>I can not speak for Eudora,  but unless you have already imported that mail to Thunderbird it is about lost.  Eudora is not able to run on some of the more recent operating systems so I would suggest you import that mail before you actually loose it.  Eudora stores mail in a proprietary format so with no Eudora reading it becomes a real problem. </p><p>Next you talk about adding a gmail account to your existing profile like as if data is all going to be merged together.  That can be the case if you choose to use POP and a global inbox,  but simply selecting not to use a global inbox for the account will have the account added to the folder pane as it's own entry and having it's own inbox and associated folders.  Personally I use the global inbox, and Thunderbird reports it as being almost 7 and a half GB in size.  That is not the profile,  just the inbox.  The profile is over 50.  I have some 25 accounts,  mostly mail accounts registered in Thunderbird and I am starting to see cracks,  but data loss is a long way off I think.  I do however make a manual backup of the profile every couple of months, so loosing historical stuff is not really an issue and the google and outlook account retain copies of all mail in the past couple of years anyway. </p><p>Yes you can add the account to Thunderbird. Yes you can ""merge"" it is you want. I would suggest against it really.   </p><p>What you need to be sure of is your use of POP mail as that makes immutable local copies.  IMAP does not, even though it's downloading of whole folder structures and their contents is very handy,  it is only as good as the server it connects to. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Credo però di aver individuato il problema nella successione di indirizzi usati nel corso degli ultimi 10 anni. </p><p>Storicamente su questo account tramite filtri locali spostavo i messaggi di una serie di corrispondenti verso una sottocartella della posta in arrivo. Successivamente ho usato un altro indirizzo su cui man mano dirottavo questi corrispondenti. L'altro indirizzo l'ho inserito sullo stesso profilo in configurazione IMAP. Man mano che i miei corrispondenti iniziavano ad usare il nuovo indirizzo creavo un filtro locale che spostava il messaggio nella stessa cartella (appartenete all'indirizzo precedente POP) per cui in queste sottocartelle venivano convogliati messaggi ricevuti con il vecchio indirizzo POP e con il nuovo IMAP. Ho verificato che i messaggi scomparsi sono quelli provenienti da account IMAP, confidavo nel fatto che essendo una cartella di un account POP non ci fossero contrindicazioni ma evidentemente non è così. Riconfigurerò i filtri spostando i messaggi su una cartella locale su cui spostare i messaggi da entrambi gli account, così dovrebbe funzionare correttamente.
