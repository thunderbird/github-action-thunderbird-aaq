Here is an abridged version: I use a MacBook Pro 9.2 (2012), v. 10.15.7 (Catalina). I have mistakenly deleted my Thunderbird app. I’m not sure what version I had last, probably the latest version.  I have a download 68.2.2 which I tried to reinstall, but this notification appeared '<strong>You have launched an older version of Thunderbird... Create new profile, or Quit.'</strong> I don’t know what I should do, my main concern being not to lose all my settings, my emails saved in folders, as well as being able to receive and send.  The Library shows T’bird, including Profile but I’m not sure it is the full working profile as it was modified yesterday morning. The last full profile backup I have saved is dated 2023.06.22. My last Time Machine backup is dated 2023.07.24. I would be so grateful if someone could help me reinstate my app.  Many thanks. </p>",gfinley,false,0,0
