They have used a contracted service with yahoo for probably the last 10 years and it has at best been a dogs breakfast.  Special passwords and odd setting to get yahoo to work with the ATT email. </p><p>There are many mail providers out there.  Google is not the only one.  Personally I have a weakness for GMX,  because the parent company is based in Germany and must use German privacy laws,  they don't retain much information about you at all.  Where as the US folk do their utmost to retain everything about you they can. but that list is far from complete.  Try googling free email providers on google,  they list close to 30. </p><p>Now we get to the real issue.  I assume your mail is currently downloaded as POP,  as IMAP mail will not survive the closure of the mail account on the server. </p><p>You worry about ""Merging"" stuff.   </p><p>I can not speak for Eudora,  but unless you have already imported that mail to Thunderbird it is about lost.  Eudora is not able to run on some of the more recent operating systems so I would suggest you import that mail before you actually loose it.  Eudora stores mail in a proprietary format so with no Eudora reading it becomes a real problem. </p><p>Next you talk about adding a gmail account to your existing profile like as if data is all going to be merged together.  That can be the case if you choose to use POP and a global inbox,  but simply selecting not to use a global inbox for the account will have the account added to the folder pane as it's own entry and having it's own inbox and associated folders.  Personally I use the global inbox, and Thunderbird reports it as being almost 7 and a half GB in size.  That is not the profile,  just the inbox.  The profile is over 50.  I have some 25 accounts,  mostly mail accounts registered in Thunderbird and I am starting to see cracks,  but data loss is a long way off I think.  I do however make a manual backup of the profile every couple of months, so loosing historical stuff is not really an issue and the google and outlook account retain copies of all mail in the past couple of years anyway. </p><p>Yes you can add the account to Thunderbird. Yes you can ""merge"" it is you want. I would suggest against it really.   </p><p>What you need to be sure of is your use of POP mail as that makes immutable local copies.  IMAP does not, even though it's downloading of whole folder structures and their contents is very handy,  it is only as good as the server it connects to. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
