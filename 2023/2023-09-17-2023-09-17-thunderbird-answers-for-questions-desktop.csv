My issue is that the redesign of the home screen did nothing for performance. You just moved things around on the screen causing a new learning curve to find where you moved things. As I said CHANGE FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGE is a waste of developer time. If you are not improving performance or adding a new function there is not reason to FIX WHAT AINT BROKE. I worked in IT for 47 years in every aspect and area, computer operator, JCL expert, auto-scheduling, programming (COBOL, PL1, ASIST, SQL, SQL Server), Mainframe, web based design and documentation, etc. I never wasted time making things ""prettier"". </p>",white134098,false,0,0
