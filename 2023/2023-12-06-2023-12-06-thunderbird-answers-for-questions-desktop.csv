There if I highlight a contact the drop-down menu  does not offer that option, and neither does  the card that appears on the right.. It doesn't offer an Edit option either.  There is an exception: the Address book named Collected Addresses. If I click on an address there I see a card on the right and in that card there is an Edit button on the right that opens a window which  has a Delete option in red.   Why is Collected Addresses  the only Address book that offers that option? Lastly, I have tried a workaround, transferring contacts from the other Address books to the Collected Addresses since I could then Delete them. But If I transfer a C)ontact in that way it doesn't disappear from the other Addresses. It just become copied to Collected Addresses, the original stays where it is.   The problem remains whole, and I've now been wrestling with it for several hours.

I also cannot write an entry.  Quite simply, on my iMac running os Sonoma 14.0, and Thunderbird 115.8.0, I find it impossible to delete contacts from my Address books, except my Collected Addresses.   No, highlighting a contact in the Address books and holding down Ctrl (or any other key) does NOT offer the option to Delete. It used to but no longer does.   To be clear: if I highlight a contact it opens a card, and in Collected Addresses this card offers an Edit option (that then allows deletion of the contact). In Collected Addresses, as I said. In any other of the Address books then card doesn't have an Edit option..   There seems to be a bug somewhere, and after 20 years of using Thunderbird it's disappointing. </blockquote> <p>I'm there with you Xavier...I've been using Thunderbird for decades as well.  I feel it's the most efficient browser for my business.  Maybe it's because I'm so embedded in the way it's done.  And after this many years, my address book is packed with thousands of contacts...and the auto fill is annoying when it's someone that doesn't exist at that company any longer. </p><p>Grrrrr! </p>",lynn45,false,0,0

To actually manage apple contacts you have to use the apple contact tools. </p><p><strong>Just an FYI.</strong>  As of Sunday the 25th February  4.3% of Thunderbird users are using apple products and 1.09% are using Linux, the rest are using windows on various flavors and ages. <a href=""https://stats.thunderbird.net/#platlang"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stats.thunderbird.net/#platlang</a> </p><p>As this is a peer support forum,  finding someone active in the forum and also using a mac is possible,  but very uncommon. I only know of one individual and that was about 2 years ago.  I think you can generally assume anyone here is not using a MAC unless they specifically say they are.  Personally I have not used a mac for about 30 years, is was this little white/cream box thing with a monochrome monitor that erased all my DOS disks without warning.
