IMAP is supposed to ""correctly identify"" these special folders,  but guess what! </p><p>First use whatever you have for web mail and confirm the folder on the server is the default exchange ""deleted Items""  then right click the account i the folder pane and select subscribe.  Ensure the ""deleted items"" folder is subscribed. </p><p>Now go to account settings &gt; server settings and ensure that the move for deleted mail is to the ""deleted items"" folder. </p><p>Once you have done this the icon shown beside the deleted items folder should change to the trash can. </p><p>I think what is happening is Thunderbird deletes by moving to trash.  In the background a delete is sent to the server which deletes the mail,  it is them moved to the server ""deleted items"" and some sort of timing issue is resulting in an error about the trash folder because the email is no longer in the inbox to move.  But as I said, I am guessing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Try again.""   </p><pre>It started doing this about 6 weeks ago after years of working fine.  I checked server settings, disabled anti-virus program, had email/internet provider check everything on their end.  I can still receive email in Thunderbird, I just can't send.  I can go online to my webmail and receive and send emails, just can't send from Thunderbird anymore. </pre>",khq0660,false,0,0

I've tried the various remedies suggested on relevant threads, to no avail.  All that I can think of is to reinstall Thunderbird, but I have lots of emails saved in folders that I don't want to lose.  Is there a way to reinstall Thunderbird without losing all of my saved emails? </blockquote> <p>just run the installer,  but it will not fix anything other than some system integration issues. Even if you uninstall and reinstall  it will still not affect the stored mail and account settings  The inability to send mail is not going to be helped at all. </p><p>So perhaps what is the exact error message you see when you try and send mail? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
