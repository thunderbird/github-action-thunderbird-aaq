I had just installed both TB &amp; FF in the new computer when the TB update occurred, and I've lost operating access my Contacts, mail and Bookmarks.  Are there clean, easy ways to accomplish these migrations and keep both FF &amp; TB profles so I don't have to start from scratch?

Eventually I realized Thunderbird has a DevTools similar to Firefox and was able to get much more granular at that point.

Which means you are correct when you say<em> ""So for me, the date-header in the forwarded message is valid""</em> </p><p>The date displayed in 'Date' column and in Message Pane header area is determined by your computer date/time and Timezone settings.  It reads the Date in header and calibrates what is displayed based on your computer settings. </p><p>In the view source, there are various 'Received' sections which relates to the path of email as sent from server to server and each will have the date time stamp determined by where each  server was located around the world. So there could be several different 'received' dates. The one at the top is the last one when it gets received by the server holding your account. </p><p>This means that the 'Personal Date/Timezone stamp' you wish to enter may not be relevant to the recipient of your email if they are in yet another timezone. However, your sent email will also have it's own Date.  </p><p>All sections in an email you are composing are editable.

Is the font distorted on the external display -- in which case you should adjust the display settings on the external first, and then perhaps try another font in Thunderbird -- or the font is too small to read on the external -- in which case, you can both adjust the display scale on the external or go to View &gt; Font size in Thunderbird and increase the font display temporarily without having to go into Settings &gt; General &gt; Fonts &amp; Colors to make a systematic size change. </p><p>Check out adjusting the external screen's settings first, then if that doesn't do it, try adjusting the font in View when you use the external, and then re-adjusting it when you're viewing the laptop screen. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

In the background a delete is sent to the server which deletes the mail,  it is them moved to the server ""deleted items"" and some sort of timing issue is resulting in an error about the trash folder because the email is no longer in the inbox to move.
