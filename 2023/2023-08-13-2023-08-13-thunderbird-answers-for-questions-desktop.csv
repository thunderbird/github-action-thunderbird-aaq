One of the Supernova objectives was to rewrite lots of old code and that caused many CSS mods to no longer work. Over time, I don't doubt that new CSS mods will surface, but my recommendation is to avoid them, as they may cause other problems. And that's just my opinion (as I do use a bit of CSS myself...) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Is the font distorted on the external display -- in which case you should adjust the display settings on the external first, and then perhaps try another font in Thunderbird -- or the font is too small to read on the external -- in which case, you can both adjust the display scale on the external or go to View &gt; Font size in Thunderbird and increase the font display temporarily without having to go into Settings &gt; General &gt; Fonts &amp; Colors to make a systematic size change. </p><p>Check out adjusting the external screen's settings first, then if that doesn't do it, try adjusting the font in View when you use the external, and then re-adjusting it when you're viewing the laptop screen. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

IMAP is supposed to ""correctly identify"" these special folders,  but guess what! </p><p>First use whatever you have for web mail and confirm the folder on the server is the default exchange ""deleted Items""  then right click the account i the folder pane and select subscribe.  Ensure the ""deleted items"" folder is subscribed. </p><p>Now go to account settings &gt; server settings and ensure that the move for deleted mail is to the ""deleted items"" folder. </p><p>Once you have done this the icon shown beside the deleted items folder should change to the trash can. </p><p>I think what is happening is Thunderbird deletes by moving to trash.  In the background a delete is sent to the server which deletes the mail,  it is them moved to the server ""deleted items"" and some sort of timing issue is resulting in an error about the trash folder because the email is no longer in the inbox to move.  But as I said, I am guessing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

First, can you confirm that you are connecting to the internet via the TWC service.  You are not on a hotspot or away on holiday or using an internet cafe for instance.  Historically TWC did not allow you to send mail unless your internet connection was supplied by them.  You could down load it,  but their server would not allow you to connect to send mail. </p><p>If you are using their service,  can you please create a log that I could view to see what is going on? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
