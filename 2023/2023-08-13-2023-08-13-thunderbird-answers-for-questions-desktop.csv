I've tried the various remedies suggested on relevant threads, to no avail.  All that I can think of is to reinstall Thunderbird, but I have lots of emails saved in folders that I don't want to lose.  Is there a way to reinstall Thunderbird without losing all of my saved emails? </blockquote> <p>just run the installer,  but it will not fix anything other than some system integration issues. Even if you uninstall and reinstall  it will still not affect the stored mail and account settings  The inability to send mail is not going to be helped at all. </p><p>So perhaps what is the exact error message you see when you try and send mail? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
