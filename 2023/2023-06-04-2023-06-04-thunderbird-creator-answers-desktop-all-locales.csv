It was a straightforward service, which I used for nearly 20 years, but with limited online storage.  I used Windows Live Mail (and its predecessors) as an offline archive (using the word in the conventional sense) of emails, locally stored (and backed up) in a large set of folders within WLM, only going online to offload mails from webmail as needed. I should like to do the same with Gmail, keeping only active messages online.  But Gmail will not talk to WLM so I am hoping to use TB instead.  I do not wish to synchronise TB and Gmail, nor to send/receive messages in TB — just in effect ""import"" mails from Gmail into TB, arrange them in locally created folders within TB, then delete them from Gmail.  Usage of TB would be largely offline. Is it possible to use TB this way?  I have  read many useful question threads in the forum and some wiki articles but remain quite uncertain as to whether and how.  I am quite old now and though I have used PCs at work &amp; home since they first appeared I am not technically proficient... I have made the Gmail account POP3, which I think is right.  I am aware only Inbox will show in TB and am happy to move messages from Sent, etc., in order to move them into TB. I'm unclear if I can set automatic delete from Gmail of moved messages:  this may be an IMAP only thing.  But I am happy anyway to manually delete them later in Gmail;  we're not talking 1000s of emails. I'm fairly sure local folders can be created in TB. WLM (I think) saves messages in separate .eml files.  I am unsure if that would be, or could be, the same in TB or if an extension is necessary.  I have seen talk of mbox and maildir but do not understand when these issues arise. I am sure there are others factors I should take into account and some I have forgotten already to list here.  I shall be grateful for any advice offered. I apologise for this long message:  thank you for getting this far!

They were IMAP messages on gmail, and a quick check showed the were not blank on the server.  I tried deleting the entire gmail folder set from the IMAP mail directory, but that only made it worse.  So I loaded my wife's profile from a backup.  It solved the problem, but for how long?   Another person with a similar issue previously noted that another symptom was a vast increase in storage requirements for the profile, and I saw that the profile was more than three times the size it used to be.  There were a series of files named NSTMP in the gmail profile that aren't present on my profile.  I deleted them from my wife's profile and recovered the storage, without changing the performance.   I suspect the profile became corrupt and the corruption resulted in generation of multiple NSTMP files, and eventually started wiping out message content as well.  Because I think the profile I restored was likely corrupt, I am guessing this problem will recur, unless someone can tell me how to fix it for good. </p><p>I'm running Windows 7 with all updates current as of the time MS stopped supporting it. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1584026;1584038;1584039;,La_Sombra
