Changing to the recommended secure settings fixed it. </p><p>The fact the account is working in webmail is not relevant to its performance in TB, as the two use different systems. </p><p>I suggest you contact Westnet to confirm if your non-secure settings are still supported.  Also, try running Windows in safe mode to test if Bitdefender is interfering with secure connections.  Disabling BD is not sufficient to rule out its effect. </p>",sfhowes,false,1,0

I even turned off my Bitdefender firewall while experimenting. </p><p>As I mentioned, I have not changed the settings in Thunderbird at all.  And what doesn't make sense is the other email address, which is on the same Thunderbird program as the problematic one, is having no issues whatsoever AND the settings are exactly the same.  The only difference is the wendyp uses ""wn"" and not ""westnet"".  The ""wn"" is because it's an old Westnet email address.  </p><p>I have been able to get into my webmail on my ISPs website, and send/receive emails on the wendyp email with no issues.  Hence the reason it has to be Thunderbird.   </p><p>I've had these settings on Thunderbird for many years and had my email address for decades.
