If you are on Windows and it's set to hide file extensions for known file types (the default), you can come a cropper.  You may end up with a file that appears to be named `userChrome.css` but is actually named `userChrome.css.txt`.

I re-installed Thunderbird and tried to re-establish my 3 accounts using a saved profile. The other two worked fine. Thunderbird found the setup for the Comcast account in it's database OK, but could not verify the password. Within my Comcast account, there is a setting to allow email clients (they mention Thunderbird) to access my email. As nearly as I can tell, there are no other requirements for special passwords, keys, or other settings. None were required when I was using the same setup in the previous distro. The first time I set up Thunderbird using the Comcast account several years ago, Thunderbird went through the auto setup without a hitch (same password). I'm glad to provide any other information you need. Thanks </p><p>Follow-up: The first thing I did this morning was check my email in Thunderbird and there appeared to be no change. The other two accounts had downloaded new mail. Comcast had not. So, I wrote the above. After closing, I went back to Thunderbird and found that all of the Comcast mail had been downloaded and it appears to be working as it should. It took from sometime yesterday until this morning to fix itself.  Thanks for answering, but I guess I'm OK now. </p>",bilyo41,false,0,0

As I have had this happen before with other accounts with possible complicating issues, I think this is a technical issue that Thunderbird maintainers should correct.
