All your data such as messages, passwords and user preferences, and changes made while you use Thunderbird, are stored in a special folder called a profile. Your profile folder is stored in a separate place from the Thunderbird program, so that if something ever goes wrong with Thunderbird your information will still be there. It also means that you can uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall without losing your settings and data.  It also means you don't have to re-install Thunderbird in order to fix a problem with the profile. </p> <blockquote> Should I attempt a backup?  </blockquote> <p>It never hurts to create a backup.
