NOTE:  This Alias acct has only ~ 40 msgs addressed to Alias; all others were to the Master addy. </p><p>The only prob I see (this <em>specific</em> instance) is, </p> <ul><li> the mail TO Alias addy are already in the (separate) Alias acct;  </li><li> Alias msgs NO longer in Master acct (moved to Alias) </li><li> Not sure can ""just delete"" Alias TB acct, as some Alias msgs <strong>may not</strong> still be on server. </li></ul> <blockquote> - <em>to get messages to redownload to primary account, you could exit TB, and in Profile Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; folder, delete the popstate.dat file, which will cause all mail to redownload</em>.</blockquote> <p>Is this a good idea? ALL msgs (still on server) for Master addy will be re-DnLd'd to TB Master acct - duplicating most msgs.  Seems bigger headache than now? </p><p>Only way I see that works w/o headache, is <strong>*if all</strong> desired msgs (Master &amp; Alias addies) are still on server (<strong>not likely</strong>).   </p> <ul><li>And if All msgs were 1st BU'd, then deleted from TB Master acct, so no duplicates land in Master acct. </li><li>If allowed duplicates in Master acct, then have task of removing 100's or 1000+ of duplicates vs. (current problem) isolating just 40 Alias msgs.   </li></ul> <p>I can make BU of Alias mailbox files - won't solve problem -  <strong>separating</strong> / removing the many Master msgs from a few Alias msgs. </p>",Joebt,false,0,0
