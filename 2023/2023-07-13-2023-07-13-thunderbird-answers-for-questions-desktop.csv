The reality is that Gmail is one the biggest email providers on the planet.  No, it's not standard IMAP.  Duh.  It's Gmail.  It's ""email +"".  We all know that, sir.  Gmail was not built for Thunderbird's ""move message from account A to account B"" feature.  It's the other way around, Thunderbird was built to serve all email users, including Gmail users.  But the feature is broken.  It's not moving anything.  It's creating duplicate documents in people's accounts, a true management hell for people who mean it when they choose ""move"" instead of ""copy.""  So don't call it ""move"" if it's not moving for 30% of the world's inboxes.  And please don't tell us we're holding it wrong.  The users shouldn't have to do a special dance just because they use a certain email provider. </p><p>Including a setting specific for Gmail accounts in Thunderbird settings would solve this problem instantly and save a lot of people from a lot of pain.  Thunderbird knows how to delete messages.  This situation is not out of Thunderbird's realm of capabilities.  All that's needed is a simple checkbox option in the Settings (e.g. ""Enable 'True moving' when moving messages from a Gmail account"") and then an 'if this, then that action', according to which ""move"" will mean ""copy, archive, and delete"" when dealing with Gmail accounts. </p><p>There may be simpler, more elegant ways of solving this issue (anything is better than telling users to fuck off).

That is why messages so often simply don't make the move at all and are lost, not archived as in your use case,  but lost.

Moving messages between accounts is one of two reasons that I still have Thunderbird installed (the other one being stripping attachments from Gmail messages). </p><p>I have suspected that moving/deleting is bug prone (been paranoid about it since the ""delete"" bug on the early generations of iPhones, which also archived messages instead of deleting) and have developed perhaps an unnecessarily obsessive protocol for it.  I have two Gmail labels in each of the accounts: From Account 1, To Account 1 in one account From Account 2, and to Account 2 in the other.  I use Thunderbird to copy the messages to these folders and then verify that everything is correct in the destination account via Gmail in a browser tab.  Then I use a second Gmail tab to delete the original messages.  It takes like 6 steps when it should only take 1. </p><p>I'm happy to post in the feedback forum.

I figured that the devs were just playing a ""random number joke"" on me by having TB point to some random message from 2022 every time it opens to a new account. There are enough people seeing this to prove that it is a real problem but it looks like an official rollback to 108 would be in order until a fix is found for this and all of the other 115 glitches. </p>",jmcgaw47,false,1,1

Unless the folder has a small number of messages in it, then whenever you open that folder it opens several messages above the last one in the folder.  If the folder contains only a few messages, then it opens with the last one displayed!  One solution is to delete enough messages in each folder so that the folder is small enough to be displayed in its entirety.  That is a lousy solution if you want to keep those older messages!
