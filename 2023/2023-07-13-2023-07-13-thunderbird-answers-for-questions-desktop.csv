The reality is that Gmail is one the biggest email providers on the planet.  No, it's not standard IMAP.  Duh.  It's Gmail.  It's ""email +"".  We all know that, sir.  Gmail was not built for Thunderbird's ""move message from account A to account B"" feature.  It's the other way around, Thunderbird was built to serve all email users, including Gmail users.  But the feature is broken.  It's not moving anything.  It's creating duplicate documents in people's accounts, a true management hell for people who mean it when they choose ""move"" instead of ""copy.""  So don't call it ""move"" if it's not moving for 30% of the world's inboxes.  And please don't tell us we're holding it wrong.  The users shouldn't have to do a special dance just because they use a certain email provider. </p><p>Including a setting specific for Gmail accounts in Thunderbird settings would solve this problem instantly and save a lot of people from a lot of pain.  Thunderbird knows how to delete messages.  This situation is not out of Thunderbird's realm of capabilities.  All that's needed is a simple checkbox option in the Settings (e.g. ""Enable 'True moving' when moving messages from a Gmail account"") and then an 'if this, then that action', according to which ""move"" will mean ""copy, archive, and delete"" when dealing with Gmail accounts. </p><p>There may be simpler, more elegant ways of solving this issue (anything is better than telling users to fuck off).

You want the product changed to to include a button that has never been in the core product. This is simply the wrong place to request such a thing.   This is user support where folk try and explain how to do what you want without the button. The addon developer has seen fit to not release a version of that button in recent years.
