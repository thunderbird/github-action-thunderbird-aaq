A right click showed multiple drag and drop customisable options which I was going to investigate later, however after taking a break and then firing up Thunderbird a couple of hours later this toolbar had vanished together with the google calendar button. Have added the Thunderbird official google calendar integration which can only be accessed via “Events and tasks” drop-down which is primitive and do not like so need to remove but unsure how. So as someone who is dyslexic with eyesight issues and born in the 40’s we do not adapt to change easily (maybe some do?) any help would be appreciated with the sorting out of the above issues. I would add that found some info on a unified toolbar and spaces which sounded good which I failed to understand or comprehend as right click is always greyed out, maybe an age thing. Any help and guidance muchly appreciated. Paul. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",enkharta

When making changes in Firefox, I recreated my profile in the profile manager and pointed it to the folder containing the profile, or so I thought. It just gave me a new profile and I didn’t have time to go digging to find out what was wrong. I realised later when trying to open Thunderbird that it was the wrong folder, I pointed Firefox to my Thunderbird profile, and now I can’t use it. I’ve been setting up a Raspberry Pi as a NAS/multimedia/backup server and so have been reconfiguring everything, and so of course my Thunderbird backup is not up to date. And I use POP as most of my mail accounts are quite old and have very limited storage. So there’s nothing much on the servers. The error message is ""A newer version of Thunderbird may have made changes to your profile"", and gives me no option to try loading my profile anyway. And I can’t try importing from the old profile into a new one. </p><p>I was using Thunderbird 91, as I depend on several addons for work stuff, and every time I update half of them stop working. I tried updating to the latest version (after making a copy of the broken profile) but still have the same problem.  So my question is: how can I save my e-mails from my old profile? I understand that Firefox overwrote some of the files in the profile breaking it, but surely the mailboxes themselves must still be good? </p><p>Much thanks for any help! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1609469;,buggie
