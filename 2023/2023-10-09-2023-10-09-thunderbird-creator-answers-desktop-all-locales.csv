I searched this forum and only found how to remove it.  I know I can turn off ""Hide the system window titlebar"" in order to have a clickable space there, but that wastes a lot of space.  I also know I can remove the search bar, but I don't think I'll remember the search shortcut (&lt;command&gt;+&lt;k&gt; on mac) because I don't use it often.  It seems like I should be able to move and resize the search bar, but whenever I remove the flexible space to the left of it, it gets far wider than I need it to be (and if I also remove the flexible space on the right, it goes full width).  I can't seem to resize the search bar directly or by adjusting the size of the flexible space (which is to say I can't find anywhere to drag on the search bar or the flexible space while in the Customize Toolbars screen or in the main window), and each flexible space I add to the right of the search bar reduces its size by less and less such that after the 3rd flexible space is added, adding additional flexible spaces is almost inconsequential (while the search bar is, unfortunately, still completely in the way).  Is it possible to control the size of the search bar another way, or is my best bet going to be to remove it and use the Edit menu when I need to search? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",The00Dustin

1426869,2023-10-09 09:48:25 -0700,2023-10-09 09:48:25 -0700,Regression in Keyboard Navigation (Supernova)?,"<p>I am having a frustrating issue with the way I use Thunderbird since the automatic upgrade to Supernova.  I believe it is likely a regression, but I'm not sure where or how to report it.  I found the bugzilla site, but since it's at the www-archive domain, I assume it's the wrong place. </p><p>My issue is that I can no longer navigate the Message List Header pane using the keyboard buttons after moving a message to anther folder using the mouse without first using the mouse to select a message.  This wasn't necessary prior to the upgrade, and it leads to the automatically displayed message below the one I moved being marked read before I can navigate.  I could extend the length of time before a message is marked read, but the new requirement would still also be inefficient and anti-ergonomic in my physical environment (I use a centered mouse to minimize pain and hand movement, so there is no travel time between mouse and keyboard but using the mouse is still more uncomfortable than using keyboard buttons). </p><p>As this issue could be specific to my environment, I will point out that I am running on macOS Ventura.  To better explain the difference in how it works now vs how it worked before, here are two basic flows: </p><p>Before: </p> <ol><li> Move the selected e-mail to another folder using the mouse to drag and drop. </li><li> Press an arrow key to go to the next e-mail I want to read (or to the next e-mail that is already marked read). </li></ol> <p>After: </p> <ol><li> Move the selected e-mail to another folder using the mouse to drag and drop. </li><li> Move the mouse back to the message pane to select the next e-mail I want to read. </li><li> Select the previously automatically selected e-mail again to mark it unread since the former step took to long. </li><li> Press an arrow key to go to the next e-mail I want to read (or to the next e-mail that is already marked as read). </li></ol> <p>Other keyboard navigation in the message pane still works as it did prior to the upgrade, for instance, deleting an e-mail: </p> <ol><li> Press backspace to send the e-mail to Trash </li><li> Press an arrow key to go to the next e-mail I want to read (or to the next e-mail that is already marked read). </li></ol> <p>This seems to imply the keyboard navigation isn't being intentionally interrupted by an e-mail being moved.  Meanwhile pressing an arrow key as the second step of the ""After"" example appears to do nothing (as opposed to moving between folders), which implies the focus of keyboard navigation hasn't been intentionally moved to the Folder Pane (which would be undesirable, but at least explicable).  If there is a way to get the old keyboard navigation functionality back with regards to navigating the Message List Header after using a mouse to move an e-mail to a different folder, please let me know how I can do that.  If this is a regression, please let me know if and how I can report it to the appropriate team in hopes of having it actually get resolved (which seems feasible since the ""What's New"" blurb was bragging about keyboard navigation in the menu). </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",The00Dustin

I can still send them.  I use <a href=""http://frontier.com"" rel=""nofollow"">frontier.com</a> as my e-mail provider and spent a good deal of time chatting with one of their tech support people.  Ultimately he had no solution.  I have tried reinstalling this upgrade, but it made no difference.  I asked this question a few days ago but got no response.  I notice that someone asked a similar question more recently, but the answer apparently came in a private message so I don't know what the answer was.  What happens when I try to download messages is that Thunderbird shows ""host contacted, sending login information"" and nothing more happens until Thunderbird eventually gives up.  I use Windows 10 on a Dell desktop.  I can still get my mail directly from the Frontier mail site, but I greatly prefer to use Thunderbird for features that Frontier doesn't have. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",rdbulkley

I’ve been setting up a Raspberry Pi as a NAS/multimedia/backup server and so have been reconfiguring everything, and so of course my Thunderbird backup is not up to date. And I use POP as most of my mail accounts are quite old and have very limited storage. So there’s nothing much on the servers. The error message is ""A newer version of Thunderbird may have made changes to your profile"", and gives me no option to try loading my profile anyway. And I can’t try importing from the old profile into a new one. </p><p>I was using Thunderbird 91, as I depend on several addons for work stuff, and every time I update half of them stop working. I tried updating to the latest version (after making a copy of the broken profile) but still have the same problem.  So my question is: how can I save my e-mails from my old profile?
