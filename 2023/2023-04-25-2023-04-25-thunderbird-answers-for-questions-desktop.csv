My in-laws regularly upset the fruit basket by ordering their messages accidentally in a way that is confusing to them. I want to prevent this from being an issue.

The simple way you might achieve that is to create a DOS (remember DOS?) BAT file that executes a copy command to copy a predefined profile to profile location and then invoke Thunderbird. Set an icon on desktop to run the BAT file and also rename Thunderbird's exe file so they can't bypass the BAT's process. Crude, and there may be better solutions. If I knew the exact file that held the customizations, I would advise to that. But I don't. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

However, if the in-laws have their own accounts, I suggest creating a portable Thunderbird on same PC and set it up for their accounts. And put a primary password on yours.
