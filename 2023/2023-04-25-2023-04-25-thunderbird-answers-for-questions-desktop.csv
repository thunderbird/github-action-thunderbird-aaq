I'm trying to make a gmail account the default email address in Thunderbird and even going by your suggestion to click on the email address name in the left pane, then selecting Account Activity, the ""Default"" is still greyed out and you can't set it as the default email.   Any other suggestions? </p>",joemorgan,false,0,1

I have clicked on the gmail account, then opened ""Account Activities"" to select the default, as several have suggested here, but it is still greyed out to where you cant select it as the default. </p><p>If I delete the current default account forcing the remainig gmail account to become the default, will I lose all of my emails under the original default account? </p>",joemorgan,false,0,0

Go to your default account, click on it, select ""Account Actions"" and ""Set As Default"" is NOT greyed out.  Click on it.  Then go to the account you're trying to set as the default and go through the same process as your original account and the ""Set As Default"" is now NOT greyed out and you can click on it to select this account as the default. </p><p>I know that sounds crazy, but it works. </p>",joemorgan,false,1,0

The Titan article you referenced tells how to use CalDAV to sync Titan calendars to the Windows, Mac and iPhone operating systems, not specifically to apps such as Thunderbird. The one piece of pertinent information I got from the article is that their CalDAV server's URL is <a href=""https://dav.flockmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dav.flockmail.com</a>. </p><p>My efforts had already lead me to think that the way to sync Titan calendars to TB is with CalDAV and that the way to do that in TB is by using the TbSync add-on. My attempts to use TbSync and their FlockMail server URL have all failed. </p><p>I am also corresponding with Titan support but their initial response missed the points entirely and I'm waiting for another response. As of now, I think there is either a problem with their CalDAV server, or with TbSync, or possibly I'm just not understanding what needs to be done. </p><p>What would really be helpful right now is to hear from somebody who has had first-hand experience in syncing Titan Calendars to Thunderbird. </p><p>Any further suggestions? </p>",@SteveS,false,0,0
