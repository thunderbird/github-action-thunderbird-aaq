The bottom line seems to be that if you're using Windows 11, and you put it into SLEEP mode, but you leave Thunderbird active, you'll be unable to log onto your various email accounts, even though you use the correct userids/passwords.  I've also found that if you restart Thunderbird in Troubleshooting mode, you'll be able to log on with the correct userids and passwords. </p><p>I did a fair amount of research on the difference between sleep mode in Windows 10 and Windows 11.  In Windows 10 I never had a problem.  There is apparently something called Hibernate mode and you'll read things which say it's often not available on Windows 11 desktop machines (which is what I have - a Dell XPS8950).  Nevertheless I tried very hard to activate Hibernate mode on my Windows 11 Pro machine, without success.  I called Dell and they basically gave me the same information that I had already read online.  None of the procedures worked, usually because the options that the recipe told you to use were unavailable or brought up screens that were completely different. </p><p>There was one option that did work, going into Command mode and entering ""powercfg/a"".  It showed that on my machine supposedly Standby (S3), Hibernate, and Fast Startup were available.  But when I tried to activate Hibernate mode using another ""powercfg"" option, it said that I lacked sufficient authority. </p><p>I believe Hibernate is the same as S4.  There are S options from 1 through 4.  I'm guessing that my Windows 10 machine was using S0 because I found something that says it allows fast startup which I did have in Windows 10. It seems clear to me that S3 is the culprit.  Whether Thunderbird can be fixed to interrogate the status of the machine before it attempts to retrieve or send email I don't know. </p><p>I now make sure that I NEVER leave the machine in Sleep mode with Thunderbird active.  To help me with this I've changed it so that Sleep mode will never be activated by the mere passage of time.  In practice I've taken to doing a complete shutdown because it was easy to make an icon on the desktop which did this.  The only way I know to activate sleep mode is CTL/ALT/DELETE and then click on the option in the lower right corner.  Too many steps.  It's easier to just shut the machine down. </p><p>By the way, on the Dell keyboard for my Windows 10 machine there was a key for sleep mode.  This key is not present on my Windows 11 machine, again with a Dell branded keyboard. </p>",tcluster,false,0,0

Even though I'm not putting, or allowing, the Windows 11 machine to go into Sleep mode, the problem just recurred.  Suddenly Thunderbird lost the passwords for my three mail servers and I had to restart Thunderbird in Troubleshooting mode to enter the passwords.  There's a big problem here, I would hope someone might respond.  Has no one else encountered this problem with Windows 11?  I have Carbonite also, in case that's pertinent.

I found some cleanup parameters but nothing that allowed me to control or specify specific files or directories.  I have Thunderbird installed on my ""D"" drive, which is an external drive.  There is a small set of files on C:\Users\tclus\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird, but the profiles.ini file points to the folder on the D drive. </p><p>Is there a way for me to locate the deficiency or error next time this occurs?  My understanding of Troubleshooting mode (the only way I can get out of this problem and successfully re-enter the passwords) is that it deletes unused or old or unnecessary (not sure which) files.  Whatever the problem is, it doesn't delete the information about the three email accounts, instead it acts like the password is missing or invalid.  It invites me to enter the password, but it immediately responds with another invitation to reenter the password.  In other words, it acts like the password I entered is incorrect.  I assume there's no file that contains ONLY the passwords - instead I'm guessing there's a file which contains information about the email servers which includes the passwords.  Next time this happens I could examine this file.  Or is there possibly a trace function I could invoke when the entered password doesn't work? </p><p>I have no cleanup programs, nor do I use any of the security programs like Norton or McAfee.  I depend upon Windows Defender.  I do use Carbonite.  Is it possible that if Carbonite is copying a file to the cloud that the file is momentarily unavailable to Thunderbird?  Carbonite is the only new feature I've added on the Windows 11 system.  Thunderbird was on the same external ""D"" drive in Windows 10.

I saved a copy of the pkcs11.txt file, which in retrospect was a good idea, because when I restarted Thunderbird it did not make a new version of the file.  Also, it asked for the password but when I entered it the indicator in the upper left corner kept going back and forth which suggested it was in some kind of loop.  I restarted it in Troubleshooting mode and it worked, sort of, even though there was no pkcs11.txt file.  I say ""sort of"" because I didn't keep detailed notes, but I think it worked without my entering a password. </p><p>Anyhow, I noticed that the pkcs11.txt file had the file spec for the C drive location, going back to 2018, so I made a copy of pkcs11.txt with that location changed to the new D drive location, and I restarted Thunderbird, NOT in troubleshooting mode, and it works perfectly. </p><p>So I believe all I really did was change the file location shown in the pkcs11.txt file to point to its new location.

If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: </p><pre>    mailnews.default_view_flags      0       &lt;=unthreaded   </pre> <p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </p><pre>  First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	   In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that     shows  context menu.&nbsp;:   At the very bottom is the option:   -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""   -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""   -&gt; Hover over an account   -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself. </pre> <p>ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:  </p><pre>    // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation     user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); </pre> <p>- copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

At about version #63 when the major internal architectural changes occurred, I gave up on T-Bird and stayed with Version #62 (or so) until about three months ago. Why: I had a _stable_ email client that did exactly what I wanted! That is, I had a sufficient number of Add-On's that worked around bugs and that overcame T-bird deficiencies in my daily workflow. </p><p>I was forced to look at the current T-bird  (&gt;= #101) when I moved my mid-2012 Mac laptop to Open Core MacOS Monterey  because T-bird #63 couldn't run reliably on Monterey. (Apple no longer provides ""legal"" updates to this hardware and Open Core makes it possible to run more current MacOS versions.). </p><p>What kept me with T-Bird over the years: • Easy viewing of email headers (mostly used for looking at scam email) • Add-ons that actually added useful features in my workflow • And sadly, in the majority: Add-ons that worked around T-bird bugs, some that had/have lingered for over a decade. </p><p>At least in the present version some of the decade-old bugs are gone. For example, I like putting blank lines between numbered list entries (using shift-return). Do this too many times and  you couldn't get out of numbered list mde without standing on your head. </p><p>At least for now (please pardon my cynicism), the ratio of Add-On;s that do useful things to the add-ons that ""fix"" egregious persistent, decade-old bugs has markedly declined.

In the Desktop's TB address books there 3 Books: Personal Address Book, AAA and 200 others, Collected Addresses. They contain 11, 201, and 16 contacts respectively. On the Desktop (and it's backup) there are the following abook* and history* files: abook, abook-1, history . Each have both an old .v3.sqlite suffix and a current .sqlite suffix. So that is 6 files in all. The 3 current .sqlite files were copied into the Laptop's Profile replacing the exiting abook.sqlite and history.sqlite as well as inserting the abook-1.sqlite.  When the Laptop TB was launched it picked up the Personal Address Book, and Collected Addresses but was missing the 201 contacts imported into the Desktop called AAA and 200 others file. I did some sleuthing and saw that the prefs.js file did not have any ldap entries for the missing contacts from the ""AAA and 200 others"". I found the Desktop's entries in it's prefs.js and inserted those 4 lines for the abook-1 file into the laptop's prefs.js. Upon relaunching TB my missing contacts were found! If you have any problems with what I did please advise on what I should have done differently. If there is no other feedback I will mark this as solved. Thanks for your help! </p>",laurencegregg,false,0,0
