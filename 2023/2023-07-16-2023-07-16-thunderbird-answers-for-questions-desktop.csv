I hadn't accessed Thunderbird for months on the laptop prior to this and it wouldn't let me access my mail but insisted I provide the password.  Well, the password is the same for my email, no matter where I try to access it (I have two desktops and the one laptop).  I use a password manager and cut and paste exclusively so there's no possibility of a typo.  It wouldn't accept my password!  Even my desktop accepted my password so I could accept email.  But my laptop, no.  The plot thickens. </p><p>This morning, just for S&amp;G, I restored my settings for the SMTP server to what it was originally on my desktop. It then demanded my password.  Huh?  I entered it from my password manager once again and BOOM! </p><p>The email went through.  Not just my incoming... my previous test message went through as well!  I now can send as well as receive. </p><p>All I can conclude is that Charter/Spectrum had struck again.  When they have a problem, my experience is that they always deny and deflect, sending me off on a wild goose chase for something that ultimately will end up being their problem.  This must have been yet another example.  In any case, it appears to be fixed, and not because of anything you or I tried. </p><p>I can remember a time when Charter had me reboot, then ultimately wanted me to delete my profile and set up another.  Ever since then, I've learned to reboot and go no further on what they say to do... seek help elsewhere! </p><p>I'm sorry I bothered you and I do appreciate your putting the effort in to try to help me.

Just tell Thunderbird ti use the same one. </blockquote> <p>Hi Matt, thanks for your answer. I don't think Gnome is connecting to any server by itself. The idea is that Thunderbird accounts are added to Gnome by Thunderbird. (so Thunderbird is the CalDAV/CardDAV client and all events/contacts should be pushed to Gnome) </p><p>After some more searching I found this 11 year old (!!) bug. Hopefully it will be picked up by the developers. It would be such a huge improvement to the overall experience of using Thunderbird on any Gnome desktop like Ubuntu. </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847989"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847989</a> </p>",thomaslobker,false,0,0
