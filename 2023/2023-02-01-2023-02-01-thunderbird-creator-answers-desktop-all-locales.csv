All I want is a white background in incoming messages (both plain-text and HTML, unless the HTML code asks for a different background). </p> <hr> <p>Thank you (after 10+ years) for finally making the font size adjustable in the folder and message pane. Also for finally fixing not easily being able to get out of numbering when forcing blank lines between numbered paragraphs. </p><p>I was actually very happy with version 60.x.x because I had a set of add-ons that working around most of the bugs and had an email client that did what I wanted. With the migration to the new  add-ons internals, I lost most every behavior I needed/enjoyed. </p><p>In closing, if I can have a default white background/canvas on incoming email messages, I'll stay with T-bird. If not, I'm ready to give up on Thunderbird (after using it for 15 years) and trade it for the the boring stability of Outlook. </p><p>I know you are volunteer organization.

Ho fatto una prova con una mia collega e ho impostato l'invio ripetitivo di un messaggio ogni 2 minuti. L'estensione funziona alla perfezione, ma ora vorrei modificare o eliminare la programmazione di quella mail che viene inviata ogni due minuti (ad esempio cambiare il testo della mail, cambiare la programmazione del tempo e dei giorni in cui inviare l'email, o addirittura eliminare proprio l'emissione programmata di quella specifica email). Tutto questo ovviamente senza rimuovere o disabilitare l'estensione, perché ho già programmato l'invio di altri messaggi indirizzati ad altri clienti con cui lavoro. Ho provato a capire da sola come fare, ma sono riuscita solo a rimuovere l'estensione o disattivarla... io invece vorrei riuscire a modificare una delle tante email che ho programmato.

I'm looking for a way to block message removal by the server in the IMAP protocol - the ""(server) append only mode"" (it should be still possible to delete/move message from Thunderbird). </p><p>Why? I see 2 main use cases: </p><p>1. The (corporate) server has message retention set globally (e.g. to 1 year) which ""cannot"" be changed. Users might want to keep their ""important"" email longer (and in addition, keep it in the same folders as before, not using the folders copy in the ""Local folders"" space). </p><p>2. Due to the unexpected situation - a server error, fire in a data center, a ransom attack, malicious email provider - all the email (or some of them) are removed from the server. Thunder would sync with the server removing the messages from the synchronized folder on a computer (sure, backup is good, but for the ""silent action"" - e.g. part of the emails deleted (or encrypted), it might take too long to detect that problem and still have a valid backup). </p><p><br> The are some (not perfect) workarounds, including: </p> <ul><li> keeping old emails in the ""Local folders"" - two places to search (or many if you have a folder hierarchy with the automatic filtering) </li><li>a separate, local IMAP server to keep an ""append only"" copy of the message (e.g. isync, offiline imap), possibly to be used by Thunderbird (instead of the upstream IMAP server) </li><li>using POP3 (with its own downsides&nbsp;:) ) </li></ul> <p><br> An obvious downside of the implementation in Thunderbird - which users of that feature have to be aware - is not doing any delete/move operations on the server (e.g. with the webclient or some other IMAP client). Nevertheless, to fulfill the aforementioned requirement it doesn't seem a high cost. </p><p>Questions: 1. Is it possible to achieve in Thunderbird itself? 2. Is there any API to help implement that as an extension? 3. Have you - by any chance - tried to implement that using the third party tools (e.g. a local IMAP server which is used by TB) and can recommend any solution? 4.

1404049,2023-02-01 10:50:29 -0800,2023-02-02 14:31:02 -0800,Oauth and Outlook-to-Thunderbird -- apologies in advance for so many questions to follow,"<p>I've been using Outlook to send and receive email for my AOL account for about ten years. Last October, a bug occurred on the AOL site, ""temporarily"" removing users' ability to generate a 16-character server password. This did not create a problem for me until I changed my AOL email password a few days ago.  Now I can see my old email in Outlook and I can view new email via iPhone, Thunderbird or the AOL website, but I can no longer send or receive email in Outlook.  This has happened to a lot of people in the last three months, and no one at AOL seems to want to fix the problem. </p><p>I saw the following remark from someone who was in a similar situation: </p><p><em>""The only fix I have found is to use Thunderbird. Thunderbird allows you to manually switch the server authentication to Oauth so it can use your email password instead of an app-generated one.""</em> </p><p>That made me curious enough to download and set up Thunderbird V102.7.1 (64-bit), and it does allow me to view my recent email.  My goal is have the same viewing experience as I had with Outlook; that is, an Inbox folder in the left margin for recent email that requires follow-up, and about 240 other folders where I'm storing receipts, business conversations, and anything else that I may one day need to look up. </p><p>To that end, I was hoping that the ""easy"" way to do that would be to: </p><p>1. Find a software product that will convert my Outlook PST files to a format that TB can import 2. Import the converted files into TB </p><p>The first problem I'm hitting with that approach is that when I select <strong>Import from Outlook</strong> in TB, I get a bright red ""No profile found"" message.  Does that message mean that TB is looking unsuccessfully for something in my Outlook installation? Does it mean that TB is looking for one of my profile names (e.g. ""Default-User"") instead of Outlook?  Or do I perhaps need to create another profile in TB and name it Outlook? </p><p>I haven't tried converting PST files yet, and I may wait on that until I have an answer to the import question.   </p><p>OK, one other question, and it involves a very low-tech approach to solving my problem.  It would go something like this: </p><p>1. In Outlook, move all email from Inbox folder to a new folder named ""000 - Temp"" 2. In Outlook, pick a folder, e.g., ""Amazon"" 3. In Outlook, drag all email from the Amazon folder to the Inbox folder 4. Wait for the Inbox folder on the TB email page to ""find"" and display the email that was just moved there 5. Create an Amazon folder in TB and move the messages from TB Inbox to TB Amazon 6. Repeat steps 2 thru 5 for every folder in Outlook </p><p>I already know this would be painfully slow and tedious. My question is, will the TB Inbox actually find and display messages shortly after I move them from one of my other folders? </p><p>OK, end of Part One. Thanks in advance for input, suggestions or laughter. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1563419;1563497;1563590;,DLESNER123

I've double check and tripled checked (and more) that the emails are being sent from the correct address. </p><p>I had no idea why folks weren't responding to me until a co-worker wanted to know why I kept sending things from her email address.
