Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency.  </p><p>Note: The settings are pixels, not points, so you may need to set a higher number than anticipated. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I do not understand why you just want one account. However, if you already have thunderbird working with an addressbook and some accounts and want to restore one more, then, assuming the account is POP, you could  - add the account, but omit retrieving any messages.  - exit thunderbird and copy the folders in your screenshot to overwrite the folders created when you recreated the account  - restart thunderbird  </p><p>But that's dicey.

Since you prefer to just restore accounts, then I suggest you locate all the folders and, with Thunderbird not running, copy them into the Mail\Local Folders folder of the current profile.

Here are a few potential reasons and troubleshooting steps you can take: </p><p>Software Updates: Ensure that your operating system and installed software are up to date. Updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements that can resolve issues that might cause the need for frequent reboots. </p><p>Overheating: Check if your computer is overheating. Excessive heat can cause instability and crashes. Make sure the cooling system (fans, vents) is clean and functioning properly. You can use monitoring software to check the temperature of your CPU and take appropriate measures if it's running too hot. </p><p>Hardware Issues: Inspect your hardware components for any signs of malfunction. Faulty RAM, a failing hard drive, or a defective power supply can lead to frequent reboots. Running hardware diagnostics or consulting a professional technician can help identify and resolve any hardware-related problems. </p><p>Malware or Virus Infections: Perform a thorough scan of your system using reliable antivirus or anti-malware software. Malware infections can cause system instability and frequent crashes. Make sure your antivirus software is up to date and perform regular scans to keep your system protected. </p>",techguy150,false,0,0

I am using Windows 11 and keep it up to date.  I also have the latest version of McAfee software and malwarebytes.  If I remember to just minimize thunderbird rather than close it, it keeps on working.  If I close it, then often I need to reboot the computer to use it.  I think there are too many emails hiding somewhere that are causing the problem.  I deleted all the junk mail I could find. </p>",patnsandy,false,0,0
