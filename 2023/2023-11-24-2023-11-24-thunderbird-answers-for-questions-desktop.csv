If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I createds a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0

The trouble with that was I had already gone round in so many circles that I had no idea where I had found the 'table' reference.  So thanks for your guidance which I can remember in case it jumps out at me again.    Why is it not under the 'view' menu item - no - don't answer that!

Windows does a sterling jobs of not managing temp files.  I have seen systems with so many hundreds of thousands of orphaned temp files in the temp folder that windows itself is struggling to address them with the available resources.  Things get exponentially worse when say Thunderbird is writing more files in there and an antivirus is also trying to monitor the creations and executions.  Technically you are limited to around 4Billion files in a folder.  The reality historically has been closer to 10,000 before real performance issues kick in. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In recent windows releases there has been a default dark theme.

But I also customise windows to set the appearance of applications.   </p><p>I do prefer the windows task bar in black,  so I try not to fiddle with the windows theme defaults much,  but there are many free themes in the Microsoft store for windows and all of them may change the way Thunderbird displays lists depending if they are based on a dark theme or a light one.  So I also set the windows display to always use light themes for applications.   </p><p>With a bit of fiddling,  I found this morning that windows 11 at least has a setting to set applications to use a light theme, i5t was probably also in Windows 120,  and I missed it.  I have included the windows page that allows the setting of a light application theme and suggest you set it.   First you have to set the mode to custom and then it displays the option for a different setting for windows V's applications.  As you can see I have the windows set to dark and the applications set to light. </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-11-25-16-25-02-63a89d.png""> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
