You are quite correct and it was a setting on the 'new to me' Mac Ventura software I am now using, but it also wasn't consistent.  Some times I got the full stop and other times I didn't.  I now believe it was down to the speed which a double space is typed.  I am old fashioned and was taught a single space after a comma but a double space after a full stop and that is what I've always done.  But what appears to have been happening was that if I typed the two spaces at let's say a leisurely pace (as I am not the speediest of typists) I got no full stop.  However, if I deliberately gave a very quick double tap when I was checking this 'fault' I would always get a full stop.  So I believe the reason it was inconsistent was that sometimes without meaning to, I would get a double tap and the full stop would appear!  I would then have to go back and erase it and continue.  However, I have been into settings now (which has also changed dramatically in Ventura and caused me more problems in finding things!) and turned this feature as well as the automatic capitalisation off - that was another thing was that annoying me!  Thanks again.  I've noted one more thing in my text here too - and although I've typed a double space after every full stop, as I always do, when I post the reply it removes the second space.  This is one more annoying thing I find today - software changing things without asking, instead of leaving them as they were. </p>",roy4matra,false,0,0

So thanks for your guidance which I can remember in case it jumps out at me again.    Why is it not under the 'view' menu item - no - don't answer that!  The whole purpose of an email client is to manage emails, so I suggest customising the emails view should be a main menu item. </p><p>As far as the multiplicity of tabs appearing is concerned - I realised I could just 'X' them away.  I'm assuming that a new release had just landed at just the moment I tried to prevent 'threading' by following someone's 'cheat sheet' type instructions from this website.  That rather confused the whole issue for me. </p><p>LOL - in my day -a millenium ago - the watchword was KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid. </p>",m_e_c,false,0,0

Windows does a sterling jobs of not managing temp files.  I have seen systems with so many hundreds of thousands of orphaned temp files in the temp folder that windows itself is struggling to address them with the available resources.  Things get exponentially worse when say Thunderbird is writing more files in there and an antivirus is also trying to monitor the creations and executions.  Technically you are limited to around 4Billion files in a folder.  The reality historically has been closer to 10,000 before real performance issues kick in. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

But I also customise windows to set the appearance of applications.   </p><p>I do prefer the windows task bar in black,  so I try not to fiddle with the windows theme defaults much,  but there are many free themes in the Microsoft store for windows and all of them may change the way Thunderbird displays lists depending if they are based on a dark theme or a light one.  So I also set the windows display to always use light themes for applications.   </p><p>With a bit of fiddling,  I found this morning that windows 11 at least has a setting to set applications to use a light theme, i5t was probably also in Windows 120,  and I missed it.  I have included the windows page that allows the setting of a light application theme and suggest you set it.   First you have to set the mode to custom and then it displays the option for a different setting for windows V's applications.

I've tried that a number of times today and in the past but it does not bring back the choice banner and there seems to be no way to do that.  sometimes the remote content may be from other associated domains and so whitelisting the email source does not solve the problem.  It is very puzzling and annoying that there is no way to change one's mind after clicking the wrong choice by mistake. </p>,allendick,false,0,0

My problem is that inbound messages arrive fine but when I send email it goes right to ""Sending Message"" forever: an infinite loop. It doesn't say message failed or enter password or anything, just and infinite unending loop with message ""Sending Message"" which eventually ( half hour and longer) I click on CANCEL. I've spent more than an hour on my cellphone with ATT and finally got the new secure key code but that makes no difference as there's no place to enter it on either  <a href=""http://att.com"" rel=""nofollow"">att.com</a> or Thunderbird. As a matter of fact TB no longer shows GET MAIL or WRITE on its menu bar. I have to dig it out by clicking other things just to create an email message which goes back to that infinite loop. </p>",Edwin0613,false,0,0
