Hover mouse cursor over the top edge of the composing area (or you could say it was the bottom edge of Formatting bar) and cursor should change to double arrow head icon - left click hold down and drag upwards. This means the 'TO' area gets compressed in size and forces a scroll bar to appear. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The only add-on I have is the Send Later extension by Jonathan Kamens and I wouldn't have thought that would cause it. I have been using it for years without this current problem and it was last updated back in September 2023 but I never saw this full stop fault until this month. I could disable it I suppose and see if it still does it. </p>,roy4matra,false,0,0
