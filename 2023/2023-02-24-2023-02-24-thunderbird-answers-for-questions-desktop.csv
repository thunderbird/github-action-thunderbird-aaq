If you want yourself and colleagues to share live updates, then you need to get your addresses online, such as carddav with a google account that each person sets up individually.

After I deleted everything as above and started over all my subscribed calendars were not carried over to Thunderbird.  So, I tried to add them individually to Thunderbird.   </p><p>The calendar has no password and I can cut and past the URL into any browser and it opens. It looks like: <a href=""https://calendar.google.com/calenda"" rel=""nofollow"">https://calendar.google.com/calenda</a> /embed?src=<a href=""http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.calendar.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.calendar.google.com</a>&amp;ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles </p><p>To add to Thunderbird I tried: </p><p>- Under calendars I selected ""+"" - Selected ""on my network"" - Kept User name blank and for Location: pasted the URL as above I hit ""find"" and it asks for a password when there is none. So I am stuck. </p><p>I looked through the posts and did not see anyone else having this problem so suppose I am just doing something wrong? </p><p>Any advice would be helpful!  I can re-post this as a new question if that is better too. </p><p>Thanks </p>",Bus275Mail,false,0,0
