The breach happened, and there's nothing you can do to reverse that fact.

It wasn't the fact that my email address was out in the ether but the coincidence that spoofing went from zero recently to renewed occurence that made me ask.

The recent increase in spoofing could be the same guys renewing their campaign or new actors altogether who've recently gotten their hands on your email address. They don't need to be alerted by the pwning notice. Such an alert is of no use or consequence to their activities. You could change your address, but even that doesn't guarantee your new address won't be a part of a breach some day. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

On EVERY occasion in the past, after I've cancelled my service with an email provider, I've been able to read ALL of the email that was previously downloaded to Thunderbird.  I've never had to move a copy to my local folder - though, now that I've had this most recent experience of having the emails disappear on my laptop, I will probably do that in the future. </p><p>So here's the question:  this has NEVER happened before AND it has happened ONLY on my linux laptop --- NOT on my Windows desktop.  So why is it happening now, after never happening before and why is it happening only on my linux laptop and not my Windows desktop??  Are the versions of Thunderbird on linux and Windows very, very different?  (of course it never happened on my linux laptop before --- i.e., not until I recently installed a new version of my linux operating system --- that might be the answer --- perhaps the version of Thunderbird that runs on this new OS doesn't work the same way that the version of Thunderbird ran on my old linux OS??

Wait a minute, how are you going to ""get my copy to back to functioning like it should"" if you are declaring it's perfect and has no bugs? </p><p>Are you offering to fix a ""non bug"", ""a bug"", you claim, that doesn't exist?  </p><p>So Stans, tell me, how do you believe you can fix a bug for me you just declared doesn't exist? </p><p>Yes, I'd be interested in a fix for the non bug so that my perfectly running copy of Thunderbird can send and receive e-mails. And while you're at it, maybe you can explain a new method for deleting email accounts (not using the Thunderbird declared method) that won't cause this non bug to happen again the next time I delete an account. </p><p>I have a great car, over the decades they've added hundred of features, computers, high speed wide tyres, ceramic brakes, 8 speed gearbox, launch control and the list goes on and on. But, if it can never start again after an oil change its not a car. And if 10 million people who haven't changed the oil say it is, they are wrong. </p><p>Stans, for future reference (use it as a life lesson): If you are attempting to make a cutting statement directed at another person don't start by commenting something works perfectly and you know how to fix it in the same sentence it makes you sound well.......... </p><p>And, Stans, for the record: If you can follow the programmers method for taking an action and that action causes their program to fail, it's what people in the computer industry call ""a bug"". Most interested programmers would like to eliminate it in less that a decade and if that comment upsets you then you should perhaps find a better use for your time. </p>",firefox2220,false,0,1

There are outlier cases where remnants of deleted accounts exist in Thunderbird's preferences file, but cleaning after them is as simple as searching through one plain-text file that you can open using Notepad or a text editor of your choice. If there is a dormant decade-old bug report that covers this specific case, I imagine there is no incentive to resolve it when <strong>not</strong> a whole lot of users are experiencing it and an easy workaround exists to remedy it. Call it arrogance or what you may, it is what it is, and you can apply this <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1330505"" rel=""nofollow"">known remedy</a>  or wait another decade for a bug fix that won't come.

Apparently not only the .js file, it stores information elsewhere. </p><p>So is that a bug? </p><p>But thanks for thinking I wouldn't make any effort to fix my own problem even though I already demonstrated I had. </p><p>And, your link? I'm curious as to how anybody with my problem could get to that link even if it worked? It's title is totally irrelevant to my problem,  I don't have a POP or IMAP problem I have a specific Thunderbird configuration problem. </p><p>I guess the bug is so irrelevant to Thunderbird it doesn't even warrant help or support? </p><p>(Please, again, if you are trying to comment on how good Thunderbird is: Don't say ""we ignore bugs"" in the same sentence as you say ""we have a great system for dealing with bugs called bugzilla"". ) </p><p>That brings me to your comment ""If it has been reported as a bug"". So finding that out isn't important by your assessment? You can give a detailed account as to why the ""bug' was ignored but you can't state whether it has or hasn't been reported as a ""bug""? That incongruity isn't working for me. </p><p>And on this great ""bugzilla"": I went to ""bugzilla"" I signed on using my GitHub account (which, absurdly, required an e-mail verification) and on completion of my sign in it came up with some stupid comment I couldn't access ""bugzilla"". So, that is why I'm here and not bugzilla, yet another total failure of the system.  </p><p>Apparently bugzilla is it's own bug. </p><p>Mozilla asks for contribution and support but makes accessing the system so convoluted it isn't worth trying. </p><p>Just go an look at the useless support/contact pages yourself. </p><p>Can I highlight one more thing: Bug reporting is used to eliminate faults that are irregular and not found under normal usage (unless Mozilla is just hopelessly incompetent), for those organisations who are enthusiastic enough to seek perfection and for those organisations who realise failure to fix an irregular minor fault may, at some future time, lead to a major fault. (That's why pharmaceutical companies don't simply ignore 1:1,000,000 deaths.) </p><p>Based on your comments, the bottom line is this:  </p><p>Mozilla chooses to ignore bugs so it's not worth reporting them even if the bugzilla system worked and you could. If a bug is reported you can provide a reason why it was ignored whether you actually know if it's been reported or not. Mozilla doesn't check if bugs have been reported previously it just decides which ones to ignore. Your simple solution, isn't a solution, so perhaps, if I was thus desirous of a real solution I could probably wait between 10 years and infinity for Mozilla to fix it. The bug will continue to be ignored because Mozilla is perfect. People shouldn't get annoyed at these obvious failures because Mozilla is perfect. </p><p>So given that there is a major bug, Mozilla is destined to ignore it, can offer no help or support on the issue because it's not interested in even finding out if its been reported let alone fix it and it will therefore never find a solution that more or less gives me my answer which is: Don't use Thundrbird.  </p><p>There is a certain constancy with Mozilla given Firefox has also been going through downgrades since it changed to the new version a few years ago and stopped being truly open source preferring rather to dictate it's own view of what people should want and disabling or crippling more apps at each itteration. </p><p>Perhaps it's time to move from thinking Mozilla ""is a great open source alternative"" and accept Mozilla is, like all these organisations end up defaulting to: Just another dud. </p><p>Oh, and if you find an actual solution in the next decade or so, maybe you should add it to support under a searchable heading (rather than, as you seem to be declaring, the apparently pointless pursuit of contacting bugzilla). </p>",firefox2220,false,0,1

So the option suggested by Stans was already eliminated before I posted. (I don't post until I have eliminated all the fundamental, non programming options). </p><p>I looked at the configuration in Thunderbird, specifically SMTP settings and although Thunderbird had deleted the account, there it was, my e-mail address was still listed under SMTP settings. I removed it. </p><p>That stopped Thunderbird searching for the deleted e-mail address sign on but the error remained: </p><p>""Sending of the message failed. Failed due to unexpected error 80004005.

If there is a solution Mozilla should ensure it finds it's way to help and support properly indexed as a failure following deletion of an e-mail account but if the Mozilla view is adding rubbish like web search to an e-mail client is more urgent and preferable to getting it to add and delete e-mail accounts/send and receive e-mails, like Mozilla, I just don't care, I'll find someone who does. </p>",firefox2220,false,0,1
