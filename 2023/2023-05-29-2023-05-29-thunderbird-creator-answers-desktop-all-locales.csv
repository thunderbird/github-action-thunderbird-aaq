My version of Thunderbird is 102.7.1, and I'd love to receive an answer for how I could either make it respect my default browser, or simply configure the command it uses to open link in browser - I could then just configure it to use either my script or the exo-open command, but I see no option for that in the settings, anywhere. </p><p>It's quite baffling that both the browser and the email client are from Mozilla, yet it's the only application I'm having trouble getting to open the links in Firefox correctly&nbsp;;) I hope someone can advice me - other than to upgrade (believe me, I will do that just as soon as I can). </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",robsku
