Actually, my 115 now looks almost identical to 102, but better. What I do suggest is that you go to settings&gt;privacy&amp;security and set Thunderbird to NOT automatically update, which is why you were updated from 102 to 115. That puts you back in control for future versions. The benefit of 115 is that it is actively supported and 102 is at end-of-life. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In addition to the above, the overall problem seems to be that Thunderbird V115 loses focus under several circumstances. In addition to the Ctrl+C problem, if I have an email focused that has attachments, when I detach or delete the attachments the focus changes to the next email in the inbox. I have to re-click on the email I was working with to bring it back into focus. These issues never happened before version 115. Is anyone else having this problem?
