This causes me to skip over the message, thinking I've already read it.  Very inconvenient, can't imagine how it's not an issue to other users. </p><p>I've seen other solutions that suggest toggling F8 to hide the preview pane.  However, the next message is still selected, but not marked Read.  Upon toggling F8 again, the selected message is then marked Read, making this not an optimal solution. </p><p>I was tempted to revert back to an older version, but my profile is no longer compatible.

They're not listed in the main TB window. Nor are all of my accounts. And the messages themselves don't seem to be anywhere on my computer. I'm using file per message storage.

But --allow-downgrade sends me to 78, not 112.
