The calendar works perfectly, updating network calendar as needed. </p><p>When  I create a new event and press [Save and Close] button, the dialog box closes, but the event takes about 25-35 seconds to appear on the calendar. </p><p>When I delete the event it takes about 12-15 seconds to disappear from the view. </p><p>If the calendar is local (on the computer) the event appears immediately on the calendar view. </p><p>I presume that this has to do with the network update procedure. Is there a way (or an option) that would show the event immediately on the view and make the update on the background later on&nbsp;?  </p><p>My Thunderbird version is 115.1.0 (64-bit) installed on Microsoft Windows 11. </p><p>Thank you </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",EmmanuelT

I'd like to be able to export messages in a selected folder in MBOX format too but, if there is a way to do so, I've been unable to find it.  Older questions refer to the use of an add-on named 'ImportExportTools NG' but the add-on manager in v115 tells me that add-on is not compatible. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1597515;,ChuckoW
