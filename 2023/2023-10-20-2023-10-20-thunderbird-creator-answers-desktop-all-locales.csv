I am using Thunderbird 115.3.3 From Calendar/New Event/Invite Attendees, my email address is not correct. I cannot see how to change this. Strangely, I have the same issue with my laptop, but the address is different! Neither address is my core email address. Both devices are linked to the same IMAP source (Fastmail) I have spent a number of days trying to fix this.  Sending emails is just fine, using my selected sender address. How do I change the inviter address, so that I can get a response? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",robin88

The only way that I can adjust is by dragging other columns and thus affecting others. Am I missing something, or is this a possible bug that needs to be addressed in a future version? I am pretty sure that I've experienced this problem in earlier versions as well, because I've always struggled with getting the columns to my liking. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",powderguy
