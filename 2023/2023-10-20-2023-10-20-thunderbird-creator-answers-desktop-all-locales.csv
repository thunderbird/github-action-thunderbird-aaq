A previous upgrade switched my upgrade settings so...  Anyway, I solved a couple of annoying issues so I am not unhappy.  I have the view set up as ""Classic View""; it's too bad every time I change a view setting the menu disappears instead of staying open so I can test the view to see what it looks like instead of having to navigate back to the view again.  When the number of lines in the email listing exceeds the displayed area, and I navigate to the last item, which moves everything up so the last item is the last line in the current email listing pane, then delete that last line the lines rearrange themselves (not sort order) so the new last line is below the pane and I have to scroll down again to see the new last email line (even though the new last line is highlighted it cannot be seen in the email list pane).  The pane should rearrange so the last line is the last line displayed so I can press the [Del] key multiple times to delete the multiple junk email starting with the last line and see everything happening instead of hoping it happens. </p><p>Is there a fix for this?

I have used Thunderbird for many years, and I actively promote it to many people, including non-IT people.

Yesterday I imported several email accounts into a newly installed version of Thunderbird. A couple of them were new with little or no history, but one had been in use for a long time, so I clicked the options to import contacts and known mail addresses. I now see a number of addresses with ~TimeStamp1697730047279 in them in the contacts list within Thunderbird. Actually, constant part is ~TimeStamp169, followed by another 9 digits. I believe this comes consistently before the @ symbol, introducing the mail domain. To me, this looks like a mistake when importing a symbol, but I have no idea a what stage of the import it would arise. </p><p>I'm actually quite new to Thunderbird. Is this sort of thing common or have I possibly missed out something in setting up the profile? The account details originally came from BT mail. As you may know, that was originally based on Yahoo, but now they have their own BT web mail tool. So, I suppose Thunderbird may have applied templates designed for Yahoo, and then found an incomplete match. </p><p>So far, I've been quite impressed with Thunderbird, in particular the power of what you can apparently do. I'm experimenting with whether I can use this mail tool more generally, but I have to be convinced that I can operate it cleanly. </p><p>I guess that's a long introduction.
