Finally, it seemed after 30-60 minutes that Thunderbird had downloaded/retrieved all outstanding mail. Everything seemed OK, no apparent problems, except it seemed some messages hadn't been moved from Inbox to destination local folders. </p><p>I don't think I've ever done this before, I chose to have Thunderbird apply ""all"" message rules to the Inbox. I walked away for an hour or so. Later I returned and all seemed well. That is, all messages seemed processed by the rules, moved from Inbox to destination folders. </p><p>I was using Thunderbird just fine afterwards when suddenly it crashed. It has not run again despite multiple attempts to run Thunderbird. It crashes every time. Help please. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1612298;,davesailor

I use Thunderbird since more than 10 years and there are multiple mailaddresses within one profile. Probably 3-4 years ago i have archived a lot of mails and a few months ago i have noticed that the subfolders with the archived mails are simply lost. I don't know why this happened. However, i still have a backup from 3-4 years ago and i am pretty sure, that these subfolders still exist in that old backup. </p><p>Question: Is it possible now to install Thunderbird on my new computer and import two backup(different dates) of the same profile? If yes, what will happen with all emails, which are contained in both backups - will Thunderbird create a duplicate of all of these mails? </p><p>Many TIA! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",comao

I am using Thunderbird 115.3.3 From Calendar/New Event/Invite Attendees, my email address is not correct. I cannot see how to change this. Strangely, I have the same issue with my laptop, but the address is different! Neither address is my core email address. Both devices are linked to the same IMAP source (Fastmail) I have spent a number of days trying to fix this.  Sending emails is just fine, using my selected sender address. How do I change the inviter address, so that I can get a response? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1612301;,robin88

The only way that I can adjust is by dragging other columns and thus affecting others. Am I missing something, or is this a possible bug that needs to be addressed in a future version? I am pretty sure that I've experienced this problem in earlier versions as well, because I've always struggled with getting the columns to my liking. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",powderguy
