Yesterday I imported several email accounts into a newly installed version of Thunderbird. A couple of them were new with little or no history, but one had been in use for a long time, so I clicked the options to import contacts and known mail addresses. I now see a number of addresses with ~TimeStamp1697730047279 in them in the contacts list within Thunderbird. Actually, constant part is ~TimeStamp169, followed by another 9 digits. I believe this comes consistently before the @ symbol, introducing the mail domain. To me, this looks like a mistake when importing a symbol, but I have no idea a what stage of the import it would arise. </p><p>I'm actually quite new to Thunderbird. Is this sort of thing common or have I possibly missed out something in setting up the profile? The account details originally came from BT mail. As you may know, that was originally based on Yahoo, but now they have their own BT web mail tool. So, I suppose Thunderbird may have applied templates designed for Yahoo, and then found an incomplete match. </p><p>So far, I've been quite impressed with Thunderbird, in particular the power of what you can apparently do. I'm experimenting with whether I can use this mail tool more generally, but I have to be convinced that I can operate it cleanly. </p><p>I guess that's a long introduction. What I really want to know now is 2 questions: </p> <ol><li> What can I do now to fix this problem, or contamination of the data. </li><li> What can I do more generally to avoid behaviour of this kind in the future. </li></ol> <p>Many thanks, for any help or pointers on this topic. </p><p>Cheers, </p><p>C.
