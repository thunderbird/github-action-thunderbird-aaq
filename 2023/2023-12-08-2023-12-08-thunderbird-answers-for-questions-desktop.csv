All I can think of would be to either manually add the password to Thunderbird, or to remove what is there to allow a prompt. Here goes:  - click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security - click saved passwords and then show passwords - highlight the incoming server row and rightclick and select 'edit password'   </p><p>OR... - from same place, highlight the incoming and outgoing rows and delete. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The message is being generated by a TalkTalk server. I did a quick web search on this error message and noticed there are others out there who report to their email provider and are ignored. In this case, Thunderbird isn't even involved. Message goes from the sender's email server to the TalkTalk server which responds back. They are ignoring the problem. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You need to contact the email provider to reset the password. If you share the information to the right of the @ sign in email address, I may be able to help you locate the email provider. Also, please click 'account settings' and then 'server settings' and let me know the name of the server name (see attached). The name may begin with imap or pop or possibly mail.
