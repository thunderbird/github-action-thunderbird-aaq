I refuse to may the extra.  However archiving in gmail requires you to leave the mail in the IMAP account. Otherwise archiving does nothing and offers no errors.  The server just ignores the command.  It would not surprise me at all if Apple did exactly the same thing.  Even if you manage to get an archive of gmail somewhere else,  gmail still keeps it in the all mail folder, because in their setup that is the archive. </p><p>As for the unsubscribe,  that sounds like the process of deleting the archived mail is still in progress, (how many thousands of mails are in the queue?  That would prevent Thunderbird from accessing other folders when it was to get mail as all available connections would already be in use trying to sync the mass deletion.  Showing only the basic inbox and things like deleted is a  classic sign of connectivity issues with IMAP accounts. </p><p>If you have an apple phone or tablet also connected to that mail,  turn them off (overnight perhaps) and that will help the backlog as they have no connection limiting and each will prevent connection from other devices while they do their own sync. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

What's going on here? </blockquote> <p>IMAP servers have a limit to the number of concurrent logins that they will support.  Generally Thunderbird will use up to 5, apple mail on an iphone will just keep connecting until it is refused.  These multiple connections make things happen faster and allow for say an expunge on one folder while message headers are retrieved for another folder and finally a message is displayed because you selected it. </p><p>Thunderbird has controls on the number of connections for each account in the advanced button in server settings for the account.  But I think your issue is actually more involved.  It maybe that the total connections for a single rackspace mail account is 25 (your stated 5 users at Thunderbird's default 5 connections.)  This means you will have to reduce the connections per user to stay within the limit,  but as you decrease the number of connections things slow down.  Then if you get a sixth user then the whole issue come up again, and again for a seventh.  I suggest oyu determine exactly what server limit you are working within. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Being force fed mm-DD date formats would have this Aussie firing chips at all Mozilla and Mzla employees that poked their heads up.

Everyone jumps to ""malware""  but in reality if you have a third party antivirus, or internet security suite, it is probably the issue.   </p><p>Yes I am taking your issues out of order,  but I think that that is the key issue. Repopulating something from a disk file being slow is probably related to the inability to read and write to the disk.  Beyond the simplicity of the antivirus being the issue (restarting the operating system in safe mode with networking ios considered the standard diagnostic to eliminate outside influences like Av and other software like cloud sync and streaming backups which can also mimic no file access.  </p><p>When it comes to folder counts of unread and total messages.
