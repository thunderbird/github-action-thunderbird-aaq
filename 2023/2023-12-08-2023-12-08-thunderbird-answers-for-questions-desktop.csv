All I can think of would be to either manually add the password to Thunderbird, or to remove what is there to allow a prompt. Here goes:  - click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security - click saved passwords and then show passwords - highlight the incoming server row and rightclick and select 'edit password'   </p><p>OR... - from same place, highlight the incoming and outgoing rows and delete. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The message is being generated by a TalkTalk server. I did a quick web search on this error message and noticed there are others out there who report to their email provider and are ignored. In this case, Thunderbird isn't even involved. Message goes from the sender's email server to the TalkTalk server which responds back. They are ignoring the problem. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
