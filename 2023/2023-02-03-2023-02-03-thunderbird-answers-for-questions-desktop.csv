Try disabling any scanning of outgoing mail in your virus package as this can have a serious impact.  For that matter try without any internet scanning as all as some antivirus scanners consider mail ports to be something they scan,  even if mail is specifically excluded as a service. </p><p>Most folk with GMail and <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> have the issue because the provider is updating the sent folder with their copy of the sent mail at the same time Thunderbird is also trying to do it.  Their solution is to turn off Thunderbird making a copy at all. </p><p>For others  it is virus scanning that slows the process enough for it to timeout.  Yet others are in a situation that the upload bandwidth is simply saturated.  Multiple users in the house all uploading things at the same time (think snap chat for a constant stream of large uploads)  fundamentally the issue is mostly around the connection trying to upload the message times out.  This should generally be worse of large email than small ones. </p><p>Most consumer internet is significantly faster downstream than upstream.  Like 4 times faster,  the assumption is that consumers consume content,  not make it.  It is also a way to sort of force commercial operators that might want to run a business using the internet to buy a commercial symmetric package (the primary difference between consumer and business packages) </p><p>I looked at the windstream settings which they describe as <a href=""https://www.windstream.com/support/my-account/email-101/server-settings-for-windstream-email"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.windstream.com/support/my-account/email-101/server-settings-for-windstream-email</a> </p><p>I strongly suggest you confirm the settings for outgoing server SMTP.  YOu might also find that an unencrypted connection (no SSL) causes more of less issues.  This would demand on a number of things,  not the least of all the amount of data being send and received is less with unencrypted connections.  Not much different  but it is a difference there. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

You can also use the mailTo: protocol to do the same thing.  It is getting the send part that has always stopped me.  Thunderbird does not appear to have a send function that can be addressed via an API.  It is good from a security point of view as you don't get malware just churning out SPAM using the mail client, unless someone click the send button.  Bad for casual users of mail send code.  Although direct SMTP delivery is really not that onerous. </p><p>It is easier in my opinion to use an SMTP library to send the mail directly to the outgoing server.

Thunderbird automatically downloads emails even when the option is not checked in server settings to download when connecting.  If I click on the inbox it then auto downloads emails.

Maybe this is by design</em> </p><p>Sounds like you have set the account as an IMAP mail account. IMAP mail accounts are designed to display whatever is on server. So the 'Inbox' in an Imap account will be identical to the server 'Inbox' as seen when you logon to webmail account via a browser. </p><p>When you click on an imap folder eg: 'Inbox',  synchronisation occurs - Thunderbird checks server to update the 'Inbox' so it matches the server. The imap account folders are not completely independent of server, unlike Pop account folders. </p><p>Imap accounts can choose to download full copies or just headers. And this can be set up on a per folder basis within the Account Settings &gt; Synchronisation &amp; Storage - 'Advanced' button. </p><p>Good explanation on IMAP accounts and sychronisation here: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/imap-synchronization</a> </li></ul> <p><br> If you want to start up Thunderbird and retrieve all new messages, but then do not want any further connection with the server until you choose, then you will need to go into 'Offline' mode.  Returning back to 'Online' mode when you want to reconnect with server. </p><p><strong>Note: </strong> You will need to have selected the option to download full copies of emails in order to read emails in Offline mode.  You will not be able to send any emails whilst in 'Offline' mode, but you can compose emails and use 'Send Later' option. This puts the emails in the 'Outbox' folder located in the 'Local Folders' mail account. When you go back to 'Online' mode you can then send those emails. </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Outbox' folder and select 'Send unsent messages' </li></ul> <p>You can set up the 'Offilne' settings here: </p> <ul><li> Menu icon &gt; Settings &gt; General </li><li> Scroll down to 'Network &amp; Disc Space' section </li><li> Click on 'Offline..' button </li></ul> <p><strong>How to go to 'Offline' or 'Online' mode:</strong> Menu icon &gt; File &gt; Offline There are various options. You can choose to force a synchronisation to check all is up to date before going offline. Or just go direct to 'Work Offline' and it will use the 'Offline' settings you have set up as mentioned above. </p><p>Quick Method: In Bottom Status Bar on far left is the 'Online' / 'Offline' icon - click on it to go to opposite of current status. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
