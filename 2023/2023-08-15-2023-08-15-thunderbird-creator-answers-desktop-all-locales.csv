I accidentally hit 'K' with a thread selected, and so got a message at the bottom of the screen saying that replies to the thread will not be shown.  This is the same situation as in the now-archived question [[Accidentally pressed ""K"" on an email - can no longer find it|<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1380096"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1380096</a>]]. </p><p>I'm now writing because I *was* able to select the option to display ignored threads described in the reply to the question above – so that I can, at least, now see the thread that I accidentally ignored without meaning to.  But I'd like to actually fix the problem and un-ignore it. </p><p>I've read the support article on <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ignoring Threads</a>, but what that article describes – namely applying 'Ignore' to the same thread so that it toggles off to unignore the thread – isn't working.  I also tried quitting Thunderbird entirely after doing that and then reopening it, but I can still only see the thread if 'view' is set to still display ignored threads; when I remove that view instruction, the thread disappears again.   </p><p>Does anyone know if there's something else I should try?  Or is this maybe a bug in Thunderbird that needs to be fixed?  Thanks so much in advance! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",linegrandfather
