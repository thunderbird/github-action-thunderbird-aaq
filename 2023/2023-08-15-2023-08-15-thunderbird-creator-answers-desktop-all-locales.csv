Tips include removing account and adding it again, deleting SMTP password, trying both ports 587 and 465, and of course verifying my SMTP outgoing email settings multiple times. </p><p>The issue is, sometimes it works perfectly fine to send e-mails. Sometimes it doesn't - it can take up to 5-10 secs for the e-mail to be sent. </p><p>I've also tried: </p><p>1) Increasing Server Timeout Value in the Config Editor 2) Disabled Anti-virus briefly to find that the issue was still there </p><p>This is the e-mail box that is showing: <a href=""https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112202-84.55.121.202.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112202-84.55.121.202.png</a> </p><p>This is my Office365 SMTP settings: <a href=""https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112041-84.55.121.202.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112041-84.55.121.202.png</a> </p><p>Questions: </p><p>- Is anyone else experiencing issues sending e-mails with Office365 smtp settings? - Before migrating to Office365, sending e-mails was super quick. Now, it takes 2-5 secs for each e-mail to be sent. However, SOMETIMES, it sends super quick... How come?  - Does Office365 have general issues with Thunderbird? Using other e-mail clients such as Spark+ our Outlook doesn't give this issue, but I really want to use Thunderbird as it's been my go-to email client for multiple years </p><p>Hoping for a resolution... if anyone has experience with TB and Office365 having this issue, happy for any tips to try so I can start sending emails quick again. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",alexander85
