If you selected View Source it was empty. From the next day another message always comes out (always the same one), which works fine on the gmail website and with mutt or emacs gnus. </p><p>It happens with another 2 messages (the same message appears in all three). The three messages I received just before by date. I've tried clearing the cache and going into troubleshoot mode, but it keeps happening. </p><p>Does someone know how to solve this problem? </p><p>Thank you </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",MySelf9785

How is it working for you?","<p>I am just trying to get some feedback here. I never was able to fully get everything adjusted and migrated over from the version that I downloaded.  I had read not too long ago, that a user had updated, but they seemed to not be able to keep the same functionality and were troubleshooting some bugs with the updates. Something related to downloading and reading e-mails I believe. Please let me know how the latest release is working with Microsoft accounts. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",JoshuaCM

I accidentally hit 'K' with a thread selected, and so got a message at the bottom of the screen saying that replies to the thread will not be shown.  This is the same situation as in the now-archived question [[Accidentally pressed ""K"" on an email - can no longer find it|<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1380096"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1380096</a>]]. </p><p>I'm now writing because I *was* able to select the option to display ignored threads described in the reply to the question above – so that I can, at least, now see the thread that I accidentally ignored without meaning to.  But I'd like to actually fix the problem and un-ignore it. </p><p>I've read the support article on <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ignoring Threads</a>, but what that article describes – namely applying 'Ignore' to the same thread so that it toggles off to unignore the thread – isn't working.  I also tried quitting Thunderbird entirely after doing that and then reopening it, but I can still only see the thread if 'view' is set to still display ignored threads; when I remove that view instruction, the thread disappears again.   </p><p>Does anyone know if there's something else I should try?  Or is this maybe a bug in Thunderbird that needs to be fixed?  Thanks so much in advance! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",linegrandfather
