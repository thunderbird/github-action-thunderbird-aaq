Don't know how, but an email with one subject line has now been excluded from showing in Inbox. Since I can see that email in All Mail folder, I tried to copy it from All Mail to Inbox.  But it will not show in Inbox. Because my ThunderBird account is linked to a gmail account, I found that particular email in gmail.  So I know the problem is in ThunderBird. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",4jpsutka

Tips include removing account and adding it again, deleting SMTP password, trying both ports 587 and 465, and of course verifying my SMTP outgoing email settings multiple times. </p><p>The issue is, sometimes it works perfectly fine to send e-mails. Sometimes it doesn't - it can take up to 5-10 secs for the e-mail to be sent. </p><p>I've also tried: </p><p>1) Increasing Server Timeout Value in the Config Editor 2) Disabled Anti-virus briefly to find that the issue was still there </p><p>This is the e-mail box that is showing: <a href=""https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112202-84.55.121.202.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112202-84.55.121.202.png</a> </p><p>This is my Office365 SMTP settings: <a href=""https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112041-84.55.121.202.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bilddump.se/bilder/20230815112041-84.55.121.202.png</a> </p><p>Questions: </p><p>- Is anyone else experiencing issues sending e-mails with Office365 smtp settings? - Before migrating to Office365, sending e-mails was super quick. Now, it takes 2-5 secs for each e-mail to be sent. However, SOMETIMES, it sends super quick... How come?  - Does Office365 have general issues with Thunderbird? Using other e-mail clients such as Spark+ our Outlook doesn't give this issue, but I really want to use Thunderbird as it's been my go-to email client for multiple years </p><p>Hoping for a resolution... if anyone has experience with TB and Office365 having this issue, happy for any tips to try so I can start sending emails quick again. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",alexander85

I accidentally hit 'K' with a thread selected, and so got a message at the bottom of the screen saying that replies to the thread will not be shown.

But I'd like to actually fix the problem and un-ignore it. </p><p>I've read the support article on <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ignoring Threads</a>, but what that article describes – namely applying 'Ignore' to the same thread so that it toggles off to unignore the thread – isn't working.  I also tried quitting Thunderbird entirely after doing that and then reopening it, but I can still only see the thread if 'view' is set to still display ignored threads; when I remove that view instruction, the thread disappears again.   </p><p>Does anyone know if there's something else I should try?  Or is this maybe a bug in Thunderbird that needs to be fixed?  Thanks so much in advance! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",linegrandfather
