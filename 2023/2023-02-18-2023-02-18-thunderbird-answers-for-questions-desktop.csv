Questa mattina però mi sono accorto che cercando di scaricare la posta di quell'indirizzo da un altro client la sincronizzazione non avveniva e non scaricava nulla, mentre ieri invece era regolare. Facendo altre prove su Thunderbird avevo notato che da quell'indirizzo scaricava sempre e solo una email e sempre la stessa. Allora sono andato sulla webmail di Aruba, ho cancellato quella email, dopodiché ho riprovato a scaricare la posta da Thunderbird ed ha scaricato regolarmente tutte le email che erano presenti sul server di Aruba. Non so dire per quale motivo quella email bloccava la procedura, tra l'altro era una email da un indirizzo sicuro. Meno male che la cosa si è risolta positivamente e sono felice che non fosse un problema di Thunderbird (credo!). Grazie comunque dei suggerimenti. </p>",robertorizzardi,false,0,0
