They have a host of legacy domains and really don't do well with them.  Just about every email issue I have seen involving iiNet has been of the, it does not work, it does work I have no idea what happened type. </p><p>All I can suggest is you make sure to use the <a href=""http://mail.iinet.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.iinet.net.au</a>  sever for sending mail (SMTP).  That they offer a choice of outgoing server for POP and only <a href=""http://mail.iinet.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.iinet.net.au</a> for IMAP  would indicate a huge level of confusion about how their internal system works.  So I would stick with the most recent server name offered. </p><p>Given that the SMTP part is just like using the red post box on the street to send mail.  It has no link to how you get your mail (except the provider) but iiNet appear to think there might be, based on their published settings. <a href=""https://help.iinet.net.au/email-settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.iinet.net.au/email-settings</a> </p><p>Is your account in Thunderbird IMAP or POP? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Not the best,  but with the implementation of sync in the next version a general change around what is imported and exported will be required as account settings etc will not form part of most folks ""export"" items. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I personally have issues using Thunderbird synced data for archives where gmail is concerned as there is a more reliable way. </p><p>Create appropriate labels in Gmail for each year and get them applied to the gmail account using their mail filters. </p><p>Then toddle over to your Google takeout service and ""takeout""  all your labels as MBOX files.  It will take a day or two,   but you get to download everything in a zipped mbox format file. </p><p>Use a gmail filter to delete the account content once you are sure what you have is what you want. </p><p>Now you can add the mbox file using the import export tools add-on to Thunderbird's local folders.  (Or if you understand enough just put the files into the Thunderbird profile.  Quicker but requires more knowledge.) </p><p>They are your data stored locally and in no way associated with any particular account in Thunderbird.

But batches of more than a few hundred at a time generally result in something going wrong. </p><p><br> . </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
