Start Thunderbird and add the imap account.  4. Immediately unsubscribe from ""All Mail"" folder, which for gmail is just an archive directory.  You don't need it in Thunderbird.

This is actually more of an index used to list mails in the user interface.  If this stuff is not updating,  it is quite probable something is making access to the file difficult.  My guess would be an anti virus scanning files while they are being updated and hence they are not being read.  First instance would be to create an exception on the antivirus product for email scanning and on access scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder.  The first to safeguard as your users do not sound very technical and  having scanning on is a mess waiting to happen.  The second to address your specific issue. </p><p>Other issues can be; Profile stored in the documents folders.

My email is collected by my website (<a href=""http://www.orion-models.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">www.orion-models.co.uk</a>) and downloaded from there whenever I turn on Thunderbird - the subfolders do not exist there, Thunderbird moves mail from my inbox to relevant subfolders using message filters. I have too many subfolders to count and my emails go back at least 15 years - they have now built up to the point that the .thunderbird directory on Ubuntu is now 12.3 GB in size. This directory is backed up to a Windows 11 PC at weekly intervals. I only noticed the folder was missing on Thunderbird when I tried to move an email to there a day or two ago (this particular folder was not automated with a message filter). There may be other subfolders missing but I have not noticed any yet. </p><p>So my objective is to find the last occurence of the missing folder in the Windows backup and copy it from there back to Thunderbird on the laptop. How do I go about this please? I have been writing software professionally since about 1970, including installing the 2nd commercial installation of Unix in the UK back in 1981 and writing software for Unix since then and MS Windows since Win 95 so I really ought to know how to do this, but the Thunderbird directory structure has me a little confused (Windows 11 search is not helping either - what am I actually looking for?) </p><pre>  Thanks for your assistance </pre>",DerekMacOM,false,1,2

I've got mine in that location and all is working just fine. On new computer uninstall the current version. In <strong>C:/Program Files (x86)</strong> folder create a new folder called 'Mozilla Thunderbird' When reinstalling Thunderbird use the 'Custom' option to put it in the C:/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird folder. </p><p>On new computer - check the Firewall and make sure that the Thunderbird install is correctly set up as an allowed program. eg: C:/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Thunderbird/thunderbird.exe </p><p>In C://Users/ User name/Appdata/<strong>Roaming</strong> folder Make sure there is only one 'Thunderbird' folder.

Many of the more common antivirus programs basically use substitute certificates to hack your mail and scan it.  Thunderbird does not use the windows certificate store where they dump their questionable self signed certificates, unlike Microsoft mail. As such generally there are issues because there is a problem with the connection encryption. The certificate they use is not trusted by Thunderbird as it is not issued by an audited authority, so the connection fails.   </p><p>You can make Thunderbird trust these certificates,  but the instruction vary according to the antivirus vendor,  so their web site is the place to look for instruction on importing their certificates to Thunderbird. </p><p>So in the first instance I would suggest disabling mail scanning in an antivirus product (defender has no mail scanner) and see if you see an improvement. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Yahoo did so you can use yahoos server setup and your ATT email address as user name and get it to work that way. Or Do you use the required mailkey instead of a password as ATT have required for some years now for those that do not use oauth?
