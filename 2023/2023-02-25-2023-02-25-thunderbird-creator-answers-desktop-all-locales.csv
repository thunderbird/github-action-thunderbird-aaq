I am concerned that when the web-based email host closes the account, all that are copied via IMAP will disappear.  So first I imported using POP3, which I understand is like taking a snapshot that will remain after the account is closed.  The webmail client is net@ddress, a product of SilverSky in which the email address is in the format xxxxx@usa.net. 1.  Using POP3, all the email folders' discrete contents except ""Sent"" were dumped/combined in one received email folder called ""Inbox"".  I don't mind that, but can't figure out how to move the ""Sent"" folder's contents which contains all the emails that I generated. 2.  I then imported again with IMAP and unlike POP3, it nicely maintained my whole folder structure.  Clicking on each triggered import of all the emails in the various folders, including ""Sent"".  However, it mirrors whatever goes on in the actual account including deletions.  Due to my concern about everything disappearing when the email account is closed, I'd like to archive everything but can't see how to bulk select large amounts of emails since there are over 10,000 involved.  Thunderbird instructions advise not to archive more than 2,000 emails at a time, so there must be a way to do it in bulk. 3.  How do I import my Contacts?
