And then had to explain about 'something strange with the email software'. The only other thing to note might be that my profile folder is quite bit - nearly 40gb.

It has re-arranged my Local folders, splitting contents randomly into two Local Folders (read and blue labels). I don't seem to have lost anything, but the layout is hard to work with. I've tried to move folders from one local folder to another, but this cannot cope with subfolders. Additionally, when I open 'Trash' deleted Emails are not appearing - instead there is a list of folders that were previously in my Local folder. And for some reason, the new TBird has resurrected all the Emails I had previously deleted, and then deleted from 'Trash', going back for 14 years.  The originals of these are, or maybe were, on a BT server - I am still a BT customer.  How can I recover my previous Inbox Local folder layout without doing any damage please?  Can I safely restore the previous settings before today's update?  Thanks.  </p><p>DAW </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1617572;1617587;1617722;1617767;1617774;1617935;,daw.hush
