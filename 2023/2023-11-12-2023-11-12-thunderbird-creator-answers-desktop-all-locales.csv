I uninstalled the newest version (115) and installed the previous version (102) because of an outgoing mail problem. It gave me a warning that the newer version changed my profiles and it's not compatible so I downloaded the new version again. The import screen doesn't look anything like what it says in the help files. I don't have an option for importing from a previous version.  </p><p>Please rescue me. I run a nonprofit and I have deadlines and meetings next week that I was supposed to make arrangements for and I've been dealing with this for almost a week. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",flwildlife

Now it deletes the message, but the same message is highlighted, and I have to go back to the messages list and click the next message. </p><p>Also, Thunderbird used to make sure the message list showed a few messages below the highlighted message. Now it lets the highlight go to the bottom of the window - so I have to scroll down to see the next message. </p><p>So where I used to have 1 UI operation (click Junk) I now have 3 UI operations (click Junk, scroll down, click next message). </p><p>Are there any options to restore the old behaviour? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dp20130225
