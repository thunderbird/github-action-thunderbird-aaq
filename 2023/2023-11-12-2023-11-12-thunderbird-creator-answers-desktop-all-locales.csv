I uninstalled the newest version (115) and installed the previous version (102) because of an outgoing mail problem. It gave me a warning that the newer version changed my profiles and it's not compatible so I downloaded the new version again. The import screen doesn't look anything like what it says in the help files. I don't have an option for importing from a previous version.  </p><p>Please rescue me.

Now it deletes the message, but the same message is highlighted, and I have to go back to the messages list and click the next message. </p><p>Also, Thunderbird used to make sure the message list showed a few messages below the highlighted message. Now it lets the highlight go to the bottom of the window - so I have to scroll down to see the next message. </p><p>So where I used to have 1 UI operation (click Junk) I now have 3 UI operations (click Junk, scroll down, click next message). </p><p>Are there any options to restore the old behaviour? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",dp20130225

When I open the Thunderbird window, two smaller windows open asking for me to enter the passwords for the two <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> accounts.  I assumed they meant my AT&amp;T passwords but when I entered them they came back as ""failed"".  I then tried the ""master"" password I put in several years ago (which I have never needed to re-enter) and that didn't work either.  I am attaching a photo of what comes up when I open Thunderbird.  You can see the two boxes that want me to enter the passwords but I have no idea what to enter.  If it wasn't my master password or my AT&amp;T passwords for each account, it must have been something I used when I installed Thunderbird ten years ago that somehow got deleted or lost. </p><p>I downloaded another email client to use temporarily until I get my Thunderbird fixed so I can not get my emails, but I hate this new client for a lot of reasons that are irrelevant here.  I hate this new client and I need my Thunderbird back.  Can anyone give me any idea on how to find the right password or to change the password so it will work again? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1617512;,pfw51
1430756,2023-11-11 20:29:25 -0800,2023-11-11 20:29:25 -0800,no longer downloading emails,"<p>Hello.  I've been using Thunderbird now for, oh, I don't even know how many years, a long time, currently version 102.15.1 (64-bit).  But, I have not been able to connect to any servers to send/receive mail since October 31.  It will just hang like it's trying to connect, but nothing happens except for the little bouncing dot that shows up while you're connecting and downloading (don't know how to better describe the dot, but that's what's in the image, bounces left-to-right beside Inbox).  I use it to connect to yahoo, google, comcast, but all of them have failed to connect since Oct. 31, though I am able to connect to them all through the browser.  I've tried disabling vpn and firewalls, individually and together, but doesn't have any effect.  Pulling up task manager, Thunderbird's CPU and memory usage fluctuates a little so it's not like the program itself is frozen but no network connectivity reported for the program.  Any help or ideas to try to get Thunderbird working again would be muchly appreciated.  Thank you in advance&nbsp;:) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ghostinthemachine7331

It seems to grab these from old messages, I think generally when I'm replying to incoming mail - and a couple of times I've sent them without noticing until they've already gone.  And then had to explain about 'something strange with the email software'. The only other thing to note might be that my profile folder is quite bit - nearly 40gb. Is this likely to be a problem relating to this or anything else? Is this a known bug? Any ideas please? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",xgipper
