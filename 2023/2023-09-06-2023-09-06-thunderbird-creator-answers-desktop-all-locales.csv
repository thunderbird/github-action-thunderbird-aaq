I was running 52.9.1 (32 bit) on an old Windows Vista Computer. I moved to a Windows 11 computer and installed Thunderbird 115.2.0 (64 bit). </p><p>Importing did not work but I read the work around of copying the C:\Users\MYNAME\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Folder from the Vista Computer and pasting it into C:\Users\MYNAME\AppData\Roaming\ on the new computer. I also had to delete: cert8.db, key3.db, secmode.db  (all obsolete), pkcs11.txt (did not exist), session.json, xulstore.json. Thunderbird came up with all my email accounts and I thought, all my emails. I thought I saw SENT email but now do not know for sure. I had to put in the passwords and my address books. </p><p>I recently sent an email and noticed that there was no Sent Folder in 4 of the 5 accounts I have with my website provider. None of my old sent emails show in those accounts either. I have two Hotmail accounts set up as POP3 as well. They have both my old Sent emails and the ones I send now. </p><p>All accounts are set to delete after 14 days, so any old emails are from the back up of the old computer. I went into Troubleshooting Information and under Application Basics, I opened the Profile Folder. I go to the MAIL folder and see folders for the different emails.  I see a ‘Local Folder’ and then <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite-1.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite-2.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite-2.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite-3.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite-3.com</a> folders for “my website” emails, and <a href=""http://pop.mywebsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mywebsite.com</a> folder and <a href=""http://pop-mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail.com</a> and <a href=""http://pop-mail-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail-1.com</a> folders.  </p><p>They all have Sent files and Sent.msf files. The Sent files are of reasonable size like 100,000 kbs. The <a href=""http://pop.mywebsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mywebsite.com</a> folder and <a href=""http://pop-mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail.com</a> and <a href=""http://pop-mail-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail-1.com</a> folders all display a Sent folder. The others do not even after I send an email but the sent and sent.msf file show the new date and time for the file, so I think they are updating. </p><p>How do I get my Sent emails to show in Thunderbird?  </p><p>Thank you for suggestions. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1602439;,montreal73

User idiocy not ruled out. </p><p>Very often when I'm composing an e-mail and swap between windows, ctrl-V to paste doesn't work, but instead sets variable width.  (The nearest reference I find online is Ctrl-T to set fixed width.)  Thunderbird seems not to remember when I come back to the window that I'm in the composition pane/message pane/ bit where you type the message. </p><p>It's almost as if it defaults to the formatting bit of the screen.  Except that I've _only_ noticed that arising with pasting; and I do switch between programs for other purposes, so if it were really that, even an idiot user would surely have noticed odd behaviour at other times.  (Never underestimate idiocy.) </p><p>It's annoying that I can't routinely switch between programs and paste *into the text box I'd just been typing in before switching*.  The real problem, though, is that I can click or double-click repeatedly in the message pane of the composition window, moving the cursor between clicks in a hopeful fashion, and still not get the desired result - Thunderbird seems determined that I really want to change formatting and nothing else.  So far, right-clicking to paste does work, once I remember it - but 20-odd years of habit are working against me, as is the fact that sometimes ctrl-V does do what I expect first time, so I'm not retraining my habits very well and can take about 5 steps to achieve a simple copy-paste. </p><p>No similar problems using Word, etc.  I have only recently learned of the wizardry that is ctrl-shift-V, and have never remembered to use it unless reminded by unwanted formatting, so can't swear to its behaviour. </p><p>I have tbkeys lite, and can't claim to understand what I'm doing with it, but I can usually follow simple instructions without excessive sobbing.  I'd happily disable all formatting functions, if that was necessary, since I send only plain text. </p><p>Any help gratefully received. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1602117;1602440;,ferrerslocke

Recently I notice that I can open an email, say in a gmail account, then close it, and when I go to look for it again, it has disappeared from the Inbox. I can (sometimes) find it attached to the bottom of a previous thread from the same correspondent, often from a long while ago. It is very annoying! How do I stop this pls?

Today I started getting a pop-up telling be to log into google. It seems suspicious because the tabs at the bottom for Help, Privacy etc take me to a blank screen. I can log onto my g-mail account through firefox with no problem. I am reluctant to log in through the pop up screen, but in the mean time Thunderbird is not linked to my gmail. Any suggestions? Thanks, Paul </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1602124;,apaulcpa

Not working any more so Googled for advice. Told to delete passwords. Did that. No request to enter password, still not working. Checked all settings, found webmail was working so no ISP problem. Did a new TB install, still not working. At wits end. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",peterr3
