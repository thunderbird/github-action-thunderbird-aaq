I was running 52.9.1 (32 bit) on an old Windows Vista Computer. I moved to a Windows 11 computer and installed Thunderbird 115.2.0 (64 bit). </p><p>Importing did not work but I read the work around of copying the C:\Users\MYNAME\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird Folder from the Vista Computer and pasting it into C:\Users\MYNAME\AppData\Roaming\ on the new computer. I also had to delete: cert8.db, key3.db, secmode.db  (all obsolete), pkcs11.txt (did not exist), session.json, xulstore.json. Thunderbird came up with all my email accounts and I thought, all my emails. I thought I saw SENT email but now do not know for sure. I had to put in the passwords and my address books. </p><p>I recently sent an email and noticed that there was no Sent Folder in 4 of the 5 accounts I have with my website provider. None of my old sent emails show in those accounts either. I have two Hotmail accounts set up as POP3 as well. They have both my old Sent emails and the ones I send now. </p><p>All accounts are set to delete after 14 days, so any old emails are from the back up of the old computer. I went into Troubleshooting Information and under Application Basics, I opened the Profile Folder. I go to the MAIL folder and see folders for the different emails.  I see a ‘Local Folder’ and then <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite-1.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite-2.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite-2.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.mywebsite-3.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mywebsite-3.com</a> folders for “my website” emails, and <a href=""http://pop.mywebsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mywebsite.com</a> folder and <a href=""http://pop-mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail.com</a> and <a href=""http://pop-mail-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail-1.com</a> folders.  </p><p>They all have Sent files and Sent.msf files. The Sent files are of reasonable size like 100,000 kbs. The <a href=""http://pop.mywebsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.mywebsite.com</a> folder and <a href=""http://pop-mail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail.com</a> and <a href=""http://pop-mail-1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop-mail-1.com</a> folders all display a Sent folder. The others do not even after I send an email but the sent and sent.msf file show the new date and time for the file, so I think they are updating. </p><p>How do I get my Sent emails to show in Thunderbird?  </p><p>Thank you for suggestions. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1602439;1602967;,montreal73

User idiocy not ruled out. </p><p>Very often when I'm composing an e-mail and swap between windows, ctrl-V to paste doesn't work, but instead sets variable width.  (The nearest reference I find online is Ctrl-T to set fixed width.)  Thunderbird seems not to remember when I come back to the window that I'm in the composition pane/message pane/ bit where you type the message. </p><p>It's almost as if it defaults to the formatting bit of the screen.  Except that I've _only_ noticed that arising with pasting; and I do switch between programs for other purposes, so if it were really that, even an idiot user would surely have noticed odd behaviour at other times.  (Never underestimate idiocy.) </p><p>It's annoying that I can't routinely switch between programs and paste *into the text box I'd just been typing in before switching*.  The real problem, though, is that I can click or double-click repeatedly in the message pane of the composition window, moving the cursor between clicks in a hopeful fashion, and still not get the desired result - Thunderbird seems determined that I really want to change formatting and nothing else.  So far, right-clicking to paste does work, once I remember it - but 20-odd years of habit are working against me, as is the fact that sometimes ctrl-V does do what I expect first time, so I'm not retraining my habits very well and can take about 5 steps to achieve a simple copy-paste. </p><p>No similar problems using Word, etc.  I have only recently learned of the wizardry that is ctrl-shift-V, and have never remembered to use it unless reminded by unwanted formatting, so can't swear to its behaviour. </p><p>I have tbkeys lite, and can't claim to understand what I'm doing with it, but I can usually follow simple instructions without excessive sobbing.  I'd happily disable all formatting functions, if that was necessary, since I send only plain text. </p><p>Any help gratefully received. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1602117;1602440;1602761;,ferrerslocke

Recently I notice that I can open an email, say in a gmail account, then close it, and when I go to look for it again, it has disappeared from the Inbox. I can (sometimes) find it attached to the bottom of a previous thread from the same correspondent, often from a long while ago. It is very annoying! How do I stop this pls?

Today I started getting a pop-up telling be to log into google. It seems suspicious because the tabs at the bottom for Help, Privacy etc take me to a blank screen. I can log onto my g-mail account through firefox with no problem. I am reluctant to log in through the pop up screen, but in the mean time Thunderbird is not linked to my gmail. Any suggestions?
