The font that continues to appear is a basic courier style.  </p><p>I've saved a pdf of various emails, with the first few being the current view I get and that recipients would see. The second last page is a copy from a previous ""sent"" email with my signature block, and the last page with a ""reply"" ready to go to that 2nd last page where the loss of formatting is very obvious. I would like to upload these but I'm not able to as it is not an 'image"" file. </p><p>Any help to try and work out what has happened and how to fix it would be very much appreciated. </p><p>Cheers. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1602435;1602438;1602841;1604428;1606196;1606455;1606580;1606879;1606881;1607113;1607151;,annesch1

Since the jump in versions was so dramatic, I did a quick search which revealed that an auto update to v115 wouldn't be available from v102 or prior - a manual download and install would be necessary.  However, when I check for the update manually and it shows it's available, clicking the update button begins the download and install process. Is this intended functionality?  I want and need a smooth upgrade/update process which won't result in loss of data or complications with my email. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1602215;,brothermoon

The program locks up, I get the spinning beach ball, and I have to force quit to close it. Letting it sit for an extended time has no impact. </p><p>If I start Thunderbird without an internet connection it behaves normally. Once it goes online and attempts to download email, it locks up.  </p><p>If I start in Troubleshoot Mode it works normally. No problems at all. I don't appear to have any add-ons or extensions running, so I don't understand why this is fixing things. I have been running Troubleshoot Mode exclusively for the past year successfully. </p><p>- I had read a previous post about disabling Thunderbird's access to Contacts in System Preferences, I tried that, no luck. - No luck with changing ldap_2.servers.osx.dirType from 3 to -3 - Oddly if I change the theme from Dark to Light, or Light to Dark, Thunderbird will sometimes launch normally and function for several hours. The problem then returns. </p><p>I'd really like to get this functioning normally again, any help is appreciated. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1602216;1602301;1602379;1602482;,andrewnelles
