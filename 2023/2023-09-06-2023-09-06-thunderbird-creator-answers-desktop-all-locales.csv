Today I started getting a pop-up telling be to log into google. It seems suspicious because the tabs at the bottom for Help, Privacy etc take me to a blank screen. I can log onto my g-mail account through firefox with no problem. I am reluctant to log in through the pop up screen, but in the mean time Thunderbird is not linked to my gmail. Any suggestions? Thanks, Paul </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",apaulcpa

Not working any more so Googled for advice. Told to delete passwords. Did that. No request to enter password, still not working. Checked all settings, found webmail was working so no ISP problem. Did a new TB install, still not working. At wits end. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",peterr3
