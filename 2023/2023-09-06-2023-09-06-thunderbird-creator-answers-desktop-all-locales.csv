Quicktext enables to write and send e-mails that I have prepared in html. Looking shiny with images, labels and preformatted text. Great Addon. Unfortunately not yet on Mac </p><p>I have html-edited emails and Quicktext running flawlessly in Windows.  There is a visual difference between Thunderbird on Windows and on Mac: When I create an e-mail in Windows, the menubar shows the menu items: File; Edit; View; <strong>Insert</strong>; Format; Options; Tools; Help.   On Mac,  the menu-item Insert is not there. Maybe this has something to do with the problem that Thunderbird in Mac does not handle html e-mails? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",casper9

At best, this causes me to sigh deeply. At worst, there may be Bad Language. [Selecting messages in this way should be <em>much</em> stickier than it is, I feel!] </p><p>Is there a helpful configuration option hidden somewhere? I've tried amending layout.css.devPixelsPerPx, thinking maybe a slightly increased text size in the view might help, but it makes no difference. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",parsons.tim
