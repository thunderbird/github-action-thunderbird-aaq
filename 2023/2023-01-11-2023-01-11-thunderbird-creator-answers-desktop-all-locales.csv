So I did a search to find out how to fix this. According to a search of this support site, there were two ways to do this. I tried both - and neither worked. There was no change in text size at all. Control + and Control - also didn't work. But when I click on a message to view it, then Control + and Control - work fine. It's just that the overall Thunderbird display text is too small and I can't seem to change it. Is there some trick that I'm not aware of? </p><p>I'm running Thunderbird 102.6.1. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1558847;1558853;,Don-Peters

I have to use Pop3 due to work and everything is fine.  </p><p>Today I open Thunderbird and it crashes right away. I reinstalled it and moved file over and the only way to get it to open is to replace the profile file in the data folder. Problem is then I lose all my emails and I have some important ones.  </p><p>Is it possible to even just restore all my emails?  </p><p>Thank you.  </p><p>The crash report is below which means nothing to me haha.  </p><p>A11yHandlerRegistered: false Accessibility: Active AccessibilityInProcClient: 0x800 ActualStreamLen: 68 AdapterDeviceID: 0x9a49 AdapterDriverVersion: 27.20.100.9624 AdapterSubsysID: 00461414 AdapterVendorID: 0x8086 Add-ons: en-NZ-new%<a href=""http://40dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org:4"" rel=""nofollow"">40dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org:4</a>,%7B8845E3B3-E8FB-40E2-95E9-EC40294818C4%7D:5.3,mailmerge%<a href=""http://40example.net"" rel=""nofollow"">40example.net</a>:9.6.1,MonterailDark2%<a href=""http://40conema.me"" rel=""nofollow"">40conema.me</a>:3.3,%7B139a120b-c2ea-41d2-bf70-542d9f063dfd%7D:3.6,tbsortfolders%<a href=""http://40xulforum.org"" rel=""nofollow"">40xulforum.org</a>:2.2.6,thunderbird-compact-dark%<a href=""http://40mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">40mozilla.org</a>:1.2,google%<a href=""http://40search.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">40search.mozilla.org</a>:1.0,ddg%<a href=""http://40search.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">40search.mozilla.org</a>:1.0,amazondotcom%<a href=""http://40search.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">40search.mozilla.org</a>:1.1,wikipedia%<a href=""http://40search.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">40search.mozilla.org</a>:1.0,bing%<a href=""http://40search.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">40search.mozilla.org</a>:1.0 AvailablePageFile: 7574077440 AvailablePhysicalMemory: 8180731904 AvailableVirtualMemory: 138522423984128 BackgroundTaskMode: 0 BlockedDllList:  BuildID: 20221219215418 CPUMicrocodeVersion: 0x9a ClassRegistrationInfoParent: {""HKLM"": {}, ""HKCU"": {}} </p><p>CoUnmarshalInterfaceResult: 0x80004005 ContentSandboxCapable: 1 ContentSandboxLevel: 1 ContentSandboxWin32kState: Win32k Lockdown enabled -- default value is true CrashTime: 1673471168 DOMFissionEnabled: 1 DOMIPCEnabled: 1 ExpectedStreamLen: 68 GPUProcessLaunchCount: 1 GPUProcessStatus: Running HeadlessMode: 0 InstallTime: 1673471162 InterfaceRegistrationInfoParent: {""HKLM"": {""InterfaceName"": ""IAccessible"", ""ProxyStub"": {""CLSID"": ""{00020424-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}"", ""ClassName"": ""PSOAInterface"", ""Path"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\oleaut32.dll"", ""LoadedPath"": ""C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\OLEAUT32.dll"", ""ThreadingModel"": ""Both""}, ""TypeLib"": {""ID"": ""{C523F390-9C83-11D3-9094-00104BD0D535}"", ""Version"": ""3.0"", ""Description"": ""Acrobat Access 3.0 Type Library"", ""Flags"": ""0"", ""0"": {""Win32"": {""Path"": ""C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat DC\\Acrobat\\plug_ins\\Accessibility.api"", ""LoadResult"": ""0x00000000""}}}}, ""HKCU"": {}} </p><p>LauncherProcessState: 0 ModuleSignatureInfo: {""Microsoft Corporation"":[""msvcp140.dll"",""VCRUNTIME140.dll""],""Microsoft Windows"":[""linkinfo.dll"",""ondemandconnroutehelper.dll"",""uiautomationcore.dll"",""TaskFlowDataEngine.dll"",""cscapi.dll"",""dbgcore.dll"",""ntshrui.dll"",""webauthn.dll"",""explorerframe.dll"",""dataexchange.dll"",""usp10.dll"",""oleacc.dll"",""directmanipulation.dll"",""Windows.Globalization.dll"",""twinapi.dll"",""srvcli.dll"",""urlmon.dll"",""Windows.UI.dll"",""Windows.Security.Integrity.dll"",""AudioSes.dll"",""wininet.dll"",""OneCoreCommonProxyStub.dll"",""iertutil.dll"",""MMDevAPI.dll"",""Bcp47Langs.dll"",""textinputframework.dll"",""npmproxy.dll"",""nlansp_c.dll"",""winrnr.dll"",""pnrpnsp.dll"",""NapiNSP.dll"",""wscapi.dll"",""wsock32.dll"",""icm32.dll"",""wshbth.dll"",""mscms.dll"",""FWPUCLNT.DLL"",""version.dll"",""winmm.dll"",""rasadhlp.dll"",""OneCoreUAPCommonProxyStub.dll"",""twinapi.appcore.dll"",""dhcpcsvc.dll"",""dhcpcsvc6.DLL"",""avrt.dll"",""directxdatabasehelper.dll"",""winhttp.dll"",""netprofm.dll"",""msvcp110_win.dll"",""policymanager.dll"",""propsys.dll"",""DWrite.dll"",""dcomp.dll"",""wtsapi32.dll"",""apphelp.dll"",""uxtheme.dll"",""dbghelp.dll"",""dxgi.dll"",""dwmapi.dll"",""winnsi.dll"",""DXCore.dll"",""WinTypes.dll"",""windows.storage.dll"",""slc.dll"",""netutils.dll"",""winsta.dll"",""IPHLPAPI.DLL"",""dnsapi.dll"",""kernel.appcore.dll"",""ntmarta.dll"",""sspicli.dll"",""mswsock.dll"",""CRYPTBASE.DLL"",""msasn1.dll"",""bcrypt.dll"",""devobj.dll"",""cfgmgr32.dll"",""sxs.dll"",""profapi.dll"",""wintrust.dll"",""msvcp_win.dll"",""KERNELBASE.dll"",""ucrtbase.dll"",""bcryptPrimitives.dll"",""win32u.dll"",""crypt32.dll"",""gdi32full.dll"",""nsi.dll"",""shlwapi.dll"",""ws2_32.dll"",""SHCore.dll"",""rpcrt4.dll"",""setupapi.dll"",""msctf.dll"",""kernel32.dll"",""imm32.dll"",""sechost.dll"",""combase.dll"",""clbcatq.dll"",""advapi32.dll"",""psapi.dll"",""ole32.dll"",""oleaut32.dll"",""user32.dll"",""gdi32.dll"",""shell32.dll"",""msvcrt.dll"",""ntdll.dll""],""Mozilla Corporation"":[""thunderbird.exe"",""xul.dll"",""rnp.dll"",""nss3.dll"",""freebl3.dll"",""mozglue.dll"",""nssckbi.dll"",""softokn3.dll"",""ia2marshal.dll"",""lgpllibs.dll""]} Notes:  FP(D00-L1000-W00001000-T000) DWrite?
