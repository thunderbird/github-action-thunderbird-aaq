This email ID was created 20 years or so ago, when I didn't know better re having my email ID tied to an ISP.  They have decided to be exceedingly unreasonable in rates and I have switched ISPs.  But now I need to set up a new e-mail ID; one not associated with an ISP. </p><p>I did a search of my Thunderbird email to find all email from the last 25 months (past 2 years plus a one month buffer) and created a Thunderbird folder from that search.  I want to extract the email IDs for all ""correspondents"" from this folder, put it into Excel and filter to remove duplicate correspondents.  Then I will cleanse the list of all ""correspondents"" I do not wish to share my new email ID with and send e-mails to the rest advising those recipients to start using my new email ID. </p><p>I have been unsuccessful in several attempts to extract a list.  I have the Thunderbird folder created from the search.  I can ""Select All"", but this gets me the contents of all emails rather than the displayed metadata (subject, correspondents, date, location).  Note that this folder contains over 5600 entries so I wish to avoid a manual process if at all possible. </p><p>Is there a way I can accomplish want I want?  Any technique can, but doesn't have to, use the folder of emails created from the search. </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dgillesp
