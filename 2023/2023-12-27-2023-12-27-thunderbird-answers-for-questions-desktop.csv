This usually happens during an update, when the antivirus intercepts the update. Something to investigate if you do use such a product, as losing files may well happen again in the future.

Perhaps yours issues a dodgy one.  Or the time on your computer is not correctly set (despite showing the correct time) and the certificate had been replaced and your computer was in the past date/time wise so the valid certificate was deemed to be in the future. </p><p>Those are just a couple of likely guesses,  but anyone using encrypted communications has been using certificates for the last 20+ years.
