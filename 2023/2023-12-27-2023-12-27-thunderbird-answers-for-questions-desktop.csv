This usually happens during an update, when the antivirus intercepts the update. Something to investigate if you do use such a product, as losing files may well happen again in the future. Anyway, on this problem, the addressbook's name is abook.sqlite, and is possibly in an archived profile. You can search for that by clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles', click 'about:profiles, and see if there is more than one profile. If there is, you might browse it to see if your missing file is there. If found, you can copy it from wherever it is back to your profile. For now, just see if you can locate it.

Perhaps yours issues a dodgy one.  Or the time on your computer is not correctly set (despite showing the correct time) and the certificate had been replaced and your computer was in the past date/time wise so the valid certificate was deemed to be in the future. </p><p>Those are just a couple of likely guesses,  but anyone using encrypted communications has been using certificates for the last 20+ years.

But per your suggestion.  My original post addendum(b)&nbsp;:   to clarify: I have not been successful at getting one of my existing GMAIL accounts to load onto a new Windows 11 laptop.   I do have 3 GMAIL accounts.   I have already been successful at putting 2 of those onto Thunderbird and giving GMAIL and Thunderbird permission to work together.   It's this 3rd existing GMAIL that is blocked from moving onto Thunderbird.  This 3rd GMAIL did work well on the previous computer.  And I am positive that all my GMAIL entries are correct on the Mozilla page, as well as the mode data.    Please see my original post. Thanks to all. </p>",nycityk9,false,0,0

I have had success by entering initial account info, but omitting password while TB is setting up account. Once done, Google prompts for it and then all is ok. My belief is that, if Google sees a password, it assumes that is the legit password for an email client -- which it is not, and then the login fails. By having no password, Google senses a new account setup and prompts for the web password and then sets the authorized code in TB. That may not be exactly what happens, but it works for me. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

Thunderbird, or any IMAP, client gets the folder list from the server,  not the other way round.  The client can add folders to the server,  and remove them.  But the server is considered to be the canonical reference. </p><p>You issue now is with your hosting provider,  not Thunderbird and I am guessing not airmail,  even it they originally caused it.  I suggest you contact hostinger and ask them how you access your email as an admin on their web site so you can remove the folders you do not want on the server. </p><p>While asking them.  It would appear their IMAP server laces all folders inder the inbox.  ie inbox.sent etc.  There is an IMAP setting in the server settings &gt; Advanced button on Thunderbird for the server directory.  Setting this can see those folders placed at the same level in Thunderbird as the inbox.  But I have no idea what it would be for your providers IMAP server. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
