This usually happens during an update, when the antivirus intercepts the update. Something to investigate if you do use such a product, as losing files may well happen again in the future. Anyway, on this problem, the addressbook's name is abook.sqlite, and is possibly in an archived profile. You can search for that by clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles', click 'about:profiles, and see if there is more than one profile. If there is, you might browse it to see if your missing file is there. If found, you can copy it from wherever it is back to your profile. For now, just see if you can locate it. Then reply back. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
