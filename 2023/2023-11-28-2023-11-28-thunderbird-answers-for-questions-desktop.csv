I have no idea whether you have a pop mail account pointing to a new empty pop mail account whilst the original is still in the profile - just not being accessed. You are under some notion that it's private and wont discuss the issue. If Thunderbird lost track and then created a new profile, it would not have any data, but it doesn't mean to old profile is missing - but again you think whether Thunderbird has suddenly created a new profile is somehow private data. If old profile lost track of a mail account and recreated a duplicate mail account, it would not contain any data, but I could tell if the data was still stored and advise you on how to get it back. I'm not looking at the data - I'm checking file names and dates they are created. </p><p>You cannot simply backdate to rescue emails when it comes to an imap account because it will auto delete them on start up because data is apparently not on the server.. You have to get them into the 'Local Folders' mail account first and then 'copy' them back onto the server. </p><p>However, I do find this an extreme unique situation. Never, have I come across anyone lose all emails from all mail accounts including Pop. I have seen eg: new pop accounts created so new pop has no mail, but the original pop folder is still in the profile and it's a simple case of repointing back to it. The only thing that can delete a load of files like that is an Anti-Virus product.  </p><p>Bottom line is this: are you going to let me help you to see if you have: A) a new profile, but old profile is still in tact B) using old profile, but new mail accounts got created and old ones are still in tact but not used </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I, at just the very moment of typing this reply, looked at my POP account in Thunderbird and it now appears that they are all strangely back!! What the heck?  </p><p>Then I opened my GMAIL account, and now I am seeing emails dated back to 2021!!  </p><p>This makes absolutely makes no sense to me. I have NOT manipulated the default profile file in any way except to add that .mbox folder to Local Folders through Thunderbird. </p><p>So, it seems, the majority of my problem(s) have been strangely solved?? </p><p>Now I am terrified to open Thunderbird on either of the other two computers. </p><p>Out of curiosity, I notice a lot of .msf files in the default profile on the other two computers. What are they and are they readable? </p>",wrgarrett45,false,0,0
