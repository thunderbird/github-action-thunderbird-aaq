Fyi, I tested sending the form in other non-Thunderbird email addresses and it pushed thru successfully. </p><p>Now here's where things got downhill, in a desparate attempt to find the junk mail, I altered and deleted the SMTP passwords in the Saved Passwords as shown in this article [<a href=""https://www.softaken.com/blog/thunderbird-not-receiving-emails|here"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.softaken.com/blog/thunderbird-not-receiving-emails|her...</a>]. However, after closing/restarting Thunderbird, the browser did not prompt me for any password. My email is still logged on. may have tampered with other areas in the settings that I forgot. I think because of this. I am now receiving this error as shown in the attached image.
