However, there was no attachment. I was about to email him back to tell him that he forgot to attach it when I realized that EVERY single email he has ever sent me in the past was missing its attachment. Even emails from months ago that I already read. I can see the paper clip icon, but when I click on the email itself, the paper clip disappears. If I try to forward an email, it looks like it's there as an attachment, but appears to be misformed or corrupted. Please help! My business partner is my graphic designer and has sent me hundreds and hundreds of emails with graphic design projects that I need access to. I have tested sending myself different attachments and they all go through. And am able to see attachments from clients as well - except for one that was not working. Any thoughts? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1624208;,leppdesign.marketing

My understanding is that everything in my ""Inbox"" is automatically synced with files stored on the IMAP server, so that deleting them on one deletes them on both.  Correct? </p><p>I have a large amount of e-mails that I ""moved"" to ""Local Folders"" and subfolders under that.

Will that work as I intend?  To keep things simple, I will probably do that in batches, periodically, for all e-mails in the ""inbox"" that are older than some amount of time in the past. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1624204;,steve.long4
