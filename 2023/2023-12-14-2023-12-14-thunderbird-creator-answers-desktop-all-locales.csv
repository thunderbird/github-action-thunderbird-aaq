I'm very upset.,<p>NONE of your online help tells me accurately how to cancel my subscription to Thunderbird.  I haven't used it for nearly a year now and I'm still paying a monthly fee.

My old laptop self-destructed, so I need to configure a new one.  The profile I use in on a central server, so I need to have the laptop find it. </p><p>What always worked for me in the past was to edit profile.ini, in ...Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird which currently looks like:  </p><p>[InstallD78BF5DD33499EC2] Default=Profiles/ibbgujfs.default-release Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/p3uryki2.default Default=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/ibbgujfs.default-release </p><p>[Profile2] Name=Central-Store IsRelative=0 Path=//NEW-HUB/F/TbirdDad </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>Central-store is the one I need to use.  But when I go to Troubleshooting / about-profiles it does not show up. </p><p>And just to be clear, it is useless for me (or anyone) to destroy, move or replicate the profile data without losing coherent access from more than one device. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",JonathanWexler

I use vertical panes - left hand pane is all the inbox, sent, archives folders etc. Under Archives is my @gmail address only, and under this I have created a large number of subfolders for various subjects both work and personal related. Its worked great for years - since Thunderbird 60 versions. </p><p>When I upgrade to the 15 version (SuperNova) it keeps splitting all my archived subfolders. It leave approx half of them in the same Archive/@gmail address and then further down the pane it creates a new @gmail address folder and puts the rest of my subfolders in there. </p><p>I know it doesn't sound too drastic, and as far as I can tell nothing is missing, but it now makes me have to scroll and toggle open the two @gmail address folders to find, sort and use my subfolders and its very inconvenient especially as it goes off the bottom of the screen. </p><p>Whats going on and is there a cure for this please? I like the new look of Supernova but I hate using it to the point that I uninstalled it and reinstalled 102 and copied across my baked up profile folder to restore it. I did this for 15.1 and today for 15.2 (I hoped they had fixed it but Not). </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",symetec
