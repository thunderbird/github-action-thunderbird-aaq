I use vertical panes - left hand pane is all the inbox, sent, archives folders etc. Under Archives is my @gmail address only, and under this I have created a large number of subfolders for various subjects both work and personal related. Its worked great for years - since Thunderbird 60 versions. </p><p>When I upgrade to the 15 version (SuperNova) it keeps splitting all my archived subfolders. It leave approx half of them in the same Archive/@gmail address and then further down the pane it creates a new @gmail address folder and puts the rest of my subfolders in there. </p><p>I know it doesn't sound too drastic, and as far as I can tell nothing is missing, but it now makes me have to scroll and toggle open the two @gmail address folders to find, sort and use my subfolders and its very inconvenient especially as it goes off the bottom of the screen. </p><p>Whats going on and is there a cure for this please? I like the new look of Supernova but I hate using it to the point that I uninstalled it and reinstalled 102 and copied across my baked up profile folder to restore it. I did this for 15.1 and today for 15.2 (I hoped they had fixed it but Not). </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",symetec

And even more important a suggestion of how to resolve this? </p> <hr>  edit   ----------- <p>After posting the question I looked at several other posts which presented similar type issues. One suggested going to the account in webmail, finding the oldest message, delete that message, and the problem resolves.
