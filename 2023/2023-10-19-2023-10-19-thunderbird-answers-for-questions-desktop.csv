Is there a reason why you are not using the 'Message Pane&nbsp;? </p><p>It sounds like you are double clicking on an email in the list and it is opening the email in a new tab each time. After reading it you would then need to close that tab by clicking on the 'x' which is in that email tab. If, after reading the email, you always close the opened email tab then the only tab left open is the 'Mail' tab so you see Folder Pane and email list automatically. </p><p>But regardless, the tab that contains all your Folders and email list is always the tab on the far left. It is the first tab. You can use 'Alt+1' keys to auto jump to the Mail tab. You can use 'Ctrl+tab' keys to move through selected tabs. </p><p><br> However, I do understand what you are talking about.

In other words words use the 'Inbox' as the folder for new unsorted incoming emails that need reading etc but then move to specific folders to make it easy to locate emails.  Eg: Folders such as 'Family', 'Friends', 'Hobby group', 'Online Orders' etc </p><p>When it comes to folders like 'Sent' using the archive option is handy, although perhaps it might be more useful to have the current year emails still in the original 'Sent' folder. </p> <ul><li> Access the Archive subfolder year 2023 </li><li> click on first email in that folder to get focus on the email list </li><li> Use 'Ctrl+A' to select all emails in that folder </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails and choose 'Move to' and select 'Sent' folder on the account. </li></ul> <p>Why do I say it's better to not store all received emails no matter what age in the 'Inbox' or store all sent emails in just the 'Sent' folder?  The emails are not stored as separate files in a folder. The emails are stored in a single text file called 'Inbox'. This means it is one single document and each received email is just a bunch of text appended to the bottom of that text file. It means you  have all your eggs in one basket. It is the most risky method to use. If the file gets too large it can become very difficult to open because it is just a single text file. If you do not compact on a regular basis then that text file can be very messy containing old residual traces of deleted emails and it's even larger than it needs to be. It's more prone to getting corrupted. If Anti-Virus decides somethingis wrong with that file then you may lose everything because Anti-Virus does not understand the file contains more than one email. </p><p>So please seriously consider creating new folders and organising emails that are in Inbox to get put into folders. This means all your emails are spread across several files instread of just one. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

There are many files which get updated/ written to upon exit. </p><p>Including eg: preferences, address book, calendar, session data </p><p>In your 'profile name' folder is 'calendar-data' folder containing 'local.sqlite' - the main database file and also  'local.sqlite-wal' which is a 'Write Ahead Log' (wal) file. It's a type of cache file used to speed up process of what you viewing and upon exit it synchs with the local.sqlite to keep it up to date. So it may contain more recent data. 'local.sqlite-shm' is a shared memory file to faciliate the process. </p><p>So actual database is 'local.sqlite', but when running Thunderbird and using calendar it first checks to see if there is anything in the *-wal file because it may contains changes as yet not applied to the database. When you exit Thunderbird all the current data is written to the database file to update it before fully closing down. </p><p>Hence if you exit Thunderbird you will find the 'calendar-data' folder does not have any *-wal nor any *-shm files. They get recreated when you start up Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

Vytvořil jsem nový profil, importoval do něj přes ""Nástroje -&gt; Import"" účty a nastavení, kontakty a e-mailové zprávy (kalendář nepoužívám). Situace byla v podstatě podobná, odskoky při přepínání složek se projevovaly také. Tak jsem ten profil smazal. Nyní jsem zaarchivoval nebo promazal pár největších složek aby mi v nich zbylo jenom max. 100 zpráv. Vytvořil jsem znova nový profil a naimportoval tam znova účty a nastavení, kontakty a e-mailové zprávy (zkrácené). Teď se už problém neprojevil. Ale uvidím, jak se to bude chovat, když bude zpráv přibývat. Pokud se znovu problém objeví, pravděpodobně otočím řazení zpráv podle datumu na descending (od nejnovějších) - tam to fungovalo dobře i v původní variantě - a dál se s tím nebudu zabývat.

And there is a folder menu you can manage and other features. I agree that, depending on one's favorites, it isn't perfect for everyone, but with a few adjustments, it looks almost exactly like 102.

So all that information is not irrelevant.  Just an FYI,  the issue was to do with how variables were defined in the C++ language and had nothing really to do with 32 or 64 bit versions.  Although the issue did limit Linux and Mac to 2Gb at the time. </p><p>The can not write mailbox problem as you define it is mostly the result of anti virus products locking files in the profile folder while they scan them in their typical pedestrian manner.  It is for this reason this forum is full of recommendations to exclude an on access scanning from the Thunderbird profile folder.   </p><p>However the real issue is file contention,  something Thunderbird simply can not handle,  having grown up in a world where your files were available immediately and exclusively.  So while I tend to reach for the antivirus card as the problem usually surfaces post update,  anything that causes file contention can cause issues.  So streaming backups,  the profile being stored on a ""cloud synced"" location (something we are seeing more of),  the profile not being stored locally on the system hard disk (while local network drives are supposed to work,  they can be problematical and other things like NAS, and USB drives can also have built in contention issues. </p><p>Again just an FYI.  I have an inbox on local folders of 7.4Gb containing almost 175,000 emails.  I also have a GMail account connected as IMAP  which has a 6.5Gb inbox with some 225,000 messages in it.  While I do see ""not responding"" issues for which I have no solution (or even real cause)  your issues will most likely be something external to Thunderbird,  but that could include spam/Scam tools injected into Thunderbird by antivirus products that have not received the message their tools are not welcome in the running program. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My unified inbox has 4 different inboxes from different email addresses merged into one. When I reply to an email, the reply must be sent from one of those 4 different addresses, but for some reason, thunderbird does not always use the address that the received email was sent to as the default FROM address for the reply like most other email clients do. When you have a linked inbox in outlook or apple mail, this behavior is the default - those clients always use the TO address of the email you received as the FROM address of the email you are replying with. The TO and FROM addresses are never the same on any one email - not sure how you came to that conclusion from what I wrote. </p>",hirscj20,false,0,0
