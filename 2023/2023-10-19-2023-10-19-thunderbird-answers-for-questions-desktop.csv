There are many files which get updated/ written to upon exit. </p><p>Including eg: preferences, address book, calendar, session data </p><p>In your 'profile name' folder is 'calendar-data' folder containing 'local.sqlite' - the main database file and also  'local.sqlite-wal' which is a 'Write Ahead Log' (wal) file. It's a type of cache file used to speed up process of what you viewing and upon exit it synchs with the local.sqlite to keep it up to date. So it may contain more recent data. 'local.sqlite-shm' is a shared memory file to faciliate the process. </p><p>So actual database is 'local.sqlite', but when running Thunderbird and using calendar it first checks to see if there is anything in the *-wal file because it may contains changes as yet not applied to the database. When you exit Thunderbird all the current data is written to the database file to update it before fully closing down. </p><p>Hence if you exit Thunderbird you will find the 'calendar-data' folder does not have any *-wal nor any *-shm files. They get recreated when you start up Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

In other words words use the 'Inbox' as the folder for new unsorted incoming emails that need reading etc but then move to specific folders to make it easy to locate emails.  Eg: Folders such as 'Family', 'Friends', 'Hobby group', 'Online Orders' etc </p><p>When it comes to folders like 'Sent' using the archive option is handy, although perhaps it might be more useful to have the current year emails still in the original 'Sent' folder. </p> <ul><li> Access the Archive subfolder year 2023 </li><li> click on first email in that folder to get focus on the email list </li><li> Use 'Ctrl+A' to select all emails in that folder </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails and choose 'Move to' and select 'Sent' folder on the account. </li></ul> <p>Why do I say it's better to not store all received emails no matter what age in the 'Inbox' or store all sent emails in just the 'Sent' folder?  The emails are not stored as separate files in a folder. The emails are stored in a single text file called 'Inbox'. This means it is one single document and each received email is just a bunch of text appended to the bottom of that text file. It means you  have all your eggs in one basket. It is the most risky method to use. If the file gets too large it can become very difficult to open because it is just a single text file. If you do not compact on a regular basis then that text file can be very messy containing old residual traces of deleted emails and it's even larger than it needs to be. It's more prone to getting corrupted. If Anti-Virus decides somethingis wrong with that file then you may lose everything because Anti-Virus does not understand the file contains more than one email. </p><p>So please seriously consider creating new folders and organising emails that are in Inbox to get put into folders. This means all your emails are spread across several files instread of just one. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
