Se provo a cliccare su annulla mi dice che il messaggio è stato inviato, ma non è stata salvata una copia: cliccando su riprova rimane solo il messaggio inviato senza che accada nulla (altro screenshot - ne ho sovrapposti due). Prima lo faceva ogni tanto, in questi giorni invece accade con tutti i messaggi. Inoltre, ogni tanto mi dice che il collegamento con il server è fuori tempo massimo, ma generalmente uso il telefono come hotspot e potrebbe essere questo il motivo? Grazie per l'aiuto Andrea p.s. considerate che non sono un gran esperto, quindi risposte semplici per favore&nbsp;:-) </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,it,1574951;1574955;,a.castiglione

The PC still exists and was originally running Windows 8.  I would have migrated the email from Outlook Express, and I do recall this being successful. I have not accessed the email on the machine for about 9 years or more. Unfortunately, it is not simply a case of launching Thunderbird because the machine has since been upgraded to Windows 8.1.  I have checked the disk and have found that the Windows installation program was nice enough to save the Thunderbird profiles in a backup directory. I believe the version of Thunderbird would have been 24.0.1. I still have the installation file (Thunderbird Setup 24.0.1.exe) but Windows 8.1 tells me it's corrupt so I can no longer install this version. Also, I fully expect the structure of the data files has changed since those days so I'm not sure I will be able to just install any version of Thunderbird, copy the profile directories, launch TB, and be successful in accessing the emails. Would someone be kind enough to put me on the right path here? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1574982;1745170;,SumoBot
