I still cannot copy or drag from Thunderbird directly to WLM. In case it provides more information the version of the add-on is 14.0.0.  There are less options in the menu of IET NG than previously and the ""Import mbox files"" option is greyed out.  (I have attached approx screenshot of this).  I cannot find a means of reverting to previous version.  Nor can I find a means of making the ""Import mbox files"" appear. I have another laptop which has the same setup with Thunderbird and Windows Live Mail but with different email accounts. This has Thunderbird 102.15.1 and Import Export Tools NG version 12.0.3 and this is working in the same way it previously did. I can copy emails directly from Thunderbird to WLM 2012. Unfortunately this doesn't help as it is different email accounts involved.  I attach screenshot of options available in the IET NG tool on this latter laptop which continues to work ok. </p><p>I would really appreciated some help in sorting this out please </p>",joycembrett,false,0,0

If you start Tbird on old computer, does it immediately request a password, possibly requesting a primary password?  OR, dou get request for password when you attempt to read mail? We can work through this, but it may take a number of messages over several days, depending on what volunteers are available. First, I'm trying to confirm exactly what your situation is.
