I still cannot copy or drag from Thunderbird directly to WLM. In case it provides more information the version of the add-on is 14.0.0.  There are less options in the menu of IET NG than previously and the ""Import mbox files"" option is greyed out.  (I have attached approx screenshot of this).  I cannot find a means of reverting to previous version.  Nor can I find a means of making the ""Import mbox files"" appear. I have another laptop which has the same setup with Thunderbird and Windows Live Mail but with different email accounts. This has Thunderbird 102.15.1 and Import Export Tools NG version 12.0.3 and this is working in the same way it previously did. I can copy emails directly from Thunderbird to WLM 2012. Unfortunately this doesn't help as it is different email accounts involved.

Kinda went like this:  Creating a profile from the existing one caused that ""Made by newer version"" error. The existing one was the one 115 touched. I went back to my Friday night backup that was made minutes before 115 blew in.  That created a new profile but when TB opened, my folders were there but there were many INBOX-1 's and it didn't have any passwords. I looked at the size of the new profile and it was 10.1 GB.  The one from the back up was 16.1 GB so the whole thing didn't get rebuilt. I went back to Profile Manager and just selected default which was actually the one from backup. TB started and everything was back (I think, still checking).  Of course I was using 115 for a day or so before hating it.  So things that I did during that time might be lost.  Also my first reverting to 102 worked and I used it for a few days before stupidly permitting 115 again.  So changes during that period may be lost also. </p><p>Now I have to remember to reject any new updates.  Maybe there is a way in TB to set that. </p><p>To summarize:  I had started Profile Manager before but always stopped because I didn't understand that I could build a new profile from an existing one. I tried that because of your info but built the new one from the 115 profile.  That didn't work.  Luckily I had a nearly current backup of the profile.  I could have just replaced it in Profiles folder and run the manager.  I am sure I did just replacing before a few times and it failed.  Maybe because I didn't run the Profile Manager?????  </p><p>BTW, if your solution didn't work and I couldn't find a solution I was seriously considering dumping TB because of 115.  If I couldn't find a new client I planned just use web based mail.  Web based mail has come a long way since Microsoft abandoned Outlook Express and forced me to TB. And I was thinking of dumping FireFox also just to get Mozilla out of my life.  The DuckDuckGo browser seems to be a viable alternative. </p>",petejc,false,0,0

To confirm this, use Profile Manager to set up the profile. You can press windows key and 'r' key and enter thunderbird.exe -p  and then select 'create profile' and then click next and then enter a name (e.g., myprofile), and then click the browse button to locate and select the profile. That ensures that TB is looking at the desired profile. If the profile is corrupt, I am not the one to know how to make it right. If the accounts are IMAP, I would suggest starting over at some point, or by copying message files if POP and reconstructing. If you still have the profile as it worked in 115, that is another option. 115 does look different, but with a few setting changes, it is similar to 102. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I think that's a configuration parameter but it's been 30+ years since I had any in-depth knowledge of the working of Imap.  The behavior that I'd like back is to ignore any servers where I unchecked the boxes that would cause T-bird to attempt to download messages.  I suspect that they are not attempting to download but are attempting to contact the server for some reason.  Before apparently if they didn't need to download anything, they didn't try to communicate with the server.  That's my guess anyway 'cause I didn't get those pesky messages every time I checked for new messages.  See the image attachment of my original post for the pesky messages.  By the way, while your suggestion of just simply moving the messages to Local Folders seems doable, Some of these accounts have multiple sub folders and if T-bird has a way to do a bulk move of folders, I haven't found it.

The problems I am having are due to a disastrous update of Thunderbird that was automatically uploaded to my Linux computer by Mozilla.  The degree of difficulty with doing anything on this update is mind-boggling. </p><p>I have attached two photos that I took with my phone because the screenshot apps will not stay open while I open the part of the Thunderbird screen that I am having trouble with. The first photo is the beginning of the Tools dropdown.  Unfortunately, my hand slipped and I did not get the ""Tools"" header.  I did get the ""Tools"" header in the second shot.  There is no ""Account Settings"" on this menu list. The only place I can find Account Settings is on the page you get when you have selected a mail account name, i.e., bdj@dj<a href=""http://-group.org"" rel=""nofollow"">-group.org</a> (as opposed to choosing Inbox where you get the email list). </p><p>Lord knows, *I* know how difficult this is, I've been living with it ever since it exploded on my computer. </p><p>My hope has been to remove all but three email accounts from Thunderbird so that with the limited scrolling this misbegotten update will allow me - I'll be able to reach my Local Folders - which I can't reach now.  I've already added the lesser used email accounts to another Linux mail program.  Why don't I switch completely to that new mail program.  Because it doesn't have the features of Thunderbird, it doesn't take a calendar.ics file.  It's a poor substitute for a well operating Thunderbird. </p><p>What this needs is for Mozilla to fix the update they sent me.  Every morning when I open my computer, the first thing I see is a pop-up screen, ""Thunderbird has crashed.  Do you want to open it.  Underneath the message is a box to provide comments.  I provided comments for days and got nothing. </p><p>I'm sorry for all this.  But David, I'm not stupid or crazy.

My guess is the rest of the account settings are below the signature box.  But my scroll doesn't work past the signature box.  I don't think this is something we can fix.  This is something that Mozilla has to fix.  Tell me what you think. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

I've attached a combined screenshot - it's actually three screenshots joined in Libre Draw because the Thunderbird screen extends beyond the limits of my screen and I can't see the whole screen.  As you look at it, you can see that ""Delete Account"" shows nowhere.  To be honest,  the real problem is the state of Thunderbird itself.  I'm trying to delete a couple of accounts which I've placed in another Email Program so that, hopefully, I can get to things I can't get to while I have six email accounts. </p><p>Any help you can give me will be gratefully appreciated. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0
