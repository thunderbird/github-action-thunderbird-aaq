The problems I am having are due to a disastrous update of Thunderbird that was automatically uploaded to my Linux computer by Mozilla.  The degree of difficulty with doing anything on this update is mind-boggling. </p><p>I have attached two photos that I took with my phone because the screenshot apps will not stay open while I open the part of the Thunderbird screen that I am having trouble with. The first photo is the beginning of the Tools dropdown.  Unfortunately, my hand slipped and I did not get the ""Tools"" header.  I did get the ""Tools"" header in the second shot.  There is no ""Account Settings"" on this menu list. The only place I can find Account Settings is on the page you get when you have selected a mail account name, i.e., bdj@dj<a href=""http://-group.org"" rel=""nofollow"">-group.org</a> (as opposed to choosing Inbox where you get the email list). </p><p>Lord knows, *I* know how difficult this is, I've been living with it ever since it exploded on my computer. </p><p>My hope has been to remove all but three email accounts from Thunderbird so that with the limited scrolling this misbegotten update will allow me - I'll be able to reach my Local Folders - which I can't reach now.  I've already added the lesser used email accounts to another Linux mail program.  Why don't I switch completely to that new mail program.  Because it doesn't have the features of Thunderbird, it doesn't take a calendar.ics file.  It's a poor substitute for a well operating Thunderbird. </p><p>What this needs is for Mozilla to fix the update they sent me.  Every morning when I open my computer, the first thing I see is a pop-up screen, ""Thunderbird has crashed.  Do you want to open it.  Underneath the message is a box to provide comments.  I provided comments for days and got nothing. </p><p>I'm sorry for all this.  But David, I'm not stupid or crazy.  The things you've pointed to - over the many messages we exchanged - simply aren't where you expect them to be.  This is a totally messed up piece of software. </p><p>I don't know if there's any more you can do for me, unless you can reach someone at Mozilla to do something about this software update. </p><p>Thanks for everything.

I think that's a configuration parameter but it's been 30+ years since I had any in-depth knowledge of the working of Imap.  The behavior that I'd like back is to ignore any servers where I unchecked the boxes that would cause T-bird to attempt to download messages.  I suspect that they are not attempting to download but are attempting to contact the server for some reason.  Before apparently if they didn't need to download anything, they didn't try to communicate with the server.  That's my guess anyway 'cause I didn't get those pesky messages every time I checked for new messages.  See the image attachment of my original post for the pesky messages.  By the way, while your suggestion of just simply moving the messages to Local Folders seems doable, Some of these accounts have multiple sub folders and if T-bird has a way to do a bulk move of folders, I haven't found it.

That ensures that TB is looking at the desired profile. If the profile is corrupt, I am not the one to know how to make it right. If the accounts are IMAP, I would suggest starting over at some point, or by copying message files if POP and reconstructing.

Kinda went like this:  Creating a profile from the existing one caused that ""Made by newer version"" error. The existing one was the one 115 touched. I went back to my Friday night backup that was made minutes before 115 blew in.  That created a new profile but when TB opened, my folders were there but there were many INBOX-1 's and it didn't have any passwords. I looked at the size of the new profile and it was 10.1 GB.  The one from the back up was 16.1 GB so the whole thing didn't get rebuilt. I went back to Profile Manager and just selected default which was actually the one from backup. TB started and everything was back (I think, still checking).  Of course I was using 115 for a day or so before hating it.  So things that I did during that time might be lost.  Also my first reverting to 102 worked and I used it for a few days before stupidly permitting 115 again.  So changes during that period may be lost also. </p><p>Now I have to remember to reject any new updates.  Maybe there is a way in TB to set that. </p><p>To summarize:  I had started Profile Manager before but always stopped because I didn't understand that I could build a new profile from an existing one. I tried that because of your info but built the new one from the 115 profile.  That didn't work.  Luckily I had a nearly current backup of the profile.  I could have just replaced it in Profiles folder and run the manager.  I am sure I did just replacing before a few times and it failed.  Maybe because I didn't run the Profile Manager?????  </p><p>BTW, if your solution didn't work and I couldn't find a solution I was seriously considering dumping TB because of 115.  If I couldn't find a new client I planned just use web based mail.  Web based mail has come a long way since Microsoft abandoned Outlook Express and forced me to TB.

I just made the changes according to the new code requirement and it's worked for me.  I encourage you to just take this a step at a time.  SFHowes has been the moderator who has helped me every time, and their directions do work. Here are some things to check, that I have adapted from an ancient support board for TB, that were helpful to me. </p><p>1.   It is userChrome.css and not userchrome.css. The C in chrome MUST be capitalized. </p><p>2.  Make sure you are in your actual profile folder. You can do this by using Help -&gt; Troubleshooting Information (in Thunderbird). In the tab that opens, scroll down to Profile/Open Folder button and click it. You should get a Windows Explorer window that opens to your profile folder. Make sure that you put the userChrome.css file inside the chrome folder in your profile folder.  [Follow the directions in SFHowes's post above about creating a new chrome folder and how to create the .css file correctly.]   </p><p>3.  To expand on the last setting in SFHowes's post, first I copy the post: &lt;&lt;&lt;Double-click toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true in Settings/General/Config. editor, restart TB.&gt;&gt;&gt; In TB, go to Settings/General and scroll down all the way to the bottom where there is a button for Config.editor. Click button.  Type ""toolkit.legacy"" in the search box, which makes the correct file appear (or choose the correct one if more than one appears)-- if it says false, click the buttons on the far right to toggle to true, if it already says true you don't need to do anything. NOW, close TB and the lines should be in place when you reopen.   </p><p>4.  Where SFHowes's code for the .css says ""blue"" you can put in a different color, such as red.  I use grey, which softens the lines in  a good way for me. </p><p>Hope this helps some. </p><p>--Victoria </p>",Victoria-nola,false,0,0
