Since you changed email providers, I suggest you start over, creating an account with new provider. To salvage that sbd folder, you can try this:  - exit thunderbird - locate your local folders folder in the profile. That is at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\&lt;yourprofilename&gt;\Mail\Local Folders - copy the sbd folder there and restart thunderbird. the folder may now be visible. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.    -&gt; Repeat the above for every account.   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

At the same time, the correct header does usually appear after a delay of sometimes several seconds -- so something in the code is still working on getting that header after the email has been presented.

However, that does not work for me.   Over the years I have started to get numerous newsletters of various kinds, ads from vendors, and political solicitations (if you give to any candidate using their online system, you start getting solicitations from many other candidates you never heard of).  When I start in the morning, or come back after a few hours, it is normal for me to have 50-100 emails waiting, most of which are those I noted.  Since it is hard to get spam filters to work reliably, I have developed a process where I can scan through my emails at high speed:  delete the political ones right away, scan newsletters in a few seconds to see if I want to read any articles, and generally dispense with all non critical emails in few minutes while still noting and absorbing anything that interests me.  This has worked well for me.  However, if I have to wait even an extra second or so for the full email to show, or have to deal with which email will delete and make corrections, it throws that process completely off -- dramatically reducing my productivity.  That is why this particular issue is important for me.  It may not be as critical for most TB users.  Again, I appreciate that the TB team has made the effort to modernize the code base and provide new features.   That is very important for the future of the product.
