Prior to that it used a custom deprecated Mozilla layout tool (XUL). </p><p>But seriously who is reading your images when you send them?  When you are asked for headers,  they are text.  Sending the image probably sees the email stripped of the image before it is even delivered.  Many corporate ""notification"" systems simple do not support image or in some cases even HTML as the header is plain text. </p><p>BTW the header is the text displayed when you display the message source (ctrl+U) before the body of the email is shown.  Not the rather diagnostically useless information shown in the message display. </p><p>i checked the xfinity web site and they are asking for full text headers,  not an image. <a href=""https://internetsecurity.xfinity.com/help/report-abuse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://internetsecurity.xfinity.com/help/report-abuse</a>  For spam they are asking the original email be send to them as an attachment.

I do have data in the original SBD file I just dont know how to get it back into Thunderbird. Using a third party program I have managed to save it as a PST file but can only open this in Outlook. Can i import this to Thunderbird? thanks again. </p>,stuartmyers36,false,0,0

Since you changed email providers, I suggest you start over, creating an account with new provider. To salvage that sbd folder, you can try this:  - exit thunderbird - locate your local folders folder in the profile. That is at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\&lt;yourprofilename&gt;\Mail\Local Folders - copy the sbd folder there and restart thunderbird. the folder may now be visible. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Each file in that directory represents an e-mail sub directory ie.

Ebből arra következtettem, hogy fizetség nélkül nem használhatom a programot. Az üzenetemre válaszoltál és akkor jöttek be az e-mailek. Szívesen támogatom a Thunderbirdet, de utalni csak bankszámláról tudok. Remélem a jövőben nem lesz probléma.
