I do have data in the original SBD file I just dont know how to get it back into Thunderbird. Using a third party program I have managed to save it as a PST file but can only open this in Outlook. Can i import this to Thunderbird? thanks again. </p>,stuartmyers36,false,0,0

Since you changed email providers, I suggest you start over, creating an account with new provider. To salvage that sbd folder, you can try this:  - exit thunderbird - locate your local folders folder in the profile. That is at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\&lt;yourprofilename&gt;\Mail\Local Folders - copy the sbd folder there and restart thunderbird. the folder may now be visible. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I searched for  what is an SBD. file and this is what I found </p><pre>'.sbd is not a file. It is a directory where your downloaded email messages are stored in files. Each file in that directory represents an e-mail sub directory ie. Inbox, Sent or Drafts ... etc. </pre> <p>Each e-mail account you configure in Thunderbird will have its own .sbd directory.' </p><p>I tried Importing from this folder but I was unable to do anything. thanks for your reply. </p>",stuartmyers36,false,0,0

If so, the update possibly 'forgot' where the profile is. click help&gt;(more)troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile' and click 'about:profile' and see if there is more than one profile listed. The inactive profile may be the one you want. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
