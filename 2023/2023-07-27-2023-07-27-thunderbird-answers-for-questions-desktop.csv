I've been told this decision will not be reversed. What I posted here at least addresses fixing it, and at the bottom of my reply is a step to set to unthreading as default on first installing Thunderbird.  </p><p><br> This is the official (to my knowledge) documentation. Well worth the read <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird</a>   </p><p>Here is my own documentation on threading, duplicating the above, but it may help: You need to highlight each folder and click View&gt;sort by&gt;unthreaded. If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.    -&gt; Repeat the above for every account.   ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

I do have data in the original SBD file I just dont know how to get it back into Thunderbird. Using a third party program I have managed to save it as a PST file but can only open this in Outlook.

Since you changed email providers, I suggest you start over, creating an account with new provider. To salvage that sbd folder, you can try this:  - exit thunderbird - locate your local folders folder in the profile. That is at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\&lt;yourprofilename&gt;\Mail\Local Folders - copy the sbd folder there and restart thunderbird. the folder may now be visible. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
