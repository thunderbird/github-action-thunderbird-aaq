Out of some thirty e-mails there are perhaps only six different subject lines, so I thought they'd be easier to view threaded, but I can't get them to group up like threads normally do. I have set the 'View &gt; Sort by' to Date, Descending and Threaded, and 'View &gt; Threads' to 'All'. That is normally sufficient. All that happens when I turn threading on is that the column of messages in the folder moves to the right (and back again if I switch it off). </p><p>I'd assumed that threading was always by subject line, but are there other criteria involved? All these messages are from a forum (notifications of a reply), so the 'From' address is the same in every case (a no response address at the forum domain). The 'Reply-to' address is different, as it's effectively a link to the topic in the forum. The 'To' address is always my own.

Any suggestions? _______________ Sunday 24 April And now this addition about 2 days later: I have just noticed another occurrence of folders being 'ghost' copied to another location.  This time (probably during a short session of archiving a few messages), out of the first 9 (alphabetically sorted) sub-folders in folder 'A-Mail - Personal', folders 1 through 5, plus folder 9 - missing out 6, 7 and 8 - have been copied (accurately as it happens) into folder 'B- Mail - Other'.  If I can't solve this soon, my faith in Thunderbird may begin to waiver? </p><p>Mondat 24 April (update): An unexplained factor not menioned in my previous obsevations is that in one - but not all folders (having since been re-sorted into Date order - I saw that several (maybe 10) of the messages files, which were certainly sent on varying (including some consecutive) dates, now had the SAME date applied to them. </p><p>And today, following a detailed pruning session in (only) my 'Sent' Folder - during which I also moved 3 of the messages to a particular folder within Local Folders, I checked the destination folder for reassurance, only to find it now also contained a completely intact random folder from within Local Folders (containing 16 sub-folders).    It had been unaccountably MOVED (note: not copied this time) from its parent folder further down the tree.  I moved it back to its original place before closing. This proved successful.

Since the regular updates in the last 2 months or so, many or all of the emails that are marked as ""read"" in the inbox of my Local Folders disappear, without my deleting or moving them. This often happens in the time it takes to click to another folder then click back in to that inbox. Sometimes I can still find those messages via search, but they aren't visible in the folder - and they aren't findable at all if I restart Thunderbird. I'm not using that email account on any other platform, so it's not a question of my deleting them online/on my phone, at all. Any suggestions? Many thanks, Jodie </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1576844;1576956;,martire
