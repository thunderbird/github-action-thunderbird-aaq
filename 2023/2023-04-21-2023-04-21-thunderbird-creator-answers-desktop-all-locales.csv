In order to contnue using Thunderbird as my email client, I had to reconfigure Thunderbird for OAuth2 (Modern Authentication).  The process required establishment of a new account, and removal of the old account which pointed to iiNet.  In the process, all my pre-existing mail folders have disappeared. I have tried importing the backup prepared before the change, which restored my Address Book but not the mail folders. I have another copy of Thunderbird on a laptop, still configured to used iiNet and with all those lost email folders intact.

Out of some thirty e-mails there are perhaps only six different subject lines, so I thought they'd be easier to view threaded, but I can't get them to group up like threads normally do. I have set the 'View &gt; Sort by' to Date, Descending and Threaded, and 'View &gt; Threads' to 'All'. That is normally sufficient. All that happens when I turn threading on is that the column of messages in the folder moves to the right (and back again if I switch it off). </p><p>I'd assumed that threading was always by subject line, but are there other criteria involved? All these messages are from a forum (notifications of a reply), so the 'From' address is the same in every case (a no response address at the forum domain). The 'Reply-to' address is different, as it's effectively a link to the topic in the forum. The 'To' address is always my own.

It had been unaccountably MOVED (note: not copied this time) from its parent folder further down the tree.  I moved it back to its original place before closing. This proved successful.

Event and Task reminders popup OK after windows startup, but not after a second user account logs on to the PC, or Windows has run for a while. However the taskbar always indicates a reminder. It would appear that the popup is active, but the dimensions are 0 x 0 pixels. To workaround, I use Alt-Enter and Size to drag the popup window larger so that the text becomes visible. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",RNathan

EXACT OPPOSITE RESULT!! </p><p>A couple hours later I got a popup message warning me that I was low on disk space.  So, ok, I looked and sure enough my 500 GB drive seemed to be nearly full.

I will be typing an email message and then I will see the circle and then a message that Thunderbird is not responding.  Sometimes when I get access again the email message window will have lost focus.  While trying to execute spell checking it again is unresponsive.  I thought perhaps that the calendar was causing the issue but closing that tab did nothing to relieve the slowness.  I have four processes of Thunderbird running and I am running Windows 11 Pro.  I have the current version of Thunderbird installed.  I have using Thunderbird for many years now and the constant unresponsiveness is extremely irritating.  This also happens when Thunderbird is preparing to display reminders.  I appreciate your assistance.  Thank you. </p>,fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1576815;,philips79
