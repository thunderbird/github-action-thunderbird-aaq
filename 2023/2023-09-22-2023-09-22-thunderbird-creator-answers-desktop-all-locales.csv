Until I updated to the latest version. My Operating system is Windows 10. The problem: It was impossible to set the size of the letters in a satisfying way. Only massive letters in writing emails resulted in a readable format on the receiving end. I tried one of the suggestions I found on the internet. Something like ""set the same format initially and then again in Latin and the bottom choice of letter types"". It did not work for me. So I decided to quit Thunderbird and start working with Gmail. Which is okay, but you have to be online and you have to change websites if you use more than one email address. I don't expect you to have a solution, but I want to inform you that I decided to quit after a years long good experience. Thank you for all your work and effort, Daniel van Schooneveld </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dvanschooneveld44

It wasn't useful to reinstall or moving mail from the inbox or rebuild the index, so now I've decided to purge it all and uninstalled it, then <strong>I need to know exactly all the remaining folder and file to delete, as well as registry keys involved by any modification</strong>. Other info: Win 10 pro 22H2 completely updated, no particular AV, rather firewall on the router plus Defender on the PC (intel 7 9gen + 16GB ram). I have 4 gmail accounts, 1 Italian free mail and 1 registered mail, that works very well from the relevant web sites. Just for the sake of curiosity, what kind of problem it could be? Most important of all: does such problem can repeat starting from scratch? I don't want to face again such kind of mess.

My operating system is Windows 10 Pro on which I just verified that I have all of its updates. </p><p>Supernova has been great until now.  Beginning suddenly yesterday and without any setting changes on my part, the Calendar would no longer send out invitations to any other email addresses.  The overall behavior is extremely odd. </p><p>First, upon entering individual addresses, notice how not only does that address now repeat itself (the two Gmail addresses which are my personal account there) but also that blank lines are inserted below.  It never did that before yesterday. </p><p>Then, upon sending the invitation, shown in my Sent folder is a very odd ""Accepted"" message instead of the usual copy of the invitation.  Because of what happens next, let me again stress that this shows up almost immediately in my Sent folder. </p><p>A few moments later, I receive an ""Accepted"" message in my Inbox that is an exact duplicate of what previously showed up in Sent.  However, I never took such action nor did the invitation ever show up in either my Gmail or, in the case of the second screenshot, my Zoho account which I added to be certain that this wasn't just some weirdness being caused by Google. </p><p>I will be glad to provide any other information that might help diagnose this issue. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",kohoso

I use Earthlink as my email server.  I should have realized what happened when I suddenly had over 2500 sets of duplicate emails. </p><p>It appears that my Thunderbird is now set up for POP, although it had been IMAP for years.  This is the second (or third) time his has happened in the last 6 months.  </p><p>Three questions: 1) Can I change back to IMAP from POP without losing more 2) Is there a way to restore any of these emails to the server? 3) How can I prevent this in the future; once I update and restart, it is too late to prevent something like this as the damage is done. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1605343;1605355;,msprinker

I didn't download or install a new version. I just closed and reopened it and it updated. When I tried to roll back to the new version, I lost all of my emails and addresses! I literally had tons of business emails and contacts and now they are gone. Thunderbird is treating this like a brand new install and I am having to set up all of my accounts all over again! Is there some way to get all of my stuff back? Or has the new install/rollback somehow written over all of my previous data? </p>",download-and-install_1;tb115;tb115profile;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1605356;1605358;1605361;,doncapps
