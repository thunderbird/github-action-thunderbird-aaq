I checked on the webmail (BT) and they have gone. The account is set up as IMAP - as is another account on the same server, which seems OK. BT won't engage with me on this as they ""don't support third party apps"" I assume that 3 years worth of important client history is gone for ever? Can anyone suggest what I did wrong, or is this a software failure? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",grayfor

I didn't download or install a new version. I just closed and reopened it and it updated. When I tried to roll back to the new version, I lost all of my emails and addresses! I literally had tons of business emails and contacts and now they are gone. Thunderbird is treating this like a brand new install and I am having to set up all of my accounts all over again! Is there some way to get all of my stuff back? Or has the new install/rollback somehow written over all of my previous data? </p>",download-and-install_1;tb115;tb115profile;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1605356;1605358;1605361;,doncapps
