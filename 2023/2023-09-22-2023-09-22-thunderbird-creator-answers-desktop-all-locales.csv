Recently, without any TB upgrade, the number of email folders presented has spontaneously reduced further. Logging in to <a href=""http://iCloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">iCloud.com</a> email online reveals both the original folders and the extra ones I have had to create via TB to be able to save messages, so communication from TB back to <a href=""http://iCloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">iCloud.com</a> is clearly working, but the full list of folders in my iCloud account is not being reflected back to TB. Can anyone help me with this? I didn't have any problem in this way using MS Outlook as an email client; only in TB. Furthermore, this problem has not occurred with any of my other MS or Gmail domain email accounts. I wonder if this is a protocol or port discrepancy of some kind? If so, it's really not apparent.

I checked the password; TBird tells me it is what I thought it is; I can use it to log in to my MailSP's WWW Interface and send messages (through Port 25). Port 587 and STARTTLS are also correct; a colleague also with an account managed to send me a mail using same server, port, STARTTLS and his password. </p><p>So the chance that this is a TBird configuration error seems to me high.
