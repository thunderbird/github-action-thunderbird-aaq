I checked on the webmail (BT) and they have gone. The account is set up as IMAP - as is another account on the same server, which seems OK. BT won't engage with me on this as they ""don't support third party apps"" I assume that 3 years worth of important client history is gone for ever? Can anyone suggest what I did wrong, or is this a software failure? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",grayfor
