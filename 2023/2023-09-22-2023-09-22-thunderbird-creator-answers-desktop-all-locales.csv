I have two email accounts which I regularly use, on different server-pairs. On one, SMTP and IMAP is fine. On the other, a commercial provider, IMAP is fine but I get a pop-up window ""Send message error &lt;NL&gt; Sending of the message failed"" without any hint as to what failed.  </p><p>SMTP Server settings are correctly listed by TBird: Server-DNS (checked many times; it is unique to the MX domain on which there are three accounts, of the form &lt;MX-name with hyphens instead of dots&gt;.&lt;ISP-name with hyphens instead of dots&gt;.de ), Port 587, STARTTLS, ""normal password"" authentication. I checked the password; TBird tells me it is what I thought it is; I can use it to log in to my MailSP's WWW Interface and send messages (through Port 25). Port 587 and STARTTLS are also correct; a colleague also with an account managed to send me a mail using same server, port, STARTTLS and his password. </p><p>So the chance that this is a TBird configuration error seems to me high. But no hint is given and I can't find anything that is wrong. Besides, it all worked the day before, before 115.2.2 was installed - when the problem arose, and continued with 115.2.3; these settings were taken over from the previous version on the update. The very same SW TBird 115.2.3 functions with the other Email server-pair without any problem. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",ladkin1
