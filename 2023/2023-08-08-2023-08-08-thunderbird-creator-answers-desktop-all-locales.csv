I can copy/paste or drag the contact from the addressbook list but all I get is the contact's name and eMail address.

I can then attach that vcf file to an outgoing eMail. That's four steps. </p><p>There was an old addon (no longer compatible since 50 integer releases ago) that allegedly included this function. </p><p>Seems like someone was never assigned to this function at the Thunderbird mothership.
