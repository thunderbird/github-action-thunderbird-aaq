My recourse is to change the font manually back to Helvetica before I begin typing below the image. </p><p>One question prompted by David's reply, just above:  Does the fact that Thunderbird offers a font selection for ""Helvetica, Arial"" (rather than simply Helvetica) mean that Windows computers without true Helvetica installed will know to substitute Arial as a second choice?  I don't know what code in the email calls out fonts and whether more than a single choice is permitted.

This allows the recipients to use their own default font for reading, not yours. And most users prefer that and, in my opinion, is a special feature of Thunderbird. What the sender sees is the font set in settings&gt;General. On the other question, the font declaration to set the order of preference for the recipient, as you stated. Alternate fonts are used if the PC doesn't use that font (which is a decision made by the OS). Helvetica is (to my knowledge) not installed on Windows PC, so I do not recommend specifying it. When inserting images, it breaks the HTML code, forcing an end tag, and that is why you see a font change. If this is important to you, I highly recommend the ThunderHTMLedit addon; I use it regularly to view and tweak HTML. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
