It states an update available, or i put it off and later click Help&gt;About Thunderbird to click the update button, and it downloads it, then I click ""Restart to update thunderbird"", and it closes, and a very brief updating window box is present (states Thunderbird is installing the update, or something to that effect, see attached screencap), with the update bar not moving at all, so within about a second, that update box closes and T'Bird starts, and has not updated, still on (as of right now), version 102.9.1.   </p><p>If I then repeat the above, clicking Help&gt;About Thunderbird, it again presents the button to click ""Restart to update Thunderbird"", so I click it, and same as above, keeps failing to update.  There is no error message.  I've repeated this process multiple times and it won't update to 102.10 that it had already downloaded. </p><p>I also tried toggling the setting ""Use a background service to install updates"", to turned on (was turned off by default?), but every time I restart T'Bird, it's off, uncheckmarked again.  Attached is that update box with the bar that never moves, just appears for a second then T'Bird is running without having updated. </p><p>The extreme slowness updating running T'Bird from the flash drive has been ongoing for a long time but this failing to update at all is something new for the last 2-3 versions at most (AFAICT). </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1575267;1575288;1575651;1575657;,habanero.dave

I then modified the Profile.ini files in each login to point to the shared folder and shared file within it. I have had to rebuild the computer, and cannot get this to work again. It works from the login which I set up first, but when I try to start it from the other login it complains that Thunderbird is running, even though I closed it before swapping users. I have tried rebooting the computer and going straight to the second login with the same result. Is there a standard way of doing this?
