Make sure ""Layout"" is selected.        Ensure that ""Message Pane"" is enabled. If it's disabled, you won't see the recipients. </pre> <pre>   Toggle Conversation View:        If you have conversation view enabled, try toggling it off and then on again to see if it brings back the recipient information. </pre> <pre>   Check Add-ons Compatibility:        Sometimes, certain add-ons might not be fully compatible with the updated version of Thunderbird. Disable any add-ons you have installed and check if the issue persists. </pre> <pre>   Safe Mode:        Try starting Thunderbird in Safe Mode, which disables all extensions and themes. This can help determine if an add-on is causing the issue.        To start in Safe Mode, exit Thunderbird, then hold down the Shift key while starting the application. </pre> <pre>   Update Add-ons:        If you find that an add-on is causing the issue, check if there's an updated version of that add-on available that's compatible with your current Thunderbird version. </pre> <pre>   Check for Known Issues:        Visit the Thunderbird community forums or support pages to see if other users have reported similar issues after the upgrade. There might be workarounds or solutions suggested by the community. </pre> <pre>   Profile Corruption:        In some cases, profile corruption can cause unexpected behavior. You might want to consider creating a new profile and seeing if the issue persists there. </pre> <pre>   Reinstall or Rollback:        If all else fails, you might consider uninstalling Thunderbird completely, removing any remaining files, and then reinstalling the version that was working (or trying a different version). </pre> <pre>   Report the Issue:        If you've tried the above steps and the issue persists, it might be a bug introduced with the new version. Consider reporting the issue to the Thunderbird development team or checking their bug tracker for any related reports. </pre>",smera,false,0,0

Follow instruction in order to regain access to your webmail account and then reset the password. </p><p>Once you know the password is good because you can get access to the webmail account, then that is the password you use when creating/setting up the mail account (unless you are access a server that requires a secure key - I'll advise further on that when you supply info). </p><p>If you already have a mail account, then you can update the stored password with the correct password.
