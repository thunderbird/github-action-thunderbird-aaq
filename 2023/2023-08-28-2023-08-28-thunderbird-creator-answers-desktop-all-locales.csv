I have an old TB profile where such an access is possible because the TB account was created before new Google OAuth requirements. Yes, and that old profile uses OAuth as log in method. But it is no more possible within a new TB profile. Some times Google says that such a log in is forbidden. Some times it presents a blank, useless response page. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rosivaldo.fa

They both forward to the same private email address. I retrieve all my mail in Thunderbird for this private address/domain, so in that way I can handle mail for my private email domain as well as the 2 business-related domains using one mailbox in Thunderbird. This has worked wonderful for years. </p><p>Problem is, since a few weeks, only the mails for 1 of the 2 business domains is arriving at Thunderbird correctly. I have already checked with my provider, and they have confirmed that the 2 forwards for those domains are identical, and should work as I expect them. When I look in the webmail for both domains, I can see test messages arriving there. So the webmail works, even for the problematic domain. I have not changed anything related to the mail settings in Thunderbird since more than a year. I am using the most up to date version of Thunderbird (on Windows 11). </p><p>I checked for Thunderbird logs, and the only log I could find is a debug.log, and that is empty. I also disabled all Thunderbird filter rules, just to be sure that they weren't the culprit, but still the messages do not arrive. I also checked the junk folder of Thunderbird, and they are not there. </p><p>How can I find out why none of the mails for 1 business domain are not arriving in Thunderbird? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",bjorn25

I'm using an IMAP server with no local copies of email on the client that's running Thunderbird. The email's body opened OK. I tried to open the PDF attachment and just saw a few garbage characters.

Same problem occurs on Linux and Windows( 10 and 11) installs of Thunderbird 102.14.0 (64 bit). The incoming email itself is NOT corrupted: I was able to use Thunderbird to save the whole email to local disk as a .eml file and then open that saved copy in Thunderbird and access the PDF attachment. The problem is not with the IMAP server: I copied the email to a postfix server, to gmail, to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> and to a Microsoft server, all with the same issue.  This problem happens only when the incoming email has very large attachments - smaller attachments of the same type can be saved or opened with no problem. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",subelman
