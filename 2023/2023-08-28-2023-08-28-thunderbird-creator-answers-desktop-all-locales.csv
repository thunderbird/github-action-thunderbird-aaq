Thunderbird is set to download messages automatically. When I opened it up yesterday, 8/27/2023, it said ""downloading 1 of 50"". I waited and it just stopped, no error message and no mail came in. Repeated attempts resulted in the same outcome. I reset TB, reset the PC with the same result. I turned the computer off overnight hoping for a better tomorrow and the same thing is happening now, except that it says ""downloading 1 of 193"". The last e-mail messages appear to have been downloaded on 8/26/2023, in the afternoon. No settings were changed prior to this problem popping up. I don't know whether TB did some sort of automatic update and I'm not sure how I would discover that anyway. An outgoing test message from this account to another account did arrive, although slowly. I'm running TB 102.14.0 (32-bit) on an up-to-date Windows 10. Does this problem sound familiar, and is there a simple fix? The mail is on the server and on my phone as well. I use POP and have not had any problems receiving mail on both my iPhone and my PC. Thanks. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",CWTL

Trying here. </p><p>Using TB 115.0.1 (64-bit) on a Mac with High Sierra (MacOS 10.13.6). </p><p>Googles security requirements no longer accept e.g. sync with default calendar in my version of the OS. So I use TB:s calendar. </p><p>However, one thing bugs me a lot and I have tried all settings to remedy this. </p><p>Each time I launch TB, the calendar is completely blank and it starta downloading from Google. I have several different calendars in my Google account, each with quite a few events. It takes several minutes to complete the download and obviously, I need to be online to be able to see coming events. </p><p>My question: </p><p>Is there any way to make TB cache all events and simply check with Google calendar and update when needed? Exactly as with my emails. Or is it just me who haven't figured it out? </p><p>Cheers! Dan </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dan279

They both forward to the same private email address. I retrieve all my mail in Thunderbird for this private address/domain, so in that way I can handle mail for my private email domain as well as the 2 business-related domains using one mailbox in Thunderbird. This has worked wonderful for years. </p><p>Problem is, since a few weeks, only the mails for 1 of the 2 business domains is arriving at Thunderbird correctly. I have already checked with my provider, and they have confirmed that the 2 forwards for those domains are identical, and should work as I expect them. When I look in the webmail for both domains, I can see test messages arriving there. So the webmail works, even for the problematic domain. I have not changed anything related to the mail settings in Thunderbird since more than a year. I am using the most up to date version of Thunderbird (on Windows 11). </p><p>I checked for Thunderbird logs, and the only log I could find is a debug.log, and that is empty. I also disabled all Thunderbird filter rules, just to be sure that they weren't the culprit, but still the messages do not arrive. I also checked the junk folder of Thunderbird, and they are not there. </p><p>How can I find out why none of the mails for 1 business domain are not arriving in Thunderbird? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",bjorn25

I'm using an IMAP server with no local copies of email on the client that's running Thunderbird. The email's body opened OK. I tried to open the PDF attachment and just saw a few garbage characters.  I tried to save the PDF attachment to local disk and resulting PDF file is binary containing exactly 27 bytes! Same problem occurs on Linux and Windows( 10 and 11) installs of Thunderbird 102.14.0 (64 bit). The incoming email itself is NOT corrupted: I was able to use Thunderbird to save the whole email to local disk as a .eml file and then open that saved copy in Thunderbird and access the PDF attachment. The problem is not with the IMAP server: I copied the email to a postfix server, to gmail, to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> and to a Microsoft server, all with the same issue.  This problem happens only when the incoming email has very large attachments - smaller attachments of the same type can be saved or opened with no problem. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",subelman
