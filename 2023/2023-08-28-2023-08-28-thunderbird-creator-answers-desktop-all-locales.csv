Trying here. </p><p>Using TB 115.0.1 (64-bit) on a Mac with High Sierra (MacOS 10.13.6). </p><p>Googles security requirements no longer accept e.g. sync with default calendar in my version of the OS. So I use TB:s calendar. </p><p>However, one thing bugs me a lot and I have tried all settings to remedy this. </p><p>Each time I launch TB, the calendar is completely blank and it starta downloading from Google. I have several different calendars in my Google account, each with quite a few events. It takes several minutes to complete the download and obviously, I need to be online to be able to see coming events. </p><p>My question: </p><p>Is there any way to make TB cache all events and simply check with Google calendar and update when needed? Exactly as with my emails. Or is it just me who haven't figured it out? </p><p>Cheers! Dan </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",dan279
