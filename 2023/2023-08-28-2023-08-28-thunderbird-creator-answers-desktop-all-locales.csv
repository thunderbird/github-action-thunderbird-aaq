I'm using an IMAP server with no local copies of email on the client that's running Thunderbird. The email's body opened OK. I tried to open the PDF attachment and just saw a few garbage characters.  I tried to save the PDF attachment to local disk and resulting PDF file is binary containing exactly 27 bytes! Same problem occurs on Linux and Windows( 10 and 11) installs of Thunderbird 102.14.0 (64 bit). The incoming email itself is NOT corrupted: I was able to use Thunderbird to save the whole email to local disk as a .eml file and then open that saved copy in Thunderbird and access the PDF attachment. The problem is not with the IMAP server: I copied the email to a postfix server, to gmail, to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> and to a Microsoft server, all with the same issue.  This problem happens only when the incoming email has very large attachments - smaller attachments of the same type can be saved or opened with no problem. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",subelman
