I have contacted my email service provider and they are unable to assist/ fix the problem - we have been changing the settings in the SMTP outgoing server and sending test emails each time, but this hasn't worked. I have added and removed Mozilla through my virus protection (AVG &amp; Windows security) and sent emails, but this hasn't helped either. </p><p>For the record, I have an ""oldish"" computer that is however running Windows 10. I can only think of one thing and maybe my computer doesn't support this version of Supernova, but I am receiving emails as per normal?   </p><p>I would appreciate it if someone could assist with this matter asap. </p><p>Kind Regards </p><p>Phil Muraca </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1610824;,philip.muraca

While playing around with the customization features I clicked on the kebab menu at the top of the folder panel to add the total message count for each folder. This display matches my previous Thunderbird versions. Then I added the folder size and decided I didn't need or want that. But now can't turn it off because the kebab menu is gone and I can't figure out how to get it back. Any suggestions? </p>,customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",knmlv04

But it has now been several days and the problem doesn't seem to be fixing itself anymore. I rely on these Calendars heavily for my job so I'm a bit anxious about them not working. </p><p>I have been googling and researching for two days now trying to find people with similar problems and so hopefully similar solutions but I have not had any luck getting to the root of the problem. A lot of the info out there is for when Lightning was still an extension or when syncing CalDav stuff. OR, whatever solution that was offered was done using linux commands and I'm on Windows.  I've tried to attach screenshots of all the relevant info I can think of without just copy/pasting everything that appears in the console debugger thing.  </p><p>If there's anything I can provide that might help with fixing this just let me know and I'll post it.  </p><p>Thank you for reading this and anytime you spend looking into my issue. I appreciate it a ton.  </p><p>Thank you, </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",grantblack000
