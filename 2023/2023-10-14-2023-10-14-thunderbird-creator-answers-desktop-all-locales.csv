I am using it with the ""Vertical view"" layout with three panes: 1) Folder pane (left; approx. 10%); 2) Message list pane (middle; approx. 40%); 3) Individual message pane (right; approx. 50%). I am using a laptop in a normal laptop mode with a Full HD screen when not in my office (meetings, home, traveling, etc.). However, in my office, the laptop is docked with a single Quad HD (2560x1440) monitor (laptop is closed). Since I am moving a lot around, I have to switch between the laptop screen (Full HD) and external monitor (Quad HD) many times a day. </p><p>So far, this has been no problem with Thunderbird. The panes got automatically adjusted to optimize display area use, so that the above ratios (10/40/50%) remained mostly unchanged. So the pane widths used up the same percentage of the screen width irrespective whether I was on the laptop screen or the large monitor. </p><p>When switching to Thunderbird 115 (Supernova), this has changed substantially. It seems Supernova apparently considers the width of the left (Folders) and right (Individual message) panes to be fixed and resizes only the middle (Message list) pane. Therefore, if I set the approx. 10/40/50% in Full HD and then switch to Quad HD, then I end up with a middle (Message list) pane much larger then needed, with a lot of empty space (see attachments). If I then readjust the pane sizes to the approx. 10/40/50% in Quad HD and then switch to Full HD (since I have to go to a meeting with my laptop, for example), then again only the middle (Message list) pane is resized (shrunk) and I end up with a message list with a lot of information missing/not visible. </p><p>The above issue forces me to constantly readjust the pane widths, which is quite frustrating. This has never happened in the previous versions of Thunderbird. </p><p>Any ideas about how to solve this issue would be much appreciated. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,hu,"",mocsai
