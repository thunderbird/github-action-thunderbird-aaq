I disliked their default email client intensely, and therefore installed whichever version of Thunderbird was available from their repository. Unfortunately I do not know how to determine the version of either POP!_OS or Thunderbird, so I can't be more precise. My apologies for that. (Where *is* Pop!_OS/Thunderbird's version of Mac's ""About ..."" menu item anyway?!)  </p><p>For those unfamiliar with POP!_OS, it's a Ubuntu derivative, and its desktop management is built on gnome 3. Its version numbers also match Ubuntu. Most of the time, instructions for Ubuntu found on the web work for Pop!_OS, at least if they are relatively recent.  </p><p>I'm being plagued by pop-ups from Thunderbird notifying me of each new email received. I want them gone. Googling for instructions has given me recipes involving menu items that don't appear anywhere in the version of Thunderbird I have. In one case (only) instructions said to look somewhere else on linux; perhaps you export drastically different user interfaces on each operating system?  </p><p>On the other hand, I don't get a count of unread messages associated with Thunderbird's icon in the Pop!_OS dock, and I do want that. (Is that even possible on linux?) </p><p>So two questions in one posting: 1) How can I get rid of pop-up notifications of new email messages? 2) (How) can I get a count of unread emails associated with the dock icon? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance, including RTFM links. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1564133;1564196;,DinoNerd
