However, the increased scam protection by gmail has led to all my mail addressed to gmail a/c fails the authentication process. Hence, I need to buy a new domain, not for web hosting, just email, that I own the full rights to setup and manage, ie, beyond the constraints built into dot name. GoDaddy can provide a suitable domain, but also insist I'll also have to include MS 365 Email Essentials. I suspect the latter uses MS Exchange but I'm not an IT guru. So am looking for the tools to maybe DIY setting up an email based on name@newdomain.au with the appropriate authentication and email forwarding to my ISP. Is Thunderbird that tool, or are their better alternatives? All help and advice is welcome. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",longinthetooth

When I want to scroll up or down, I do it manually. </p><p>Thunderbird's new behavior upon upgrading to the latest client:  When clicking on an email to read, the list of emails automatically centers on the email clicked.  I'm having to constantly scroll back up or down to reset the view to how I had it. </p><p>The new behavior is extremely irritating and causes a lot of extra scrolling - if I wanted it to show that view, I'd center it there myself!  Is there a way to turn off the autofocusing?  I looked in the configuration settings but everything I tried didn't seem to have an effect on that behavior. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",destinywoods

A technician checked my setup as provided by <a href=""http://iiNet.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">iiNet.net.au</a> Test messages were successfully sent to my personal email account and I also sent one to the technician's Gmail account. Messages to external providers e.g. Strata Management, Air Conditioning companies and even to the Technician's business are failing. The technician has advised that as 'some' messages are sending OK my setup is correct. I have attached a copy of the error messages that I am receiving when trying to send emails and also when I am closing the failed message. I am not technically minded at all so would appreciate very basic instructions on how to fix this issue.

1434361,2023-12-18 20:02:51 -0800,2023-12-18 20:02:51 -0800,Problems setting up Thunderbird account,"<p>I downloaded and installed Thunderbird on my Windows 10 computer.  I had it working for a while but wanted to change my settings to where I didn't have to enter my password each time I wanted to check email.  I couldn't figure out how to do it, so I removed the account I originally set up intending to recreate it and selecting remember my password.  However, now when I try to set up my account again I get a message that says the incoming server already exists and I can't proceed any further with the set up.  I also tried uninstalling Thunderbird and reinstalling, but that didn't resolve the problem either.  If anyone could provide any suggestions to resolve my problem, I would be most appreciative.  Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",connjp
