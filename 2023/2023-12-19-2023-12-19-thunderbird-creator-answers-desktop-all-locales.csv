However, the increased scam protection by gmail has led to all my mail addressed to gmail a/c fails the authentication process. Hence, I need to buy a new domain, not for web hosting, just email, that I own the full rights to setup and manage, ie, beyond the constraints built into dot name. GoDaddy can provide a suitable domain, but also insist I'll also have to include MS 365 Email Essentials. I suspect the latter uses MS Exchange but I'm not an IT guru. So am looking for the tools to maybe DIY setting up an email based on name@newdomain.au with the appropriate authentication and email forwarding to my ISP. Is Thunderbird that tool, or are their better alternatives? All help and advice is welcome. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1625190;1625199;1625202;,longinthetooth

I use POP to get my emails, with no backup on the mailserver of my provider.  I attach a screenshot of one archived folder.  The shown folder should contain 1070 emails. </p><p>Do you have any ideas what might have happened, and what I could do to get the proper dates back in place, and be sure no emails have been lost?

I then installed another router (ASUS RT-AC87U) that gave the same problem. Also installed a timer that switches on half an hour before booting both computers so that we do not have to switch it off manually and we are sure the router already had a reset. Another issue on both computers: when some times we cannot receive e-mails and we reset router or computers, some e-mails that had been deleted reappear in the Inbox as if we had not opened them......

This contradicted the settings that no email ever should be deleted. I also cannot access the archive where the emails were moved to. It does not show up. There are plenty of files in ""AppData\Roaming\..........\INBOX.sbd\Archive.sdb"", so I suspect that's where the emails were moved to, but this archive does not show up anywhere in Thunderbird. How can I stop Thunderbird deleting the emails, and how do I restore the emails from the archive to the IMAP server? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",aow6656

I have 3 gmail accounts, all of which I used to be able to access through Tbird.  Nice and easy!  I use POP, not IMAP. Very soon after loading one of the 115 versions, I lost access to one of my accounts.  That was some weeks ago now.  I tried deleting the account from Tbird and then re-adding it.  I got an error message from Google.  I have tried it MANY times with the same result, and so can no longer access it via Tbird.  I have needed to access direct online via Chrome and Gmail and copy to one of my other gmail accounts which Tbird DOES read OK. Now a second account is experiencing the same problem.  I have not deleted it from Tbird, as I don't want the same fiasco again.  BUT, every few minutes, as Tbird checks my emails, I get a login window which I complete – which produces the same Google error message.  This means that Tbird no longer accesses THAT email account, either. I now have only one Gmail account that Tbird can access, and I am concerned that that one may also fail. I SHOULD PREFER TO REVERT TO THE TBIRD VERSION WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED THE FIRST 'SUPERNOVA'.  As far as I can see, Supernova is a disaster.  There are other minor frustrations with it, which were not there before. I have a LOT of information stored in many folders and sub-folders, which previous Tbird versions handled well.  Supernova is still OK with them, but I want to be sure to preserve all that information if I need to delete Tbird in order to revert to an earlier (and therefore reliable!) version. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1625421;,blackberrylane.co.uk
