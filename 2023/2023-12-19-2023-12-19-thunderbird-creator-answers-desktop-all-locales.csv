However, the increased scam protection by gmail has led to all my mail addressed to gmail a/c fails the authentication process. Hence, I need to buy a new domain, not for web hosting, just email, that I own the full rights to setup and manage, ie, beyond the constraints built into dot name. GoDaddy can provide a suitable domain, but also insist I'll also have to include MS 365 Email Essentials. I suspect the latter uses MS Exchange but I'm not an IT guru. So am looking for the tools to maybe DIY setting up an email based on name@newdomain.au with the appropriate authentication and email forwarding to my ISP. Is Thunderbird that tool, or are their better alternatives? All help and advice is welcome. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1625190;1625199;1625202;,longinthetooth

Microsoft help people when I asked them about this a year or two ago said just tag it for the anti virus software to ignore it. I was uneasy about that advice.  I have solved it in the past by installing separate anti virus packages which seem to ignore it, but I would rather not deal with all that if possible.  The offending file seems to be in a sent email folder in an imap folder so it comes up each time I do a new install on a windows machine.   </p><p>Could someone point me in the right direction?

Today I noticed, that in some of them quite a number of emails have lost their dates, sender, recipient, subject, and are now showing a time from today only.  This was initially the time when I started thunderbird this afternoon, but when I delete the "".thunderbird"" folder (Linux Mint) and use a backed up folder, it will show the time of when I then restarted Thunderbird.  I tried several backups going back to early this year- all the same result.  Some emails seem to be missing entirely in one of pop- IN folders starting from 11/12/23 till today.  I use POP to get my emails, with no backup on the mailserver of my provider.  I attach a screenshot of one archived folder.  The shown folder should contain 1070 emails. </p><p>Do you have any ideas what might have happened, and what I could do to get the proper dates back in place, and be sure no emails have been lost?
