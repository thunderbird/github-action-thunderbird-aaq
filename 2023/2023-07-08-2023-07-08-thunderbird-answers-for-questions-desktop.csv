Da quel che leggo in giro, Mail salva i messaggi in file singoli, questo fa si che i backup incrementali possano essere limitati ai nuovi messaggi. Thunderbird invece usa un formato monolitico chiamato mbox in cui ogni cartella di Thunderbird corrisponde ad un singolo file su disco. La nuova posta vine salvata in coda ai file già esistenti che quindi risulteranno modificati e verranno salvati nuovamente in ogni backup. </p><p>Soluzioni? 1) Una possibile soluzione è quella di raccogliere i messaggi più vecchi in singole cartelle. Queste non venendo modificate ogni volta, dovrebbero funzionare bene anche in un backup incrementale. 2) Esiste anche la possibilità di impostare Thunderbird per salvare i messaggi in file singoli come spiegato qui  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/maildir-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/maildir-thunderbird</a> <strong>Ma è una funzione sperimentale, incompleta e con numerosi bug non risolti per cui ti sconsiglio di usarla</strong> </p>",@next,false,1,0

They provide a very poor imitation of the yahoo service under contract with Yahoo.  This ""deal"" comes with the obvious issue that ATT have no idea even how or if it works. </p><p>About the only thing that becomes clear as soon as you search for ATT email in the past 10 years is that they have this proprietary ""secure key"" thing that no one else on the planet has, and it is a password. </p><p>Not an app password.  Everyone has those. Not Oauth2.0 authorization which basically the entire world is migrating to. Not two factor authentication, again very common. No a special password that they generate that they and only they call a ""secure mail key""   This password serves no purpose for accessing anything ATT on the web, because that would increase their support costs.  No it is only for use with email applications. </p><p>ATT even go so far as to suggest that ""Do you use a desktop program or a mobile app to access and manage AT&amp;T Mail? If so, we suggest you use one with Open Authentication (OAuth) technology.""  Ok so Thunderbird supports OAuth.  Unfortunately ATT do not. </p><p>You can force use of oAuth,  by changing the server names in account settings to Yahoo ones and retaining the ATT email address as a user name.  That is <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a> and <a href=""http://outbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">outbound.att.net</a> to those server names used by Yahoo.  <a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN4724.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN4724.html</a> for POP and for IMAP <a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/imap-server-settings-yahoo-mail-sln4075.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/imap-server-settings-yahoo-mail-sln4075.html</a> </p><p>My feeling is If you do not like the service at ATT or their reliability,  use another mail provider.  You could even use Yahoo which is currently providing the limited ATT service, as I described.  You do not even need to change your email address.  But the internet has many many free mail providers and few are as difficult to deal with as ATT/Yahoo arrangement. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
