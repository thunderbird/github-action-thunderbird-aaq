I'm pretty happy with it so far except for the fact that when the Mail tab is open along with Settings and/or Addons and I click between them a new window suddenly pops out. It's like I've just dragged one of the tabs to the desktop to open a new window, except I haven't, I've merely clicked one of the 2 or 3 tabs. After adjusting a setting or two, or adding a new theme etc it gets a little tiring having to close these unwanted windows. Any idea what might be causing this and how I can prevent it? </p><p>- In Settings &gt; General I tried switching between the 3 options in ""Open messages in..."" but that had no effect. - TB 115.5.1 - Mac OS 13.6 - 2  addons are installed but I've disabled them. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",gh108

Infatti ogni nuovo PC, la prima cosa che faccio è installarlo per gestire le mail. Ho appena comprato un nuovo Mini-PC con Win11 ed era mia intenzione riprodurre esattamente la stessa situazione che ho sul mio portatile. Quindi, installo l'ultima versione di Thunderbird. Sul mio portatile, copio la cartella Thunderbird presente in AppData - Roaming Apro lo stesso percorso sul Mini-PC e la copio nella stessa posizione. Esattamente come dice la procedura qui sul supporto. Niente, non mi vede niente. Allora inizio a cercare un po' su internet, c'è chi dice che la gestione dei profili è cambiata nel tempo, quindi se il mio profilo è stato creato tempo fa, bisogna installare una versione vecchia di Thunderbird, fare la procdura di prima per copiare il profilo e poi fare tutti gli aggiornamenti per portare Thunderbird all'ultima versione.... fatto, senza risultati. Provato ad installare varie versioni, Alcune volte si inchiodava dicendomi che non c'era alcun profilo o era danneggiato, altre partiva ""vuoto"" come al solito. C'è chi dice che lui ha risolto rinominando la cartella del suo profilo con il nome del profilo che si è creato con la nuova installazione.... provato ma niente. Ho provato a pincioccare (termine tecnico&nbsp;:-) con i file profiles.ini e intalls.ini, ma niente.... Mi potete aiutare&nbsp;? Solo pensare di dover impostare tutti gli account di posta (sono tantissimi) da zero, mi fa star male&nbsp;:-D Grazie anticipatamente a chi avrà voglia di darmi una mano.

First, for some reason, TB is creating an archive folder in the Archive folder for the iCloud mailbox when it should be creating it under Local Folders in a folder named for that mail account. Second, when I attempt to move or delete that newly created folder in iCloud\Archive, TB then unsubscribed from almost all IMAP folders save Inbox, Sent, and Trash. I have to every day check for that and resubscribe to the folders that TB has unsubscribed from. It only affects my iCloud account, it does not seem to touch my GMail, Yahoo, Hotmail, or <a href=""http://ATT.net"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.net</a> account (which is backed by Yahoo). </p><p>Found a similar issue on Reddit, but it was Thunderbird version 102.3.0 on Debian.
