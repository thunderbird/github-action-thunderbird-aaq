I'm pretty happy with it so far except for the fact that when the Mail tab is open along with Settings and/or Addons and I click between them a new window suddenly pops out. It's like I've just dragged one of the tabs to the desktop to open a new window, except I haven't, I've merely clicked one of the 2 or 3 tabs. After adjusting a setting or two, or adding a new theme etc it gets a little tiring having to close these unwanted windows. Any idea what might be causing this and how I can prevent it? </p><p>- In Settings &gt; General I tried switching between the 3 options in ""Open messages in..."" but that had no effect. - TB 115.5.1 - Mac OS 13.6 - 2  addons are installed but I've disabled them. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",gh108
