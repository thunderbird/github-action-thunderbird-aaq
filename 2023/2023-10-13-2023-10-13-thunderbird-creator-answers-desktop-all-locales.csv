I use Thunderbird on a Windows 20 desktop.  I have three email accounts set up.  Every few minutes the chime alerting to new mail bings on the least-used account and a little red bubble appears on the Thunderbird icon in the tray with the number of new emails -- sometime is says 2 0r 3, sometimes 30 or 40.  But, none of the folders in this account have any new email.  As soon as I click on the account header (which has turned blue to show new email) the number bubble disappears from the Thunderbird icon and the account header turns back to black.  Then, a very few minutes later, the chime goes off again.  I am stumped.  Has anyone else experienced this? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1610786;,mark.abels

I guess it shouldn't be called insert signatures, but maybe insert template, because that better describes what is required. </p><p>The thing is, I have a lot of different replies or other texts prepared where inserting HTML text including formatting will make the routine easier. I haven't found anything like that here. </p><p>I'm attaching a picture of how this is elegantly handled in Windows Live Mail 2012, where I simply have a list of different signatures (about 25) and each refers to a specific HTML file or plain text.
