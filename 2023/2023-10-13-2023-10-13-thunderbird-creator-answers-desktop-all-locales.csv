I use it to work with a number of mail accounts, including an MS Exchange account.  All worked OK before the Thunderbird update. Exquilla version is 115.3 and paid up. </p><p>After the Thunderbird update I found that the MS Exchange account had disappeared from Thunderbird. Re-adding this account through the Account Wizard <em>appeared</em> to work OK. But after successfully verifying my account, on the final ""Congratulations window"" it said to click Finish to save settings and exit account wizard. There was no Finish button to click on, only Back, Next and Cancel ones (see screenshot). Clicked Next&nbsp;: window disappeared. </p><p>And yes the MS Exchange account was then accessible in Thunderbird, and it synced OK (it's all still there online), and I could work with it, but only as long as I didn't exit Thunderbird&nbsp;!  When I re-loaded Thunderbird later after exiting it, the MS Exchange account was absent again. Contrary to what was stated, the account had not been saved.  Tried this several times - same result. </p><p>This issue only affects my MS Exchange account&nbsp;: none of my gmail accounts nor my Xtra account were affected. </p><p>Have other people had the same problem&nbsp;?  If so, is this being looked into&nbsp;?  It would be very annoying to have to add the MS Exchange account again each time I load Thunderbird. </p><p>Thanks a lot for any help, Emile. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1610548;,ejbax

Unblocking the file will include it in your sent message.'  </p><p>This is not a remote file, it has just been copied from another Thunderbird message into the clipboard. There is an Options button which shows the file location showing mailbox:///c:/users/(username etc).  </p><p>In Tools/Settings/Privacy/Mail Content, I have ticked the 'Allow remote content in messages.' </p><p>In Exceptions, I have tried to add 'mailbox:///c:/users/' as a permitted location. Doesn't help. I still get the error message. It's a nuisance to have to dismiss it every time.  </p><p>This is a new problem since upgrading to 115.3.1 (64-bit) </p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",brianstokes
