Stamattina invece le interruzioni sono diventate sempre più lunghe costringendomi a dover riavviare il programma perchè bloccato per diversi minuti. Cercando in rete sembrava fosse un problema di indicizzazione e quindi sono andato nella cartella del profilo e ho cancellato i più recenti file con estensione .msf - poi ho cancellato anche il file global-messages-db.sqlite Purtroppo adesso ad ogni riavvio sembra partire il processo di indicizzazione ma si blocca dopo 2/3 secondi senza lasciarmi il tempo di fare nulla Ho circa 7/8 mail alcune molto ""pesanti"" - tutte in IMAP per fortuna ma vorrei evitare di dover reinstallare tutto.

Mohu použít jak prostý text, tak drobné formátování v HTML anebo použít HTML soubor s potřebným formátováním. To je OK. </p><p>Co ale hledám, je vkládání podpisů přímo v otevřeném emailu a to k aktuálně postavenému kurzoru. Asi by se to nemuselo jmenovat vložení podpisů, ale třeba vložení šablony, neb to lépe vystihuje požadované. </p><p>Jde o to, že mám připraveno hodně různých odpovědí či jiných textů, kde vložení HTML textu včetně formátování usnadní rutinní práci. Zde jsem nic takového nenašel. </p><p>Přikládám obrázek jak je to elegantně řešeno ve Windows Live Mail 2012, kde jednoduše mám seznam různých podpisů (asi 25) a každý se odkazuje na určitý HTML soubor nebo prostý text. Následně výběrem požadovaného podpisu se vloží požadovaný text na požadované místo. </p><p>Dokud toto nebude dostupné v Thunderbuildu, pak práce v takovém emailovém klientu by pro mne nebyl posunem vpřed. Ale věřím, že toto naprogramovat je velmi jednoduché a pro uživatele to je velkým přínosem. </p><p>S pozdravem Pavel Cuc </p><p>--- </p><p>Hello. </p><p>I almost switched to Thunderbild, but one missing feature stopped me. </p><p>I know that Thunderbild allows you to assign an ""automatic"" signature to each connected account. I can either use plain text, minor formatting in HTML or use an HTML file with the necessary formatting. That's OK. </p><p>But what I'm looking for is to insert signatures directly in the open email and to the currently positioned cursor. I guess it shouldn't be called insert signatures, but maybe insert template, because that better describes what is required. </p><p>The thing is, I have a lot of different replies or other texts prepared where inserting HTML text including formatting will make the routine easier. I haven't found anything like that here. </p><p>I'm attaching a picture of how this is elegantly handled in Windows Live Mail 2012, where I simply have a list of different signatures (about 25) and each refers to a specific HTML file or plain text. Then selecting the desired signature inserts the desired text in the desired location. </p><p>Until this is available in Thunderbuild, then working in such an email client would not be a step forward for me. But I believe this is very easy to program and a great benefit to the user. </p><p>Regards Pavel Cuc </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,cs,1610705;1610914;1610988;,pcuc66
