I can only think to install back to an update 10 days ago. I can't find an option for that- and I am not a proffessional- just a simple user.  </p><p>I have a MacAir, since installing the latest update, Thunderbird: stalls for so long and can't switch it off or access anything for hours sporadically,  it won't save 'sent' emails sporadically,  it sends emails full of garbage - numbers, green and black screens, and other illegable content. sporadically.  A lot of problems happen the moment I put an image into the content.  and then I can't undo it. I can't access the image to move it, to delete it, just stuck.  the signature keeps including code.  it now says 105% full. Since when did we have a quota?  I didn't know how to fix it. So it's now blocking me receiving emails.  so I archived, deleted mails and it shifted it. BUT I have never had to do this before and don't want to -I have a busness to run and need to keep records. I can't delete in the future. What is this stupid quota thing? </p><p>I can keep going with the problems I have. But I don't have copious amounts of weeks and months to now trouble shoot. So I thought I just take it back to a previous update -say 2 weeks ago before th eproblems started, and not update again until Thunderbird can function on the Mac.  </p><p>Can anyone help me? I am scared to uninstall, as I don't want to lose my contacts again. (had previous problems with Thunderbird in the last few months) ...now this.  and have no idea how to get help?  I want to be loyal to thunderbird- but I can't function with it right now.  </p><p>....anyone? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",Kew

Mohu použít jak prostý text, tak drobné formátování v HTML anebo použít HTML soubor s potřebným formátováním. To je OK. </p><p>Co ale hledám, je vkládání podpisů přímo v otevřeném emailu a to k aktuálně postavenému kurzoru. Asi by se to nemuselo jmenovat vložení podpisů, ale třeba vložení šablony, neb to lépe vystihuje požadované. </p><p>Jde o to, že mám připraveno hodně různých odpovědí či jiných textů, kde vložení HTML textu včetně formátování usnadní rutinní práci. Zde jsem nic takového nenašel. </p><p>Přikládám obrázek jak je to elegantně řešeno ve Windows Live Mail 2012, kde jednoduše mám seznam různých podpisů (asi 25) a každý se odkazuje na určitý HTML soubor nebo prostý text.

I can either use plain text, minor formatting in HTML or use an HTML file with the necessary formatting. That's OK. </p><p>But what I'm looking for is to insert signatures directly in the open email and to the currently positioned cursor. I guess it shouldn't be called insert signatures, but maybe insert template, because that better describes what is required. </p><p>The thing is, I have a lot of different replies or other texts prepared where inserting HTML text including formatting will make the routine easier. I haven't found anything like that here. </p><p>I'm attaching a picture of how this is elegantly handled in Windows Live Mail 2012, where I simply have a list of different signatures (about 25) and each refers to a specific HTML file or plain text. Then selecting the desired signature inserts the desired text in the desired location. </p><p>Until this is available in Thunderbuild, then working in such an email client would not be a step forward for me.
