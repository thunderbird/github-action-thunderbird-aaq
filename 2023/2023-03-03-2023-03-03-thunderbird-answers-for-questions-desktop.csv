Account 4, TalkTalk, assuming it is my second TT address: In, all correct - Out, all correct except this is not my default account as far as I know (see Point 3 above) 5. There is no Account 5 6. Account 6, Googlemail: In, all correct - Out, all correct except this is not my default account as far as I know (see Point 3 above) 7. Account 7, Yahoo: this one is tricky, which is why I haven't used it until I had sorted it out (I get an error when signing in and everything I have tried so far has failed, so since I don't use it I'm not that fussed). And I have been getting this notification window when Thunderbird starts: 'Login to server <a href=""http://smtp.mail.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.yahoo.com</a> with username gfinley66@yahoo.com failed', which the option 'Enter new password'.

Why not? Because gmail will prompt for password, but because OAuth is already set up for incoming, it will say the password is wrong. The incoming Oauth and outgoing Oauth need to be set up together. This will involve changing some Incoming server settings and some Outgoing SMTP server settings, checking cookies are allowed and removal of all old passwords before a restart of Thunderbird and then following the gmail prompt to allow thunderbird. </p><p>Start by changing both incoming and outgoing server settings. </p> <ul><li> 'Account Settings' &gt; select gmail account name - see image below as guide. </li><li> Bottom right look for 'Outgoing Server (SMTP)' </li></ul> <p>The info you previously posted says this account is correctly set up to use a gmail smtp, so this time... </p> <ul><li> Click on 'Edit SMTP_Server' button  </li></ul> <p>Then edit the settings so they match as follows: </p> <ul><li> Decription: Google Mail </li><li> Server name: <a href=""http://smtp.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.gmail.com</a> </li><li> Port: 465 </li><li> Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li> Authentication method: OAuth2 </li><li> User Name: full gmail email address </li></ul> <ul><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <ul><li> Select: 'Server Settings' for the gmail account - see image below as guide </li></ul> <p>Set the following, some may aleady be correct, but I'll list all the settings. </p> <ul><li> Server Name: <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> </li><li> User Name: full gmail email address </li><li> Connection Security: SSL/TLS </li><li> Authentication method: OAuth2 </li></ul> <p>If you get any prompt from gmail to enter password - click on Cancel  and continue checking settings as below. </p><p>Next Check these Settings: I'm assuming you already have the following, but check anyway. </p> <ul><li> Menu icon &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security </li><li> Under 'Web Content' </li><li> Select checkbox: 'Accept cookies from sites' </li></ul> <p>Also set up this for same section: </p> <ul><li> Click on 'Exceptions' </li><li> enter: <a href=""https://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com</a> </li><li> Set Status to 'Allow' </li><li> Click on 'Save Changes' </li></ul> <p>Now, whilst in 'Privacy &amp; Security', you need to remove the current saved passwords for the gmail account.

Remember it is case sensitive, so make sure the keyboard 'Caps Lock' is not accidentally switched on. Logon to the gmail webmail account via a browser to get access.

The Oauth password gets set up at the start when Thunderbird tries to get access to 'Get Messages' off the gmail server to do the incoming of emails. You should get that google page asking for email and password to set up and allow Thunderbird. You have to enter the normal password - same one you use when you logon to the webmail account. Hence why I advised you check that you can get access to the webmail account so you know what is the correct password. </p><p>Once the oauth password gets stored in the Saved Passwords then Thunderbird should use it to get mail and to send mail.

OK, I think I'm getting confused by the mentions of password (my webmail password), and the Authorisation passwords (sometimes referred to as oauth, sometimes OAuth and sometimes OAuth2).  When I last responded to Google's invitation to enter my password, I thought it wanted me to enter the Authorisation password, so I entered the various versions, which didn't seem to work. It didn't occur to me I should perhaps enter my webmail password, so before going through your latest reply in detail, I thought I should try that, which appeared to work, as Google asked me to identify myself on my mobile, which I did. But the saved password in Settings/Saved logins is still gobbledegook. So now I'm totally lost. (I checked the webmail password again, and the browser automatically opened on my page, so I can't check the password, I assume it's the same as the one I've always use, A....3). </p><p>2. You say: 'It looks like this: oauth://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> (<a href=""https://mail.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/</a>)  It will say the User Name = full gmail email address It will say the Password is something really weird and long a load of letters and numbers - it will not resemble any normal password. This oauth password cannot be used by you for anything. Only Thunderbird program can use this. ' &gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, this password is what I meant by 'gobbledegook', which is why I got confused in Points 3 &amp; 4 in my previous reply. OK, so I don't need to worry about that. </p><p>3. I have not sent anything since you previously told me not to, and will not until you tell me I can. </p><p>I have checked the last 4 screenshots I sent you and they are still the same - EXCEPT, I just noticed I wrongly sent you GMAIL, INCOMING P.2 - just attaching the correct one below. </p><p>I had also forgotten to send you GMAIL, SETTINGS, PRIVACY &amp; SECURITY, SAVED LOGINS, so am sending it to you too - the password is indeed gobbledegook ('something really weird and long a load of letters and numbers'). </p><p>If everything looks correct to you, am I right in thinking I don't need to either: - 'You would have to remove the google oauth password line if you intend to try again.' or - 'remove all google/gmail stored passwords and then remove the gmail account via Account Settings.' </p><p>With many thanks again, and best wishes.

If you delete an email in an imap account eg: Inbox folder and it goes into the imap Trash folder, then the imap folders synchronise with server .

After 30 days gmail will auto empty Trash.  </p><p>If you only want to delete from the imap account, but keep email on server, then you can use a special shortcut method to by pass the Trash which means gmail will only remove the 'Inbox' label and archive the email in 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>To delete email by passing the Trash: Select email then hold down the 'Shift' key and press the 'Delete' key on keyboard. </p><p>Please note there is no Undo with this action. </p><p>Keyboard shortcuts: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-thunderbird</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If I change the Gmail account to POP, will this allow me to delete from Thunderbird without affecting the Gmail account on the server? </blockquote> <p>Yes.  </p><p>Pop accounts can only access the server Inbox and download to the pop account Inbox. There is no synchronisation between any folder in a Pop account and any folder on the server. So this means the Pop account set of folders in Thunderbird can have different names from those on the server and contain different emails. </p><p>eg: The server may have all the emails in the Inbox because that's where all new incoming mail gets displayed. In Thunderbird, you can organise all those incoming emails into various folders. eg: Friends, Family, Bills, Online Orders, Clubs, etc plus the you will get the usual set of default folders. This organising is advised, so the mbox files that store the emails do not get too large. Note: the 'Sent' folder auto gets created when you first send an email, Same for Drafts etc. </p><p>Before you create the  Pop account you need to make sure the webmail account has the correct settings set up. </p> <ul><li> Logon to the gmail webmail account via a browser. </li><li> click on 'Settings' gear wheel icon located top right </li><li> select 'See all settings' from the pop up drop down section. </li><li> Select 'Forwarding and Pop/Imap' tab </li><li> For 'Pop download' section - select 'Enable pop for all mail' </li></ul> <p>Please note you cannot simply alter the server settings of the current imap account. You will need to set up the Pop account as New &gt; Existing mail account. </p><p>After creating the  Pop account in Thunderbird: check the 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Server Settings' before downloading anything. Select 'Leave messages on server' The checkboxes below that setting offer some means of deleting off the server, but I do not believe the emails will be properly deleted because you are not able to put them in the gmail Trash. It means the label would get removed and gmail would still have the email in the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Gmail stores everything in the 'All Mail' folder; incoming, outgoing, archived - the lot. The use of 'labels' is like applying a tag which gmail uses as a search criteria so it can offer a virtual display of emails in a folder like structure which is easier for users to understand. </p><p>Gmail will auto empty the server 'Spam' and 'Trash' folder.  So, if the server auto puts emails into the 'Spam' folder then Thunderbird cannot access them and you will not know what is in that 'Spam' folder unless you logon to webmail account. </p><p>Gradually, the number of emails on the server will increase. This will use up the quota on the server. If the server quota gets to maximun then the server will not be able to receive any emails until space has been created.  Therefore I would advise, periodically, logon to the  gmail webmail account and check the 'Inbox' for emails you may not need to keep OR check 'All Mail' folder for emails that do not have any labels (assuming you did select the option 'Until I delete' them). </p><p>Please note any emails you send using Thunderbird via the gmail server will get recognised by gmail and gmail will put copies of those sent emails into the  server 'Sent Mail' folder. This is handy should you ever need to use webmail. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
