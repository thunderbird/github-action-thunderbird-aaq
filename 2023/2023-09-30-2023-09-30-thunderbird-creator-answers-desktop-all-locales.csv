When I checked my email, I found that the contents of my inbox had disappeared - there was only a blank space. Later I found that the missing mail was only for this year - mail from 31 Dec 2022 and before then is still there. And new emails arriving since then are displayed normally.  Any idea what has happened? And is it possible to get the missing emails restored? Thank you. Nick Terdre </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",nickterdre

Now I still get the notification of new emails (&amp; number of) in Inbox but could not access them. I discovered that now I have to click on the line above (which is my email address) which takes me to another page where I have to click on Read Messages which takes me back to Inbox!

That one hit, a request for purchasing help for a bound user manual, has a response that ""Being a free product, there is no nicely-written, bound, reference manual...We're very proud of what we do and of the documentation available."" Linux, another free product, is documented in numerous ""nicely-written, bound, reference manual[s]"", as are most free software products.  The string-search approach used here for help sometimes does not work well, and can often yield incorrect answers applying to other/older versions of the software. I am surprised at the response from a 'Top 10 Contributor' and not at all clear on the reason for the vehemence of the response.  Browsers and email clients would seem to be the applications most likely to be used by the naive user, whom I would think we should encourage to seek and use documentation. As a software engineer, I certainly understand the preference for writing code over writing documentation, but also recognize the importance of well-maintained documentation.  Is there something I am missing here?  To my mind, the absence of coherent, date/version specific documentation is perhaps the greatest weakness in this product. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1607111;,dumpsterdan
