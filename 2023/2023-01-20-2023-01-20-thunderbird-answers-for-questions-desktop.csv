This is what my provider, Dreamhost says. </p><p>Hi again, </p><p>Thanks for contacting us back! </p><p>Unfortunately, it's hard for us to see what's happening for you since that's all happening within your mail app. I've set up the 'steve@ad<a href=""http://-answers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">-answers.com</a>' user on my own Thunderbird mail app and it looks to have loaded up your mailbox okay, though it took a while since you have a lot of data stored under it. I was also able to send a test email from my Thunderbird set up, which saved the sent message in your 'Sent' folder okay. You should see my test in the 'Sent' folder now. </p><p>So, the sent message did get saved okay and I wasn't having any issues with the mailbox myself other than it taking a while to load up. I also sent a test via webmail as well which saved in the 'Sent' folder okay. </p><p>The mailbox is storing is currently storing 19Gb now, so it's less than what you were storing before. Here are just the larger folders storing over 1000 messages since you do have a lot of folder locations as well: </p><pre> 1573  109M Growing Oaks &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  1646  684M Archives.2017 &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  1811  438M Speedpro Imaging &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  2140  909M Archives.2018 &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  2248    43M Facebook &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  2420  969M City of Eden &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  3143  161M PCI Accounting - Reports &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  7999  4.2G Sent &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  14514  4.6G PCI SALES ASSISTANCE &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt;  54603    19G TOTAL &lt;-----&lt;&lt;&lt; </pre> <p>So, you have plenty of space, even more than before. And, in total, you're only storing almost 55 thousand emails, which isn't a huge amount either. I haven't seen the issues with the disk space quota limit since were able to clear that up previously. </p><p>All of the folders other than the ones listed above aren't storing too much, so those smaller locations should load up okay. I was also able to load up the smaller folders like 'Laura Rippey' and 'Artwear' in Thunderbird as well as in webmail, so the folders do have content and those emails are coming up for me. </p><p>It's hard to tell what's happening on your end since we can't see that. I tested through through Thunderbird as well. Do you happen to have another mail application that you might be able to configure via IMAP to see if the issues occur there as well? Any problems with the mailbox would also show up in webmail, but since clearing up the disk space quota issue from before, I'm not seeing issues there now. </p><p>I do apologize for the inconvenience with this matter. It does look to be specific to the mail app, though I'm not sure what that could be since I can't replicate any issues with that myself. Are you noticing similar issues within webmail at all? </p><p>I know we've gone through this before, but I think the best option here is to see if you can replicate the same issue within another mail application if you have one. And, test this through webmail at the same time to see if there are issues coming up there as well to help narrow it down. </p><p>Let us know how that goes and we'll gladly take it from there, Steve. </p><p><br> Thank you kindly, </p>",steve498,false,0,0

These attachments are b64 encoded and are incomplete (there is no terminator at the end of the b64 section) in Thunderbird when you View Source.  However, if I log into AOL webmail directly, the attachments are complete.  I have Thunderbird configured for IMAP.  In Thunderbird, if you move these incomplete messages to a local folder, Thunderbird deletes the complete message from the server and leaves you with an incomplete message in your local folder.  I have used Outlook and Windows Live Mail in the past and never had such a problem.  I view Thunderbird's occasional corruption of messages as a serious bug because it renders Thunderbird unreliable. </p>",dennis723,false,1,0

Today I received a large email (2.4 MB) that had 9 attachments.  The first two came through fine and only part of the 3rd (a pdf) was received.  The other 6 attachments did not appear in TB.  However, if I logged into my AOL email account with AOL webmail, or Outlook 2013, or Window Live Mail all 9 attachments were there in their entirety.  In TB, after making the preference change, I cleared the cache and did CTRL-U in an attempt to force the re-download of this email, but it had no effect.  I also moved the email from my IMAP inbox to IMAP drafts and back again to IMAP inbox with no effect in TB.  When viewing the source for this email, it appears that TB or the AOL IMAP server interrupts the message download for some unknown reason.  TB has downloaded larger emails in the past without issue, so size is not the sole cause of the problem.  The message size on the server is 2.4 MB vice the 408 kB that TB downloads.  This is the third time I have verified that TB failed to completely download a message.  I can provide a copy of the complete .eml source from the server and copy of the .eml that TB downloads.

This would be a fairly inefficient and error prone way to accomplish this task.  After a brief look at the code, it looks like MAPI calls are being used to expose information about the messages/folder structure, etc.  (The folder structure would not be in each individual email either).  I haven't found the exact place in code where the TO field of each message is queried, but that would be the place to query the recipients collection.  Assuming this is done with a MAPI call and not through some arcane text parsing of the email message, it is the replacement of one MAPI call with another. (and probably a bit of formatting to handle multiple recipients and correctly place the TO and CC fields) </p><p>Likely Outlook stores the information in this manner as it is an efficient object oriented approach to the data storage. </p> <blockquote><em>re&nbsp;:This is the code to so.

For Thunderbird to work well with many of the leading antivirus product you have to create exclusions for Thunderbird profile folder in the anti virus program and disable scanning of encrypted connections on email ports and outgoing email scanning. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
