The current issue is that does not always work.  The first several times I tried it nothing happened.  Today I opened Thunderbird went to the Help, found that 'cure', tried it and it worked.  But previous attempts it did not work.  Might have something to do with using Thunderbird quite a bit before trying to add a name to a group by drag and drop. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1580573;1580574;1580576;1580579;,djcarlst

For many years I had zero issues, but a few years ago my troubles began. </p><p>For some reason at some time during the day, Thunderbird will stop automatically synchronzing my inbox and folders.  It's really frustrating because I never know when it happens, but after a few hours I will notice ""I haven't gotten any messages in a while. ""   This happens at least twice a week.  Sometimes I might not realize it until much, much later, and by then I've missed dozens upon dozens of email messages. </p><p>At first this happened when I was still using POP on a gmail inbox.  The only way I could trigger Thunderbird to start re-syncing again was to completely shut down Thunderbird and reopen it.  It gets really annoying having to do this so frequently. </p><p>At some point, I decided to convert to IMAP.  This works only marginally better.  Thunderbird still occasionally stops syncing, but usually I just have to navigate to a different folder and then back to Inbox, to get it to start again.  But it may take several minutes before the messages start flowing in. </p><p>I can't see that there are any errors happening, but maybe I don't know where to look.  I'm perfectly happy to look for error logs or whatever to help troubleshoot the issue. </p><p>I really don't like the gmail interface on Chrome, and the phone app is even worse, and would hate to have to stop using Thunderbird.  But with gmail I never have to worry if my inbox is current, and I'm beyond tired of missing email messages. </p><p>Has anyone experienced this before or could help with advice on figuring this out? </p><p>Thanks so much! </p><p>P.S.  I'm currently on 102.11.0 (64-bit) on MacOS Big Sur.  I have auto-updates turn on, so my Thunderbird install is always current. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cal.vino
