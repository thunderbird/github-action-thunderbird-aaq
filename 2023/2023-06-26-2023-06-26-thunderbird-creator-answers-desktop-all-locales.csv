I left that position and someone else then occupied it. My access to that account was then removed by the sysadmin &amp; new loggin details given to the new occupant. I deleted all account/server settings, having transferred all previous in and out emails to a local folder, from my Thunderbird. At the user level at least, there is no visible sign of that account remaining.  However, I keep getting a pop-up that the server for that account requests me to provide authentication details for that deleted account. As far as I know the new occupant of the position is using that account without a problem. How can I stop getting that pop-up? It is very annoying, as it appears on top of whatever other program/window I ma using at the time. Any help?

Uso calendari e rubrica, e non so se la lentezza dipendaanche da questo. Quando avvio Thunderbird, devo talvolta aspettare qualche minuto perché mi risponda ai comandi. Se invio un'email, fino a che non è finita tutta la fase di invio e copia locale, il programma non fa null'altro. Ho il sospetto che siano problemi di rete, come se alcune attività non fossero asincrone, ma occorra aspettare sempre la fine di ogni operazione prima di iniziarne un'altra. Però ricordo bene che, una volta, l'invio delle email era asincrono, non mi obbligava ad aspettare la fine delle operazioni. Cosa si può fare per tornare ad una velocità decente?
