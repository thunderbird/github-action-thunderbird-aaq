Uso calendari e rubrica, e non so se la lentezza dipendaanche da questo. Quando avvio Thunderbird, devo talvolta aspettare qualche minuto perché mi risponda ai comandi. Se invio un'email, fino a che non è finita tutta la fase di invio e copia locale, il programma non fa null'altro. Ho il sospetto che siano problemi di rete, come se alcune attività non fossero asincrone, ma occorra aspettare sempre la fine di ogni operazione prima di iniziarne un'altra. Però ricordo bene che, una volta, l'invio delle email era asincrono, non mi obbligava ad aspettare la fine delle operazioni. Cosa si può fare per tornare ad una velocità decente?
