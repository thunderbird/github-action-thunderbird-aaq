A week ago, a message in Thunderbird from my university Gmail account asked me to sign in again. This was a separate, smaller Google window with my email address already there, and a button ""Next"", presumably to enter my password or go to a university sign-in page. But when I click next, it just goes to a white page with ""403 Forbidden"" written. The URL at the top that it is apparently trying to go to is a university security/authentication thing.  </p><p>Ever since then, this is the only result I get when trying to connect to this Gmail account. I have deleted the account from Thunderbird and tried re-connecting it in many ways, entering the server settings manually (with OAuth2), etc., and this same thing always happens. I have also tried deleting the cookies from this account, and clearing my entire Firefox cache and cookies. Please let me know what other details I can give.  </p><p>For the record, I am using Ubuntu 22.04, but I recently tried this on a Mac, and all the exact same things happened with Thunderbird. However, using web-based Gmail works fine (Ubuntu and Firefox), and I can also connect to this email account with the Mac Mail client normally.  </p><p>Thank you </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",karl.lerud

This gives me groups of Older, Last 14 Days, Last 7 Days, Yesterday and Today with arrows to collapse or expand the groups. I keep the first 4 groups collapsed and only group Today expanded. </p><p>Problem 1: When I navigate to a different folder then back to Inbox, all the groups are now expanded and must be re-collapsed. In 102 the Message List Display would remember the collapsed/expanded state of each group while 105 the state for all groups is changed to expanded. </p><p>Problem 2: In 102, when a group is collapsed the Message List Line shows for the group shows only the collapse/expand arrow, the group name and the number of messages in the group.  Example: ""                                      &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                                                                   "" </p><p>In 115, when a collapse is executed, the group name line below is not properly erased so that From, Received, and Size fields show the From, Received and Size from the message that previously was on that specific screen line which is the top message in the newly collapsed group. Example: ""                                &gt; Older (19)                                                                                                   "" Example: ""       AT&amp;T                &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                         9/3/2022, 4:29 PM                1.6 MB     "" Example: ""       LinkedIn           V Today (6/6)                                8/20/2023, 1:18 PM              42.5 KB    "" (Other fields may behave similarly but I have not seen it because those fields were blank anyway) </p><p>Problem 3: This occurs in 115, and in 102 which I have previously reported but did not get fixed in 115. When the popup requesting file cleanup pops up and continue is clicked, when it finishes the Message list display options Sort by &gt; Grouped By Sort becomes unchecked and my message list is no longer grouped by sort.

However WHY did you use that Icon instead of the standard 3 line hamburger Icon??? The Icon you used looks like the Windows 10 Task View Icon) </p><p>Thunderbird 115.3.1 (64 bit), Windows 10 Home, 22H2 </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",gtalbott202

In the old days, starting with the 3-bar menu symbol, there was a path to reach the place where Thunderbird stored the passwords needed to get access to one's ISP accounts. If that still exists, I can't now find it.  </p><p>I have a new Dell laptop that I am trying to activate. Comcast does not accept the PWs (that I have written down), so I want to find them on this older machine where they still work. Following TB's instructions, the expected ""Saved Passwords"" box does not appear; instead we get ""Saved Logins"". ""Logins"" is apparently a synonym for what I might call ""retail"" passwords, used to access bank, vendor, &amp;c accounts, but these are distinct from network-access accounts. (In general, I think TB fails to distinguish adequately between the two password categories, but that's another question.) </p><p>So the question is: how do I get access to the ISP passwords stored on this old, working, machine, so I can use them on the new one? </p><p>I am using 115.3.2 on win11. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",wagtail1
