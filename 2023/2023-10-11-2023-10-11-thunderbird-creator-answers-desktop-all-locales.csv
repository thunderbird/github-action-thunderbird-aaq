This gives me groups of Older, Last 14 Days, Last 7 Days, Yesterday and Today with arrows to collapse or expand the groups. I keep the first 4 groups collapsed and only group Today expanded. </p><p>Problem 1: When I navigate to a different folder then back to Inbox, all the groups are now expanded and must be re-collapsed. In 102 the Message List Display would remember the collapsed/expanded state of each group while 105 the state for all groups is changed to expanded. </p><p>Problem 2: In 102, when a group is collapsed the Message List Line shows for the group shows only the collapse/expand arrow, the group name and the number of messages in the group.  Example: ""                                      &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                                                                   "" </p><p>In 115, when a collapse is executed, the group name line below is not properly erased so that From, Received, and Size fields show the From, Received and Size from the message that previously was on that specific screen line which is the top message in the newly collapsed group. Example: ""                                &gt; Older (19)                                                                                                   "" Example: ""       AT&amp;T                &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                         9/3/2022, 4:29 PM                1.6 MB     "" Example: ""       LinkedIn           V Today (6/6)                                8/20/2023, 1:18 PM              42.5 KB    "" (Other fields may behave similarly but I have not seen it because those fields were blank anyway) </p><p>Problem 3: This occurs in 115, and in 102 which I have previously reported but did not get fixed in 115. When the popup requesting file cleanup pops up and continue is clicked, when it finishes the Message list display options Sort by &gt; Grouped By Sort becomes unchecked and my message list is no longer grouped by sort. See: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1371381"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1371381</a>  </p><p>(PS I love the new access to the Message list display options so I don't have to search through multiple levels of view options to find and re-check Grouped by sort. However WHY did you use that Icon instead of the standard 3 line hamburger Icon??? The Icon you used looks like the Windows 10 Task View Icon) </p><p>Thunderbird 115.3.1 (64 bit), Windows 10 Home, 22H2 </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",gtalbott202

In the old days, starting with the 3-bar menu symbol, there was a path to reach the place where Thunderbird stored the passwords needed to get access to one's ISP accounts. If that still exists, I can't now find it.  </p><p>I have a new Dell laptop that I am trying to activate. Comcast does not accept the PWs (that I have written down), so I want to find them on this older machine where they still work. Following TB's instructions, the expected ""Saved Passwords"" box does not appear; instead we get ""Saved Logins"". ""Logins"" is apparently a synonym for what I might call ""retail"" passwords, used to access bank, vendor, &amp;c accounts, but these are distinct from network-access accounts. (In general, I think TB fails to distinguish adequately between the two password categories, but that's another question.) </p><p>So the question is: how do I get access to the ISP passwords stored on this old, working, machine, so I can use them on the new one? </p><p>I am using 115.3.2 on win11. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",wagtail1
