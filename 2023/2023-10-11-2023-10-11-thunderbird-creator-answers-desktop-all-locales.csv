I use as calendars some ""ics format"" files that are in a folder synced via Resilio Sync to other PCs. I created the calendars as ""network"" calendars, giving as URLs the paths to the files. They are 8 small files. If I modify, quickly one after the other, some events of a calendar, Thunderbird changes the calendar file to read-only, and sends me a message saying it could not write the xxx.ics.tmp file to the xxx.ics because this one was locked. Then, if I try to exit, Thunderbird doesn't quit anymore: I have to forcedly terminate the process tree. In the calendar folder I find the xxx.ics file and the xxx.ics.tmp files. I delete the tmp file and obviously eventually, at thunderbird restart, I found the xxx.ics before the last op, read-only. Now I can unlock it and all is working again. Making some tests, I understood the problem arises from a conflict between Thunderbird trying to update the files with the last changes and Resilio Sync tryng to sync the files with other PCs (note: the PCs are all mine and I don't modify the files on different PCs at the same time). I found a note in the Resilio help pages just about this kind of problem. Resilio suggests to modify some of its parameters to prolong the interval between the start of two sync operation refresh of some specific files (with given extensions). I lenghten the time interval for the *.ics files up to 40 sec, without success. Does Thunderbird 115 have some parameter to avoid it gets stuck so quickly for a locked calendar file? I repeat I did not have this problem before Thunderbird 115. I hope I was clear. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",o.talamo

I had two accounts set up for the same Office365 email address.

I have had this setup for about two years. </p><p>Today, I took the Thunderbird snap upgrade to 115.3.2, and it seems that Thunderbird merged the two above-mentioned accounts together.  It kept the name for the OWL account and open folder layout that I had in the navigation pane (I was normally using the OWL account), but made it an IMAP account with the IMAP server settings from the other account.  When I go into the OWL for Exchange add-on settings, there are no accounts set up. </p><p>It doesn't look like I lost anything, but this behavior is disturbing.
