This gives me groups of Older, Last 14 Days, Last 7 Days, Yesterday and Today with arrows to collapse or expand the groups. I keep the first 4 groups collapsed and only group Today expanded. </p><p>Problem 1: When I navigate to a different folder then back to Inbox, all the groups are now expanded and must be re-collapsed. In 102 the Message List Display would remember the collapsed/expanded state of each group while 105 the state for all groups is changed to expanded. </p><p>Problem 2: In 102, when a group is collapsed the Message List Line shows for the group shows only the collapse/expand arrow, the group name and the number of messages in the group.  Example: ""                                      &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                                                                   "" </p><p>In 115, when a collapse is executed, the group name line below is not properly erased so that From, Received, and Size fields show the From, Received and Size from the message that previously was on that specific screen line which is the top message in the newly collapsed group. Example: ""                                &gt; Older (19)                                                                                                   "" Example: ""       AT&amp;T                &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                         9/3/2022, 4:29 PM                1.6 MB     "" Example: ""       LinkedIn           V Today (6/6)                                8/20/2023, 1:18 PM              42.5 KB    "" (Other fields may behave similarly but I have not seen it because those fields were blank anyway) </p><p>Problem 3: This occurs in 115, and in 102 which I have previously reported but did not get fixed in 115. When the popup requesting file cleanup pops up and continue is clicked, when it finishes the Message list display options Sort by &gt; Grouped By Sort becomes unchecked and my message list is no longer grouped by sort.
