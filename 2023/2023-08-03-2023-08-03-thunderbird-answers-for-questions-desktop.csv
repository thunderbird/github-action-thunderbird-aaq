That is a separate process.  So we are left with only four real possibilities for it failing.   </p> <ol><li> The copy of outlook being used to import from is not actually fully functional. </li><li> The file we are importing from is corrupt or parked on a bad disk location.  As you have not manged to test the disk  the bad location remains a possibility. </li><li> Outlook as the hosting application has stopped processing to ask for a password or some such. as it is no ""visible"" the user interaction does not occur so it just hangs there. </li><li> Thunderbird's import has a bug. </li></ol> <p>Logging of the import will shed further light on exactly what that is,  but as you appear to be having difficulty with a command line utility,  logging might be a step to far. </p><p>See <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

This processing could be related to server-side operations or configurations. In Thunderbird, such messages usually indicate that the mail server is performing some tasks on your account before it can deliver the messages to your client. This can sometimes take time, especially if there's a backlog of emails. To resolve this, I'd recommend trying a few steps. First, ensure that your Thunderbird is updated to the latest version. Then, check your email account's settings, especially the server settings. If the issue persists, you might want to consider contacting Comcast's support to inquire about any ongoing server-side maintenance or issues. Additionally, you can try accessing your email through Comcast's webmail to see if the issue is Thunderbird-specific. Lastly, you might need to be patient and let the server processing complete, especially if there's a large amount of mail to process. It's frustrating, but sometimes these situations can take a bit of time. Good luck, and I hope your email access gets back to normal soon! </p>",suram080,false,0,3

To retrieve your lost Address Books and second email address, you can try a few steps. First, make sure Thunderbird is closed. Then, navigate to your Thunderbird profile folder. You can find this by going to ""Help"" &gt; ""Troubleshooting Information"" in Thunderbird and clicking on ""Show Folder"" next to ""Profile Directory."" In the profile folder, look for ""abook.mab"" for your Address Books and ""prefs.js"" for your email settings. You might need to replace these files with your backups if you have them. As for the 'side by side configuration' error, try reinstalling Thunderbird or repairing the installation.

I've spent many hours trying to figure out this problem on my own with Geek Squad and Spectrum support but we have all exhausted available resources and have reached a brick wall. Now I'm thinking I should stop doing this and wait a few weeks for designers to figure this out and in the interim use Spectrum webmail.

The server that allows you to send mail is the outgoing or SMTP server. The server that lets you receive mail is referred to as an incoming, POP or Mail server.

Unfortunately, a rumor began approx ten years ago that Thunderbird was being abandoned, but what actually happened was a restructuring within the organization for better focus.

Thank you.) </p><p>Hi David and Matt, </p><p>Thanks for your last note and your dedication to TB. </p><p>I got a big surprise this evening. I felt you should know about this in case it helps you and TB users.  </p><p>For the 3 weeks I've not been able to send outgoing emails via TB since its latest version was installed, I've been testing the outgoing TB function periodically on the slim chance that some programmer at my ISP or TB would have installed some sort of fix that would allow me to send outgoing emails once again via TB. </p><p>This evening, I did this test yet again and voila!  The outgoing email went out and was received by the addressee!  If you can tell me how this finally happened without my changing anything in my settings, I would love to know. Otherwise, I will have to assume this was deus ex machina! </p><p>That's the good news. The bad news is that in 2 of the 3 outgoing tests I did, odd things happened: </p><p>1. In one case, in the message portion of the email, a little square box with a silhouette figure of a person's head and shoulders appeared.  When I clicked it, the entire contents of my address book appeared!  In the attachment space ""maryinfantino.vcf  4 bytes"" appeared.  My guess is that this glitch is somehow connected to the address book file my tech created when we copied my TB address book and put it in my ISP's web mail so I could use web mail until we found a fix for the TB outgoing email glitch.  </p><p>2.  In another case, the silhouette box did not appear in the message area. But in the attachment space ""maryinfantino(2).vcf"" appeared.  Clicking on this did not open up the contents of my address book.  </p><p>3.  In the third case, all went well.  No silhouette-person-in-a-box symbol and no attachment were automatically included. If I knew all my TB outgoing emails would be like this, I could go back to using my wonderful TB. But I can't take that chance of course until I know for sure my address book won't attach to my outgoing emails.  </p><p>Any thoughts on what might be happening to produce these different results?   </p><p>You wrote that I didn't send you the settings you needed for figuring out why the outgoing email function in TB was no longer working for me. I thought I did. Sorry.  Please tell me again which settings you want me to send. Maybe if we do this now, the settings I send will possibly be ones that got somehow changed (without my making the changes) and which are now allowing my outgoing emails to launch.  </p><p>Since TB is still sending out new versions, does this mean the TB team is still revising and updating the software or does it mean the team is only updating TB's security?  I see some changes in the format of the latest TB, so I'm thinking you're still revising the software. </p><p>Can you tell me why TB made the decision to not include a feature that allows users for certain to block certain emails either by address or key word, etc.?  Is there any chance TB will start including this feature?  </p><p>David, thank you so much for the encouraging info on TB's current status.  </p><p>My hope still is to return to using TB if at all possible. </p><p>Thank you both very much.

The recently released 115 has more features and tweaks to be added, so it's a normal occurrence. I always recommend doing periodic backups, as it is possible that an update may have bug to be fixed.  - on helping your PC send messages, I don't know if there is a problem, as you indicated success in sending email.

The change in meeting time after accepting the invite could be due to a time zone conversion problem. To fix this, let's try a couple of things. First, ensure that both your Thunderbird and Windows 10 time zone settings are accurate and match your Europe/Prague time zone. Also, check if the sender's time zone settings are correct. If the problem persists, you might want to check if any add-ons or extensions in Thunderbird are affecting time zone settings. You can try disabling them temporarily to see if it makes a difference. Lastly, ensure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. </p>",suram080,false,0,1
