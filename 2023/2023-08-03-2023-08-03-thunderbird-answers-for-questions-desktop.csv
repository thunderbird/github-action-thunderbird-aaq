Thunderbird only download them locally it's still on the main email inbox server that is on the online email provider. You need to go to the online email provider and look for the emails on there to verify they are still there and that the email provider hasn't removed old email based on their capacity to keep old emails. </p>,Dropa,false,0,1

Also, I just realized that Thunderbird used to tell me how many messages in the Inbox and how many of those are unread, in the lower right of the status bar at the bottom.  Now it just tells me how many messages are in the Inbox but now how many are unread, at the top of the screen next to ""Inbox.""  How can I make it tell me how many messages are unread? </p>",MozThunderbirdUser,false,0,0
