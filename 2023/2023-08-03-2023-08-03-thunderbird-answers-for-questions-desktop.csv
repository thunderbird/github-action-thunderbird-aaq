It sounds like you've been through a lot trying to get your email and address book sorted. I'm really sorry to hear about the troubles you've encountered. Regarding your missing address book, it's possible that the update caused some settings to change. To resolve this, you might want to try accessing the ""Address Book"" section in Thunderbird, which should be in the ""Tools"" menu. If you don't see it there, you could check if it's disabled from the ""View"" menu. If that doesn't work, you can also consider exporting your address book (if you have a backup) and then re-importing it. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

This processing could be related to server-side operations or configurations. In Thunderbird, such messages usually indicate that the mail server is performing some tasks on your account before it can deliver the messages to your client. This can sometimes take time, especially if there's a backlog of emails. To resolve this, I'd recommend trying a few steps. First, ensure that your Thunderbird is updated to the latest version. Then, check your email account's settings, especially the server settings. If the issue persists, you might want to consider contacting Comcast's support to inquire about any ongoing server-side maintenance or issues. Additionally, you can try accessing your email through Comcast's webmail to see if the issue is Thunderbird-specific. Lastly, you might need to be patient and let the server processing complete, especially if there's a large amount of mail to process. It's frustrating, but sometimes these situations can take a bit of time. Good luck, and I hope your email access gets back to normal soon! </p>",suram080,false,0,1

To make the space between ""From,"" ""To,"" and ""Subject"" smaller in Thunderbird, you can use a little custom CSS magic.

Search for ""layout.css.devPixelsPerPx"" and set it to a smaller value, like ""1.0"" or ""0.9"", depending on your preference.

The PC came with Akamai software installed which I found evil, stopping me from getting any work done.  When I tried to delete it, it resisted strenuously and it took me ages to be able to click on the appropriate Microsoft options - Akamai have the ability to blanket the screen denying access to everything with a blanket which cannot be minimised, cancelled or anything else - but I went on and on and eventually it disappeared from my list of applications and everywhere else on my PC whereupon Microsoft took it upon itself to instal its software.  However, every now and again I get a popup saying that I need protection against websites from the Akamai software so it is possible that Akamai have left a virus behind that seeks to deny me access to websites I need to access.  I think this is unlikely.  As I said before, I do have web access to Microsoft email up in parallel so I have access to at least some part of the Microsoft email infrastructure at the point of failure. I do not know what the error message is referring to - what is trying to access what and failing? </p>",daedulus,false,0,0
