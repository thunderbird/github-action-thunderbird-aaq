Sorry it too k me a while to reply – now I’m retired I’m spending a lot less time glued to a computer in the daytime! I guess the best way to respond is interspersed, same as you did to me. I’ve used bold for my latest set of additions.</strong> </p><p><em>re I also deleted and reinstalled Thunderbird, because I wanted to change its install location.</em> </p><p>I'm presuming you only deleted the program, so you could install it into a different 'custom' directory and not the default. But that would not have effected anything to do with your profile. </p><p><strong>You are correct about the reason for the reinstallation. I have a separate hard disk (D:) for programs and my Thunderbird installation was in the default directory so I wanted to move it there. However, I’m sorry but I misled you, by unforgivably sloppy use of language, about how I did it. I didn’t just delete the program, I did a proper uninstall.</strong> </p><p>Q - Did you reinstall the same identical version of Thunderbird which you were previously using&nbsp;? </p><p><strong>I doubt it. What I mean is, the installer exe I used for the installation I removed was pretty old. I can’t be specific because I have deleted it now. I guess that installation will have been upgraded periodically, so the net result probably was up to date, technically speaking. But to reinstall Thunderbird I downloaded and used the very latest version of the installer. So even if the reinstalled version was identical in principle to the version I uninstalled, I doubt it will have been an identical installation. If you see what I mean.</strong> </p><p>Q But did you mean you also wanted to move the profile data itself to a new storage location? </p><p><strong>Well, I’ll be honest, I don’t understand much about what a “profile” entails. Ideally yes, I’d have moved the profile data to a new location too, because I have another separate hard disk (E:) specifically for data. I like to try and keep my C: drive confined to Windows as far as possible. But the installer doesn’t give any options with respect to where the profile data should live, and I don’t know if it’s possible to relocate it, or if so how. So what I believe happened is my original profile was deleted when I uninstalled the original installation, and was recreated (presumably in the same default location) when I reinstalled.</strong> </p><p><em>re: I managed to recreate my four accounts without any difficulty,</em> </p><p>If you merely reinstalled the program then it would have started up and hooked up to the original profile data, thus meaning you did not recreate any accounts. Q Did this occur? </p><p><strong>No, I recreated the accounts, same way as I did when I originally installed. The reinstalled Thunderbird didn’t hook up to any original profile data. Like I say, I assume(d) the original profile would have been deleted when the program was uninstalled.</strong> </p><p>However, if you actually move the 'profile name' folder to another location.... Q Did you do this: Start Thunderbird, create a new profile and pointing it to look at the old profile - this would have updated the 'profiles,ini' file, so the new installed Thunderbird would know where to find the new location of original profile. Q Or this: Did Thunderbird start with a new profile, so you created the mail accounts again and then went into the Account Settings - Local directory and pointed the account to look in a different folder&nbsp;? </p><p><strong>Neither of the above. I didn’t create a new profile and point it to look at the old profile (I wouldn’t know how). Thunderbird started with a new profile, as I understand it; I recreated the mail accounts, but I didn’t do anything about pointing anything to look anywhere else.</strong> </p><p>re Address Books: In Address Book Q: Have you lost visibility of any actual address books? Q: Do you only use 'Personal Address Book' and 'Collected Addresses'? </p><p><strong>I’m not sure if I’ve lost visibility of any actual address books. Not a very helpful answer I’m afraid. I did a bit of experimentation last year with creating one or two new ones, but I think I may have deleted them again because something about them wasn’t working like I expected. What I actually wanted was lists of names in a group i.e. mailing lists. I think I made two mailing lists instead but I didn’t need to use them yet. What I actually see now, under Address Books from the menu, as well as the two you mentioned, is four more all called just Address Book. I believe these four are there because when I recreated my four accounts, Thunderbird asked me each time (something like) if I wanted to link to an existing address book it had found, and it seemed like the sensible answer was yes. They are all empty. Apart from them, yes, I only use Personal Address Book and Collected Addresses. And to say  I use them is a bit of an exaggeration; from my perspective, address books just live in the background and take care of themselves, without any input from me. In particular, I don’t understand how or why addresses get into one or the other of Personal Address Book or Collected Addresses; I only recall ever editing existing entries, not adding them. It was only when I started to compose emails after reinstallation, and started to type names that I expected to auto-complete and didn’t, that I had a look at the address books and found lots of missing entries.</strong> </p><p>Q: Is it only contacts that are missing? Q: What is the name of the address book that has missing contacts? </p><p><strong>When you say only contacts ... you mean, as opposed to mailing lists? No, I think there are mailing lists missing too. But only if a mailing list is a line item in an address book. I can't remember if that is the case, or if it is an object in its own right under Address Books from the menu, like an address book.</strong> </p><p><strong>Personal Address Book now has no contacts in it at all. Collected Addresses has 39 contacts; I couldn’t say how many were in it for the old installation, but I’m guessing two or three hundred at least.</strong> </p>",spargeus.maximus,false,1,0

Hence the 'real time protection' is getting very much involved on downloaded files and when files are opened and updated. </p><p>Scanning emails is not as helpful as you may imagine because Thunderbird by default does not allow remote content unless you choose to allow it. Thunderbird will not auto open any attachment. You should never open anything or click on anything just because you are curious what it is. Only open attachments which you know who sent it and that it is legit.  Emails are not really the problem, but allowing remote content and opening attachments can be. Neither of these occur by default. Only by an action by you. </p><p><br> If an Anti-Virus ever wants to 'fix' anything to do with a thunderbird file then do not allow the fix because it is likely the Anti-Virus will mess up your emails. If you use AV then set up instruction to 'ask' you what to do, so you can stop the fix and sort out the problem yourself.  Anti-Virus products do not understand that all downloaded emails are stores in a text file, so one file has many emails. If it fixes a file then you may lose emails. </p><p><br> As you say ""If I disable the realtime protection in Windows Defender I have no problems."", so you know what is causing the issue and I can assure you this is a long standing problem when it comes to Anti-Virus products. </p><p>Microsft says ""While real-time protection is off, <strong>files you open or download</strong> won't be scanned for threats."" </p><p>Suggest you first try this - make the Thunderbird profile folders are exempt from scanning.
