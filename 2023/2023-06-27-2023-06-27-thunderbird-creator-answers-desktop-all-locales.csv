After trying a lot of different filter words, I finally deleted all the filters in Thunderbird. Then created one filter at a time.

For at least 4 months I've been experiencing issues while using Thunderbird.  It started when a couple more file folders were added, (Not by me), to the ""Folders Group"" under my email address.  Those folders that were added are:  ""JUNK ITEMS"" and ""DELETED ITEMS"".  The only folders I've ever used were the ones that were installed in the beginning many years ago.  They simply read: ""JUNK"" and ""DELETE"".  Yes, I've always updated whenever an update became available. </p><p>I cannot remove the Junk items or the Delete folders from the folder file.  When I attempt to do so, I receive the message which states: ""The following process failed. Messages cannot be ""RENAMED""!  This happens even though I selected the ""Delete Tab"" from the drop-down menu, even though I selected the ""DELETE"" option. To add to all of this now every time I open the Thunderbird program to check my e-mail, it loads those very slowly.  When it's completed the downloads, and I start selecting e-mails to view, I may get through 2 or 3 and they suddenly ""disappear"" from the inbox list.  If I wait for about a minute or less, they suddenly re-appear. </p><p>Another issue is this occurs often while I'm trying to view the remaining e-mails, AND at times some of the e-mails I have ""DELETED"" suddenly re-appear from the ""TRASH FOLDER""!  I have un-installed and re-installed the Thunderbird program without any changes to the issues. </p><p>If I knew how to SAVE all of my e-mails that I keep, and do a ""Restore"" operation without loosing my e-mail files, I'd do that.  I'm currently running Windows 10 on an HP ENVY 700 Series PC and have Centurylink for my ISP. </p><p>Is there anyone who can help me identify what is causing all these issues with Thunderbird?  I would really appreciate any suggestions or help with solving those problems!
