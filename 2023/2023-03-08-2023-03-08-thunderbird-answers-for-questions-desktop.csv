The receiving server checked and discovered that the email id of sender was in conflict with the host email provider and suspected as spam. Proper settings of DKIM and SPF records at the email host are needed to authenticate the email id. This can not be fixed with Thunderbird. </p>,davidsk,false,2,0

The world has plenty of people keeping tons of ancient emails and images that are of no consequence. </p><p>I can understand keeping some emails that may be important.  Examples: </p> <ul><li> confirmations of orders placed online because if something goes wrong with whatever was purchased there may be a vaild warranty on the item. The order email would help to prove when you purchased the item. </li><li> Email from a relative mentioning information about a birth, marriage or death or a similar importance. It might prove to helpful to retain such information. </li><li> Emails that contained helpful information on solving a problem - you never know when you might need it again&nbsp;:) </li><li> Maybe a business would keep good documentation - customers - sales etc </li></ul> <p>But why do people keep dozens of emails that are just general chit chat, especially if they are more than 3 years old. It's just consuming space.  It's likely you could have emails a decade old and will never need them.  If any one sends me a lovely image as an attachment - do I really need to save it after viewing it?  If it is a family member then perhaps save it somewhere suitable on computer and then delete the attachment. </p><p>There is healthy sense of freedom and control when you delete old stuff that you know is not important and then compact the folder to remove all the old traces. You gain so much space and things can work a lot more efficiently in some cases. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

These are not Default Folders; but Folders I have created for Storage; but some are duplicated that I did not do. When I try to delete them, they just return as they were. My Thunderbird Data is in Dropbox, so, perhaps it is Dropbox that is returning them. Maybe, I shall look in Dropbox WebSite and see if deleting them from there has an Effect, that is, if I can find them. </p>",howdee,false,0,0

It seems that on Linux Thunderbird may use ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs provided by <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_user_directories"" rel=""nofollow"">xdg-user-dirs-update</a> to determine whether/where new folders are created on startup. Installing this package and in particular setting XDG_DESKTOP_DIR=""$HOME/Desktop"", XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=""$HOME/downloads"" (the actually directory I use for downloads on my system) appears to have prevented Thunderbird from creating ~/Desktop, ~/Downloads. </p>",piperfw,false,0,0
