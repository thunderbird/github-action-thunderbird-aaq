And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Was there more to this?  Probably!  Like if they need to extend the timeout period,  they need to get rid of the antivirus product that is slowing their system for no security return.  </p><p>It is actually quite rare for an update in Thunderbird to affect the ability to send.  The exception being servers using encryption that has been obsolete for most of the last two decades,  and they are still out there.  </p><p>As Thunderbird has not in the last year or so disabled any obsolete/broken  encryption  then everyone should be looking outside of Thunderbird for the cause, despite the symptom being observed there.  For windows users, and increasingly Mac users the most common failure point is the antivirus and the software firewall it installed with it.  One blocks the account setup wizard and the latter blocks this new unknown program for any access to the internet.  It has to protect you. </p><p>Then most of these antivirus products use self signed certificates to hack your encrypted connections to do their scanning.  It is essentially a man in the middle hack.  But it is a delicate house of cards and as soon as something changes it is just as likely to just break something.  Like getting or sending mail. </p><p>As these self signed certificates are unknown to the chain of trust used in the wider internet they have to be added manually to the certificate store in Thunderbird or connections simply fail.  So any connection using SSL/TLS or STARTTLS is susceptible to the self signed certificate messing up the connection. </p><p>Personally I just do not do any email scanning using only windows defender.  It works for me and I do not have to put up with the regular collapse of some mail function caused by the third party antivirus products. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
