That is, your data may still be there, but in an older profile. Profiles are stored in c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles folder. One way to review that (other than with windows file explorer), is to click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles.' The next pane should show available profiles. I don't know if you can just select and go with another profile, or whether you need to extract data, but look first and see what's there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

Any post that is NOT seeking help in using Thunderbird as it exists. We are volunteers here to assist in using Thunderbird, not in developing new features or fixing features. There are developers for that and there are other forums for that. Yes, it would be nice to have the menu bar on top. Yes, it would be nice to have a global reset to threading. Yes, it would be nice to not need CSS for some custom features. But that is what is there. Telling us is wasting everyone's time. Public input is always welcome, but please use the proper forum.
