The basic process is a simple copy of the profiles to a USB drive.  This is followed by burning the copied profiles to DVD for off-site storage. </p><p>I have recently encountered a problem with burning the profiles to DVD because a number of files which have no name have begun to appear in the profiles.  My burning software ignores these files, and subsequent validation shows them as missing from the DVD. </p><p>I have found two such files that appear in some of the profiles.  These are "".startup-incomplete"" in the profile folder and "".metadata-v2"" in the profiles ""\storage\permanent\chrome"" sub-folder. </p><p>I have been unable to find any information about what role these files play.  I suspect that they may be irrelevant in the case a recovery from backup is required.  (I.e. they would be recreated if missing.)  In this case I could simply skip including them in the backup.  But knowing there purpose would make me more confident in this assumption. </p><p>Thanks for any insights about these files or their purpose. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1591011;1591116;,scitec

I have a dozen email accounts, and previously all accounts shared a common inbox, etc.  When I create an account now, it seems the process forces the creation of a new folder, outside of Local, and then allows you to change some of the folder choices, but doesn't seem to allow me to move the whole account back under Local. </p><p>Whenever I try to search for help on this topic I seem to get unrelated help so perhaps I am not wording the search correctly? </p><p>Thanks, Lew </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1590996;,lew3
