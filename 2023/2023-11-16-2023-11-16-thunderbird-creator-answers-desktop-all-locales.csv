However it still takes much longer to start up than previous versions to 115. </p><p>I still have the issues that I posted about: - Inbox displays incorrect number of messages - Issues with forwarded messages that also happen when using Unified folders. So I dont use Unified folders. </p><p>I now also have the issues (that I have not posted about): - Sometimes TB shows an empty message with a date of year 1969 - Sometimes when I compose a new message, which opens a new window, and then I switch out of that window back to the window that has Thunderbird in it, the new message window just disappears, along with the contents I have typed into it. Poof. </p><p>With TB pre-115, I always felt it was stable and reliable and had few issues over the years. </p><p>With 115 I now feel there are many issues, that I dont have time to dig into, or post about. </p><p>If I am using Firefox and I click ""Email a link of this page"" in TB, first the main TB application opens, and then a new separate window opens with a new message that contains the info of this page. In previous versions, the main TB application did not first open, just a TB new message window would open. This was much faster than what 115 does. </p><p>I have a number of email accounts in TB and I cannot use Unified folders, so I have to check the Inbox and other folders of each account separately. </p><p>I would install the Unified Folders Debugging 115.3 addon but I noticed it gives a warning before install that says it will have access to my whole computer, and my company's security policy will not allow installing based on this warning. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",hiker11
