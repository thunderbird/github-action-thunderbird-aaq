However it still takes much longer to start up than previous versions to 115. </p><p>I still have the issues that I posted about: - Inbox displays incorrect number of messages - Issues with forwarded messages that also happen when using Unified folders. So I dont use Unified folders. </p><p>I now also have the issues (that I have not posted about): - Sometimes TB shows an empty message with a date of year 1969 - Sometimes when I compose a new message, which opens a new window, and then I switch out of that window back to the window that has Thunderbird in it, the new message window just disappears, along with the contents I have typed into it. Poof. </p><p>With TB pre-115, I always felt it was stable and reliable and had few issues over the years. </p><p>With 115 I now feel there are many issues, that I dont have time to dig into, or post about. </p><p>If I am using Firefox and I click ""Email a link of this page"" in TB, first the main TB application opens, and then a new separate window opens with a new message that contains the info of this page. In previous versions, the main TB application did not first open, just a TB new message window would open. This was much faster than what 115 does. </p><p>I have a number of email accounts in TB and I cannot use Unified folders, so I have to check the Inbox and other folders of each account separately. </p><p>I would install the Unified Folders Debugging 115.3 addon but I noticed it gives a warning before install that says it will have access to my whole computer, and my company's security policy will not allow installing based on this warning. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",hiker11

They are transferring us to a messenger service.  It's not supposed to happen  for a while but my IINET emails have stopped working and IINET are blaming Thunderbird (for which they have (no control). Receiving 'help' today, I have now lost my Inbox of emails but my main concern that my folders (on the side) have not been migrated nor does anyone from either organisation know how to affect this! Over the past 6 weeks sending, relying or forwarding emails has been haphazard as to the ability to do any of those. Any ideas how to right the ship?
