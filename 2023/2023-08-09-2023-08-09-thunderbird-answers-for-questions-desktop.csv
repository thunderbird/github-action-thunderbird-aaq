Our prior problem was in having one problem to focus on. You mention having multiple accounts, but only one shows. And you mention that Google prompts for a password and says it is incorrect. I think you indicated four accounts?  </p><p>First, please review and confirm that there are an equal number of SMTP servers for each account and that each account's SMTP server is unique (both using same email id). The authorization code must be OAUTH2 for both. Connection security should be SSL/TLS for both. Incoming port 993 and SMTP port 465. Second, please post a screenshot of the incoming server setup and the SMTP server setup of the account that is giving password problem. We don't need to see the email address, so long as you are using the full address (e.g., karl@gmail.com, not just karl).  Third, please review settings&gt;privacy and security. Click savedpasswords and then showpasswords. Since the gmail accounts are not working, I suggest you highlight all rows of gmail accounts and delete them. That will reset TB so that future attempts for gmail retrieval will prompt for the password.  That should give a head start. I regret that this has taken so long. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
