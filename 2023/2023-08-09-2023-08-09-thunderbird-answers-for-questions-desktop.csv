Temporarily, the WIN 7 PC is set up on the dining room table, so I have to go forth &amp; back when dealing with this issue.  Second, I opened Account Settings and Settings on this WIN 7 PC, jotted down all the particular settings.  Everyone for all 4 e-mail addresses is exactly the same, EXCEPT for the actual e-mail address &amp; the name assigned to the accounts.  They are all OAuth2, all 995, all SSL/TLS, all SMTP port 465.  Then I went to the WIN 10 PC, and opened the Settings and Account Settings.  All these settings are IDENTICAL to the list I made from the 7 PC. </pre> <p>So, thinking that there may be a file corruption somewhere in the Thunderbird folder, I went to CCLEANER, used their 'Uninstall' utility, and uninstalled Thunderbird.  Then I opened FIREFOX, got the link for THUNDERBIRD download and processed it to completion. I opened THUNDERBIRD, immediately got the Google sign-in screen overlaying the Thunderbird page.  My kombi17m showed in their box.  Again I typed in the password, as I have done numerous times before, and the screen changed to a Google alert notice that Thunderbird was attempting to access my Gmail account. I clicked OK, and the Thunderbird 'home' page showed. </p><pre> However, despite this seeming to be normal, I noticed in the left side column, now I have TWO incidences of the 17mkombi address, so this is one more aggravation.  I found no place in the Settings or Account Settings where I can delete one of these.  Furthermore, my other 3 e-mail addresses are not showing.  As a final test/check, I opened the Settings &amp; Account Settings for the 17mkombi on the Win 10 PC for the purpose of checking and comparing the connection settings with my list.  All of them are exactly identical to the list I made from the 7 PC.    So, while the issue with the connection seems to be magically solved, the only remaining problem seems to be WHY the other 3 accounts are not showing properly.  I believe I have it written down someplace the U.S. mailing address for MOZILLA.  After all of these exchanges over a period of several months, it's time for me to send a check in thanks for the assistance. </pre> <p>This is the right thing to do. THANK YOU!!!! k.t. P.S.  I didn't try to make screen copies to send to you since these exchanges are being done on the WIN 7 PC, and I would have to do a screen shot on the 10, then save the file, put it on a thumb drive, bring it here, and attach it to one of these exchanges.  VERY laborious in my opinion. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0

I'm in a suburb of Tampa, FL; you're located somewhere else far from here. I understand this.  Despite my long career in computer technology &amp; programming, WINDOWS has always been an enigma to me ever since MICROSOFT flooded the PC market with free copies of Windows 3.1 back in the early 1980s.  OK, so all this aside, please also understand a couple other basic points.  On this WIN 7 PC, I have NO problems automatically opening my 4 e-mail accounts WITHOUT having to enter any passwords while using  </pre> <p>T-BIRD (102. ....).  I can also go directly to the Google/Gmail software (through FIREFOX) to clear out the Sent e-mails, since on some of my four addresses, they are not automatically deleted, and so I do this manually.  WHY this is the case, I have no idea ... all my addresses were set up as POP3 accounts, and according to the setup data, all of them have exactly the same SMTP in &amp; out settings. </p><pre> When I downloaded THUNDERBIRD onto the WIN 10 PC, I went to the address setup screen, and entered all the data exactly as it appears for the 17mkombi address as it appeared in the WIN 7 setup.  I did exactly what you suggested several e-mails ago ... I COPY the Thunderbird folder on this WIN 7 PC to a thumb drive (it is about 5 GB size), and then I COPY the file on the thumb drive to the THUNDERBIRD folder on the WIN 10 PC.  While I do not fully understand all these protocol acronyms, I will write down your most recent instructions, go to the WIN 10 PC, and validate that the date present there is EXACTLY what you have defined above.  I assume that when you ask for screen shots, you're speaking about the existing ones that are here on the WIN 7 PC, or mot?  You might have to explain this more clearly. </pre> <p>THANK YOU. k.t. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0

Our prior problem was in having one problem to focus on. You mention having multiple accounts, but only one shows. And you mention that Google prompts for a password and says it is incorrect. I think you indicated four accounts?  </p><p>First, please review and confirm that there are an equal number of SMTP servers for each account and that each account's SMTP server is unique (both using same email id). The authorization code must be OAUTH2 for both. Connection security should be SSL/TLS for both. Incoming port 993 and SMTP port 465. Second, please post a screenshot of the incoming server setup and the SMTP server setup of the account that is giving password problem. We don't need to see the email address, so long as you are using the full address (e.g., karl@gmail.com, not just karl).  Third, please review settings&gt;privacy and security. Click savedpasswords and then showpasswords. Since the gmail accounts are not working, I suggest you highlight all rows of gmail accounts and delete them. That will reset TB so that future attempts for gmail retrieval will prompt for the password.  That should give a head start. I regret that this has taken so long. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
