The concern was how much data was being consumed. The iPhone shows that a massive amout of data is being used up by the email accounts. This is why I'm trying to find out if all of the emails are refreshed (Downloaded again) or if it's just the new emails that are added. I know that it's only the header info of the email that is shown until it's clicked on. </p><p>The accounts are set to fetch at 15 minute intervals.

My thought on that is that Gmail offers settings that create duplicate views, causing lots of storage to be used. IMAP accounts don't respond to control from email clients well, and most show incoming messages immediately, regardless of the setting for periodic checks. On your question, the data is downloaded depending on your synchronization&amp;storage settings. If you specify all messages locally, then you will experience a degree of downloading as Thunderbird verifies at startup that all messages are, indeed, locally available. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It went through many changes between versions 50 and 90 hence those other add-ons I mentioned that I have not used for a year or two.  </p><p>The reason I mentioned google contacts was because I found previously that the synchronization was only in one direction Google contacts to Thunderbird.  I also found previously that once a contact had been added, by adding a label to it then it could be edited in Thunderbird and that change would synchronize back to google contacts.  Now I find that what had been working until early this year does not work now.  </p><p>Therefore should I delete my google address book in Thunderbird and create another or is there an issue with either Google or Thunderbird that I need to wait a bit longer for it to be resolved?  I think the issue had arisen in mid summer this year. </p>",a.h.lohmann,false,0,0

In any case, when managing contacts within a browser at <a href=""http://contacts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">contacts.google.com</a> make sure contacts are part of the 'Contacts' group (for lack of a better term).

There is one new contact I added in the summer, it is in the contact group as you call it, that occurs when I apply a label. </p><p>So I created a new CardDAV address book using my same email@gmail.com address (this is not it obviously) and two address books were created (I amended there names slightly because they were both the same ""address book"").  Anyway having left it a short period and looked again I think all my contacts have been loaded including the new one I added this summer. </p><p>Things are not perfect though because the labels in google contacts which show as lists in Thunderbird have not been passed across.  So the new address book is just one big list rather than many lists. </p><p>Both new address books properties look the same I guess they are not though because one of them is empty.  So I will set up all my instances of Thunderbird this way and remove the old address books in due cause unless something arises? </p><p>I shall look at this again tomorrow and if it still seems okay I shall mark the support request solved.

Does it matter?? </blockquote>  <p>Given that  Thunderbird is a product of the Thunderbird project with paid developers employed by Mzla and Firefox being a completely different project with paid employees, employed by either the Mozilla Foundation or the Mozilla company (On is a US not for profit,  the other is not). Yes, it does make a difference.  Almost as much difference as if you  were over at Ford asking about warranty procedures for your Hyundai. </p> <blockquote> I apologise if I don't meet your standards to qualify as a donor. </blockquote> <p>This is the technical support forum for supporting Thunderbird.  By definition it is a peer support forum.  So no one here works for Mzla and no one here has any special information on how the corporate donation process works.  It has nothing to do with your ability or qualification as a donor and everything about which corporation you are asking about! </p><p>There is a frequently asked questions link on the donations page to <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/#faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/#faq</a> </p><p>This link includes the frequently asked question </p> <blockquote>Who can I email directly with questions about giving?  </blockquote> <p>Which includes in it's answer  </p> <blockquote> If you have a question about giving to Thunderbird, please contact us via this form</blockquote>with the form word linking to this page. <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/help/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/help/</a> <p>The donations page also has a link to the same page under ""contact us"" beside the frequently asked questions page. </p><p>Then we get to the specifics of your question.  You can not donate online with cash and any other form of donation is going to require you to identify yourself to the service sufficiently for the financial transaction to complete.  The legal requirements for various international financial transactions vary based on the place at which you are making the donation and the point at which the receiver is located.  Those donating from many countries in the world are required to leave sufficient information for their national financial tracking police to follow your every action.  Others like PayPal have additional requirement that they impose due to jurisdictional issues as well as them being satisfied you are who you say you are to undertake transaction on that account. </p><p>Why do you have to provide what ever information you were asked for,  I have no idea.  I do not even know what information you were asked for.  Discussing the specifics of what was requested in a public forum such as this appears to me to be counter to your stated aim of anonymity.  Perhaps take your query to an email basis which is clearly where any reply to the contact form will be directed so your privacy is not further eroded by a discussion that by it's very nature is going to become more intrusive, not less. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,1

The issue is that it should not be this hard to make a donation, and I shouldn't be put through the ringer with all the personal info questions. I mentioned that Wikipedia doesn't hassle people for their info, so why can they treat their clients/customers with 'respect' but you guys can't? </p><p>You say that less than 2% donate to Thunderbird, and I really believe this is a major reason - but I guess Thunderbird isn't interested. </p><p>Finally, I don't use checks, haven't for about 30 years - once again, <em><strong>it shouldn't be this hard to donate....!</strong></em> </p>",minkwa1,false,0,1
