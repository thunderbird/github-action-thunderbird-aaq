Changing the bitness of Thunderbird is really a rather pointless exercise as the same source code is used to make both versions and making the change causes the profile per install to kick in an loose your existing profile. </p><p>Beside the <strong>+ New Message</strong> you should see three ...  clicking that shows a menu.

My thought on that is that Gmail offers settings that create duplicate views, causing lots of storage to be used. IMAP accounts don't respond to control from email clients well, and most show incoming messages immediately, regardless of the setting for periodic checks. On your question, the data is downloaded depending on your synchronization&amp;storage settings. If you specify all messages locally, then you will experience a degree of downloading as Thunderbird verifies at startup that all messages are, indeed, locally available. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The one that sets it to star should also set to unstar. My suggestion is to run that filter twice, first to verify that it stars a message and then run a second time. My hope is that, since it is confirmed to star, that it will also unstar. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
