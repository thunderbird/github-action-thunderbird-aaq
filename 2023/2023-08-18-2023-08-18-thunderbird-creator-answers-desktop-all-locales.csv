1421532,2023-08-18 05:50:55 -0700,2023-08-18 05:50:55 -0700,New Window,<p>I had to reinstall Win 10 and obviously Tbird after that. Without knowing about it the latest version differs in some ways to the 'old'. I now face a problem with the display. The upper part of the window lists all the mails as usual and the open mail in the screen section below that. Only problem is that i cannot reduce the number of messages displayed in the upper screen section so have 7 instead of the previous 4 messages. Al in all this has reduced the visibility of the actual mail being read considerably. Try as i might i cannot find out how to be able to modify. Previously one could expand or reduce the size of the upper screen section. Can anyone please teach me how to adjust the screen? Thank you john ccombes </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",johnc48
