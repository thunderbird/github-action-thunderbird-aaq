I have 2 gmail accounts and one comcast account on it.  I also have many subfolders with saved emails in them.  Just now, I opened up Thunderbird, and every account shows a magnifying glass with an x in the middle, saying no results.  This is true with every folder I open. Intresting, on the left, the inboxes for each email shouls new emails waiting to be opened.  I have opened up my gmail web site, and my emails are there.   Any help would be appreciated.
