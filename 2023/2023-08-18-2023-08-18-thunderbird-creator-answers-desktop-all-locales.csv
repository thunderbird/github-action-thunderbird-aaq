I have been asked by Microsoft Support to contact Thunderbird to resolve a recurrent error in the POP connection. At unpredictable times, Thunderbird stops downloading messages with error message Server Unavailable 21. Microsoft finds their systems run properly and they think it is a Thunderbird problem. The error is also described on Reddit by other users. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",norman.schuerhoff

I have 2 gmail accounts and one comcast account on it.  I also have many subfolders with saved emails in them.  Just now, I opened up Thunderbird, and every account shows a magnifying glass with an x in the middle, saying no results.  This is true with every folder I open. Intresting, on the left, the inboxes for each email shouls new emails waiting to be opened.  I have opened up my gmail web site, and my emails are there.   Any help would be appreciated.
