Utilizzo il vostro client mail thunderbird da tantissimo tempo nelle altre verisioni e sempre su windows anche in versioni precedenti, e non ho mai avuto problemi. Recentemente ho voluto installare questa Vs. nuova versione, sul mio PC con Windows 11 ma ho riscontrato frequenti crash. Inoltre mentre lo si utilizza spesso si blocca e si mette in una fase di ""NON RISPONDE"" non acctta più alcun comando e devo pertanto riavviare il PC. Potreste dirmi se questa versione presenta dei problemi? in tal caso ritorno alla versione cprecedente che funzionava benissimo.

Without knowing about it the latest version differs in some ways to the 'old'. I now face a problem with the display. The upper part of the window lists all the mails as usual and the open mail in the screen section below that. Only problem is that i cannot reduce the number of messages displayed in the upper screen section so have 7 instead of the previous 4 messages. Al in all this has reduced the visibility of the actual mail being read considerably. Try as i might i cannot find out how to be able to modify. Previously one could expand or reduce the size of the upper screen section. Can anyone please teach me how to adjust the screen?
