Utilizzo il vostro client mail thunderbird da tantissimo tempo nelle altre verisioni e sempre su windows anche in versioni precedenti, e non ho mai avuto problemi. Recentemente ho voluto installare questa Vs. nuova versione, sul mio PC con Windows 11 ma ho riscontrato frequenti crash. Inoltre mentre lo si utilizza spesso si blocca e si mette in una fase di ""NON RISPONDE"" non acctta più alcun comando e devo pertanto riavviare il PC. Potreste dirmi se questa versione presenta dei problemi? in tal caso ritorno alla versione cprecedente che funzionava benissimo.

Per uso personale ho installato anche Thunderbird 102.14.0 (32 bit), con cui mi trovo benissimo da anni, ma..... mentre la risoluzione sul video del PC è PERFETTA, quella del Philips è tutta sgranata. Anche cambiando la risoluzione del Philips non risolvo il problema. Se faccio un ""cattura schermo"" noterete, come potrete vedere dal file che allego, che l'immagine catturata viene perfetta&nbsp;! Ma...... facendo una foto col cellulare (vedi file allegato) potete vedere come IO vedo nella realtà il programma.

Then at the bottom of the screen it said: Downloading xx emails, but nothing went to the Inbox. These are my attempts after googling the issue: - I tried deleting the .msf files from the Profile, that failed. - I deleted the Local Folders an replaced it with the last working one from Time machine, that failed. - I have deleted the Inbox and Inbox.msf (after moving the contents in a temp. sub folder), but so far there is nothing in the new Inbox. - I deleted the Profile and replaced it with the last working one from Time Machine (16.8.23). The Inbox was repopulated but the missing emails are still missing, and also the ones which should have downloaded from the webmail I have used since. I have a Macbook Air M2 (Ventura 13.5), and TB is up to date (v. 115.1.1.) Thank you. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",gfinley

Without knowing about it the latest version differs in some ways to the 'old'. I now face a problem with the display. The upper part of the window lists all the mails as usual and the open mail in the screen section below that. Only problem is that i cannot reduce the number of messages displayed in the upper screen section so have 7 instead of the previous 4 messages. Al in all this has reduced the visibility of the actual mail being read considerably. Try as i might i cannot find out how to be able to modify. Previously one could expand or reduce the size of the upper screen section. Can anyone please teach me how to adjust the screen? Thank you john ccombes </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",johnc48
