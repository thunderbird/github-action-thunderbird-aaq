Left to its default, it will download all messages that this copy of Thunderbird has not downloaded.

It relates to creating changes that require having pre- knowledge and knowing multiple steps to find accessible functions. The need to do multiple steps for every folder is the barrier. If there was a one-step process for each folder, that would likely be in compliance. The critical part is the solution is not obvious. One needs to know that the solution is in the View part of the Menu options, then Sort By (when the Threads option looks obvious but does not lead to a solution) then finally Unthread.  To start the whole process, one must KNOW, Have preknowledge, that those three short horizontal bars as an icon lead to a Menu. WCAG requires the solution to have an obvious path. A right click on a folder with Threading options would be appropriate. Instead, the options are divided into may different multi-step paths.  WCAG requires an option for ""Text under an Icon"". Not just ""Hover and text will show up"" Many have no idea that those three short horizontal bars mean anything. Mozilla deleted these options about 4 or 5 years ago.   We have a large population of ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, who may be literal thinkers and others who have inabilities to memorize processes that are not obvious or an inability to translate Icons into a text based concept.  These fancy threading functions should be the options, not the default. </p>",MarkinIdaho,false,0,0
