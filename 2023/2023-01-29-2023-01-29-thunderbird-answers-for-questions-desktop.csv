Thunderbird will connect 5 times and this can be reduced, or increased, in server settings &gt; advanced.

Now I had a typo in the word Repair,  so perhaps look for that. </p><p>If you want to make your life simpler,  dump the proton stuff.  It really offers almost nothing, and costs you money.  I suggest you ask yourself exactly what it is that proton provides you for the inconvenience of not having a permanent local copy to work with.   </p><p>Thunderbird offers native (PGP and s/Mime) E2ee encryption.  Even folk like google offer end to end encryption of connections.  In my view Proton offers to send links to your contacts for which you have no encryption keys offering them a chance to read your encrypted email on the proton web site, hence they claim everything is encrypted. </p><p>See like so many you automatically want to disable compacting as if that is somehow going to do anything.  Except make you file do nothing but grow.  If the problem appears after compacting it is usually because something else is a problem. As compacting only copies what is there in the file showing as undeleted to a new file, replaces the original and hence all the previously deleted mail there is not really much chance for Thunderbird to mess it up.  It has happened in the past,  but rarely.   Finally it reindexes the messages, exactly as the repair button does. </p><p>What is often the issue,  especially on systems that are out of support is the anti virus installed is aggressive and prevents Thunderbird accessing it's files as necessary.  Try disabling the anti virus ability to scan in the Thunderbird profile folder,  before even looking at compacting. </p><p>What is also probably relevant is as the bridge really only caches the mail locally. (it may actually only exist in the Thunderbird cache if having local storage is disabled, then every time you start and connect all the relevant mail is fetched again, so all of Thunderbird's local storage and local indexes used to search and sort mail are having to be rebuilt over and over  Personally  I will stick to suggesting ask your self why you are using proton in the first place.
