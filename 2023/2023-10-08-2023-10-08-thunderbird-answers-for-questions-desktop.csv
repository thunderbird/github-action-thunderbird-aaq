IMAP folders tend to loose their content when Thunderbird can not synchronize properly with the server.  In this case the bridge.  My guess is something is wrong there.  Quite possible something to to with a firewall or antivirus as a new version of Thunderbird is involved.  They can be quite finicky about version numbers of software especially in their software firewalls.  But you might want to check the bridge is unaffected. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0
