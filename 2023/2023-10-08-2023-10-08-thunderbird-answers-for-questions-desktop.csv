But given that I keep the latest version of Firefox installed it's most likely that it has more security holes patched then the previous version of Firefox which doesn't have those holes patched.  It's a judgement call here, and there IMHO is no really right security answer. </p><p>And YES this DID solve the problem, at least for me.   </p><p>But NO, I won't be clicking the ""Did this reply solve your problem?
