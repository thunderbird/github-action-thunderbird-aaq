I even get the warning about not getting more updates until I get win10, when I look at 'about Chrome'.

Only issue is when I try to click on a hyperlink in an email, or any link under 'help' except the troubleshooting buttons an the about button. Basically anything that takes me outside Tbird. </p><p><br> BTW, I do have Firefox installed on the computer, as well as Chrome. xxxxxx Followup; I've apparently gotten stuff working.
