These are really ""windows"" and everything else builds on top of it. If you are having issues with that DLL,  it is not something that a reinstall of any software but windows will fix. </p><p>However thanks to google,  the answer is your version of chrome is not compatible with windows 7. <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1181142/google-chrome-windows-7-desktop-app-will-not-open"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1181142/google-chrome-windows-7-desktop-app-will-not-open</a> </p><p>So I suggest you move to Firefox for a while.  They will continue to support Windows 7 for a short time, although they to have announced a withdrawal of support.  I  ""think""  V115 will be the last major version of Thunderbird to support windows 7 as well,  following from the change to Firefox (they are both based on the Mozilla platform.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
