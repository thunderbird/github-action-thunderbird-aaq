Newest message dated 11/18/23, I can't dislodge the page - T'bird v115.6.0 on OS 13.6.3","<p>Hopefully nearing the end of a long saga. Used Comcast email and T'bird for many years. In November I wanted to add a new address to Comcast and that's when my troubles began - it was like quicksand: passwords, and more passwords etc. it became worse and worse and ... worse! I gave up on Comcast and opened Yahoo and iCloud email addresses and engaged Apple Mail. I've used Macs since about 1985 and used individual apps for browsing, mail, office suite etc.  I'm used to having an ""Address Book"" as part of a mail program; Apple Mail has no address book their Mail reads ""Contacts"" for an address - very nice if one is using an iPhone but not so on my desktop Mac - so I return to Thunderbird which I'm used to. We oldies single task - it's like driving 25 MPH. </p><p>Today Matt helped with the correct authentication method to get my T'bird logged on to Yahoo, now to the rest of it:  </p><p>I need to unfreeze T'bird's opening page which shows a Nov. 18 email as the newest message - I can't click the page away, only scroll to older messages. I sent myself a message today but it doesn't appear as a received message. Could the Mailbox be at capacity? I'm running T'bird v115.6.0 on Mac OS 13.6.3 and it was OK until I poked the hornets' nest. </p><p>Any thoughts are appreciated </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",return335
