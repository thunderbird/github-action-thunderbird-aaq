I would like to know that...each time I log in. I have contributed to Mozilla several times (but I have no idea when or how often). You can help me greatly by telling me ""Thanks for your contribution last July..."" and so forth. Wouldn't that be a win-win? --Eduardo Mitchell elashn@gmail.com </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",elashn

I'm still very happy because I LOVE thunderbird but for the first time ever, I can't make it work right. I know the problem is on my end but I can't seem to fix it. I am switching over from Airmail to Thunderbird and the transition has been horrible which is why I was leaving Airmail to begin with. So now I've entered all my info and it seems I successfully migrated the accounts. Unfortunately, it appears that the folder problems followed over to Thunderbird. Some of my 'airmail specific folders' are showing up in Thunderbird and it won't let me delete them. Also, the inbox seems mapped funny ... there's the regular trash can but deleted messages don't go to that folder, they go to inbox.trash - but whyyyyy?  </p><p>This is the message I just sent to airmail: I'm having the worst trouble with the folders and inbox. I reformatted my computer - iMac Desktop (2017) Sonoma 14.1.2 and everything went fine except with airmail. All my folders for my primary account are gone. The whole folder system seems corrupted or something. I'd like to be able to start over fresh but I can't seem to do that no matter how hard I try. I'm currently running the beta version (bc the regular app stopped working a loooong time ago) and it's a disaster. I currently have one icloud (hschulienlcsw@icloud.com with an alias of heatherschulien@icloud.com) account, private domain accounts (heather@heatherschulien.com and junky@heatherschulien.com) and one gmail account that is forwarded to the junky account. My icloud folders seemed to stay intact but not my others. When I tried to migrate to a new app, it brought with it all the folder problems from airmail. It appears the main problem is with the main account: heather@heatherschulien.com. </p><p>Also, how do you add 'alias' emails? Also having trouble setting up the calendars... nothing is working like it's supposed to&nbsp;:(  </p><p>I'm dying, please help me&nbsp;:) </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1626934;,hschulienlcsw@icloud.com
