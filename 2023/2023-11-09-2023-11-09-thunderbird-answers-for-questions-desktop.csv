Is it in Thunderbird settings? . If yes how. Can I revert without losing the current configuration and data? Have you stopped updates in Thunderbird so you don't get version 115.4.2 (32bit) again. Is it in Thunderbird settings? If yes how. Best regards Kenneth Winther </p>,mkwinther,false,0,0

I am now running version 102.15.1 in Thunderbird. Super nice, now I can mark many folders at a time. The only problem was that it didn't take my calendar with it. But I have now had it done manually. If version 115.4.2 will one day work so that you can select more folders, then I can update to this version: I'm not sure I'll hear about it. If you do, please write to me.

I'm looking for a ""lazy"" solution where the sync would replicate the existing folder organization on her client to the server. The folders are not local folders. I experimented using my own mail account. When I installed Thunderbird, there was only an inbox and a few other folders. My ""saved mail"" folder from my mail server was not visible in the client. Then I turned off the restriction to sync only subscribed folders and tadaa.. Al my saved mail folders appeared in Thunderbird. Then I messed a bit with it by adding and deleting folders at both ends and by moving a few mails around between folders. Every change was nicely replicated in both directions.

The ""saved mail"" folders only exist for the e-mail account in the client. The mail server has  no ""saved mail"" folder. All mails on the server are still in the inbox. <em>if sync'd, IMAP protocol will give priority to the server and delete the local messages. </em> That's what I'm afraid of. You seem to confirm that since the folders don't exist on the mail server, all folders (and their content) on the client will be deleted and the old mails will be shown in the inbox. That's what we don't want. <em>Correction: since we have some ""illegal"" situation, there's probably no way to predict what will happen to the mails themselves if the folders are deleted on the client because that folder didn't exist on the server&nbsp;???</em> <em>I am also puzzled on how she managed to set the folders up. Rightclicking an account and creating a folder puts it on the server, so she must have taken extra steps somehow.</em> Don't know how she managed to get there. I did a little experiment (on my own computer): I enabled ""sync only subscribed folders"" and re-started the mail client. Instantly the ""saved mail"" sub-folders in the client disappeared. Nothing changed on the mail server. I expected that the folder ""saved mail"" would also disappear on the client, but that didn't happen. Only the sub-folders disappeared. The I created a new (empty) folder ""TEST"". The folder then appears on the server. So, you are right that she somehow managed to organize her mails in folders on the client without replication on the mail server. But this is the situation today. As part of my experiment, I moved a mail from my inbox to the TEST folder on the server. This is instantly replicated on the client. Next I delete the TEST folder on the client. On the client, the TEST folder is moved to the recycle bin (including the mail which is in that folder). On the mail server, the same thing happens. Conclusion:  1. there seems to be  no ""lazy"" way to replicate folders created on the client back to the server, if those folders don't exist on the server. A replication attempt will remove the folders (and their content) on the client if they don't exist on the server. My friend would no longer be my friend... 2. The current situation is inconsistent with the normal behaviour of Thunderbird. Any change you make on the client is normally replicated on the server, regardless of the server setting in the client for syncing subscribed folders. 3. Check the folders properties: will have to wait. She's sick and I don't have remote access to her computer (She doesn't understand how to install TeamViewer). I tried this on my own set-up and the synced folders all have ""imap://..."" as you say. I'll come back once I've had a chance to look at this on her computer. 4. Given the current situation and the reluctance to ""manually sync"" the client folders to the server, my best option for a ""lazy"" solution is to back-up the user's profile file to Google Drive or something along that line. </p>",ghersschens,false,0,0
