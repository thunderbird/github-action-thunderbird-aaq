Is it in Thunderbird settings? . If yes how. Can I revert without losing the current configuration and data? Have you stopped updates in Thunderbird so you don't get version 115.4.2 (32bit) again. Is it in Thunderbird settings? If yes how. Best regards Kenneth Winther </p>,mkwinther,false,0,0

I am now running version 102.15.1 in Thunderbird. Super nice, now I can mark many folders at a time. The only problem was that it didn't take my calendar with it. But I have now had it done manually. If version 115.4.2 will one day work so that you can select more folders, then I can update to this version: I'm not sure I'll hear about it. If you do, please write to me.

While Density is ""Compact,""  the spacing shown for line height does change, independently, according to the CSS file's  ""px"" numbers for  Folder Tree and the threads panel / Message List.   </p><p>2. However, Bug 1 makes TB unusable, because of BUG 2:  Bug 2. When View Density is set to ""Compact"" but the Message List /Threads panel is more spacious (due to the CSS line height settings),  you can't scroll and click through a long list of messages because every time you click, TB jumps to highlight that message, but it jumps off the visible display of the Message List; apparently the program is calculating where to place the focus and highlight the clicked on message BY NOT USING THE ACTUAL LINE HEIGHT set by the CSS but some other line height (presumably based on ""Compact"" density?) </p><p>If you try to click, or scroll and select (Shift Click) several messages, you can't: they vanish off the visible display after you click 9on them.  </p><p>So TB is not usable in this condition. If scrolling, click, and focus code were aware of the line height that is actually in effect in the message list, I think things would be great.   But at present, this means you can't select, delete, etc., from a message list if it contains more than 10 or 20 messages, if you are seeking a readable line height for the list and a more compressed line height for the folder tree.

The wheel of my mouse works perfectly at any Density setting, and with any number ##px between 18 and 40 for the thread rows,  in the CSS template that you provided to me.

Clicking and selecting a message in a Message List, is my problem. The problem is: I click on message in the list (table view), and the click causes a ""jump-scroll"" movement out of the screen ""window"" with the focus and the message that I tried to click on below the bottom cut-off of the ""window"" or ""viewport"" or whatever you call the rectangle on the screen that contains the message list. So I have to scroll after clicking to go find the message I clicked on, and I can't select a group of several messages because the focus is always jumping off the screen and is crazy.  </p><p>3. This problem, #2 above, DOES NOT HAPPEN...can be made to vanish, in only two ways that I have found: </p><p>A) If there  is a userChrome.css file with a ##px value for Thread Row Height of 27 AND the View/Density is set to Default; In this case I can click, select, scroll, select many emails, early in the list, late in the list, it is all stable, predictable and acceptable).  </p><p>B) The problem also does NOT occur if one removes or renames the userChrome.css file that contains settings for row height and tree folder line height settings and Card line height settings as you provided to me.  Without those settings in useChrome.css, Density can be compact or Default or Relaxed, it all works.  </p><p>Outside of these two conditions, the problem happens, big time, and it makes  TB not usable anylonger.  </p><p><br> </p><p><br> .. </p>",kmartinp,false,0,0

I'm looking for a ""lazy"" solution where the sync would replicate the existing folder organization on her client to the server. The folders are not local folders. I experimented using my own mail account. When I installed Thunderbird, there was only an inbox and a few other folders. My ""saved mail"" folder from my mail server was not visible in the client. Then I turned off the restriction to sync only subscribed folders and tadaa.. Al my saved mail folders appeared in Thunderbird. Then I messed a bit with it by adding and deleting folders at both ends and by moving a few mails around between folders. Every change was nicely replicated in both directions.

The ""saved mail"" folders only exist for the e-mail account in the client. The mail server has  no ""saved mail"" folder. All mails on the server are still in the inbox. <em>if sync'd, IMAP protocol will give priority to the server and delete the local messages. </em> That's what I'm afraid of. You seem to confirm that since the folders don't exist on the mail server, all folders (and their content) on the client will be deleted and the old mails will be shown in the inbox. That's what we don't want. <em>Correction: since we have some ""illegal"" situation, there's probably no way to predict what will happen to the mails themselves if the folders are deleted on the client because that folder didn't exist on the server&nbsp;???</em> <em>I am also puzzled on how she managed to set the folders up. Rightclicking an account and creating a folder puts it on the server, so she must have taken extra steps somehow.</em> Don't know how she managed to get there. I did a little experiment (on my own computer): I enabled ""sync only subscribed folders"" and re-started the mail client. Instantly the ""saved mail"" sub-folders in the client disappeared. Nothing changed on the mail server. I expected that the folder ""saved mail"" would also disappear on the client, but that didn't happen. Only the sub-folders disappeared. The I created a new (empty) folder ""TEST"". The folder then appears on the server. So, you are right that she somehow managed to organize her mails in folders on the client without replication on the mail server. But this is the situation today. As part of my experiment, I moved a mail from my inbox to the TEST folder on the server. This is instantly replicated on the client. Next I delete the TEST folder on the client. On the client, the TEST folder is moved to the recycle bin (including the mail which is in that folder). On the mail server, the same thing happens. Conclusion:  1. there seems to be  no ""lazy"" way to replicate folders created on the client back to the server, if those folders don't exist on the server. A replication attempt will remove the folders (and their content) on the client if they don't exist on the server. My friend would no longer be my friend... 2. The current situation is inconsistent with the normal behaviour of Thunderbird. Any change you make on the client is normally replicated on the server, regardless of the server setting in the client for syncing subscribed folders. 3. Check the folders properties: will have to wait. She's sick and I don't have remote access to her computer (She doesn't understand how to install TeamViewer). I tried this on my own set-up and the synced folders all have ""imap://..."" as you say. I'll come back once I've had a chance to look at this on her computer. 4. Given the current situation and the reluctance to ""manually sync"" the client folders to the server, my best option for a ""lazy"" solution is to back-up the user's profile file to Google Drive or something along that line. </p>",ghersschens,false,0,0

May it be that your problem is still not comprehensively solved? </p><p>Thouht about it. First thing is, find your Profile folder on your machine and make a backup from it. On Windows make a 7z (or do ""send this folder to ..."" and chose zip) at C:\users\john\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird. On Linux do ""tar c ~/.thunderbird | pigz -c &gt; opensuse.thunderbird-20231113-001.tar.gz"" . These zipped archives will freeze date and times as well as permissions so they will give you a true snapshot of the day. If you do another one on the same day choose *-002.tar.gz ... . Restore: (1) mv ~/.thunderbird /tmp/ and (2) tar xfz *.gz . </p><p>Now you're safe and friends will be friends. However, avoid mismatches of server vs client folder structures. Create new test mails to yourself with subject=test1, body=msg1 on the internet (server). subject=test2, body=msg2 locally on your TB client, see what happens. Good with your syncs? Find ""Archive message"" buttons on server vs client, press them, see what happens. Mails 1, 2 should ""reunite"" in Archive/2023/test{1,2} mails more or less. Create subfolders Archive/2023/A (server) */B (client), move test1 &gt; A (do it on internet==server) , test2 &gt; B (do it on TB==client), see what happens. Good with your syncs, again? Be creative, see how far correspondences can go, create deeper subfolder levels (how many levels deep has your friend created previously). </p><p>Another avenue, also install TB beta when you already use TB release. TB beta is VERY reliable (99%) and its profile folder will reside withing the same ~/.thunderbird folder (linux) or */AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird (Windows). Operating both at the same time can give you immediate feedback how sync is operating betwenn server &lt;--&gt; client(s). When first connected with TB beta, it might download the complete inbox from the server into TB beta's Inbox, so choose wisely the right point in time when to add another TB profile to your investigator's toolbox. Probably your problem can be completely solved without a TB beta. </p><p>That's all for now, what do you think, tell me if you feel an approach like that might inch you further to the finish line. </p><p>Good luck, Regards, U.S. </p>",uwe.scheffer,false,0,0

I'll first talk to my friend (when she' better) to find out how on earth she managed to get her TB out of sync with the server. The procedures you describe all test if client and server do properly sync. They do. My concern (as you can see in previous posts) is that when I turn off the restriction to sync only subscribed folders, the client will sync the server folders with the client folders and since the server is the master and doesn't have any folders, all folders on the client will disappear. What's probably the least risky way to see what really will happen: - make a backup of the TB client profile and store it in a safe location - turn off the sync restrictions in the TB client profile and see what happens - if the folders are replicated back to the server (which I don't expect): party time&nbsp;;-) - if the folders on the client are deleted: restore the TB back-up profile and keep making back-ups from time to time to avoid loosing the folders and mails in TB if the PC's HDD crashes. What I can't fathom at this point: assuming that the folder on the TB client will be deleted by syncing with the server, the mails contained in those folders are also deleted (to be more precise: moved to TB's recycle bin). On the server the same mails are still in the inbox (server doesn't have those folders). What happes to those mails? Will they be synced again and show up in TB's inbox?  </p><p>I already tried creating and deleting folders on my own account on both ends (client and server) and the changes are always correctly replicated by the other side. I just can't get client and server out of sync. </p><p>I messed a bit more with mails and folders of my own mail account to see if I could create a discrepancy between client and server, but it takes quite a few (unlikely) steps to get there: - delete a folder on the client -&gt; folder is also deleted (= moved to recycle bin) on the server - move the mails from the deleted folder back to the inbox on the server -&gt; nothing happens on the client (!) - move the deleted folder on the TB client back to the ""saved mail"" collection -&gt; same happens on the server, but now the folder on the client still contains the old mails (syncing failed in the previous step), the folder on the server is still empty (mails there were moved from the recycle bin to the inbox) - move the old mails which used to be in the folder + aa few newer mails from the inbox back to the empty folder on the server - TB and server are now in sync </p><p>To be honest, this is far-fetched and unlikely to be the cause of my friend's situation. She doesn't mess with her mailbox. In fact she hardly ever goes to the web client to check her mails on the server, let alone move mails around. She always uses TB to access her mails. </p>",ghersschens,false,0,0

So, we're up for next steps.  </p><p>What we know by now is that we can trust the sync mechanism both ways server &lt;---&gt; client. Next, we may not forget that working with mails from the mail web app within a web browser is a client, too. So we already have two clients working, one in the browser, the other one is TB. One of the clients is out of sync (browser) the other is in restricted sync mode (TB). So can we go from here just by pure reasoning and logic? Let's see. </p><p>When we are not connected to the internet and we write some mails and move received mails locally in and out of folders, create new ones and change the overall situation within TB , what is - at least - supposed do happen when we regain internet access at a certain point later on&nbsp;?? It would be off the tracs if the server god just would invalidate our work and kill our new messages we wanted to send once internet is back again, right? So, without the presence of severe bugs, as soon internet is back on, the client situation is going to be mirrored on the server, that is what should happen, everything else would kill the whole point to have cloud sync, right? </p><p>Because of that scenario of what should happen in the absence of bugs it is not wholly correct when you say the server is the master, you see where this is going already? It is more a thing of the right timing. If something happens on a client, the server will be informed of it, only then the server will regain its master status somewhat because all other clients now are able to download (aka ""sync"") the new situation from the one and only server. So maybe your fears that all will be gone is without merits, think about it. </p><p>Despite that, we won't let our guards down, not yet. So this is what I would do at this point. Make a copy locally of all mails and folders withing TB local environment. It works exactly as you'd expect from a normal (aka ""real"") mail account. Even the spam detection works on the local environment, just copy and paste things in spall portions and see how fast TB works on your machine. Do it with internet turned off. When you are finished with the copy and paste procedure, you should habe the same folder structure under ""local"" as you have it under ""john doe's mails"" account.  </p><p>Now you can turn off the restriction in TB and reopen internet access for your machine. I think sync should run okay, it might take its time but it will sync. If things really should go south, then feed the mails and folder you have mirrored in TBs local environment back nice and slowly back to your real mail account. Piece by piece the mails and folders should be uploaded to the server. This might take its time depending on how much data there is to feed and on your upload speed. </p><p>What do you think? Let me know. Regards, U.S. </p>",uwe.scheffer,false,0,0

I have my preferred pdf file type (Kofax Power PDF 5.0) set up as the default in settings.  I can receive pdf files and they open correctly.  My usual procedure is to type an email, add the pdf and then open the pdf once attached to check it one more time before hitting send.  That is when the attached error message pops up. </p>",tseabrook,false,0,0

I try to explain again, for perhaps I was not able to describe the problem clear enough.... </p><p>In my former laptop I could see (in Thunderbird) the contents of the email at the top of the list with mails. I could view that half way the screen, right under the email. I'ld like to have that back again, because without that view I have to click on the new mail in order to read it and then I can decide what to do with it. More clicks, for me unneccesssary..... </p><p>How can I bring that view back again in this program?
