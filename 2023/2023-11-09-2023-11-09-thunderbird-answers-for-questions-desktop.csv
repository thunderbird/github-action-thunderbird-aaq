Somehow it is not being recognized by the calendar module.  By examining the file I see that all my previously stored calendar data is still there but is not being accessed and nothing can be added either.  Essentially the local calendar is now inaccessible. </p>,mark514,false,0,0

If so, and if she downloads messages and filters (or moves) to various folders, then that can't be replicated on the server. If this is an IMAP account, she could set up the folders on the server and work with the online folders. Knowing the account setup will help in giving a more precise response. Also, knowing whether her folders are under ""Local Foldes"" will help, as some people use IMAP and still make local copies. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
