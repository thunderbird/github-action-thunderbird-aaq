My default Windows virus checker did not identify any issues and I ran malware bytes and it showed zero problems.  the problem seemed to start at the point when I forwarded a 5mb file to a few friends.  Since then, I have been unable to send anything.  The system continues to crash.  Most of the time I cannot see any information in pull down lists.  I have tried rolling back to a week old restore point and it continues to have the probem.  I have tried updating to 115.4.1 and it still has the problem.  I have removed all of the automatic installed updates from the last two days and still have the problem.....

1429126,2023-10-27 17:32:16 -0700,2023-10-27 17:32:16 -0700,TB 115 message search results no longer open to the email I want resend when I click it,"<p>Just migrated to Thunderbird 115 and noticing a lot of issues (as others have posted about).  I don't know if there is a solution to this one: </p><p>When I search for emails from a given customer I get a search results page in TB 115 that looks like all older versions of TB.  It gives subject line, date sent, and first few lines of message which makes it easy to find a generic message that I just want to resend to a new prospect without re-typing everything. </p><p>In previous version of TB when I click that email it would open up in the next window and then be ready to read.  I could just do ""control-E"" to open a new ""send message window"" from there, just change the recipient, and off it goes. </p><p>Now in TB 115, clicking on the old message I want to resend opens up a window that just shows the collapsed thread of all kinds of messages I might have sent before and after that message I'm trying to recycle.  I uncollapse the thread and then see dozens of replies and messages that went back and forth to a customer over many dates and times. </p><p>NOW I have to figure out which date and time is the message in the thread that I'm trying to copy instead of it just opening to the one message I just chose from the search results page.   </p><p>I can have the message pane open and it gives me just the sender's name and dates sent of the first few messages in the thread before I uncollapse it, so that does not seem to be the answer.  Clicking on a message in the uncollapsed thread lets me read more of it, but I still have to dig around all the messages in the thread to find the right email I had just clicked on in the search results page.  Or jot down the time and date of what I'm looking for to narrow it down faster. </p><p>Is anyone familiar with this situation?  Or have a fix for it?   </p><p>Version 102 which I just left was simple and quick to use and I've been using ""contol-E"" for something like 20 years.  The function still works in TB 115 but now they have made it much harder to get to the message you want to re-copy or resend.  If you run a business there are dozens of messages you are re-using and now it's become a much harder process to find them and resend them. </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",cvs33
