What gives???","<p>Dear Thunderbird Community,  </p><p>I am a die hard fan of the Thunderbird Mail Client, particularly on Ubuntu-based operating systems and have been a loyal user for years. However, with each new ""upgrade"" or ""improvement"", it seems to me there is always that lurking problem of HANGING SLOWNESS.  </p><p>Why do I frequently get these warning signs of ""BUSY"" or ""FORCE QUIT"" ""WAIT"", on a routine basis. Yes, my HP Spectre x360 laptop is from 2016, and it's aging a bit; but I only have the Firefox Developer Edition browser open at the same time as my Thunderbird Client.  </p><p>It's not like I'm using all of the systems resources. So, why the frequency of hanging slowness? It's very frustrating when you're inspired by an email message that you're quickly typing down and your thought process is rudely interrupted, because you're waiting for the Thunderbird Mail Client app to return to normal? </p><p>Is there something inherently going on in the background is that is slowing down this app's performance? It's a very bizarre problems that really affects your daily productivity and communication goals.  </p><p>Please shed insight or provide tips and/or advice.  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",MrPina

1425215,2023-09-26 18:42:05 -0700,2023-09-26 19:19:05 -0700,Thunderbird - Can't send or receive emails,"<p>Hello,  </p><p>I have not been able to send or receive emails for the past 4 days using Thunderbird. </p><p>Before I went on vacation on Friday 22nd September 2023, I was able to send and receive my emails on my <strong>wendyp@wn.com.au</strong> address using Thunderbird on my computer.  Since I got back on Monday (25th) I have not been able to send or receive any emails.  Nothing has been changed in the Thunderbird settings. </p><p>At first, I thought Thunderbird might need to be updates. I did an update, to no avail.  Current Thunderbird version is 115.2.3 (64bit).  My computer is running Windows 10. </p><p>I use Bitdefender for protection and I turned off the virus and firewall to see if that helped, but it didn't. </p><p>I don't believe it is my actual webmail server, as I have been able to get my wendyp emails through my Android phone and by logging into my webmail account.  I have also been able to send emails, with no issues using this method as well. </p><p>The strange thing is, I have another email address (page3@westnet.com.au) on the same Thunderbird program on my computer, and that one is having no problems whatsoever.  Again, both settings have not been touched in the past few days. </p><p>Please find attached screen shots of the alerts from my wendyp@wn.com.au account. </p><p>The first attachment is when I try to request new emails from the server on Thunderbird. </p><p>The second attachment is when I try to send an email using Thunderbird. </p><p>The third attachment are my wendyp@wn.com.au email settings, which I have not changed at all. </p><p>I hope to hear from you soon, so this can be rectified. </p><p>Thank you - Wendy Page </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1606347;,isthisurcard3

When verifying an account using otr, an error occurs in the following: when I try to verify a contact, the verification button is highlighted in gray. That is, a friend sends me a request, but I can't verify it!
