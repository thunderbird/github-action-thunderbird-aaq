When verifying an account using otr, an error occurs in the following: when I try to verify a contact, the verification button is highlighted in gray. That is, a friend sends me a request, but I can't verify it! I will also note that I have already corrected the preferences/advanced/config editor file and studied this page <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OTR"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OTR</a> but nothing helped. Thank you in advance if you can help fix this moment. I'm using the XMPP protocol. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",frantsyzof
