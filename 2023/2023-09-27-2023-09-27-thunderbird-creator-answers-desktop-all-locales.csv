1425215,2023-09-26 18:42:05 -0700,2023-09-26 19:19:05 -0700,Thunderbird - Can't send or receive emails,"<p>Hello,  </p><p>I have not been able to send or receive emails for the past 4 days using Thunderbird. </p><p>Before I went on vacation on Friday 22nd September 2023, I was able to send and receive my emails on my <strong>wendyp@wn.com.au</strong> address using Thunderbird on my computer.  Since I got back on Monday (25th) I have not been able to send or receive any emails.  Nothing has been changed in the Thunderbird settings. </p><p>At first, I thought Thunderbird might need to be updates. I did an update, to no avail.  Current Thunderbird version is 115.2.3 (64bit).  My computer is running Windows 10. </p><p>I use Bitdefender for protection and I turned off the virus and firewall to see if that helped, but it didn't. </p><p>I don't believe it is my actual webmail server, as I have been able to get my wendyp emails through my Android phone and by logging into my webmail account.  I have also been able to send emails, with no issues using this method as well. </p><p>The strange thing is, I have another email address (page3@westnet.com.au) on the same Thunderbird program on my computer, and that one is having no problems whatsoever.  Again, both settings have not been touched in the past few days. </p><p>Please find attached screen shots of the alerts from my wendyp@wn.com.au account. </p><p>The first attachment is when I try to request new emails from the server on Thunderbird. </p><p>The second attachment is when I try to send an email using Thunderbird. </p><p>The third attachment are my wendyp@wn.com.au email settings, which I have not changed at all. </p><p>I hope to hear from you soon, so this can be rectified. </p><p>Thank you - Wendy Page </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1606347;,isthisurcard3

When verifying an account using otr, an error occurs in the following: when I try to verify a contact, the verification button is highlighted in gray. That is, a friend sends me a request, but I can't verify it! I will also note that I have already corrected the preferences/advanced/config editor file and studied this page <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OTR"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OTR</a> but nothing helped. Thank you in advance if you can help fix this moment. I'm using the XMPP protocol. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",frantsyzof
