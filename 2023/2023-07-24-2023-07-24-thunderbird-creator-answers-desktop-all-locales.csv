Possible?","<p>Hi, I have been using The Bat! client from Ritlabs for ages and reason for this is its capability to display messages threaded by ""From"" header and then sorted by date. This way, if sender X sends me an email, sender X will be first in the list and I can expand/collapse his name to see all the messages ever received from him. I love this because threading by message ids and subjects does not always work (honestly, it does not work for me most of the time to the expected degree)! </p><p>Is it possible to achieve similiar behaviour in Thunderbird (115)? </p><p>The closest I got in Thunderbird was to setting ""View &gt; Sort by &gt; From"", ""View &gt; Sort by &gt; Grouped by sort"" and ""View &gt; Threads &gt; Collapse All Threads"". But when I click on Date columns, the all idea is lost. </p><p>Attached screen shows expanded thread ""Firefox Accounts (accounts@firefox.com"" as the first entry because its message is the latest. Followed by ""Airbnb (automated@airbnb.com"" and when I expand it, I find all messages from this sender. Etc... </p><p>Thanks.
