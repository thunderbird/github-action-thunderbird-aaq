L'errore esatto è: Alcune cartelle (ad esempio ""Posta in arrivo su mioindirizzoemail"") non possono essere compattate perché lo spazio sul disco è insufficiente. Eliminare alcuni file e riprovare. </p><p>Lo spazio disco c'è, 20 GB disponibili. </p><p>Da diversi mesi riscontro inoltre un ""freeze"" di Thunderbird quando arriva una email. </p><p>Se fino ad ora ho continuato accettando il problema, adesso purtroppo la situazione sta peggiorando e chiedo se forse il problema sia causato dal grande numero di email (parliamo di circa 130000 email per circa 45 GB di spazio occupato). </p><p>C'è qualche problema noto con account con numero di email elevato? </p><p>Grazie </p><p>Mauro </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,it,"",mauro.narduzzi
