I have found a place to specify font and have tried that, but that does not affect anything in the window I have mentioned. On my old computer (Win 10, 64 bit), I found the font on that window large enough. Not now with my new computer (Win 11, home). I suppose I am running an earlier version of Thunderbird on the old computer? (I haven't yet found the 'about' tab for Thunderbird -- not Firefox, to tell me what version I am running.) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",kirkaby

Syncing with my network calendar causes the program to freeze. I can wait a whole day and nothing happens. When I turn the calendar off, Thunderbird is working fine. Tried to delete the 'calendar-data/cache.sqlite' file, but it didn't helped. Deleted the calendar and add it as a new one - also no luck. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",slawek.jsk
