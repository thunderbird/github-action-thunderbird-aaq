I noticed this when I returned. I'm using imap to download from the server. Logging in to the server via browser shows that there indeed new emails. Quitting Thunderbird and restarting results in showing old emails and a spinner (slider?) on the Inbox tab that never stops. I have not changed configuration recently (I was away when this started). I followed a suggestion to delete cert9.db, key4.db, and logins.json. Doing this and restarting changed nothing. My understanding is that this should have deleted my server password information, but I was not prompted for a password on restart.

I know it existed in 102 and also now in 115.  That is that despite the Junk Settings being set to ""Delete them"" under the checked statement ""When I mark messages as junk"", they do not ever get deleted.  I have to manually delete items marked as junk, which is mostly accurate.  So in my inbox, I just see a multitude of items marked as junk each morning until I re-sort by junk status instead of date and then easily delete them and then go back to sort by date. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",chunnel
