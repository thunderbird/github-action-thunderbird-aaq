Syncing with my network calendar causes the program to freeze. I can wait a whole day and nothing happens. When I turn the calendar off, Thunderbird is working fine. Tried to delete the 'calendar-data/cache.sqlite' file, but it didn't helped. Deleted the calendar and add it as a new one - also no luck. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",slawek.jsk
