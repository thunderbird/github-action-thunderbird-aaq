When I have an email open, I can usually click the ""delete"" or ""junk"" button to send it where it needs to go, and the next email will automatically appear. But recently, those buttons only work once: if I click ""delete"" or ""junk"" on the second email that comes up, nothing happens. I have to close that email and delete or junk it from the Inbox. Am I the only person having this problem? I tried deleting the Trash files in the profile, but that didn't help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",storm7

This is very alarming, but what is worse is that the trash folder for some email addresses no longer exists, which means as soon as I delete an email it is permenently gone. And some of my email addresses no longer have a 'sent' folder which means that after I have sent an email, there is no record of the email after it is sent. This is very concerning. </p><p>There is folder called 'junk' which should have 100s of emails in it, but it say there are only 17, When I select it, there are no emails there. </p><p>I would post a screenshot, but it would reveal all my email addresses. </p><p>The more I am looking into solving this the more I have discovered that thousands of my emails have disappeared. Especially those I have sent. I am devistated. These are my records. </p><p>How can I roll back to when thunderbird was reliable, and is there any way of salvaging this catastophe? And how can I trust thunderbird again, which was at one time most reliable? </p><p>I have tried the following advice I sought on bing: </p><p>To restore the Junk folder, you can go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Security &gt; Junk and check the box that says “Move new junk messages to”. Then, select “Other” and choose the Junk folder from the list. This will enable the Junk folder again and move any spam messages there. You can also right-click on any message and mark it as junk or not junk to train the filter.  FAILED - IT HAS NOT RESTORED THE JUNK FOLDER </p><p>To restore the Sent folder, you can go to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders and check the box that says “Place a copy in”. Then, select “Other” and choose the Sent folder from the list. This will enable the Sent folder again and save a copy of any messages you send there. You can also drag and drop any messages from your local folders to the Sent folder if you want to move them. LIMITED SUCCESS - 2 SENT FOLDERS HAVE BEEN RESTORED. Several have not been able to be restored using this method. </p><p>Another annoying change: It has put the 'File, Edit, View, Go, Message, etc' Tool bar under the 'Get Messages, Write, Reply etc"" Tool bar. They should be the other way round. </p><p>I really hope all this can be solved. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",sheffield28

In Thunderbird, there always was a gap between last message in the message list and a message window, so you can always understand, were there any new messages or not. There was also possible to regulate this gap by mouse. After upgrade to version 115 (""Supernova"") there is no gap anymore. And you cannot change it.
