This is very alarming, but what is worse is that the trash folder for some email addresses no longer exists, which means as soon as I delete an email it is permenently gone.

Then, select “Other” and choose the Junk folder from the list. This will enable the Junk folder again and move any spam messages there. You can also right-click on any message and mark it as junk or not junk to train the filter.  FAILED - IT HAS NOT RESTORED THE JUNK FOLDER </p><p>To restore the Sent folder, you can go to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders and check the box that says “Place a copy in”. Then, select “Other” and choose the Sent folder from the list. This will enable the Sent folder again and save a copy of any messages you send there. You can also drag and drop any messages from your local folders to the Sent folder if you want to move them. LIMITED SUCCESS - 2 SENT FOLDERS HAVE BEEN RESTORED. Several have not been able to be restored using this method. </p><p>Another annoying change: It has put the 'File, Edit, View, Go, Message, etc' Tool bar under the 'Get Messages, Write, Reply etc"" Tool bar.
