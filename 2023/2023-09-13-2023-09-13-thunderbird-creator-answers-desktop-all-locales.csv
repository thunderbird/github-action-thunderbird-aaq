(Thunderbird was suggested by online searches and made sense to me as a simple Firefox user. But that's all I'd like to use it for. And yes, I did donate:) But when I ask the .mbox file to 'Open With' Thunderbird, a 'Write' window opens - why? I need to stop using so much Google storage but am reluctant to simply delete when I don't know how to look at any backups!
