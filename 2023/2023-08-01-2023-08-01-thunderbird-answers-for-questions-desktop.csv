First, make sure you've got Thunderbird installed on your new laptop. Then, in your old Thunderbird, right-click on the subfolders you want to move and choose ""Copy To"" from the menu. Pick your new Thunderbird account as the destination. The emails will be copied over. If you're using IMAP, they'll sync automatically. If you're on POP, just make sure to also back up those folders before deleting them from your old setup. Hope this helps you get your subfolders set up on your new laptop!

It's great that you've already tried a few troubleshooting steps. To address this, let's give these steps a shot: Firstly, ensure Thunderbird is up-to-date. Then, try creating a new profile in Thunderbird and add your O365 account again. Sometimes profiles can get corrupted. Also, double-check your O365 server settings, as they might need an update. Lastly, if you're using two-factor authentication for your O365 account, generate an ""App Password"" from your O365 account settings and use that in Thunderbird. Give these a go, and hopefully, Thunderbird will be back in action. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

It sounds like you're trying to figure out how to automatically update or move Filters after moving Folders from one email account to a new email account in Thunderbird. While it might seem like moving Folders would also move Filters and update the rules, it doesn't work that way. What you can do is manually update your Filters to reflect the changes. In Thunderbird, open up the Filters menu, locate the Filters associated with those moved Folders, and adjust them to point to the new location. Unfortunately, there isn't an automatic update feature for this. Once you've updated the Filters, they should work smoothly with the new email account and Folders. If you're having trouble finding the right Filters or need more assistance, feel free to reach out. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

No worries, we'll get this sorted out. The numbers in the grouped list titles might be a bit wonky due to some underlying issues. And as for the ""Today"" turning into ""Old mail"" – that sounds like a quirky bug too. To address this, let's try a couple of steps. First, make sure you're on the latest version of Thunderbird. If you are, try restarting Thunderbird or even your computer. If the issue persists, you might want to consider repairing your Thunderbird profile. Go to ""Help"" &gt; ""Troubleshooting Information"" &gt; ""Open Folder"" to find your profile. Rename the file named ""places.sqlite"" to ""placesOLD.sqlite"" and then restart Thunderbird. This often clears up odd display issues. If you're comfortable with it, you can also try creating a new profile to see if the problem persists there. Give these steps a shot, and hopefully, your Thunderbird will be back to smooth sailing. If not, come on back, and we'll dive deeper into solving this for you! </p>",suram080,false,0,1

If you want to know which email a person opened and what they did with it then you are monitoring that person and all their activities. You may not want to know what people are doing all the time and perhaps would not be checking all the time. But as you have no idea when something occurs, it means you still need to monitor everything just in case. </p><p>Using imap accounts the actions are updated to server, so all computers accessing that email address will get updated within a short time frame. They all show same data. So you talking about getting the data before that occurs in fact you want to know specifically when it occurs. </p><p>So you are looking for what user logon id on what computer (IP) starting Thunderbird logging into which profile and viewing what account and selecting which email and whether they changed it's status and what action if any occurred and what timestamp. In effect you would need to monitor the desktop and keystrokes etc. </p><p>This is way beyond anything which can just be done within Thunderbird which operates on a per installation using a designated profile.   The link david gave you is an example of the type of software you are looking for. </p><p>Otherwise, I can think of a few alternative methods you may want ot consider: Assign specific emails to specific people, so you know who is responsible for dealing with those emails. You need someone to have first access to mail and they assign people to specific emails by setting a 'Tag'. eg: Employee called Bob is assigned a Tag called 'Bob' and they deal with all emails with the 'Bob' tag. You would need to make sure all Tags are set up on each computer in order for everyone to see the tags.  However, this still does not stop people accessing email with wrong tag because they still technically can see everything. </p><p>Another method:  set up a filter on server which sends a copy of emails into separate email addresses and each employee has access to a specific email address and is set a password. So in effect they do not get full access to everything.  Only the top admin has access to all mail and all passwords and they set up filters or manually move mail to various email addresses/accounts to manage workloads.  If an email goes missing erroneously, you would still have main copy in main receiving account and you would also know who was dealing with that email. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It sounds like you're facing a bit of a hiccup with your <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a> email in Thunderbird. No worries, we'll get this sorted out! When you hit that send button and the screen goes white, it's likely the connection to the outgoing server is timing out. This could be due to a few things – maybe a temporary glitch or a setting that needs tweaking. To fix it, first, let's ensure your outgoing server settings are correct. Even if the link doesn't show up as in the illustrations, you can find it by going to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Outgoing Server (SMTP). Check that your server settings match what your provider recommends. Also, make sure there are no antivirus or firewall settings causing conflicts. Lastly, if the issue persists, consider trying Thunderbird in Safe Mode or disabling any add-ons temporarily. Your draft being sent from your mobile suggests it's more of a Thunderbird-specific issue. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

It looks like you're having an issue with Thunderbird where the sender field is empty when you click on mailto links. I totally get how frustrating that can be. No worries though, we can definitely help you fix it! Since you've already tried reinstalling and it didn't work, let's try something else. First, make sure Thunderbird is your default email client in your operating system's settings. Then, let's go to Thunderbird's options and check if your default email account is properly set up. Sometimes these glitches can be related to that. If it's still not working, you might want to consider temporarily disabling any add-ons that could be interfering. </p>",suram080,false,0,0
