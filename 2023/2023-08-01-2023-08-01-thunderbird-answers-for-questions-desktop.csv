Yes, you can create filters that put different messages into special folders, but I don't grasp the desire for a ping when eventually opening the message. The concept of a noise when mail arrives was to let the user know that new mail arrived. But in your situation, you know the message is there and make  a conscious decision to open it - so why would you want the ping?  Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Gmail creates multiple folders for a complete inventory and the folders are not really folders, they are labels. That is each email message exists once, but Gmail has several indices that point to it. That is why I always attempt to discourage users from subscribing to 'folders' such as Allmail, as that includes all mail, including trash. So, to solve your issue, I suggest you unsubscribe from those all encompassing gmail folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Be sure all folders are set for allowing offline access. 2. to get all the messages be sure to do File&gt;offline&gt;download .  Once you have that, you can exit TB, copy the folders from the IMAP account to your Local Folders folder and then you can access the messages in Thunderbird after closing the account. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
