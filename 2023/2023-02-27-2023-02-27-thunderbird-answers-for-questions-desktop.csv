If you have other accounts, check to see if one of them was using a component of the deleted account. For example, it sometimes happens that a person is using two accounts for the same smtp server.

See if any component of the deleted account appears there.  - another test is to click settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, click 'saved passwords'.

The first part of your answer gets me to the part about deleting the account. After that, however, there is no way for help. Isn't it possible that TB has a mechanism that protects e-mail accounts twice and that you may have to delete something in the profile folder or even to edit the file prefs.js or something else? </p>",m.sammet,false,0,0

Prima di postare avevo già attivato la ricerca in cartelle e files hidden... Prima di ricercare se esistevano nell'intero disco altri files *.mab , pensando appunto quanto da te segnalati, ma inutilmente. A questo punto pensavo che magari al variare delle versioni i files .mab fossero stati sostituiti con altri index o chissà che... Da non credere... Ho anche ricercato in dump sui files aggiornati il giorno della modifica, presenti nelle sottocartelle del profilo. Niente. Non so più dove cercare. Ma gli indirizzi li aggiunge...
