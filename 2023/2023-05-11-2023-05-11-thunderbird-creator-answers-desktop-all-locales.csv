Il settaggio dello scarico delle caselle di posta è solo per il titolo e poi manualmente le scarico io. Avevo alcuni filtri che mi archiviavano le email ricevute e ho un problema cioè me li archivia correttamente ma quando vado a scaricare la singola email non mi fa vedere il testo contenuto ma solo l'allegato. Ho provato prima di scaricarle a riportarle nella cartella di posta e poi scaricarle e vedo corretamente tutto. Ho provato a eseguire nuovi filtri ma mi fa lo stesso problema come posso fare a risolvere questo incoveniente. Grazie </p>,fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,it,1580672;,e.isetta63

A bunch of stuff I don't even see in my emails is, but not ""Reply to.""   </p><p>My first and main question: How can I add this as a selection?  In ""Filter Rules"" there's the list of header fields (which defaults to ""Subject""... related question: can I change the default field to ""From,"" the one I most often use?) and a list of 'operators' such as ""contains,"" ""doesn't contain,"" ""begins/ends with"" etc.  At the bottom of the header field selection box is ""Customize.""  I tried using that and just typing it in, but it won't take ""Reply to"" because there's a non-printing character in there, which I'm assuming is the space between Reply and to.  I tried using just Reply, and that doesn't work at all.  Any way to add ""Reply to"" as an option? </p><p>Second question: are the filter fields case sensitive?  If I'm filtering for say ""Water,"" will ""water"" cover all possibilities (water, Water, WATER, WaTeR, etc...) or will ""Water"" just cover ""Water"" and nothing else?  I have been entering multiple cases of some words, but if that isn't necessary, it would be nice to know. </p><p>Thanks!! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1580521;,kharrisma
