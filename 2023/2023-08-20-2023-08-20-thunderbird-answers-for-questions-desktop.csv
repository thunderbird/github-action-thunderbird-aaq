I had forgotten the password, so I looked in the settings.  The new display there only shows the first eight characters of the password, and the window  can't be expanded, nor the columns resized to show more.

I suggest reporting these problems to your email provider. DKIM/SPF refers to situations where the domain of the email address and the domain of the email provider do not match, which is common if you sign up for web hosting and use that for email. The DKIM/SPF settings are identifiers set in the server to confirm that your email id on the server is legitimate. My wording is non-technical and probably a bit of a stretch, but I hope you get the idea. As an aside, we are seeing more email providers increasing their security procedures, and Google is at the top of that list for security. </p>",davidsk,false,2,0
