I am using Gmail on a free personal account and not a Google Workspace subscriber or a Gmail account that is part of Google Workspace so with that being said, there may be limits for personal free accounts too which has not been discovered at the time of this writing.   </p><p>What I discovered after the original post was that if I clicked on the All Mail folder, it will increase the number which it is reading now and stable, not increasing: All Mail 717,461 instead of 808,141 Inbox 530,472 instead of 790,763 </p>",vincepoy,false,0,0

These emails do not have an Unsubscribe button. Also, the Sender and Receiver have the same email address. So. if I were to use an app which would block these emails, I would be blocking myself because I am both the Sender and the Receiver according to these emails.. When I send out an email, obviously I do not address it to the same address as mine. Hope this is clear. Thank you. </p>",gilliano56,false,0,0

I suggest reporting these problems to your email provider. DKIM/SPF refers to situations where the domain of the email address and the domain of the email provider do not match, which is common if you sign up for web hosting and use that for email. The DKIM/SPF settings are identifiers set in the server to confirm that your email id on the server is legitimate. My wording is non-technical and probably a bit of a stretch, but I hope you get the idea. As an aside, we are seeing more email providers increasing their security procedures, and Google is at the top of that list for security. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
