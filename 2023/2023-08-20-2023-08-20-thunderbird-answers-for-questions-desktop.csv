It would be clearer to me if it was called ""Repeat last move (move to Inbox again)"" for example, and it would be clearer if it would specify which account the folder belongs to, such as ""Inbox (account 1)"". </p>",alonshoer,false,0,0

So you chose to move to inbox again and the last move to inbox was the inbox for another account. So the move is to thgis other inbox.  I do not see the issue. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
