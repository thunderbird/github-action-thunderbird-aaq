I suggest reporting these problems to your email provider. DKIM/SPF refers to situations where the domain of the email address and the domain of the email provider do not match, which is common if you sign up for web hosting and use that for email. The DKIM/SPF settings are identifiers set in the server to confirm that your email id on the server is legitimate. My wording is non-technical and probably a bit of a stretch, but I hope you get the idea. As an aside, we are seeing more email providers increasing their security procedures, and Google is at the top of that list for security. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I had forgotten the password, so I looked in the settings.  The new display there only shows the first eight characters of the password, and the window  can't be expanded, nor the columns resized to show more.  I had to copy the password, then paste it into another application to see the whole length. </p><p>If I feel ambitious, I may try to reproduce the original problem, but I am getting a little tired of the problems with Supernova.

I presume these copies are all in the ...AppData/Roaming folder and nothing in the Local? </p><p>For ctroein, I found that TB is installing  ""Mozilla Maintenance Service"" What this does is use the Windows update function to detect a TB update. It is a clever way to remove some background computing. However, if like me, you do NOT want updates, then uninstall this. There is also a flag in TB to disable but don't remember what it is just now. I believe it signals the Service function to work. I think if it is uninstalled you will not get the auto update in background when not looking. </p><p>It seems to me that Windows and many apps are too free with giving updates.

It will list all the profiles. </p><p>Suggest you use this method to open the current new profile and also the original profile. </p> <ul><li> You would be looking for the 'Root Directory' location and it will have a 'Open Folder' button (In Linux - 'Open Directory' button). </li><li> Click on 'Open Folder' button to see contents of that profile name folder. </li></ul> <p>Once you have both profiles open in new independent windows... </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird now - this is important. </li></ul> <p>You will see various folders and files. </p><p>Calendar: If you just have the 'Home' default calendar then  'calendar-data' folder could be copy pasted to new profile - replacing the default empty calendar-data folder. </p><p>AddressBooks: </p> <ul><li> Personal Address Book - 'abook.sqlite' file </li><li> Collected Addresses - 'history.sqlite' file </li></ul> <p>Both of the above can be directly copy pasted into the new profile name folder  replacing the empty default ones.

You need to copy any folder that has a.sbd extension. </p><p>As these are POP mail accounts you can copy and paste them into the new Pop account folder in new profile. </p><p>When it comes to the 'Local Folders' mail account - you can copy the entire 'Local Folders' folder - go to new profile - clickon 'Mail' folder - delete the current empty 'Local Folders' folder and then paste the copied 'Local Folders' folder into the 'Mail' folder. </p><p><br> Start Thunderbird. </p><p>Import other address books.

Then in address book check it's contents and then you can rename the address book to a more suitable name - that name you may discover in the 'pref.js' file you put on the desktop - it can be opened using eg: Notepad.
