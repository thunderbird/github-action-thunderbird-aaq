Szeretném látni az összes levelemet, érkezési sorrendben, egymás alatt, mint eddig. Új email fiókot vettem fel a programba és itt rendezi a leveleimet, a régebben használt email fiókomnál ezt nem teszi és ezt szeretném az újonnan ""regisztráltnál"" is beállítani, de nem sikerül. Van olyan levelem, amit nem is látok, nem jelenik meg sehol, egyik ""témában"" sem, csak jelzi, hogy van egy új levelem. Lehet valahol törölni ezt a funkciót? </p><p>Köszönettel: Dr. Karcsú Noémi </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,hu,1584645;,karcsudoki
