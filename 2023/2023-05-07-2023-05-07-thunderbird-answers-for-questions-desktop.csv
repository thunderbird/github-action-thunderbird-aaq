Antivirus scanning locking out the file. (simple expedient of restarting in safe mode with Networking will remove that.) 2. The actual storage file having issues with regard to corruption or allocation.  Generally you needs to use the system utilities to ""de-fragment"" the file system as that will identify file system errors. 3. An oauth authentication window open in the background.  Hover your mouse over the icon on the task bar and see if there is a second window showing open.
