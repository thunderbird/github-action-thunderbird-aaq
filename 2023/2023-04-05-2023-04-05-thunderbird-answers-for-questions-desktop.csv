Kliknite na priečinok ""Doručená pošta"" pravým tlačidlom myši, vyberte ""Vlastnosti"" a preverte akú veľkosť na disku zaberá.  Limit veľkosti zložky je detailnejšie vysvetlený tuná:  <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Limits_%28Thunderbird%29#Folders_and_messages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Limits_%28Thunderbird%29#Folders_and_messages</a>. </p><p>Odporúčam staré správy z preplneného priečinka ""Doručená pošta"" odstrániť, alebo archivovať. Postup archivácie: Označte všetku starú poštu v priečinku ""Doručená pošta"" (cca 1000 emailov) a zvolte a (stlačiť klávesu a), alebo ich po označení archivujte aj takto (druhá možnosť): - Thunderbird - Správa - Archivovať - uvoľnili ste si miesto v priečinku a všetka stará pošta je ARCHIVOVANÁ - nájdete ju v priečinku ARCHÍVY pod konkrétnym letopočtom. Poštu z roku 2018 archivuje do priečinka 2018. Poštu z roku 2019 archivuje do priečinka 2019. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/cs/kb/archivace-zprav"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/cs/kb/archivace-zprav</a> </p><p>Pokiaľ v Thunderbirde odstránite e-mail, tak sa v skutočnosti iba označí ako odstránený, ale fyzicky zostane. Jeho fyzické odstránenie sa vykoná až použitím voľby ""Údržbu priečinkov“. Takže aby ste zmenšili veľkosť preplneného priečinka je nutné ešte vykonať ""Údržbu priečinkov"": <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/cs/kb/provedeni-udrzby-slozek"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/cs/kb/provedeni-udrzby-slozek</a>. POSTUP: - Thunderbird - Súbor - Vykonať údržbu priečinkov <a href=""http://imgbank.cz/images/2015/08/19/Thunderbird_udrzba_priecinkov.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgbank.cz/images/2015/08/19/Thunderbird_udrzba_priecinkov.jpg</a> </p><p>Ďalšou možnosťou je, že ste narazili na limit veľkosti niektorého iného priečinka, kde je maximálny limit tak isto 4GB.  V tomto prípade pomôže to isté - uvolniť preplnený priečinok archiváciou, alebo odstránením starých správ, a následným spustením ""Údržby priečinkov"". </p>",Ansamb,false,0,0

You would need to have selected 'View' &gt; 'Display Attachments inline' in order for it to be displayed. It is possible to save the .vcf files and import them into the Address Book. </p><p>However, it may also be a malicious attachment being disguised as a vcard.  </p><p>Freezing often occurs because another program has interrupted the process. It is likely the Anti-Virus product you are using is scanning incoming  files and for some reason it is not likeing the .vcf attachment; possibly it is trying to 'fix' it. </p><p>Please note - I would advise that you do not want an Anti-Virus trying to fix anything when it involves any profile folder or file.  It may try to fix the 'Inbox' and could corrupt the file as Anti-Virus does not understand the single text file actually contains all your emails.  So if you want Anti-Virus to scan emails then please make sure you have the setting to ask you what to do. Never allow an auto fix as you may lose emails. </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What Anti-Virus product are you using? </p><p>The best method testing is to restart the computer in 'Safe Mode with Networking' as this disables the Anti-virus and other not necessary files, so you can run Thunderbird and see if you get a 'freezing' problem. It also means you do not have to uninstall etc any Anti-Virus, so when you go back to start computer as normal everything is auto up and running again. Note: if you normally use 'wireless' connection to router then you will probably need to use an ethernet cable to connect to router for the test. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

My dad used to type in all-caps too.  </p><p>Regarding the Thunderbird ""temporarily blacklisted IP address"" message about my Comcast email account, I have the same problem, and have tried troubleshooting mode with only temporary improvement, as well as uninstall-reinstall without benefit. I just now contacted Comcast, and they are having a level 2 tech support person look into it. For me, the problem is occurring only on 1 of 2 laptops (fortunately).  Possibly coincidentally, about 2 weeks ago, I upgraded this laptop from W10 to W11, but the error message began only yesterday. So, I don't have any solutions yet, but will try to provide updates when I do hear from Comcast.  </p><p>If anyone has additional helpful suggests, I'm open to hear from them. </p><p>Velma </p>",vlcampb3,false,0,0

Sorry for the Caps but I did not realize it at the time and did not mean to OFFEND others. </p><p>My issue began at the end of March and has been a long month of talking to Comcast to no avail. They claim all is well on their end and ""it must be Thunderbird....talk to them"". </p><p>I get the following error messages when Thunderbird tries to pull E-mails from two Comcast accounts: 1.  Login to account (E-mail <a href=""http://account.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">account.comcast.net</a>) failed. 2.  Login to server imap <a href=""http://comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">comcast.net</a> with usernames failed. 3.  Alert from account (E-mail account) temporarily blacklisted ip address - Try again later. </p><p>If i restart my personal desktop computer Thunderbird pulls the E-mails from Comcast and then after five or ten minutes the above error messages appear. </p><p>I moved to Outlook and get error messages that my Comcast needs to be updated.  No E-mails and then later they start coming in little groups along with the error messages. </p><p>It seems to be a circular chase....not me, but them, not them but you. </p><p>Thank you for your reply.....noting that others are having the same issue. </p>",darryl.judy.zajac,false,0,0

Worked my way up from the initial support level, to tech support, and to the next higher level of tech support.  Went through the same process at each level, answered the same questions, and comcast went through their checks, even wanting a new password for the main account.  The tech was referencing documents you can find on line regarding Thunderbird and Comcast issues.  At the last tech level the support person ran out of options and opted as a last effort to just ""reboot/restart"" the modem line from their end.  With the modem reboot taking place I opted to do other things.  Approximately five hours later I decided to ""look again"" at Thunderbird.  I re-entered the new password under the Thunderbird program to set-up an existing account.  Bingo. it worked, Thunderbird pulled the E-mails and has been working just as it did before. </p><p>Even Outlook is working and getting all the E-mails with no problems.   </p><p>So far no error messages or ip blacklist messages. </p>",darryl.judy.zajac,false,0,0

Your computer ip address had got onto a server spam filter list and that was why you kept getting the error message from the relevant server. </p><p>Usually, the error message advises you to check a specific spam filter and one of the most common websites to check is this: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://check.spamhaus.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://check.spamhaus.org/</a> </li></ul> <p>The ip address range is controlled/issued by your internet service provider. </p><p>If you are using Windows OS then the info at the link below would help you to find out your current ip address: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-your-ip-address-in-windows-f21a9bbc-c582-55cd-35e0-73431160a1b9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-your-ip-address-in-windows-f21a9bbc-c582-55cd-35e0-73431160a1b9</a> </li></ul> <p>I would have advise you to try to force a new ip address for your computer.  One method you could try would be to exit all programs, switch off computer and then perform a reset on the router. Usually there is a 'reset' button on the side of the router which you can use. Sometimes completely disconnecting the router can work as well - wait about 12 seconds and then switch it on. Once it is all up and running, boot up computer and open Thunderbird. </p><p><br> However as you mention 'comcast' then it's possible you are using xfinity as isp. </p><p>I have located some information at the following link which may be of interest should this issue present itself again. </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/releasing-and-renewing-ip-address"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/releasing-and-renewing-ip-address</a> </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
