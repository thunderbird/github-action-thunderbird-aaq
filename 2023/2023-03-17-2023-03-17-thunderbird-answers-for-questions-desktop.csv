That is the only folder that gets an auto filter on download. It has always been that way and no you cannot do an auto filter on any other folder. The 'All Mail' folder is not just incoming new mail.  </p><p>In webmail - on server - Gmail will apply a label of 'Inbox' to all incoming mail with the exception of emails that the server deemed as Spam/Junk. Those emails get a 'Spam' label. </p><p>If email did have Inbox label, but gmail removes the 'Inbox' label, it is because you applied a filter to move or delete emails. Anything you do in Thunderbird imap account effects how gmail interprets your actions. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:when Tbird applies filter to move message strikethrough copy remains in inbox. </em> </p><p>Pop accounts do not work like Imap accounts. Pop can only access server Inbox to download a copy which it stores on your computer and you can choose to leave a copy on the server or not. </p><p>Imap accounts are designed to display whatever is stored on the server.  The folders in an imap account should never be regarded as a separate independent copy because all imap folders synchronise with server folders of same name. They are like one and the same sharing same view. </p><p>Gmail stores all emails, sent, received, archived - everything in the 'All Mail' folder. Gmail understand this is a totally useless method for users as they cannot easily find anything. So gmail applies 'labels' to all emails it receives (the labels are like filter tags) then uses those labels to offer a virtual display of the email in a 'folder - style' view.  This means you can have an email stored in 'All Mail' and see the same email in 'Inbox' and 'Important' folders.  </p><p>In the imap account, those 'labels' are real files and we call them Folders. Most people never subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder because it is just a complete copy of everything you have in other folders, and as it can  be a massive folder, it can consume space and performance issues. Unlike the 'All Mail' folder on the server which displays the various 'labels' with each Subject. No label information is stored in the 'All Mail' folder in the imap account because only the server uses labels.  </p><p>If you delete an email from the 'Inbox' - it should get put into the gmail 'Trash' folder - as per  </p> <ul><li> Account Settings &gt; Server Settings for the account. </li><li> 'when I delete a mesasge' </li><li> Select 'Move it to this folder': </li><li> select the server folder 'Trash or maybe it's called 'Bin' on gmail account' </li></ul> <ul><li> If you are seeing a 'strikethrough' then perhaps you have the 'just mark it as deleted' option. You are not instructing it to go to the Trash.  </li></ul> <p>When email gets put into the server Trash folder then gmail sees this as a command to remove all labels and put into TRash - you want to remove all copies of email, so it deleted the copy from the 'All Mail' folder. Then every 30 days it empties the Trash automatically. </p><p>If email is not put into the gmail Trash/Bin folder then gmail understands you do not want to delete the original, so it only removes the 'Inbox' label - basically gmail archive the email. It's still in 'All Mail'.   This occurs all time with POP mail accounts because there is no means of putting deleted emails into a server Trash folder. </p><p>If you have a filter that 'moves' an email from the imap Inbox folder to another Imap folder eg:Bills in same account then gmail removes the 'Inbox' label and applies a 'Bills' label.  </p><p>If you are moving an email out of the account - from the imap 'Inbox' to a folder in the 'Local Folders' mail account, then you are in effect deleting the email off the server.  This is usually only done if you are reaching a full quota on server and need to delete emails off the server, but retain a copy. But if you have the setting to just strikethrough/mark as deleted and not properly delete by putting the server Trash folder, then gmail obeys your instruction - Remove label - archive and store in All Mail. </p><p>I would strongly advise the filter uses 'Copy' to Local Folders folder because if something goes wrong then at least you have not lost the original. Also, you would need to be very certain you had downloaded full copies and not just headers, otherwise you could be storing a load of useless headers and no contents in the Local Folders account. Imap accounts can download full copies or only headers and it can do it on a per folder basis. </p><p>Do This: </p> <ul><li> Check the Account Settings &gt; Server Settings for gmail imap account. </li><li> 'when I delete a mesasge' </li><li> Select 'Move it to this folder': </li><li> select: 'Trash or maybe it's called 'Bin' on gmail account' </li></ul> <p>Message Storage: </p> <ul><li> Select 'Clean up (expunge) inbox on Exit' </li></ul> <p>That means compact the Inbox to remove all old traces of moved emails, so file is kept in good order. You can choose to empty the TRash, but gmail will auto do this periodically anyway and it does give you the opportunity to rescue an email you deleted in error. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

So the email is not going to be deleted off the server. </p><p>The email is removed from the 'Inbox' because that is your instruction. Gmail sees you have not put the email in the gmail Trash folder, so it assumes you do not want to delete the email, it assumes you do not want the email in the 'Inbox' so it removes the 'Inbox' label. That means the email is still on server in the 'All Mail' folder. As you subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder in the imap account, it means you get to see a complete copy of everything on the server. You will see all emails received, sent and archived ...all of them in the 'All Mail' folder like a big soup all mixed up in one pot. </p><p>Gmail server only has one folder - it is the 'All Mail' folder. It contains everything. Gmail can offer to add labels to emails to create virtual views of those emails in a sort of 'folder' type display, but all the emails are in the  'All Mail' folder. So in webmail account all those 'folder-style' label names offer a more logical way of viewing emails eg: Inbox, Sent etc.  Each being the result of a virtual display of emails with a tag.  </p><p>Gmail says: If email in 'All Mail' folder is tagged with the label called 'Inbox' then let us see a virtual copy of email in the 'Inbox'. </p><p>Therefore Gmail says there are two things that can be removed: 1: a label 2: an email </p><p>You may wish to remove a label but not delete an email - eg: Archive an email. When gmail archives an email, it removes all labels and keeps the archived email in the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Gmail says To make sure there is no misunderstanding - only emails that are put into the gmail Trash folder will get deleted from the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Hence why I said 'COPY' the email to Local Folders' Then when you know you have a good copy, delete the email in imap Inbox and put it into the gmail imap Trash folder.

Some people have said to me - why did all my emails in the TRash get deleted&nbsp;? Answer&nbsp;: you put email in Trash meaning you do not want the email, Gmail gives you about 30 days to recover the email, just in case you deleted in error - then gmail auto empties the TRash to recover space on server.  Thunderbird imap folders can only show what is on the server.  Any imap account should never be considered as a completely independent copy because it can only display what is on server. </p><p><br> <em>re&nbsp;:How often should I archive them? </em> That depends upon your point of view and it can be a different when using a gmail imap account. </p><p>In a gmail imap account, gmail sees 'Archive' to mean Remove all labels and keep in 'All Mail' folder. That might be suitable for you. But how can you tell what is archived and what is not archived when everything is all in one pot. If you want to keep stuff on server and never see it then it works ok if you do not subscribe to see 'All Mail'. Otherwise, if you subscribe to see 'All Mail' then it will remain listed in that folder. It's the same as moving a filtered email, just the labels get removed. </p><p>Alternative options: Some people create a folder for the year eg: Archive 2020 Then put all emails with a 2020 year date into that folder. Creating a new folder for each year. Some people do an archive once a year, so reset the Archive settings in the Account Settings to point to the new folder, so when you click on Archive it goes to respective folder. </p><p>Others just want to dump  everything into one folder which can get a bit risky if that folder gets very large. Create a gmail imap folder called 'Archives' (OR in webmail account create a label called Archives and subscribe to see it) Set up Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders select checkbox 'keep message archives in: Select 'Other' and choose 'Archives on gmail account' At least this keeps them sorted as 'Archived'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Let's pretend you have created a folder called 'Hubby Mail' This means you can subscribe to see the 'Hubby Mail' folder in Thunderbird, but your wife does not need to subscribe to see that folder. So she will not see that folder. Meaning if it was moved email from imap 'Inbox' into an imap folder called 'Hubby Mail'... You will see emails in that folder, but your wife will just see email disappear from Inbox. </p><p>Gmail sees this as a remove the 'Inbox' label and apply a 'Hubby Mail' label. Email is still in 'All Mail' because all emails are stored in that folder on the server. It needs to be in the 'All Mail' folder in order to allow it to be seen in the 'Hubby Mail' folder. So if both you and wife have subscribed to see 'All Mail' then all emails will still be visible to both of you in that 'All Mail' folder. </p><p><br> If you move to a folder in 'Local Folders' account: Gmail will remove the 'Inbox' label, so netiher you nor your wife will see that email in the imap 'Inbox' folder. But both of you will still see email in the 'All Mail' folder if both of you subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>The only real difference is this:  Moving to an imap folder means you and your wife have the choice of whether you want to see that folder via 'Subscribe', but email must remain in 'All Mail'. You cannot delete the email. </p><p>Moving to a Local Folder means only you see it in Local Folders, but email is still in 'All Mail'. This may may you need to perform an extra delete.  If you want to delete that email once you have a good copy in Local Folders then you either have to delete it from 'All Mail' which is a pain to find emails OR do not use 'Move' - use 'Copy' in filter so it is easy to find and delete from the Inbox. </p><p>If you use a 'Local Folders' folder then you can delete that email off the server as you will have a copy stored on your computer that is totally independent of the server. If you use 'Copy' to Local Folders then the original email will still be in the 'Inbox', this means you can easily find it and then delete it so it goes to the gmail imap 'Trash' folder. Gmail will completely remove it when it auto empties that TRash folder. </p><p>Both you and your wife will see the email disappear from 'Inbox' and appear in 'Trash'. It will also disappear from the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>If you use 'Move' to Local Folders, email is still in 'All Mail' folder, but because that 'All Mail' folder has everything then it a pain to find specific emails, but yes you can delete an email from the  'All Mail' folder.

Data from Inbox tells me that I have 108 unread emails and a total of 124 emails altogether. The 16 Read email topics are still not displaying. All my other folders list emails being present, but none of them show me any of those emails topics.  So I am unable to view any of my many emails, except for those emails in my rebuilt folder that I marked as read in the actual web account. (That's why I now have 108 unread emails.)  All this seems to have started with TB 102.8.0 on Saturday 18/03/2023. How do I get to read all my emails?   Is TB going to fix this problem soon? </p>",billcanwork,false,0,0
