I have read part of the terms and conditions product disclosure and they just about want to know everything (being nasty here, but in my words, like what did you last have to eat, when did you last go to the toilet,where did you last travel to etc, i think you get the point) anyway too much reading and disclosure for me.  </p><p>Now i use Firefox and absolutely love it, and i do contribute dollar wise when i can as i am only on the pension and my wife uses Thunderbird and she loves it. So you can help me in explaining how i can make up a new email address but still use Thunderbird.  </p><p>Now i went into accounts in Thunderbird and imported my wife's Gmail account but now when she gets an Gmail email it goes into her Gmail account as well as into Thunderbird. Is there anyway of creating a new email address in have Thunderbird use it.   </p><p>If i create one in outlook i have to setup outlook but then if she gets an email for outlook once again it goes to outlook and then to Thunderbird. I would just like to create an email address and it just goes to a server and then straight to Thunderbird just like it is/was now. thank you in advance Garry </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",garrytune

I authorized Thunderbird on my hotmail email accounts and it is able to log in and get my emails. But Thunderbird randomly popup up a Microsoft hotmail login box asking me to log into one of my hotmail accounts. Thunderbird is not remembering to not responding the the Microsoft request for a saved password and passes the login prompt to me. </p><p>And even after I log in sometime the save prompt will be asked again sometime later. There seems to be some type of timing issue where Thunderbird is not responding to Microsoft's request for password or Thunderbird is not recognizing the request or something because sometimes it is not passing the saved password to Microsoft. </p><p>Another clue is that randomly I will see the outline of the Microsoft prompt box but no text appear for about 10 seconds and then go away. The box cannot be moved, closed, and is fixed on top of any windows I had open. In this case Thunderbird must have responded to the prompt but late/slow enough for the box to be rendered. This is why I suggested a possible timing or reconfiguration problem. </p><p>This started in August as soon as the 115 version came out and continues today. I have 10 hotmail accounts that Thunderbird is logging into and download messages from every 15 minutes. This also maybe causing a problem with Thunderbird. I would imagine most people do not have this many email accounts with Microsoft. I never have this problem with my gmail account. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",skerichbuy
