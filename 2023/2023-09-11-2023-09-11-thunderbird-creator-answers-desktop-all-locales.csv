I authorized Thunderbird on my hotmail email accounts and it is able to log in and get my emails. But Thunderbird randomly popup up a Microsoft hotmail login box asking me to log into one of my hotmail accounts. Thunderbird is not remembering to not responding the the Microsoft request for a saved password and passes the login prompt to me. </p><p>And even after I log in sometime the save prompt will be asked again sometime later. There seems to be some type of timing issue where Thunderbird is not responding to Microsoft's request for password or Thunderbird is not recognizing the request or something because sometimes it is not passing the saved password to Microsoft. </p><p>Another clue is that randomly I will see the outline of the Microsoft prompt box but no text appear for about 10 seconds and then go away. The box cannot be moved, closed, and is fixed on top of any windows I had open. In this case Thunderbird must have responded to the prompt but late/slow enough for the box to be rendered. This is why I suggested a possible timing or reconfiguration problem. </p><p>This started in August as soon as the 115 version came out and continues today. I have 10 hotmail accounts that Thunderbird is logging into and download messages from every 15 minutes. This also maybe causing a problem with Thunderbird. I would imagine most people do not have this many email accounts with Microsoft. I never have this problem with my gmail account. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",skerichbuy

Unfortunately, I set up Thunderbird on my new pc and started getting and receiving email using the same account I used on the old computer without successfully transferring the profile folder. How can I retrieve all the emails stored on my old computer? I tried replacing the profile folder on my new computer with the one from my old computer, but I only got the most recent emails. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",doug107
