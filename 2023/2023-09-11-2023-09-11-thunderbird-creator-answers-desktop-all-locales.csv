Con l'ultima aggiornamento alla versione 115.2.0 sto avendo un paio di problemi davvero fastidiosi che non mi permettono di utilizzare lo strumento in maniera corretta. Vado per punti: </p><p>1) Ero abituato da decenni a selezionare l'ultimo messaggio del giorno e poi chiudevo Thunderbird. Al prossimo riavvio il programma mi presentava sempre l'ultima schermata aperta e si posizionava esattamente sul messaggio che avevo selezionato in precedenza. Con la versione 11.52.0 mi apre la schermata corretta, ma si posiziona casualmente trai i vecchi messaggi ricevuti, esempio si posiziona sui messaggi di Giugno 2023 e non su l'ultimo di Settembre 2023. Tutte le volte mi tocca a scrollare a mano fino ai messaggi odierni, questo comportamento non lo aveva mai fatto prima. </p><p>2) Ogni volta che cancello un messaggio, automaticamente Thunderbird mi fa uno scrolling e si posiziona sui messaggi di qualche giorno fa (comportamento davvero fastidioso). Quindi la procedura è: - Cancello un messaggio - Thunderbird mi scrolla da solo sui messaggi più vecchi - A mano utilizzo la scrollbar per tornare sull'ultimo messaggio del giorno Non so se sono riuscito a rendere bene l'idea... Qualcuno mi può aiutare&nbsp;? Perché da giorni è diventato difficile usare il programma di posta, grazie.
