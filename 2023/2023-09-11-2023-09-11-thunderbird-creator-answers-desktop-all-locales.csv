I updated to the latest 115 version to see if that would fix it, but it did not. </p><p>my outgoing mail settings are SMTP server are set Security and Authentication, to STARTTLS, and Oauth2. port 587 I have found that it sometimes works, and then for unknown reason stops working.... </p><p>the strange thing is I have another outlook account and it works fine. I have compared settings and they are identical, so the only thing I can think is that MS side is timing out on the log in, or not accepting my password?  When I click on the send button, for just a second I get a popup from outlook, with a blanks screen, I assume it is logging into my office account. it then vanishes. while on TB, there is a dialog box stating ""sending message"" and it sits there until it times out! several minutes later! see attachments. </p><p>Message could not be sent because the connection to outgoing server <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> timed out. </p><p><br> </p><pre>Please someone help me!

Con l'ultima aggiornamento alla versione 115.2.0 sto avendo un paio di problemi davvero fastidiosi che non mi permettono di utilizzare lo strumento in maniera corretta. Vado per punti: </p><p>1) Ero abituato da decenni a selezionare l'ultimo messaggio del giorno e poi chiudevo Thunderbird. Al prossimo riavvio il programma mi presentava sempre l'ultima schermata aperta e si posizionava esattamente sul messaggio che avevo selezionato in precedenza. Con la versione 11.52.0 mi apre la schermata corretta, ma si posiziona casualmente trai i vecchi messaggi ricevuti, esempio si posiziona sui messaggi di Giugno 2023 e non su l'ultimo di Settembre 2023. Tutte le volte mi tocca a scrollare a mano fino ai messaggi odierni, questo comportamento non lo aveva mai fatto prima. </p><p>2) Ogni volta che cancello un messaggio, automaticamente Thunderbird mi fa uno scrolling e si posiziona sui messaggi di qualche giorno fa (comportamento davvero fastidioso). Quindi la procedura è: - Cancello un messaggio - Thunderbird mi scrolla da solo sui messaggi più vecchi - A mano utilizzo la scrollbar per tornare sull'ultimo messaggio del giorno Non so se sono riuscito a rendere bene l'idea... Qualcuno mi può aiutare&nbsp;? Perché da giorni è diventato difficile usare il programma di posta, grazie.

I authorized Thunderbird on my hotmail email accounts and it is able to log in and get my emails. But Thunderbird randomly popup up a Microsoft hotmail login box asking me to log into one of my hotmail accounts. Thunderbird is not remembering to not responding the the Microsoft request for a saved password and passes the login prompt to me. </p><p>And even after I log in sometime the save prompt will be asked again sometime later. There seems to be some type of timing issue where Thunderbird is not responding to Microsoft's request for password or Thunderbird is not recognizing the request or something because sometimes it is not passing the saved password to Microsoft. </p><p>Another clue is that randomly I will see the outline of the Microsoft prompt box but no text appear for about 10 seconds and then go away. The box cannot be moved, closed, and is fixed on top of any windows I had open. In this case Thunderbird must have responded to the prompt but late/slow enough for the box to be rendered. This is why I suggested a possible timing or reconfiguration problem. </p><p>This started in August as soon as the 115 version came out and continues today. I have 10 hotmail accounts that Thunderbird is logging into and download messages from every 15 minutes. This also maybe causing a problem with Thunderbird.
