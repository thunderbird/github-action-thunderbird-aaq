Con l'ultima aggiornamento alla versione 115.2.0 sto avendo un paio di problemi davvero fastidiosi che non mi permettono di utilizzare lo strumento in maniera corretta. Vado per punti: </p><p>1) Ero abituato da decenni a selezionare l'ultimo messaggio del giorno e poi chiudevo Thunderbird. Al prossimo riavvio il programma mi presentava sempre l'ultima schermata aperta e si posizionava esattamente sul messaggio che avevo selezionato in precedenza. Con la versione 11.52.0 mi apre la schermata corretta, ma si posiziona casualmente trai i vecchi messaggi ricevuti, esempio si posiziona sui messaggi di Giugno 2023 e non su l'ultimo di Settembre 2023. Tutte le volte mi tocca a scrollare a mano fino ai messaggi odierni, questo comportamento non lo aveva mai fatto prima. </p><p>2) Ogni volta che cancello un messaggio, automaticamente Thunderbird mi fa uno scrolling e si posiziona sui messaggi di qualche giorno fa (comportamento davvero fastidioso). Quindi la procedura è: - Cancello un messaggio - Thunderbird mi scrolla da solo sui messaggi più vecchi - A mano utilizzo la scrollbar per tornare sull'ultimo messaggio del giorno Non so se sono riuscito a rendere bene l'idea... Qualcuno mi può aiutare&nbsp;? Perché da giorni è diventato difficile usare il programma di posta, grazie.

Set the delivery number of emails that can be set each day &amp; increase that number in incriments each until it reaches a max number (like 50 oer sending email address,) </p><p>3. Use tracking links in emails being sent that will allow Thunderbird to know if the receiveing person has opened the email </p><p>4, Use tracking links in emails being sent that will allow Thunderbird to know if the receiveing person has REPLIED to the email sent </p><p>5. Use an automated follow up email that is ONLY sent to those who did NOT REPLY </p><p>6. Share a central ""email address sent memory file"" - that ensures email addresses are NOT sent an email from another Sending email account on Thunderbird </p><p>7. All ""reply emails"" sent to a ""shared central Inbox"" </p><p>8. If I decide to ""REPLY"" to one of these emails, it will be sent via the SAME email address as the prospect replied to - example ""campaigemail-address@domain.BB""  </p> <hr>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",celticwarrior68

I have read part of the terms and conditions product disclosure and they just about want to know everything (being nasty here, but in my words, like what did you last have to eat, when did you last go to the toilet,where did you last travel to etc, i think you get the point) anyway too much reading and disclosure for me.  </p><p>Now i use Firefox and absolutely love it, and i do contribute dollar wise when i can as i am only on the pension and my wife uses Thunderbird and she loves it.

Is there anyway of creating a new email address in have Thunderbird use it.   </p><p>If i create one in outlook i have to setup outlook but then if she gets an email for outlook once again it goes to outlook and then to Thunderbird.

I authorized Thunderbird on my hotmail email accounts and it is able to log in and get my emails. But Thunderbird randomly popup up a Microsoft hotmail login box asking me to log into one of my hotmail accounts. Thunderbird is not remembering to not responding the the Microsoft request for a saved password and passes the login prompt to me. </p><p>And even after I log in sometime the save prompt will be asked again sometime later. There seems to be some type of timing issue where Thunderbird is not responding to Microsoft's request for password or Thunderbird is not recognizing the request or something because sometimes it is not passing the saved password to Microsoft. </p><p>Another clue is that randomly I will see the outline of the Microsoft prompt box but no text appear for about 10 seconds and then go away. The box cannot be moved, closed, and is fixed on top of any windows I had open. In this case Thunderbird must have responded to the prompt but late/slow enough for the box to be rendered. This is why I suggested a possible timing or reconfiguration problem. </p><p>This started in August as soon as the 115 version came out and continues today. I have 10 hotmail accounts that Thunderbird is logging into and download messages from every 15 minutes. This also maybe causing a problem with Thunderbird. I would imagine most people do not have this many email accounts with Microsoft. I never have this problem with my gmail account. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",skerichbuy
