The login page that's supposed to open up is blank and closes by itself. I'm a highly advanced user. I appreciate your advice, but Windows Security is very weak and it's not advised by leading cybersecurity professionals to run it alone. If one of the devs would like to troubleshoot their own software, I'm all for it. I've posted exactly what happens and there's an account login problem that needs fixed. Since 115 alters the current profile, there's no way to revert back to 102.13.0. There are no updated steps for setting up 115 and I know some things have changed. I would love to be able to send e-mails again from my desktop. If it's not fixed or the steps are updated then I'll have to use Outlook. I'd much rather use Thunderbird. </p>",mrbjk,false,0,0

If TB works, you will probably have to disable any action of Avast on TB, such as MailShield, scanning of secure connections etc., blocking access to certain sites etc.  Better still, just remove Avast and use Windows Security. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,1

Discovering replacement CSS with the new environment will be a matter of individual experimentation. SO, what that means is that some of the CSS tweaks that we have used may not be available in the near future, if at all. CSS is no specialty of mine so I also am waiting to see what new CSS becomes available. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
