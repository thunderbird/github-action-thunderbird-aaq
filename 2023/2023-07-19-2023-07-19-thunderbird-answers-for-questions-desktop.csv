Keeping a unified folder, like your inbox, visible in your favorites after restarting Thunderbird can be a little tricky. Here's a workaround you can try: before closing Thunderbird, make sure you select another folder, then reselect the unified folder you want to keep in your favorites. This should help it stay visible when you restart Thunderbird. If you're up for it, you can also explore Thunderbird add-ons that might provide a more solid solution.

If you feel that this is a bug or a problem, you can implement a workaround. </p><p>To workaround the problem, you have to open the <strong>Config Editor</strong> (at the bottom of the Thunderbird Settings view) and search for key <strong>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets</strong> (just type ""stylesheets"" in the search entry) and set it to <strong>true</strong>. This configures Thunderbird to load custom CSS style for the UI during the startup. </p><p>Now you need to locate the <strong>profile directory</strong>. The easiest way is to use Help – Troubleshooting Information and in the first table click the link ""<strong>about:profiles</strong>"" which contains the button to open the ""Root Directory"". This opens a file manager with lots of files and directories and you can verify you're in correct directory when the directory contains file <strong>prefs.js</strong>. If this directory does not yet have subdirectory called ""<strong>chrome</strong>"", you have to create such a directory (all lowercase letters). Inside that directory, you should create file called ""<strong>userChrome.css</strong>"" (note the uppercase C and everything else in lowercase) with the following contents: </p><p>/****** start of file ******/ @namespace html url(""<a href=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</a>""); </p><p>toolbar-menubar { order: 1; } unified-toolbar { order: 2; } tabs-toolbar { order: 3; } /****** end of file ******/ </p><p>The idea is to configure given UI elements to have non-default order using the CSS property <strong>order</strong> where the smaller number will be rendered earlier in the UI. The UI is made out of XML elements where the elements are <strong>&lt;toolbar-menubar&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;unified-toolbar&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;tabs-toolbar&gt;</strong>.

It is very tedious and the default should be ""no change"" - ever.  Heretical, I realize, for those who hang their hats on UX novelty and the utter ""brilliance"" of their UI/UX visions, but there are very, very few UI/UX changes that are forced to accommodate a security fix or critical operational flaw and while I can abide the premise that UX refreshes keep the product hip and stylish and consistent with the latest trends, existing users are not UX trend chasers. </p><p>Updates should treat UX/UI models as absolutely sacred, absolutely inviolable.

Complaints would plummet and there'd be good data on how many users reject the changes. </p>",gessel,false,3,0

It doesn't solve a core philosophical failure that blights the development process and engenders much frustration and gnashing of teeth among the loyal, long term users: the assumption that what the developers believe is progress is what the users need, it ain't Brondo. </p><p>All of us who are (or were) users of TB (or any program) became so because it did something we needed it to do. Changing that function, even cosmetically, is going to hurt some users, even if there are valid and rational arguments why it is an improvement.  In an environment that embraces the concept of radical consent in so many ways, stuffing an upgrade down the throat of an existing user without even a ""hey, you want this?"" is inconsistent with modern social norms of enlightened behavior. </p><p>It is possible, of course, to reject upgrades, but it is a huge hassle and means blocking all updates, including security fixes, just to avoid the addonpocolypse ones like 68, 78 and 115 that utterly destroy functionality for months, even years as the still (amazingly) dedicated developer community finds ways around problematic API changes (even accepting the changes are meaningful security changes or driven by FF codebase migrations that would be unreasonable to expect to preserve without doing a waterfox kind of fork). The default is to auto-update, as we do for most programs and most of the time without the radical trauma of some TB updates.  </p><p>Not every update breaks add-ons but some do (incorrectly).  Add-ons generally do not self-update on unsupported versions (correctly).  TB should consider add-ons first class code citizens, not trivially disposable cosmetics.  They are operational modifications to a vehicle not JC Witney double stick racer mods.  Users had a legitimate need to modify the base operation of the program, sought out and applied a solution and it isn't acceptable to negate that effort without warning. Every TB update should do what plugins do: check compatibility and refuse to update until the user manually disables any incompatible plugins rather than simply disabling them for the user and saying ""check it out!  new! Sleek!"" (sorry, nothing works anymore, but looks nice, huh?). All reasonable efforts should be made to preserve compatibility indefinitely, but that's obviously not always possible to keep the code base manageable and secure, and it is fine to inform users that there are important security reasons that require breaking plugins, but never, ever to do so without informed, affirmative consent. </p><p>As for UI/UX changes, I'd argue that the philosophy should be no change, not even trivial cosmetic ones, are permitted on an existing install.  Ever.  If you started with TB 0.1 your 115 interface should look exactly like this: <a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-14-at-4.51.00-PM.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-14-at-4.51.00-PM.png</a> unless you explicitly gave informed, affirmative consent to UI/UX changes. </p>",gessel,false,3,0

F9 doesnt seem to have any effect. Thanks for the .sqlite tip. i thought i was going nuts not able to find abooks.mab. </p>",tallenvt,false,0,0

I need to create multiple contact lists every few months, pulling names from a work address book that has 100s of emails in it at this point. The contacts for each mailing list vary, there are 40-90 or more for each contact list, and they are never in consecutive order. </p><p>So, yes, until recently I would use the method described by David, above. But ever since a recent update (I am using 102.13.0 now), control-click does NOT work. Only a single email/contact can be highlighted at once. Maybe this is because of the new pane at the bottom, where we can see details on whichever email is selected above? I mean, clearly that pane can't show more than one contact at once... </p><p>...but if that it the issue, then I would LOVE to be able to turn OFF that pane, because I don't care about seeing full details on a contact most of the time anyway! Clicking and draggin one email/contact at a time, for a list of over 90 emails, is ridiculously inefficient.&nbsp;:( There has got to be a better way! </p>",Quartermoon,false,0,0

And I would like to point out that Thundebird without the addons (respects to their developers) would not exist as a standalone email client before long.

Users are not magicians to discover what works or not. </blockquote> <p>Perhaps,  but it has been 20 years since I saw a real comprehensive manual for any software. </p><p>The issues here are manifold,  and perhaps not helped by David's understanding that sound just does not work with IMAP. </p><p>The wav files generally work,  but Thunderbird has historically been quite picky as to what does and does not actually play.  I never really got to terms with the issues,  but setting the wav file in the account setting and clicking play makes the issues there clearer.  If the sound file plays there,  then it will work with Thunderbird wwhen it get new mail.  If it does not play at that point,  please prompt again and I will go off looking for exactly what the specifications are,  but I think it is something about bit rates and the file being stereo. </p><p>Then we have the issues with when to play the sound file.  Modern IMAP severs support a feature called IDLE.  This has a sub option for push email.  You will find this setting in the server setting as ""allow immediate notifications when new messages arrive.""  This means that mail is immediately forwarded to your mail client when it is received via the IMAP sync process, I am not completely au fait with the IDLE push notifications, but they do only occur for some folders in most implementations, hence the continuing need for timed checks.   </p><p>Use of Idle is distinct from the timed 10 or 15 minute checks for new mail in the settings line above it and like POP this is the time when new mail sounds apply as the delivery mechanism alerts Thunderbird that there is new mail. So I guess the IMAP sounds will be broken if you allow IDLE,  but your mail will arrive slower if you disable it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
