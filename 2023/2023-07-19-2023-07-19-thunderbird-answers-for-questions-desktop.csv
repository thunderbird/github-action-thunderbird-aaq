They both use the same server, but O365 accounts often require additional steps to allow sending.  I set up a consumer Hotmail account in a new profile in TB 115 and it works without issues.

The login page that's supposed to open up is blank and closes by itself. I'm a highly advanced user. I appreciate your advice, but Windows Security is very weak and it's not advised by leading cybersecurity professionals to run it alone. If one of the devs would like to troubleshoot their own software, I'm all for it. I've posted exactly what happens and there's an account login problem that needs fixed. Since 115 alters the current profile, there's no way to revert back to 102.13.0. There are no updated steps for setting up 115 and I know some things have changed. I would love to be able to send e-mails again from my desktop. If it's not fixed or the steps are updated then I'll have to use Outlook. I'd much rather use Thunderbird. </p>",mrbjk,false,0,0
