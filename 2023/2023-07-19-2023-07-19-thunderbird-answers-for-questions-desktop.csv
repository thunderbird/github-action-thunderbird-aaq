Quit Thunderbird if it's running. Open a new Finder window on your Mac. Go to your user home (lil' house icon), hold the Option key on your keyboard then go to the top menu bar to GO and drop down to Library and click to show the hidden user Library .If your Library is already unhidden in your user home, simply select it. Go down to Thunderbird, select it, then select Profiles and choose your default profile. Go down to Mail, select, and delete the ""smart mailboxes"" folders showing there. You might want to move them to a separate folder in your computer temporarily to be safe before deleting. Re-open Thunderbird and, if Unified Folders was already selected you should see them again. If Unified Folders is not at the top of the column, click the three buttons to the right of Unified Folders and choose to ""Move Up."" If Unified Folders is not showing, go to View in the top menu bar to VIew down to Folders and select Unified Folders. You can deselect ""All Folders"" if you wish. </p>",jgtech,false,0,0

You should have no problem updating from 102 to 115. Since it is a major upgrade, I recommend doing a backup prior to the update, if only for protection against any unexpected glitches. As far as moving storage locations, those technical mechanics have not changed. Personally, and not for any technical reasons, I would recommend making the changes for storage now with 102, since you're familiar with that. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

The login page that's supposed to open up is blank and closes by itself. I'm a highly advanced user.

If one of the devs would like to troubleshoot their own software, I'm all for it. I've posted exactly what happens and there's an account login problem that needs fixed. Since 115 alters the current profile, there's no way to revert back to 102.13.0. There are no updated steps for setting up 115 and I know some things have changed. I would love to be able to send e-mails again from my desktop. If it's not fixed or the steps are updated then I'll have to use Outlook. I'd much rather use Thunderbird. </p>",mrbjk,false,0,0
