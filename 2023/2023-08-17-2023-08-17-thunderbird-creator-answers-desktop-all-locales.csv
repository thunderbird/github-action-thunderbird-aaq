For the last week one of them cannot send. A large window for connecting to the outgoing server opens for a moment and then the email freezes and eventually times out. The other sends normally as do all my other email accounts on TBird. I have no trouble when I use x-notifier neo in any browser, so the problem is just on TBird and not on the Hotmail system. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1598265;,lethedoom
