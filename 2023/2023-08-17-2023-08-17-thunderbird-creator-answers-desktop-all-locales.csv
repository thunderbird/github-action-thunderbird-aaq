I'd like to see the feature whereby e-mails from unwanted senders actually bounce as if my e-mail address were not valid.  I think that having a set filter that merely deletes the unwanted sender's message is not adequate albeit somewhat useful. Also, I would like to have the ability to set up things so that only people who are in my address books can send me messages.  Can anyone oblige and do an add-on or build these features into a Thunderbird update? As a blind computer user I do so much appreciate that Thunderbird is quite accessible using the NVDA screen-reader.  Thanks for a good jobb on that. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",wpg67

I check email from my phone, browser, etc. with no problems. Recently, Thunderbird never connects to email server. I use Thunderbird to store my old messages. When this started, I downloaded the most recent Thunderbird and got the same results. I have changed nothing in my setup. I get ""scubadug@netzero.net: Host contacted, sending login information..."" message, which apparently eventually times out. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1598118;,scubadug

After the installation when I opened Thunderbird, all my emails were gone and I had to download Thunderbird and reconfigure it to work with my imap <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> account. Even after that it simply downloaded all my 8,000+ emails to the main folder. This also happened to Firefox (Ver. 116) all my configurations, bookmarks and other data was gone. Firefox started as if I just downloaded it for the first time. </p><p>I can not find my old profiles to restore either program. I tried the ""Restore"" program to try and go back to an earlier version of Windows but that didn't help. I began trying to recall some of the sub folders I had for my Thunderbird mail program. Then Windows again downloaded the update and again everything was lost from both programs. </p><p>I sat down at the computer this morning and it happened again. Thunderbird and Firefox info gone!!! </p><p>Does anyone have any idea what is going on here? Have the boys and girls at Microsoft set up some sort of anti-Mozilla bug in the latest Windows 10 update? I have been using Firefox and Thunderbird for years. Am I going to have to get rid of them and use the MS browser and mail programs now? </p><p>Joe </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",joseph-rowland
