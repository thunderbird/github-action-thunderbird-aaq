I've read lots of articles and forum posts without finding a solution. First thing I've tried is changing font and size in  General -&gt; Language, both the main one and all of them in the advanced settings. I can't see anything change, no matter the settings there? I've restarted the app, still nothing. What does that setting even do? Or is there a secret way to apply it that I don't see? </p><p>Also, if that's not the way, how do I change the font of the message list etc? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",joel70

For the last week one of them cannot send. A large window for connecting to the outgoing server opens for a moment and then the email freezes and eventually times out. The other sends normally as do all my other email accounts on TBird. I have no trouble when I use x-notifier neo in any browser, so the problem is just on TBird and not on the Hotmail system. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",lethedoom
