It will then work with no issue, receives and sends mails, loads all sub folders. It just won't stay.  </p><p>- I can go to account/privacy and view and edit my passwords. I can enter the correct password there and the account itself works and loads mail. If I close and re-open TB, it's still fine. On the 4-5th time of opening and closing, it locks up and starts promting for sign in. </p><p>- I get logged out of one or multiple accounts and get promts to sign back in. These login page windows then cannot be interacted with, at all. They are not displayed correctly, the buttons are just dead and do not react or lead anywhere if I click. Some do the little brightness animation and recognize that I clicked, but nothing continues. I have no ability to enter or submit the gmail credentials in there. </p><p>- I tried navigating those with on-screen keyboard, CTRL +, also with scroll wheel etc., it cannot be resized or interacted with. Also changing the window and screen scaling size (100%/150%) does nothing, I also checked all actual browsers like firefox and chrome and they all have normal zoom, cache and cookie settings. Why is the login page not usable?  </p><p>I know it would probably be fine after reinstall but I just cannot keep doing this. It does not last even a week. I even deleted the profile and re-setup everything several times already, it still comes up with login pages all the time. And if those are not usable then I cannot go forward. </p><p>This is all on a fresh Lenovo Thinkbook G15 that is nearly new. I have never seen software not work this vehemently. I have given all info that I have and all that I tried.
