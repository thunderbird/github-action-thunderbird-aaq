That is, from folder mode menu, tick 'favorite folders' and that will add that category in left sidebar. Then, rightclick your important folders and tick 'favorite folder' and you will then have all your priority folders readily presented.  </p><p>For profile switching, it's rather simple (in my opinion), considering that TB needs to restart to administer a different profile. Maybe the menu is misnamed (?) for that? For example, to create a new profile, the steps are to click help&gt;troubleshooting, scroll to 'profiles', click 'about:profiles' and click 'create profile' button, which lets you name the profile and define where it is to be located. Then, in future, by clicking help&gt;troubleshooting and returning to that about:profiles link, you can pick which profile to open. I agree it isn't a simple menu link, but does work rather well. Another option that I like is to set another shortcut on desktop, with each shortcut invoking a different profile.  </p><p>And we love you too. Thank you for your support. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Mail accounts are independent accounts. </p><p><strong>One IDEA that may work for you - read on....</strong> There is One method you could consider if you are using only <strong>POP</strong> mail accounts for eg: parents Only pop accounts can be merged to use one mail account - eg: Local folders mail account. It's called a Global Inbox. </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unify-your-pop-email-accounts-global-inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unify-your-pop-email-accounts-global-inbox</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Global_Inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Global_Inbox</a> </li></ul> <p>In 'Account Settings' you will still see the list of separate accounts. But in Folder Pane, you will not see them. You do not see the separate account names as all pop accounts come in to the one Local Folders 'Inbox'. Those pop accounts will use 'Local Folders' as their 'group' mail account. But there is nothing stopping you from creating a sort of likeness to a mail account. In 'Local Folders' mail account, you can create a new folder which has the account name or name of parent. It can contain subfolders like it's own Inbox. You can set up message filters to scan the 'TO', 'Cc', 'Bcc' and IF matches parent A email address put in folder X You can even rename 'Local Folders' mail account to say 'Parent Accounts'. So it is possible to set up a Group like organisation using the 'Local Folders' mail account  - BUT it can only be done using POP mail accounts. </p><p><strong>If using IMAP or a mix or you like to separate groups completely:</strong> Setting up a 'profile' to act as a group for certain mail accounts is the natural way to organize groups of accounts if you do not want to clutter up the Folder Pane of one profile. </p><p>If I want to open a different profile then you have a couple of options - (other than the addon mentioned previously).

Note:  that shortcut icon will only work if you have exited Thunderbird first. </p> <ul><li> Create a shortcut icon for Thunderbird and put on desktop then do this: </li><li> Right click on the Thunderbird shortcut icon and select 'Properties' </li><li> In the section where it says 'Target:' </li><li> It will say something like this: ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe""  </li><li> At the end of that line you need: a space and then type <strong>-P</strong> </li><li> So it looks like this:  ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" -P </li><li> click on 'Apply' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <ul><li> This shortcut will now open the 'Profile Manager' - you could rename the Shortcut to say 'Thunderbird Profile Manager' </li></ul> <p>You can use it to Create a new profile Or select which profile you want to open </p><p>If you do not want Thunderbird to auto open on a particular default at start up then uncheck that option. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
