Further investigation since my last post has uncovered a copy of the same email folders on the PC with MS365, so I can put the iiNet laptop aside from the issue before me. But my objective is to get those folders set up so I can see them from WITHIN TB, not outside it - if that is possible.  That would give me ready access to saved messages that I am likely to refer to in the future. The mail folders are located at D:\Thunderbird\sp5uno6a.default\Mail\<a href=""http://exchange.iinet.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">exchange.iinet.net.au</a>.  I assume they were written there when I was using iiNet for email on this PC.  There are two folders for each subject, one an MSF file (which could be an index) and the much more substantial File proper, which I assume contains the saved messages. The most recent activity on folders in this directory corresponds with the date I switched to MS365, confirming that these are the folders I am after. The Account Setting currently on TB for Message Storage shows the Local Directory at D:\Thunderbird\Local Folders. Although I have inserted manually in TB folders with the same names as those saved earlier, and a few of them now have one or two messages stored in them, I cannot find where they are being saved.  I'm guessing that would be where I might save copies of the folders saved earlier.  But mine is an uneducated guess. Any advice that will enable me to copy those email folders to where I could again access them from within TB would be greatly appreciated. </p>",BruceM1,false,0,0

My objective is to place them somewhere inside TB so I can at least refer to them there, preferably in the same account. I have now confirmed that TB is writing the ""new"" mailboxes (ie mailboxes entered into the single account on this TB installation) at C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\sp5uno6a.default\Imapmail\<a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>. As an experiment, with TB closed I copied from my D drive (ie archive location)  to the above address the mail files Amazon (2,802 KB) and Amazon.msf (65 KB), which were saved from a previous account. Now when I open TB and select the folder Amazon, I initially see all the messages stored in this box on my D drive.  After a very short time, they all disappear.  When I check back using Windows Explorer, I find that the file Amazon.msf has been over-written and is now just 4 KB in size.

Although I don't know the mechanics as well as some on this forum, IMAP accounts sync to the server, not to the PC. Since those messages are not on the server, they are removed. It is possible to create the folder online, and then to copy from PC to online folder, but that is a problem-prone process that doesn't work well (I say that after having read of the attempts by others on the forum), but you may want to do that. If you do, I suggest doing only a small percentage at a time. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I went into the apps store to find, ""Applications/Utilities/Console.app"" .But before i got there ""Apple Arcade and Privacy"" popped up. I read some of that - i don't do any gaming and would like to avoid ads, and couldn't find a way to enable me to send crash reports to you. I really do prefer managing my gmail via Thunderbird, but i may not be smart enough to continue. I was not able to find or set anything  that would enable me to send crash reports to Thunderbird or Mozilla. </p><p>Actually - Thunderbird stopped working and i had to ""force quit"", which is what i always do when it freezes for a while.

Suggestions? </p><p>Meanwhile - other problems i've been experiencing include ""text size"" trouble.

This was not always the case - it might have started a year ago.  </p><p>But very recently - when i click on and open an email that's already open, a different email shows up. The only way i've found around that is to close the email and open it again from within my ""Inbox"". </p><p>And today i opened an old email and it was full of gibberish. And one or two other emails were blank. </p><p>And i am behind in my (volunteer) work. Still - it entails a lot of reading and writing and i cannot keep up, without these problems.

It breaks down at step four because you have changed something. 1. Switch on Thunderbird 2. Click hamburger icon  for menu 3. Click New&gt;existing mail account 4. If you’re using a custom domain, you’ll need to click on Configure manually - which I do. 5. Insert full name 6. insert email 7. insert protonmail password 8. click continue 9. for incoming server enter protocol, hostname, port, connection security, authentication method, username 10. for outgoing server enter hostname, port, connection security, authentication method, username 11. Click Done, and you’ll be asked to confirm the exception for the security certificate. Since Proton Mail Bridge uses a certificate locally on your device, this can’t be signed by a certificate authority and requires you to confirm it manually. BUT THIS SCREEN NO LONGER APPEARS how am I meant to confirm it now? I can no longer use Thunderbird. </p>",iankens,false,0,0

If I ask TB to compact my inbox, which right now has about 150 emails (I always file them after reading) the compacting won't finish but will leave a large temporary file which remains stable.
