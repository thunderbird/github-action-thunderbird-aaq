There are add-ons that copy a sent message to the folder from which it was sent, but I presume that as a new user you haven't installed any add-ons.

There may be some tweaks to help, but having 100+ accounts downloading from an old PC is not a stable environment. My suggestion is to either upgrade to a higher performing PC, or to offload the job to several PCs. Thunderbird is but the messenger and there are just so many cpu cycles to do the work. Archiving may help, clearing out trash and cache frequently may help, but, as I see it, that PC needs help. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The report pops up, but my only option is to send it to Apple. I clicked on the link Wayne sent re how to send crash reports. I went into the apps store to find, ""Applications/Utilities/Console.app"" .But before i got there ""Apple Arcade and Privacy"" popped up. I read some of that - i don't do any gaming and would like to avoid ads, and couldn't find a way to enable me to send crash reports to you. I really do prefer managing my gmail via Thunderbird, but i may not be smart enough to continue. I was not able to find or set anything  that would enable me to send crash reports to Thunderbird or Mozilla. </p><p>Actually - Thunderbird stopped working and i had to ""force quit"", which is what i always do when it freezes for a while. The report popped up, ""You quit Thunderbird because of a problem. Click 'Send to Apple' to submit the report to Apple. This information is collected anonymously.""  </p><p>The report is in a window and very long. Sometimes i take screen shots of the beginning, middle and end of a report and save it in my ""Thunderbird crashes"" folder before sending it to Apple. But even when i take several screen shots, that's just a small percentage of the whole report. </p><p>The report is still up, i haven't yet sent it to Apple, or taken any screen shots. Suggestions? </p><p>Meanwhile - other problems i've been experiencing include ""text size"" trouble. I've set it to Calibri medium"" ,but it looks very tiny and people complain it's too small to read. So usually i type my messages in Word, then copy and paste them into emails. This was not always the case - it might have started a year ago.  </p><p>But very recently - when i click on and open an email that's already open, a different email shows up. The only way i've found around that is to close the email and open it again from within my ""Inbox"". </p><p>And today i opened an old email and it was full of gibberish. And one or two other emails were blank. </p><p>And i am behind in my (volunteer) work. Still - it entails a lot of reading and writing and i cannot keep up, without these problems. Maybe i should advertise locally to see if can find someone who knows Thunderbird who can help me. And maybe someone has other suggestions. I will close down all docs and websites in Firefox and update my operating system and see if that helps. I'm still really nervous about 1000s of emails that have disappeared. </p>",patwj,false,0,0
