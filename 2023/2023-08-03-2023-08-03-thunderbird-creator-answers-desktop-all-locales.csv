For example why can't i add a sender to a filter by right clicking on the mail and then in the menus the option would be there&nbsp;? I have a ""shopping"" folder and when i get a notification from amazon or whomever it would be great to right clic this email and add the adress (or subject or whatever) to the ""shopping"" filter which moves the mail to the ""shopping"" folder, no&nbsp;? On the other hand sometimes messages are filtered to a folder (which is what I usually do) without me knowing or asking for it. Is there a better and easier way to make it work&nbsp;? thanks for the help </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jchuillier

Přestože štítky (opakovaně) vytvářím postupně, jejich číslování postupné není a v závěru jsou zpřeházené. Pro přiřazování štítků používám numerickou klávesnici a hodilo by se mi číslování přiřadit dle priority zprávy. Zároveň potřebuji nastavit na 2 počítačích stejné štítkování tak aby se mezi sebou pošta dle štítků synchronizovala Lze vytvořit i více než 9 štítků, případně používat pro přiřazení i jiný symbol než číslo?

I've been using Thunderbird for decades and always liked it until now. </p><p>1.  ""Get messages"" used to be prominent.  Now the only options other than ""Get Messages"" way up top above the standard Windows menu bar is a choice of whether to display a tiny icon below the menu bar to the left of a large button ""+ New Message.""  I want a large button the size of the New Message button with caption ""Get Messages."" </p><p>It doesn't make usage sense to me to make a large New Message button with a small icon to get messages.  I get new messages far more often than I write a new message. </p><p>Is this customizable? </p><p>Or can I move the top menu ""Get Messages--Write--Chat--etc."" below the menu ""File--Edit--View, etc.?"" </p><p>2.  I also don't like the new font family/face for the list of folders window and the ""Subject--Correspondents--Date"" window.  Is there a way I can change the font family/face?  The only options I see are to change the font size and the vertical spacing of the lines with the ""Density"" options. </p><p>3.  I also don't like the new icon in the Task Bar for Thunderbird.  I think it might be a fox curled up, but because it's so small it just looks like an imperfect blue circle with a white center--meaningless.

I am not a technical wizz by any means, but have deduced what I think might be the route cause. However I am not sure how to remedy it exactly. Its on Windows 11 22H2, if that helps. </p><p>Here is the situation as I understand it: </p><p>1. Until yesterday both of the apps on the laptop and desktop machines were running version 102.13.0 and working fine. </p><p>2. Last night, the laptop auto upgraded to 102.14.0, this did not happen on the desktop which remains on 102.13.0. Since then, no emails are being received into the laptop, and when I send a test email it goes through but gives me the pop up: </p><p>""Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors."" </p><p>The tests are not in the sent folder as a result. </p><pre>3. To be safe, I have switched off auto updates on the desktop machine to avoid the same thing happening there. </pre> <p>4. I have checked network/firewall settings to the best of my abilities, and the app is allowed on there. </p><p>5. I have checked the Server Settings and everything is as should be. I played with the SMTP and IMAP server settings switching between SSL/TLS and STARTTLS (and back again), to no avail. </p><p>6. I looked for an even later version to see if maybe that would work, and found 115.1.0. So I updated again but still in issue persists. </p><p>7. My next step would be to try and revert it back to 102.13.0. However I am uncomfortable with the thought of uninstalling the app altogether and redownloading the old version. I am also unsure how to do this/where to find that old download. </p><p><br> Help would be very much appreciated! </p><p>Luke </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",lukew100
