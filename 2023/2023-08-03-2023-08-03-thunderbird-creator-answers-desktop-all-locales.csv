Přestože štítky (opakovaně) vytvářím postupně, jejich číslování postupné není a v závěru jsou zpřeházené. Pro přiřazování štítků používám numerickou klávesnici a hodilo by se mi číslování přiřadit dle priority zprávy. Zároveň potřebuji nastavit na 2 počítačích stejné štítkování tak aby se mezi sebou pošta dle štítků synchronizovala Lze vytvořit i více než 9 štítků, případně používat pro přiřazení i jiný symbol než číslo?

When I receive the meeting invite, it shows correct time in our zime zone. When I accept the invite , metting time changes to the time of an invite sender. I can see our correct time croswed out in an invite and replaced by a sender´s time. Strange think it happens only to the (reoccuring)  invite from US , from Japan it works fine. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1595606;,jkrnavek
