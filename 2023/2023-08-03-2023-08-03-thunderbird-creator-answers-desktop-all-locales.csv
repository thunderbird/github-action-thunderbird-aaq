Last night, the laptop auto upgraded to 102.14.0, this did not happen on the desktop which remains on 102.13.0. Since then, no emails are being received into the laptop, and when I send a test email it goes through but gives me the pop up: </p><p>""Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors."" </p><p>The tests are not in the sent folder as a result. </p><pre>3. To be safe, I have switched off auto updates on the desktop machine to avoid the same thing happening there. </pre> <p>4. I have checked network/firewall settings to the best of my abilities, and the app is allowed on there. </p><p>5. I have checked the Server Settings and everything is as should be. I played with the SMTP and IMAP server settings switching between SSL/TLS and STARTTLS (and back again), to no avail. </p><p>6. I looked for an even later version to see if maybe that would work, and found 115.1.0. So I updated again but still in issue persists. </p><p>7. My next step would be to try and revert it back to 102.13.0. However I am uncomfortable with the thought of uninstalling the app altogether and redownloading the old version. I am also unsure how to do this/where to find that old download. </p><p><br> Help would be very much appreciated! </p><p>Luke </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1594950;,lukew100
