I'm running Thunderbird 115.4.1 on Linux Mint 20.3.  I have Keep message archives in ""Archives"" folder on Local Folders set, and Archive Options set to Keep existing folder structure of archived messages.  I've (apparently) archived a few old messages, I say apparently because they disappeared from the folder they were in so I'm really hoping they still extant somewhere.  And this is a Gmail account using imap. </p><p>Question 1: How do I determine where the archives are stored.  They are not in ~/.thunderbird </p><p>Question 2: how do do I access them if I want to search for a read an old email? </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tim.d.childs

The program said it was up to date (v68 I think) but I then discovered that the 64bit version was up to v115 and it had the necessary ""calendar"" (to see these Invites) built into it so I installed it and everything seemed to be fine after the upgrade except that I lost my Address Book (all the websites I saw said the upgrade would ""handle"" everything and none warned that Address Book should be exported BEFORE upgrading!), however, just from yesterday, TB has stopped downloading messages from (just) ONE of my <a href=""http://ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ntlworld.com</a> accounts! </p><p>When I click 'Get Messages' and look at the bottom I see it accessing all the accounts I have EXCEPT the main one I use! </p><p>Now, recently, for some unknown reason, Virgin Media LOCKED this mail account and I had to go through a whole load of palaver to get it up and running again!  This, of course, involved accepting a new, ridiculously complex, password for the mail account but I did all that and once I had entered the new password into TB, the account worked fine all of last week. </p><p>However, as of yesterday, TB has stopped even trying to fetch the mail from the ntlworld server associated with my main email address (it gets the messages from my other ntlworld addresses no problem) and I can still SEND emails from my main ntlworld address!  </p><pre>I looked in the saved passwords and noted that the new password is there against the <a href=""http://smtp.ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ntlworld.com</a> linked to this email address but there is no sign of a <a href=""http://pop3.ntlworld.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop3.ntlworld.com</a> line for this account or the associated password! </pre> <p>I can find no  advice on how to manually add in this account and its password for a pop3 server and wondered if that was why TB was not downloading messages from that server/account anymore? </p><p>I have already tried deleting popstate.dat for the a/c in question and even tried deleting global-messages-db.sqlite (which meant I had to go into EVERY webmail for ALL of my accounts and delete ALL the messages in them to avoid the possibility of re-downloading thousands of emails!!!) but my suspicion is that the account not being listed in the saved passwords (just for pop3, the smtp password is there alongside this email address) is the root of the problem. </p><p>TB doesn't ASK me for a password for this account when getting messages it just doesn't attempt to fetch them from that account/server at all! (Everything is all properly set up &amp; the account IS 'ticked' to be included when getting mail!) </p><p>Any ideas what the problem (actually) is and how to fix it?  Any help is much appreciated, thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1617859;,wb.cameron
