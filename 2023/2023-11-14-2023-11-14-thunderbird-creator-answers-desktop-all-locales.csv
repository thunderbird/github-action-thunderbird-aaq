Three accounts are working as usual, but one account is affected by an issue since a couple of days,  after I have sent out an e-mail with the following options: -	Request Receipt confirmation (MDN) -	Request Delivery confirmationDSN -	Save copy to Inbox  The situation now is: 1.	When opening a new incoming message by double-klick this one will be opened in a new window prepared already as „Answer“. That means:  o	In the right upper corner the buttons „Answer“, „Forward“, Archive“,… are missing. o	In the left upper corner the button „send“ is already available.  o	The field for the target address is already filled. 2.	Normally the following message should occure: ”To save your private sphaere Thunderbird has blocked external contens”, together with the option to show the external contens. But now instead: No such message, no such option available. 3.	Following message instead:  o	No Identity has been found matching the e-mail address from the „From“-field.   …… 4.	The address field is already filled by address of the sender 5.	URL’s sent by the sender are not working. 6.

A legutolsó frissítés után aktiválódott a témacsoport funkció. Sajnos a levelező partnereim - ez lehet csak nálam jelentkezik - a ""tárgy"" mező kitöltését teljesen kaotikusan és össze vissza kezelik. Ezt azt jelenti hogy nem feltétlenül abban a témában írnak levelet ami a téma, hanem elővesznek egy korábbi levelet amit nekem írtak és valami teljesen más témáú levelet írnak mint ami az ereseti téma. Ez szerintem a levelezési kulra hiánya, de nem tudok vele mit kezdeni... </p><p>A kérdésem az lenne, hogy hogyan tudom a ""témacsoport"" funkciót kikapcsolni?
