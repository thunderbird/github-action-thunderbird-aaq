I'm running Thunderbird 115.4.1 on Linux Mint 20.3.  I have Keep message archives in ""Archives"" folder on Local Folders set, and Archive Options set to Keep existing folder structure of archived messages.  I've (apparently) archived a few old messages, I say apparently because they disappeared from the folder they were in so I'm really hoping they still extant somewhere.  And this is a Gmail account using imap. </p><p>Question 1: How do I determine where the archives are stored.  They are not in ~/.thunderbird </p><p>Question 2: how do do I access them if I want to search for a read an old email? </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tim.d.childs
