This was to ensure that my computer quick-backup utility would save emails.  I followed Mozilla instructions and all went well, everything seems still to work just fine, except that one POP email account shows nothing in the appropriate Thunderbird Inbox now.  Sent messages show up, and new incoming messages to that account go into the Inbox and show, but all the old ones from before the location change just don't populate the Inbox listing area.  The Inbox file at the new location has messages in it, I can see and read them with Notepad, but there's no corresponding Inbox message list for that one account.  What could have gone wrong, and is it possible to somehow 'activate' the old messages so they show, or move them again from the original AppData/Roaming location to the new one?
