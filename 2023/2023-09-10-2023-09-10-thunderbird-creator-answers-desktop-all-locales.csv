I've assumed it's better to cull all email addresses related to those email accounts before severing all ties. </p><p>What I tried: Followed this thread <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1255223"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1255223</a> </p><p>I can't upgrade to v60 with Vista. I modified advanced config and added strict config Boolean setting and set to false and added check compatibility 59.2 setting and set to false. </p><p>The email crawler add on still gives me not compatible error. I restarted Thunderbird and that didn't help, unfortunately. </p><p>What can I do? </p><p>Again, my two main concerns are 1) harvest email address on my dead email accounts so I can send notifications of my new email addresses and 2) prepare to move all Thunderbird stuff to new desktop once I have working wireless internet to facilitate. </p><p>Thank you for your patience with my explanation and any help you can provide. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1602751;1602838;1602953;1602987;1603379;1603543;1603746;1603979;1604046;,eden5
