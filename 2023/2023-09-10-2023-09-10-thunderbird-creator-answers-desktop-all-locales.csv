I have read part of the terms and conditions product disclosure and they just about want to know everything (being nasty here, but in my words, like what did you last have to eat, when did you last go to the toilet,where did you last travel to etc, i think you get the point) anyway too much reading and disclosure for me.  </p><p>Now i use Firefox and absolutely love it, and i do contribute dollar wise when i can as i am only on the pension and my wife uses Thunderbird and she loves it. So you can help me in explaining how i can make up a new email address but still use Thunderbird.  </p><p>Now i went into accounts in Thunderbird and imported my wife's Gmail account but now when she gets an Gmail email it goes into her Gmail account as well as into Thunderbird. Is there anyway of creating a new email address in have Thunderbird use it.   </p><p>If i create one in outlook i have to setup outlook but then if she gets an email for outlook once again it goes to outlook and then to Thunderbird. I would just like to create an email address and it just goes to a server and then straight to Thunderbird just like it is/was now. thank you in advance Garry </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1602886;,garrytune
