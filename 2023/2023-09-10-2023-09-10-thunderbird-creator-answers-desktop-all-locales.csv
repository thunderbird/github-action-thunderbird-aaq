1423490,2023-09-10 03:40:13 -0700,2023-09-10 03:40:13 -0700,Problem importing emails,"<p>I installed Thunderbird on a new HD, and it appears to be running OK. I have now tried to import all my old emails, but this is where I have a problem. I selected 'Import from a file' as I had exported the emails to a separate HD. When I opened the ext HD I noticed the file said .zip, so I thought I should unzip it, this maybe where I went wrong.  Then I selected 'Import a backed up profile' - already ticked was 'Import from a profile default' but I changed that to 'Choose a profile folder' and aded the one from my extHD. Once I had clicked 'Start import' an error message came up 'Import failed unexpectedly, more information may be available in the Error Console' So this is where I am at - and I have no idea where or what the 'Error Console' is. What have I done wrong, and what do I do now&nbsp;? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tisrplace

Firat I thought this is related to Birthday reminders, but it is also true for events I have added to the standard calendar via Thunderbird. </p><p>Sorry if this is a double post, but I only found similar issues with older versions of Thunderbird and a plugin for the calendar. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",g.steinwender

The former to place composed emails in the Outbox and the later to send emails from the Outbox. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Get/Send extension is no longer supported in V115. Send Later is still there and working. </p><p>Thunderbird provides send unsent messages via the File menu or a right click on the Outbox. It would be much smoother and consistent for there to be a Send Unsent button on the main mail toolbar.  </p><p>Please take this as a request to provide the above at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",bazzaman

First, I have more tech problems than I can shake a stick at and I m dealing with concussion and screens (monitors, cell phone, etc) aggravates and I don't track as well online as usual, so I'm asking for help sooner than I would hoping y'all can break it down very smply for me. Thanks for reading. </p><p>Thunderbird v.59.2 on Windows Vista desktop. Yup, Vista&nbsp;:-) Cable provider died, so years of emails to addresses using isp-provided email addresses are in Thunderbird but can't use emails. </p><p>In short term got TMobile 5G wireless and it is hideous, beware! For now I use my cell as hotspot to get on internet on old desktop. </p><p>I'll list what I've tried in a sec, but here's my ultimate goal: I want to get AT&amp;T fiber installed and hooked up on new desktop (Windows 11) and install latest thnder bird there and bring over old files. Before installing at&amp;t I have to formally cancel with former cable provider (it's in an odd limbo). I've assumed it's better to cull all email addresses related to those email accounts before severing all ties. </p><p>What I tried: Followed this thread <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1255223"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1255223</a> </p><p>I can't upgrade to v60 with Vista. I modified advanced config and added strict config Boolean setting and set to false and added check compatibility 59.2 setting and set to false. </p><p>The email crawler add on still gives me not compatible error. I restarted Thunderbird and that didn't help, unfortunately. </p><p>What can I do? </p><p>Again, my two main concerns are 1) harvest email address on my dead email accounts so I can send notifications of my new email addresses and 2) prepare to move all Thunderbird stuff to new desktop once I have working wireless internet to facilitate. </p><p>Thank you for your patience with my explanation and any help you can provide. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",eden5
