I have now tried to import all my old emails, but this is where I have a problem. I selected 'Import from a file' as I had exported the emails to a separate HD. When I opened the ext HD I noticed the file said .zip, so I thought I should unzip it, this maybe where I went wrong.  Then I selected 'Import a backed up profile' - already ticked was 'Import from a profile default' but I changed that to 'Choose a profile folder' and aded the one from my extHD. Once I had clicked 'Start import' an error message came up 'Import failed unexpectedly, more information may be available in the Error Console' So this is where I am at - and I have no idea where or what the 'Error Console' is. What have I done wrong, and what do I do now&nbsp;? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1602728;,tisrplace
