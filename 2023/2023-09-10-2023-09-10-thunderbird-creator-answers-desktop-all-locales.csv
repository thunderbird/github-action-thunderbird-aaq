I've updated the software, this still hasn't helped.   Can anyone give any guidance as to why this is happening.   Search function has been a great tool, but it now seems to only show search results from July 2023 and earlier - not good&nbsp;:( Thanks for the help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1602693;,gmc455

When I search for the emails sent to the group nothing shows up. If I search for sent emails based upon a name in the group it also does not show up. It also appears that if a member of the group responds to ""reply all"" although I receive the email it also cannot be searched for. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1602694;,garylsmithmail

First, I have more tech problems than I can shake a stick at and I m dealing with concussion and screens (monitors, cell phone, etc) aggravates and I don't track as well online as usual, so I'm asking for help sooner than I would hoping y'all can break it down very smply for me. Thanks for reading. </p><p>Thunderbird v.59.2 on Windows Vista desktop. Yup, Vista&nbsp;:-) Cable provider died, so years of emails to addresses using isp-provided email addresses are in Thunderbird but can't use emails. </p><p>In short term got TMobile 5G wireless and it is hideous, beware! For now I use my cell as hotspot to get on internet on old desktop. </p><p>I'll list what I've tried in a sec, but here's my ultimate goal: I want to get AT&amp;T fiber installed and hooked up on new desktop (Windows 11) and install latest thnder bird there and bring over old files. Before installing at&amp;t I have to formally cancel with former cable provider (it's in an odd limbo). I've assumed it's better to cull all email addresses related to those email accounts before severing all ties. </p><p>What I tried: Followed this thread <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1255223"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1255223</a> </p><p>I can't upgrade to v60 with Vista. I modified advanced config and added strict config Boolean setting and set to false and added check compatibility 59.2 setting and set to false. </p><p>The email crawler add on still gives me not compatible error. I restarted Thunderbird and that didn't help, unfortunately. </p><p>What can I do? </p><p>Again, my two main concerns are 1) harvest email address on my dead email accounts so I can send notifications of my new email addresses and 2) prepare to move all Thunderbird stuff to new desktop once I have working wireless internet to facilitate. </p><p>Thank you for your patience with my explanation and any help you can provide. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",eden5
