Deleted everything from win.10. The minute the new Tbird  115. Tried to install. A pop up window said my password and user name failed to connect to my server Spectrum. no matter how many times I tried latest config. And password . It would continue to reject it. I only have one email address for 15 years. But it keeps rejecting the password.  Tried switching from pop3 to IMAP. Can’t get past the log in box. And therefore I can’t get a blank, clean new install. I have deleted every remnant of Tbird.  I’ve tried this 30 times this past month. And the same result happens. The pix show what happened the first time I tried to reinstall. Now I can’t even get to those options.  All that happens is the constant rejection of either the password or the server domain name. Like spectrum “(<a href=""http://mail.two.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.two.com</a>) or <a href=""http://mail.spectrum.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.spectrum.net</a>. Those are Spectrum’s server domain names that always worked. And still do.Just not with MY Tbird.  I don’t want to have to surrender and switch to Outlook. I love Tbird. I started using it in the days when it was part of Netscape in 1998. </p><p>Please help thanks  Michael </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1593356;1593360;,expo21
