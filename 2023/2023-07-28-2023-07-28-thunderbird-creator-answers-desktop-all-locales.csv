I read all posted solutions that were not of real help, like folder rights, and so on.  I had the same issue today, and realized that the mail file size and the writing rights are not the real issue, and reinstalling software As Administrator did not help at all. </p><p>I noticed that when I installed the latest version of Thunderbird, the headers would not load, but I coud load messages only at 352 messages at the time until the ""write error"" came up.  The Gmail Inbox covered couple years, and the mail file hidden deep within Windows 11 Roaming folder was over 3GB.  The Thunderbird account was installes as POP. </p><p>How the installation got fixed: 1. Just in case, I copied the Mail folder from C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\zkwmmr59.default-release\Mail 2. Uninstalled Thunderbird, rebooted and installed As Administrator (original version was just installed by file Open).  After installation software came up with the POP account, and the original write error. 2. I removed present Gmail account Settings\Account\Settings\Account Actions\Remove Account, and then in Account Actions added MAPI account for Gmail. </p><p>This has resolved the write to folder prohibition issue, doesn't make much sernse, but it works, and software started to download headers, and now continues to download all messages, no issues observed. So as it looks now Thunderbird, v.115.01 fails with POP settings, but works with Gmail MAPI. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",2kkrys

Deleted everything from win.10. The minute the new Tbird  115. Tried to install. A pop up window said my password and user name failed to connect to my server Spectrum. no matter how many times I tried latest config. And password . It would continue to reject it. I only have one email address for 15 years. But it keeps rejecting the password.  Tried switching from pop3 to IMAP. Can’t get past the log in box. And therefore I can’t get a blank, clean new install. I have deleted every remnant of Tbird.  I’ve tried this 30 times this past month. And the same result happens. The pix show what happened the first time I tried to reinstall. Now I can’t even get to those options.  All that happens is the constant rejection of either the password or the server domain name. Like spectrum “(<a href=""http://mail.two.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.two.com</a>) or <a href=""http://mail.spectrum.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.spectrum.net</a>. Those are Spectrum’s server domain names that always worked. And still do.Just not with MY Tbird.  I don’t want to have to surrender and switch to Outlook. I love Tbird. I started using it in the days when it was part of Netscape in 1998. </p><p>Please help thanks  Michael </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1593356;1593360;,expo21
