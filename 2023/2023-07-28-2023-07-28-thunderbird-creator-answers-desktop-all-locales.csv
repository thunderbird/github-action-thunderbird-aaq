I've looked everywhere for an easier way to contact you through e-mail, chat or through calls but posting a thread and hoping you see my post looks to be the only way to reach your support. I can of course describe my inbox, saved messages, etc. I know my father went through the same process and actually went about calling you to get his thunderbird account fixed but this was a few years ago, so if anyone knows of a better way of contacting them other than this post I would appreciate the help. </p>",download-and-install_1;notathunderbirdproblem;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1593574;,Beanman23

I read all posted solutions that were not of real help, like folder rights, and so on.  I had the same issue today, and realized that the mail file size and the writing rights are not the real issue, and reinstalling software As Administrator did not help at all. </p><p>I noticed that when I installed the latest version of Thunderbird, the headers would not load, but I coud load messages only at 352 messages at the time until the ""write error"" came up.  The Gmail Inbox covered couple years, and the mail file hidden deep within Windows 11 Roaming folder was over 3GB.  The Thunderbird account was installes as POP. </p><p>How the installation got fixed: 1. Just in case, I copied the Mail folder from C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\zkwmmr59.default-release\Mail 2. Uninstalled Thunderbird, rebooted and installed As Administrator (original version was just installed by file Open).  After installation software came up with the POP account, and the original write error. 2. I removed present Gmail account Settings\Account\Settings\Account Actions\Remove Account, and then in Account Actions added MAPI account for Gmail. </p><p>This has resolved the write to folder prohibition issue, doesn't make much sernse, but it works, and software started to download headers, and now continues to download all messages, no issues observed. So as it looks now Thunderbird, v.115.01 fails with POP settings, but works with Gmail MAPI. </p>",fix-problems;gmail;probablynotathunderbirdproblem;pop;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",2kkrys
