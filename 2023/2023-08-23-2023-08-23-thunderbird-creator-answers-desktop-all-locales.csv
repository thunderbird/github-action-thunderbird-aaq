I've actually used its predecessor, Eudora, since 1993, including on a virtual machine the past decade or more; but in a few weeks Eudora will no longer be accepted for use by my institution due to outdated security protocols. I've been studying online TB documentation but remain confused on multiple issues. </p><p>One of the reasons I used Eudora for so long was because I could locally store outgoing and incoming emails so as to work with them when offline (airplanes, etc.) I'd archive the two boxes twice a year, renaming them, so as to keep my primary in and out box small enough to function smoothly. Thus I have 50 or so archived in boxes across decades, and another 50 or so outboxes. I keep all but the last year's on an external drive but rely on accessing the immediate past year's archived boxes simply by reaching into Eudora's Mailbox menu and choosing one to examine. </p><p>I'm starting fresh with TB and have created Local Folders, apparently, for my Sent and In boxes; so that would seem a good start. </p><p>(1) Will I forever have just one of each, growing eternally; or, as in Eudora, can I periodically export or copy contents to an additional, createable box that I can then access at will via some TB menu option? The documentation I've read in Help regarding Global Inboxes, Unified Folders, and more have my head spinning. </p><p>(2) I do have my preceding Eudora archived boxes on my computer. They sit as ""Unix Executable File"" format but are read immediately by Eudora. Would I be able to point TB to those periodically to read and search them, or will those files never be readable by TB? </p><p>(3) I am willing to reformat my Eudora address book contents manually as needed for TB. But I have exported it from Eudora into several formats, including csv and Excel. Should I just import one of those into TB and see what it does, or is there an example of expected entry formatting I should observe. </p><p>(4) For my eyes, in Eudora I displayed fonts at size 22 and printed 12. No matter what I set in TB preferences, the visual result remains small (looks like size 12 to me). </p><p>That's it for now. Apologies for any denseness exhibited above! </p><p>Best, </p><p>Tony </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",ajgarcia2
