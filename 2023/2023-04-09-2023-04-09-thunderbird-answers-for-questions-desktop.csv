IMAP sync may cause problems otherwise. IMAP accounts are good if you access the account from more than one device, such as phone and PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In the past this problem did not occur. </p><p>It turns out that cPanel seems to have a new bug in it, so that at least under certain circumstances it will fail to update a free automatic certificate. Previous experience shows that cPanel does not immediately fix bugs in its products, perhaps leaving them to be fixed in a future release. </p><p>I would like to leave this question posted here, so that it can help others who run into the same cPanel bug. The solution in my case was to ask my computer operators to update the certificate manually using the management tools (probably WHM). This instantly solved the problem. </p>",David536,false,0,0

After more than a year of trouble-free use, TB suddenly became unable to connect to my GoDaddy Office365 email accounts on or about April 7th. TB is still able to connect to my Gmail and an IMAP account that I have. </p><p>I too called GoDaddy email support. I was told that Microsoft Office365 (of which GoDaddy is a ""reseller"") has been in the process of switching server types (to ""Exchange"" I think but I'm not sure). Anyway, the GD guy said ""free"" Thunderbird is no longer compatible with the servers. He mentioned something about a ""pay"" version of TB that is compatible. Perhaps he meant a ""pay"" add-on for TB? </p><p>Caution, take the above with a grain of salt as the minutia of email servers, clients, exchanges, etc is lost on me. </p><p>Anyway, I switched over to Outlook desktop client as it came with Office 2021 that I purchased.

I did 2 accounts manually and 2 using the automatic option: - The manually setup accounts could receive and send messages but while the sent messages were received by the recipient, they were not copied to the sent folder and were not synced with the OL online accounts. </p><pre> Note that the server type on TB is listed as owl-ews </pre> <p>- The accounts created automatically at this time work fine, messages are received and sent correctly and the sent messages are copied to the sent folder and everything syncs accurately with the online OL accounts. </p><pre>  Note that the server type on TB is listed as owl     </pre> <p>- I then re-set up the 2 manual accounts automatically and at this time, they are working correctly. </p><p>The one problem that I am now having is that I have several non-working accounts on TB: - the 4 original IMAP accounts that stopped working on 4/7/23  and: - the 2 manually set up accounts with the owl-ews server type plus one duplicate account that I don't know how it got there &nbsp;:) for a total of 3 While the 4 original accounts are completely non-operational, the 3 owl-ews accounts all receive messages sent to the the working owl accounts </p><p>I am hesitant to delete any of these redundant accounts as I don't know if deleting one would delete all and I would lose all the data. I used the original IMAP accounts to set up the owl supported accounts so if I were to delete the owl-ews accounts, would this: - delete the working owl accounts and also delete the original IMAP accounts? </p><p>I sent an email to owl.support@beonex.com on 4/12/23 but have not yet heard back from them. Hence, if anyone is familiar with the account deletion process on TB, I would very much appreciate their advice. </p>",Aegeri1046,false,0,0

Deleting one will not delete all the others. </em> P.S. Since Owl 1.0.2, you do not need to use EWS for additional accounts. Owl 1.0.2 supports multiple Exchange accounts on the same server via OWA. Please try EWS or EAS, only if it fails with OWA.""<em> </em> </p><p>I hope that my experience with Microsoft Office365 Outlook email accounts abrupt change to Exchange servers and the subsequent solutions to get TB working again will help others you have encountered the same problems. </p>",Aegeri1046,false,0,0
