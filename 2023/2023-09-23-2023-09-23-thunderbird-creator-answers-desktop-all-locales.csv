I need to sort by tags &amp; group them, in order leave the<strong> untagged at the top</strong> so I can see what I have left to tag.  </p><p>If I use the tag feature now it will let me select one or more that I have already tagged but <strong>completely</strong> leaves out the option to see my UNtagged messages.  Am I missing something?  I know everyone hates change, this new version went way too far in my opinion with the number of ""improvements"" thrown at the user at once.   </p><p>I need the sortby group on tags back PLEASE!!!!!! or tell me how to do it another way if I have to. </p><p>IMO Its going to be overwhelming for the average user and I'm much savvier than most for my age and we work in software development too and have to release new versions to our clients.  So I get it.   But man, this new version is slowing down my work flow - Shift M was my friend to move emails into client folders - yes, I found its now CTR SHFT M to move but I set it back to Shift M until they take that away.    </p><p>Not a fan at all and I work on MAC and PC's  I miss having the number of read and unread total in the lower right - turning on the read and unread only works on the folder level and quite frankly it gives me ptsd to see all the total number of emails I've handled in 25 years in each folder.  I just need to see the inbox.    </p><p>I really hope the tag /sort group feature comes back - PLEASE </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",mariah2

There was zero delay on the prior version to open a folder, so it appears to be specific to Supernova.
