There was zero delay on the prior version to open a folder, so it appears to be specific to Supernova. I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned it on the forums yet, so it seems it might just be something about my particular setup. Can anyone help me diagnose what I might be doing wrong? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",lowraxe
