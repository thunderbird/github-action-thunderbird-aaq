This is one I have not used in a year or so, not since upgrade to Supernova.  When I try to send a message from this little-used comcast account I get this failure note: ""An error occurred while sending mail.  The mail server responded: Please ensure your email address and authenticating user match when sending messages.  Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again."" </p><p>My other 2 comcast accounts work just fine. </p><p>I have reviewed the account setting and can find nothing amiss.  The only difference between the two good ones and the bad one is my name and the email address.  The outgoing servers are the same &lt;<a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a>&gt;, the server names and types are the same: IMAP Mail Server, <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a>, the Ports are the same: 993, the connection security is the same: SSL/TLS, and the authentication is the same: Normal Password. And as far as I can tell I have not changed anything in this account since it worked well about a year ago. </p><p>What am I missing?  Do you have any suggestions?  I am unsure what the message means by ""authenticating user."" </p><p>Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",eberger5

I am 81 and don't know tech language but I need help please. I just want my email back the way it has been for 20 years. Thank you. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",heartbeat1

It's driving me insane. Not very pleased with the last version release. It also takes up a hell of a lot more space than the old version which I'd rather like to go back to. </p>,fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",patrice19
