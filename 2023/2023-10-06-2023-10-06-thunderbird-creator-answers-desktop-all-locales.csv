1426444,2023-10-05 19:57:38 -0700,2023-10-05 19:57:38 -0700,115 breaks IMAP folder hierarchy rendering Thunderbird unusable,"<p>Most of my work life is in email. Over 25 years (starting with Mulberry) I have built up a custom IMAP folder hierarchy that makes work manageable, but Thunderbird 115 has broken this, now displaying nested subfolders at the top level sorted alphabetically. See the images for before and after. For example, there are now three ""Administrative"" folders that were formerly classified under superordinate folders for my roles as lab leader, graduate program chair, and departmental faculty member. Persons who used to be in Colleagues or Students subfolders are now at top level. Inexplicably, a few folders retained their hierarchy but most are flattened out. Now I need to scroll through hundreds of folders (have not counted recently but in the late 2000's I had over 500.)  </p><p>I was able to revert to 112.14 using backups, but will be stuck with this version for the rest of my career unless Thunderbird fixes these problems. Thunderbird is so important to me that I make an automated monthly donation to the project, but will have to cancel if this is not fixed. </p><p>If anyone has found a work around please LMK. And Thunderbird team, please acknowledge and LMK whether this will be addressed or are IMAP users left behind?  </p><p>Thanks, Dan Suthers </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dan_suthers

When I select ""continue"" I get a confirmation that the configuration was found in the Mozilla ISP database, but when I select ""Done"" I get a message that it is ""unable to log in at server.""

This is one I have not used in a year or so, not since upgrade to Supernova.  When I try to send a message from this little-used comcast account I get this failure note: ""An error occurred while sending mail.  The mail server responded: Please ensure your email address and authenticating user match when sending messages.  Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again."" </p><p>My other 2 comcast accounts work just fine. </p><p>I have reviewed the account setting and can find nothing amiss.  The only difference between the two good ones and the bad one is my name and the email address.  The outgoing servers are the same &lt;<a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a>&gt;, the server names and types are the same: IMAP Mail Server, <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a>, the Ports are the same: 993, the connection security is the same: SSL/TLS, and the authentication is the same: Normal Password. And as far as I can tell I have not changed anything in this account since it worked well about a year ago. </p><p>What am I missing?  Do you have any suggestions?
