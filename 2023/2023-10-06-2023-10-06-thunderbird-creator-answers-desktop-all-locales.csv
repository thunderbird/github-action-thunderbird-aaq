Se mi sposto da una cartella all'altra il cursore non si posiziona più sull'ultima e-mail ricevuta ma a caso su un vecchio messaggio magari a metà del mio elenco, quindi devo scorrere fino alla fine per vedere gli ultimi messaggi ricevuti. Un altro problema si presenta quando utilizzo il campo cerca in alto, prima mi compariva un elenco di messaggi che contenevano quello che avevo cercato, cliccavo sul messaggio e si apriva il messaggio. Adesso quando clicco sul messaggio che mi interessa mi si apre un ulteriore elenco di messaggi come se facesse un'altra ricerca e mostrasse altri risultati in cui devo andare a ritrovare il messaggio che cercavo. Non vorrei tornare indietro di versione perchè in questa sono state apportate modifiche interessanti ma questi due ""bug"" stanno facendo impazzire me e il mio staff. Spero che qualcuno possa aiutarmi. </p><p>Grazie </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,"",marcomonte105

For example, there are now three ""Administrative"" folders that were formerly classified under superordinate folders for my roles as lab leader, graduate program chair, and departmental faculty member. Persons who used to be in Colleagues or Students subfolders are now at top level. Inexplicably, a few folders retained their hierarchy but most are flattened out.
