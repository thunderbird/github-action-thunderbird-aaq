I browse messages in split view, rightclick-delete unwanted messages from the message list on top. The new version - unlike the pre-115 - automatically selects (and opens in bottom pane) the next message closest to the deleted one. Needless to say this is a huge security flaw. I never want to auto-select or auto-open an unknown message. </p><p>I am aware of the advanced ""mail.delete_matches_sort_order"" and the ""close message window/tab on move or delete"" switches, neither does anything useful anymore. I have an old, safe message at the top of my message list (sorted on oldest first), selected and opened while browsing the list, and in the previous version, even in the worst case it always kept viewing this safe message. But now it always switches selection to a neighbor (DOWN in the list) of the deleted message - but a neighbour of an unsafe message is usually another unsafe message regardless of sort type. </p><p>The only temporary workaround I see atm is leftclick-drag messages to trash, but this is also unsafe because of occassional doubleclick. Thunderbird cannot be used safely atm? Should this horrible change be filed as a bug report somewhere?

Over 25 years (starting with Mulberry) I have built up a custom IMAP folder hierarchy that makes work manageable, but Thunderbird 115 has broken this, now displaying nested subfolders at the top level sorted alphabetically. See the images for before and after. For example, there are now three ""Administrative"" folders that were formerly classified under superordinate folders for my roles as lab leader, graduate program chair, and departmental faculty member. Persons who used to be in Colleagues or Students subfolders are now at top level. Inexplicably, a few folders retained their hierarchy but most are flattened out. Now I need to scroll through hundreds of folders (have not counted recently but in the late 2000's I had over 500.)  </p><p>I was able to revert to 112.14 using backups, but will be stuck with this version for the rest of my career unless Thunderbird fixes these problems. Thunderbird is so important to me that I make an automated monthly donation to the project, but will have to cancel if this is not fixed. </p><p>If anyone has found a work around please LMK. And Thunderbird team, please acknowledge and LMK whether this will be addressed or are IMAP users left behind?  </p><p>Thanks, Dan Suthers </p>",other;tb115;tb115unified;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1608731;,dan_suthers
