This might seem convenient, but I don't want Thunderbird to be active at all when I have the program closed. If other people want this functionality, and my guess is that they do, there should be a way to opt out of it.

I did hear back from you all on the duplicates, and for a long time, I could tell you thought it was user error.

Persons who used to be in Colleagues or Students subfolders are now at top level. Inexplicably, a few folders retained their hierarchy but most are flattened out.
