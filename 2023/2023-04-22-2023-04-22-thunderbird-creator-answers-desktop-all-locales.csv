On my iMac, running Monterey OS 12.6.5, I use the latest version of Thunderbird for email. However, it has not accepted the new password, which I enter in the popup window requesting it. (See screenshots) I have tried going into settings/privacy and security and changing it in saved passwords and I've tried deleted saved passwords. I have also entered the secure key. Nothing works. All my mail folders are there. I would really appreciate help on how to get Thunderbird to use my new Yahoo password. Thanks. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1576847;1576880;1577149;1577150;1577151;,DelilahR

Since the regular updates in the last 2 months or so, many or all of the emails that are marked as ""read"" in the inbox of my Local Folders disappear, without my deleting or moving them. This often happens in the time it takes to click to another folder then click back in to that inbox. Sometimes I can still find those messages via search, but they aren't visible in the folder - and they aren't findable at all if I restart Thunderbird. I'm not using that email account on any other platform, so it's not a question of my deleting them online/on my phone, at all. Any suggestions? Many thanks, Jodie </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1576844;1576956;,martire

I have to jump through hoops the provide that metadata (View Source) when forwarding the malware because I cannot attach the email to a new email to Comcast describing the problem. </p><p>•	When I screen-scrape material with FireFox from a screen with embedded pictures, that material is not properly rendered when pasted into a Thunderbird email.  Right-indents accumulate in the email until there is only a tiny-width stream of text and pictures that I cannot left-indent back to the original screen format.  Surely Thunderbird should respect the indentation of a screen-scrape from FireFox.  MS Outlook does. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1576871;1576878;,dick-lincoln

The area (Pane) that contains the From:  To:  Reply to:  and Subject: need to be made smaller.  I am aware of the View tab but it does not provide for such a change.  Many of the Tabs are greyed out and are of no use.  Pressing control and rolling the mouse wheel only changes the actual message.  I am hopeful there may be a way to change this somewhere in the registry. Just so you know, the OS is Windows 11.  On another PC I use with the same version, but Windows 10, all is perfectly sized - although I still cannot change the size of the pane.  It could be a simple mouse click selection under settings or Account Settings but nothing so far has worked.  Can anyone help with this issue? I have other problems with how TB is displaying emails but one thing at a time. </p><p>Larry K </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1576892;1576907;1576910;,ldkamb
