Hawks.ics and F1-2023.ics work fine, as do the other 8, but myical.ics does not display (so I don't know if it syncs or not). This only started happening yesterday. myical.ics syncs perfectly in google calendar and passes a couple of ics validation tests. I tried a new profile but the problem remains the same. </p><p>Any ideas please&nbsp;? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1576834;1576848;1576978;,firefox277

I have to jump through hoops the provide that metadata (View Source) when forwarding the malware because I cannot attach the email to a new email to Comcast describing the problem. </p><p>•	When I screen-scrape material with FireFox from a screen with embedded pictures, that material is not properly rendered when pasted into a Thunderbird email.  Right-indents accumulate in the email until there is only a tiny-width stream of text and pictures that I cannot left-indent back to the original screen format.  Surely Thunderbird should respect the indentation of a screen-scrape from FireFox.  MS Outlook does. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1576871;1576878;,dick-lincoln

1411524,2023-04-22 04:16:48 -0700,2023-04-22 06:06:39 -0700,Version 102.10.0 (64-bit) How to make the From: To: pane smaller,"<p>Below is a random image of an email. The area (Pane) that contains the From:  To:  Reply to:  and Subject: need to be made smaller.  I am aware of the View tab but it does not provide for such a change.  Many of the Tabs are greyed out and are of no use.  Pressing control and rolling the mouse wheel only changes the actual message.  I am hopeful there may be a way to change this somewhere in the registry. Just so you know, the OS is Windows 11.  On another PC I use with the same version, but Windows 10, all is perfectly sized - although I still cannot change the size of the pane.  It could be a simple mouse click selection under settings or Account Settings but nothing so far has worked.  Can anyone help with this issue? I have other problems with how TB is displaying emails but one thing at a time. </p><p>Larry K </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1576892;1576907;1576910;,ldkamb
