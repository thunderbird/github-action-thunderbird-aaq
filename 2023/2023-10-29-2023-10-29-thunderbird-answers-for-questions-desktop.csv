First, add your accounts to the new profile.  IMAP accounts will download mail from the server and POP accounts, if any, will download new mail.  To recover old POP mail or other local mail, Help/Troubleshooting Info, Profile Folder, Open Folder, close TB, go up a level in File Explorer to Profiles, open the old profile folder, open the account subfolder of Mail, e.g. Mail/<a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>, copy the mbox files - the large files with no extension, named after folders, e.g. Inbox - to Mail/Local Folders in the new profile folder, renaming if necessary, e.g. Inbox to InboxOLD.  Also look for mbox files in Mail/Local Folders of the old profile and any .sbd subdirectories.  In other words, copy mbox files from old profile to Mail/Local Folders of new profile.  When you restart TB, the folders will appear under Local Folders in the folder Pane. </p><p>To transfer contacts, copy abook.sqlite and history.sqlite (Personal Address Book and Collected Addresses) from the old profile to the new, with TB closed.  If you have others like abook-1.sqlite, import them to the new profile from Tools/Import when TB is open. </p><p>Other items like filters, junk training, local calendars etc. can also be transferred if necessary. </p><p>I always create a new profile for each major release and avoid many of the update issues that are reported on this forum. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I did try it though, and it seams to have worked. Win key is working fine with TB open.

I'd rather have the folder that I am in currently be sorted. But at least I see that if I click back into the folder, the emails are all there. So it seems to be just for sorting.  When all the emails disappeared except for the ""important"" ones, that's when I decided I had to downgrade.  </p><p>I didn't see where/how to Tag an email as ""important"" and then to un-Tag it when I want to.

It's not a huge thing, but if things that were quick &amp; easy now take more steps, it all adds up to slower progress on whatever I'm working on.  </p><p>And do you have any recommended resource that I can read about how to make changes so that, like you said, it can be modified to look like 102?

So, if you have switched it on then I can understand your concerns. </p><p>Most virus's get onto your computer via two methods. 1. You allow your curiousity to get the better of you which is what the sender is trying to accomplish. You get an email which has an attachment, you have no idea why you have the attachment. You may not even know who sent the email or why. You open the attachment when you should have just deleted the email. I've had numerous emails with bogus people saying they had attached an invoice, but I knew it could not be true.   Do not click on stuff which you should not click on. </p><p>2. You choose to click on a link which may be text or an image link, but you have not checked what the real link is before you clickon it.  Link might have the text which says it will open on a specific webpage, but inreality it does not.  Usually, your Firewall Anti-Virus will pick up and block a bogus website, but you cannot always be certain. </p><p>How to know the link is the correct one: Hover over the link and the real link is displayed in the bottom Status Bar. </p><p>If you delete emails which you do not like then remember to 'compact' that folder to completely remove all hidden traces.  </p><p>If you allow Anti-virus to scan your Thunderbird profile and it locates a problem and tries to fix it, then you stand a very good chance of losing emails. Please remember, AV products do not understand that an mbox file is not just one email, so killing a file could potentially delete all emails in that file or cause corruption of file. This is not the same as scanning an email being downloaded or file which you download from a browser. </p><p>There is nothing in a Thunderbird Profile which CCleaner can nor should touch. I've has all kinds of problems with passwords, sessions files etc getting 'cleaned up' and it causes no end of inconvenience for no good reason.
