First, add your accounts to the new profile.  IMAP accounts will download mail from the server and POP accounts, if any, will download new mail.  To recover old POP mail or other local mail, Help/Troubleshooting Info, Profile Folder, Open Folder, close TB, go up a level in File Explorer to Profiles, open the old profile folder, open the account subfolder of Mail, e.g. Mail/<a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a>, copy the mbox files - the large files with no extension, named after folders, e.g. Inbox - to Mail/Local Folders in the new profile folder, renaming if necessary, e.g. Inbox to InboxOLD.  Also look for mbox files in Mail/Local Folders of the old profile and any .sbd subdirectories.  In other words, copy mbox files from old profile to Mail/Local Folders of new profile.
