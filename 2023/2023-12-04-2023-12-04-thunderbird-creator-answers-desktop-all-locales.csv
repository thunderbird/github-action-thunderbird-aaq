When I loaded Thunderbird on my old computer  I had issues receiving my e-mail.  My e-mail provider tech support was able to get me set up so that my e-mails went to a G-mail account and were forwarded to the computer.  I used this setup for approximately 5 years.  During that time I created several folders in Thunderbird and they have several important emails stored there. I setup my new Windows PC this past week and downloaded Thunderbird.  To my surprise, I was able to set the program up so that it works without having to go through G-Mail.  My issue is that I want to copy the  e-mail folders and my address book from the old computer and move them into Thunderbird in my new computer.  I have looked at your support page and I am concerned that when I move files from the old to the new that I will lose some e-mails and the few folders that I have on the new CPU. I would appreciate your direction and instructions on what I need to do to accomplish this task. The old computer Thunderbird files were up to date.  Updates were completed as they came out. The new Thunderbird appears very different than the edition that is on my old machine.

I've seen this in other email clients and find it absolutely necessary. If you accidentally deleted an email that is perhaps days or weeks old, it is extremely difficult to find in the delete folder:  when sorting by date, it will be buried amongst hundreds of other trashed emails received around the same time, and after an accidental deletion you may not even know the date and time, the sender, or the Subject of the deleted email! Today I accidentally came across a possible solution:  there is a field called ""Order received"", and it seems that this field contains a number which indicates the order in which emails were moved between mailboxes.  Sorting by that, the latest deleted email is at the top (or bottom). Is this true, or does that field indicate something else? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",msohnius
