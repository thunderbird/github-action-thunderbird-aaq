Open the Settings window (not Account Settings, but Settings) and scroll down in the General settings to Incoming emails, and click the App Icon Options button. Now select (dot) the Count of Unread Messages option, not the Count of New Messages option. Then click OK and close settings and close and restart Thunderbird, and from now on, the icon badge number will change every time you open and read a new message, just the way you wanted it to. </p><p>HAGD. </p>",danawilson001,false,2,0

The roaming folder is for data that is needed should the windows user account/profile be moved to another windows machine using windows roaming profiles.  In the case of Thunderbird the bulk of your mail and settings data is required for the application to run seamlessly and the same as on the last machine you logged into.

When a major release occurs, Thunderbird keeps people on older version getting separate updates eg: 102.13.1 updated to 102.14.0 That update occur for me on 2nd August 2023 </p><p>Updater Software on your computer has no knowledge on what Thunderbird is currently doing. They just discover what is available on the official website as new release and assume it is an update. </p><p>Loads of people have fell foul of this because they are letting an updater software control updates instead of Thunderbird. </p><p>In Thunderbird You can choose to be asked whether to update automatically or check for updates, but ask you first before installing update. </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> scroll down to 'Updates' section </li><li> Select 'Check for updates but let me choose whether to install them' </li></ul> <p>This means Thunderbird will check for update but not install automatically - you have to allow it. </p><p>There is also another checkbox 'Use a background service to install updates' If you uncheck that option it forces the UAC to pop up asking if you want to make changes to program. It's like a special additional line of defence to stop updates. Many people do not like being always prompted by UAC to allow an update, so they select that checkbox. </p><p>I use Check for update, but ask me first and also unchecked that 'use background service..' </p><p>But and this is important, I do not have updater software checking to see if Thunderbird has an update because they often get it wrong.
