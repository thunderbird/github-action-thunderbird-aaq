Another approach would be to delete all entries in the addressbook and use the tools&gt;import menu to do that. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

After I deleted most of the clutter (except for those special emails) I had around 400 left and it has worked better than ever.  I suspect your issue might be similar to what I had and all you need to do is organize what you have and maybe update TB to a newer version. </p>",harrisonstew,false,0,0

Unchecking it will stop the showing of the numeric badges completely. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

Open the Settings window (not Account Settings, but Settings) and scroll down in the General settings to Incoming emails, and click the App Icon Options button. Now select (dot) the Count of Unread Messages option, not the Count of New Messages option. Then click OK and close settings and close and restart Thunderbird, and from now on, the icon badge number will change every time you open and read a new message, just the way you wanted it to. </p><p>HAGD. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0
