To reply to your message proper: Yes, I changed the settings to what your link suggests - the Connection Security suggestion being absent from my MacBook, I checked with TT (chat) which was useless, but I found it in a google search (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1398238"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1398238</a>), as well as the other settings, which were a lot clearer than TT's.

The answer probably lies in the spreadsheet, so I will need a proper look, but I thought it best to reply as soon as I could. With best wishes. PS. It looks like I can't attach the spreadsheet on this. I will take some screenshots (I think it may need two) and keep my fingers crossed... Yes it did. </p>",gfinley,false,0,0

I am concerned that when the web-based email host closes the account, all that are copied via IMAP will disappear.   </blockquote> <p>A well founded fear.  They probably will. </p> <blockquote> So first I imported using POP3, which I understand is like taking a snapshot that will remain after the account is closed.  The webmail client is net@ddress, a product of SilverSky in which the email address is in the format xxxxx@usa.net. 1.  Using POP3, all the email folders' discrete contents except ""Sent"" were dumped/combined in one received email folder called ""Inbox"".  I don't mind that, but can't figure out how to move the ""Sent"" folder's contents which contains all the emails that I generated. </blockquote> <p>Once you have moved that entire ""inbox"" somewhere else.  Copy your sent folder content on the browser app to the inbox.  Then they will download as new mail.  I say move the inbox mails because they will then not get mixed up. </p> <blockquote> 2.  I then imported again with IMAP and unlike POP3, it nicely maintained my whole folder structure.  Clicking on each triggered import of all the emails in the various folders, including ""Sent"".  However, it mirrors whatever goes on in the actual account including deletions.  Due to my concern about everything disappearing when the email account is closed, I'd like to archive everything but can't see how to bulk select large amounts of emails since there are over 10,000 involved.  Thunderbird instructions advise not to archive more than 2,000 emails at a time, so there must be a way to do it in bulk. </blockquote> <p>You best bet is to use the importexport tools addon. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>It will be slow as each email ill be verified against the server before it is exported.  SO  you might want to use a combo of IMAP export and POP. </p> <blockquote> 3.  How do I import my Contacts?  Apparently it needs to be converted into a .csf file; no idea how to do that. </blockquote> <p>Let's revisit that once you work out what formats your existing provider will offer the contact data in.  At this point it is about like asking about the length of a piece of string neither of us have seen. </p><p>As a general point the windows standard controls for multiple selections you hold shift.  Click in something in a list.  Click somewhere else in the list and everything in between is selected.  Changing to Ctrl instead of shift allows individual fine tuning.  One click reverses the selection state a second does it again. </p><p>I do not recommend directly trying to move many IMAP account mails somewhere else using this approach as data loss is really a common outcome.  There are plenty of reports in this forum of folk looking for mail that bulk actioned and lost.  It however is fine on folders of mail from POP accounts and local folders. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
