It used to work,  but Google, like Microsoft have for years resulting in their alias not working unless you send from the web site, tend to change the email headers to match what they have on their server for the account sending mail.  If you have an issue with that,  you will have to address it with Google.  Thunderbird is a mail client and can send whatever it wants,  but it can not control actions taken at the server based no corporate policies. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

If only a small percentage of email users used aliases the number would still probably run in the millions. The concern to prevent spoofing is a serious one. For several months I have been getting almost daily email rejection messages for messages I never sent. Yet the move to protect emailers from spoofing has run roughshod over the uses of aliases, which many of us find to be of great value. My alias email address is my user ID  or registered email address  in scores of websites and phone apps. It would be quite a nightmare to change them.  Surely, major email providers, like Gmail, could allow you not just to register an alternative address, but to use it to send messages. </p>",rmrubinsl,false,0,0

I have difficulty following ""However <a href=""http://acm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">acm.org</a> has a mail exchanged record in DNS that identifies the allowed mail server for email to come from as <a href=""http://mail.mailroute.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mailroute.net</a> See <a href=""https://intodns.com/acm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intodns.com/acm.org</a>.""  In English, does this mean that ACM provides a means of specifying the outgoing server, but there are problems with it?  I followed the link you provided and found: </p><pre>   Your MX records that were reported by your nameservers are:    10   <a href=""http://mail.mailroute.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mailroute.net</a>   199.89.1.120 199.89.3.120 (no glue)    [These are all the MX records that I found. If there are some non common MX records at your nameservers     you should see them below. ]  </pre> <p>I don't what this means.   I have tried adding my <a href=""http://acm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">acm.org</a> address as a sending address to Google, but keep getting error messages, even though Google  has verified several times that I can receive messages at that address. As you say, I need to take that up with Google.  The basic question is: Do you know of an outgoing email server that allows you to send messages from an alias that you can register with it and the server can then verify to any recipient server that the message came from you? </p>",rmrubinsl,false,0,0
