I did my own testing on gmail, confirming what you reported, that the FROM address to recipient will always be the SMTP-defined email address, not the from address. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I suggest checking account pane, the one that shows SMTP server on bottom line. This is not the 'server settings', but the account pane itself. There is a possibility that, with four accounts for that server, that they may not be all pointing to their appropriate SMTP server (a common problem). You also have different settings on the servers.  Is the account for ssetuplux still on Thunderbird? </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Sending emails doesn´t work in any of them. I changed the ports on some of them to see if they worked but they didn't. </p><p>Setuplux is the email of a customer to whom I tried to send a message and had this same error.

The bottom line of the account pane lists the name of the associated SMTP server. Check your account folders to see if the setuplux is stuck in there. You might also log onto web account to see if the message is in there. Do you receive the exact same error message regardless of which account you try? That is the reference to the egon email address? </p>,davidsk,false,0,0
