For several months I have been getting almost daily email rejection messages for messages I never sent. Yet the move to protect emailers from spoofing has run roughshod over the uses of aliases, which many of us find to be of great value. My alias email address is my user ID  or registered email address  in scores of websites and phone apps. It would be quite a nightmare to change them.  Surely, major email providers, like Gmail, could allow you not just to register an alternative address, but to use it to send messages. </p>",rmrubinsl,false,0,0

ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0
