If only a small percentage of email users used aliases the number would still probably run in the millions. The concern to prevent spoofing is a serious one. For several months I have been getting almost daily email rejection messages for messages I never sent. Yet the move to protect emailers from spoofing has run roughshod over the uses of aliases, which many of us find to be of great value. My alias email address is my user ID  or registered email address  in scores of websites and phone apps. It would be quite a nightmare to change them.  Surely, major email providers, like Gmail, could allow you not just to register an alternative address, but to use it to send messages. </p>",rmrubinsl,false,0,0

Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

When you're 60+ y.o., you don't remember or aren't familiar with all the latest lingo 'threaded' and your mind just thinks 'how do i *expand* this?' Just a suggestion to other code writers so they will maybe quit changing terminology; they'll find out in 20 years!&nbsp;:)  </p><p>On the side, one thing that frustrates us seniors is having to type a new password in TWICE, then. . . .typing in the little dots withOUT knowing what we're typing. Our fat old fingers can't be assured to type what we're thinking. Wish someone would quit it with those stupid dots already; just show me what I'm typing. The eyeball helps but there's no one looking over my shoulder or I wouldn't type my password in; they fortunately haven't caught on to making me type my account name with little dots as that info is just private as well. </p><p>When might Tbird give us the option to put the File/Edit menu back above the Write/Reply... menu as it used to be pre-115 version? </p><p>Thanks again for the threading help though! </p>",errata007,false,0,0

You can press the alt key or F10 and when it appears, click View&gt;toolbars and tick menu bar. And you're smarter than you think you are. There are many people who wouldn't know to make the post you did. Don't beat yourself up too much. I think you're right there with the rest of us, sharing the same frustrations as the rest of us. Computers - and email clients especially - are complex. I have this strong belief that working with computers keeps our minds involved in problem-solving, and that helps keep us involved with the world. That's our silver lining. &nbsp;:)  Yes, I agree about the dots and typing without seeing, but the internet was devised in a simpler, trusting, time.

If you had just added a 'Work' email address and you want to add a 'Home' email address, then click on 'Add email address', select 'Home' from the drop down and then enter the Home email address. </p><p>A bit lower down you can see 'Addresses' Click on 'Add address' to see various address fields. Where you see 'None' - click on the drop down to selct either 'Home or Work' Then either manually type in the data into the relevant fields or maybe you have an email which contains data, in which case you can copy and paste text which you can see either in an email or any other document. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

How do i rename Organizational Properties and the sub-titles that are under Organizational Properties.&nbsp;?</strong> </p><p>You cannot completely remove any section. You just do not use it. You cannot rename default fields that have specific code behind it so that all data gets displayed correctly. 'Organisation' was chosen because it can mean a business or a hobby group. There are very good reasons for using specific names for fields because they cater for many uses. </p><p><br> <strong>re:   same questions apply to Custom Properties and Custom 1, Custom 2, Custom 3, and Custom 4, and what if I wanted to add Custom 5,6,7, &amp;8, but with my own name/designation rather than calling it custom 1,2,3,4 etc.</strong> </p><p>Ever since MoreFunctionsForAddressbook addon was not maintained, it's been a bit of pain trying to work out exactly what you can do with these Custom fields. </p><p>One method which can be used is to map fields when importing ldap address books.  When importing an ldap or mbox address book, you need to map the fields in that address book to the fields in Thunderbird. But what happens if you have an ldap address book field which is not available in Thunderbird - after all not all address books are the same. Senario: You may have a field called 'UserID' in the ldap address book but need a field in Thunderbird which can map to it and display the UserID's. That's where you can use eg: Custom1 field. </p><p>Another Idea on using Custom fields: Personally, I've always just added the first text to be whatever I wanted eg: If I wanted to use Custom1 for a list of Groups which people belonged to then that is precisely what I typed so it would look like this - note I chose to put thew word GROUPS using capital letters. It visually stood out better. Custom 1:   GROUPS: Book Club, History Club </p><p>Then at least I knew what Custom 1 had reference to for that contact.  It also meant I could choose to use the same format for every contact - just type the word 'GRoups: before the list of groups OR choose something else for another contact who had nothing to do with Groups, but might be someone who had a specific userID then I could Reuse same&nbsp;: Custom 1: USER-ID: 1234 </p><p>Reusing that Custom1 field also means you may not need as many. </p><p>I'll keep looking to see if there is an addon that can offer something which can do as you require. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
