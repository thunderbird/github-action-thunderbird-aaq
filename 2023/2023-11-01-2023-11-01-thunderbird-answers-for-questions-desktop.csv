"" &lt;-- This is not correct. Thunderbird has always been a Mozilla product. What is different now is that Thunderbird since 2020 is under MZLA which is a for profit corporation. MZLA is 100% owned by Mozilla Foundation, which is a non profit.

But just know that pop isn't particularly well suited to having multiple thousands of messages in an Inbox.  ""Leave messages on server"" enabled essentially attempts to mimic an imap environment (in which case why not just change to imap?), and also increases the probability of problems. </p><p>&gt; I do have a folder structure of 3 levels deep. </p><p>If this is a pop account, there's no way you can be downloading multiple gmail folders to Thunderbird. AFAIK Thunderbird (and any mail client) will only download from the one and only <strong>Inbox</strong>.  If you have three levels deep of folders, then the folders other than Inbox only exist in Thunderbird, or you are doing something highly irregular. </p><p>&gt; So when is the very nice team from Thunderbird gonna solve duplicates issues once and for all?  </p><p>As I recall, as the number of messages in a pop Inbox increases, so increases the probability of causing problems with the local popstate.dat file which is what tracks which messages Thunderbird thinks have been downloaded from the server.  If that file is corrupted, is inaccessible/locked, or gets deleted then your entire message store will be redownloaded from the pop server.  The first two items I listed can be caused by hardware problems, antivirus SW and backups. You would be wise to explore those two possibilities.  Regardless, I do not know of any currently open bug reports that describe your issue, and our experience is the causes tend to be caused by something in the user's environment, which includes network.  </p><p>Another idea to pursue is disable automatic compact, which the user in <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1798300"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1798300</a> found to be helpful. </p><p>I think only one bug in the past three years has been confirmed, and then fixed in <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1796903"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1796903</a>, which involved the setting ""Fetch Headers Only"".  Another thing you can check in your settings. </p><p>The fact that you never see duplicates in the gmail web interface has little bearing on whether or not you will have duplicates in your email client. </p>",wsmwk,false,0,0
