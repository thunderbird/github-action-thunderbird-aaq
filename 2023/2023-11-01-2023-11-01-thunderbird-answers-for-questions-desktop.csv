I když mám nastavené, aby se zprávy řadily podle data (vzestupně) a dle příznaku přečtené, po přechodu do jiné složky a návratu do hlavní složky zpráv, kurzor (aktuální zobrazení zpráv) se opět nastaví někam na začátek nebo doprostřed roku 2021 místo na poslední aktuální zprávu. Při jakékoliv manipulaci s poštou tedy musíme posouvat posuvník vpravo někam z horní nebo prostřední pozice na spodní doraz, abychom se dostali k posledním zprávám. </p><p>Dle mého názoru, programátor při úpravách programu při přechodu na verzi Supernova, vůbec neuvažoval variantu používání, kdy jsou aktuální zpracovávané maily zobrazeny na spodní části seznamu, protože při obráceném řazení (sestupně), kdy jsou poslední zprávy zobrazovány nahoře, se systém chová očekávaným způsobem. </p>",palca1,false,0,0

Řazení čistě podle datumu příjmu zprávy funguje správně, dle očekávání, a to i při přechodu mezi různými složkami. Kurzor se při přechodu mezi složkami vždy nastaví na poslední zprávu (ať už je mám seřazené sestupně nebo vzestupně). Proti tomu - jakmile se klikne na řazení podle příznaku ""přečtenosti"", složka je sice řazená tak jak chceme , tedy nejprve nahoře staré a přečtené a úplně dole nepřečtené a taky seřazené podle datumu, jenomže jakmile kliknu na jinou složku a vrátím se zpátky, kurzor se nastaví na PRVNÍ řádek a na obrazovce se zobrazí NAHOŘE, NEJSTARŠÍ a PŘEČTENÉ zprávy, místo DOLE, NEJNOVĚJŠÍCH a NEPŘEČTENÝCH.

If that file is corrupted, is inaccessible/locked, or gets deleted then your entire message store will be redownloaded from the pop server.  The first two items I listed can be caused by hardware problems, antivirus SW and backups. You would be wise to explore those two possibilities.

But with all the new snazzy things Thunderbird is saying it can do, I CANNOT imagine it does not have the ability to simply sort how your email accounts show up in the left hand bar yet. Do we really have to use a third-party add-on to do this? ""Manually sort folders"" is the only add-on I really see people recommending out there on the web and it hasn't been updated for the new releases so I guess if Mozilla hasn't thought to include this basic feature yet, I will have to roll back my Thunderbird to an earlier release just so I can have my email accounts in the order I want/use them. </p>",Ltechs,false,1,0
