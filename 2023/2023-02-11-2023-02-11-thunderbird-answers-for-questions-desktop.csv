Looking to have a complete list of incoming accounts is something of a dream as the lists you mention simply are not lists of accounts as such. </p><p>2. Outgoing server (SMTP) in account settings will list the outgoing sever you have configured.  These are the servers that accept your outgoing mail. </p><p>3. You show an image of the accounts show in unified folders.  These are simple a collection of accounts used to search for mail in the unified inbox search folder.  At times they do not show all configured incoming account.  Right clicking the folder list and selecting properties will allow the list of incoming accounts to be edited as to what is shown. </p><p>4. You list a collection of addresses in the compose window for from.  These are a simple list of identities and their associated outgoing server.  In no way related to the incoming accounts in the unified inbox or the account settings </p><p>From is determined by identities.  Each account can have an unlimited number of identities, the default is one,  but you can keep clicking add and adding them to the extent of available memory.

You have six email accounts shown on one of the screenshots. That means there should be twelve entries in settings&gt;privacy&amp;security screenshot, yet you only show seven. My suggestion:  - there should be an incoming and smtp server for each account, even when using the same server - review all six accounts to see which smtp server is supporting it. My guess is you may find the yandex smtp server is set to support a gmail account, and that creates the problem you see. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
