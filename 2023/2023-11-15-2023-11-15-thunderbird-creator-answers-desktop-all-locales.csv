Having them hidden under that new right arrow makes extra steps to do so </li><li>the row of custom colours no longer hold: what is the point of being able set a row of custom colour if they don't hold!!!  I used different colours to indicate different response in a thread -- thereby having an immediate way to see the order of responses. </li><li>I need layers of sub-folders -- often to add a new name to a group I belong to, or a new year.  I have been asking again and again over several years for the ability to create a new sub-folder WHILE one is moving an email from the inbox to a folder or sub-folder.  Having to 'go' to the folder first, make a new sub-subfolder, return to the inbox, and then move the email is an unnecessary waste of time.  </li><li>'a picture says a thousand words' -- emojis are so useful in this way, especially when one is tired or can't think of the right words to say.  This feature was taken away years ago, and I wish that TB would bring it back.  The minimal 'yellow faces' are minimally useful. </li><li>The 'signature switch' button is in the wrong place -- exactly where one would normally click to get back into TB after doing something in another program.  It needs to be moved over to the left, or placed somewhere else. </li></ol> <p>It seems to me that the TB functions (at least the ones that I need) are getting less and less useful and increasing 'cognitive burden'. </p><p>Sorry to be so negative, but I do wonder who TB is trying to please/appease -- it is not this user. </p><p>Blessings </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1635409;,quaternalmoon131

It's mosty been smooth, thunderbird is great as usual. Thunderbird connects to the email server using IMAP. This person is using supernova. Recently the person that uses folders most often has been seeing issues. I can provider full detail because the user can't recall everything they did. But a list of things I'm sure of: [1] she has a good number of folders under her main email account, those look like user@domain.com </p><pre>  \att   \bigco inc </pre> <p>etc [2] she normally creates new folders at the top section of the sidebar, where it has Inbox\user@domain.com. New folders historically manifest in the lower section under the folder that is dedicated to user@domain.com (this is what I've been told). [3] Now if we try to create a new folder at the top under inbox\user@domain.com, it seems to be created, but we can't find it anywhere [4] If we create a new folder under the lower section that is dedicated to user@domain.com, the new folders appear under her universal inbox area at the top (inbox\user@domain.com); not under the folder that is dedicated to user@domain.com. [5] If I log on to the webhosting company's server and view the folders in roundcube, most folders seem to be where they belong [6] one 'misplaced' folder we found under the trash folder; I moved it back to user@domain.com, and it was there for a while, then it moved itself to the templates folder - very strange. </p><p>What is the right course of action for this? If there isn't an 'inside tbird' fix, should I just delete the account from tbird and rejoin? I wonder if this is all due to supernova. I've heard that others have had real issues with it. My own thunderbird just freaked out - all of the tabs I have had loaded that had emails I wanted to keep at hand just showed up blank - no message loads, the tab itself has no label. For my own part I just got the most recent tbird today: 115.4.3 </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1618172;,sparrowtwo

However it still takes much longer to start up than previous versions to 115. </p><p>I still have the issues that I posted about: - Inbox displays incorrect number of messages - Issues with forwarded messages that also happen when using Unified folders. So I dont use Unified folders. </p><p>I now also have the issues (that I have not posted about): - Sometimes TB shows an empty message with a date of year 1969 - Sometimes when I compose a new message, which opens a new window, and then I switch out of that window back to the window that has Thunderbird in it, the new message window just disappears, along with the contents I have typed into it. Poof. </p><p>With TB pre-115, I always felt it was stable and reliable and had few issues over the years. </p><p>With 115 I now feel there are many issues, that I dont have time to dig into, or post about. </p><p>If I am using Firefox and I click ""Email a link of this page"" in TB, first the main TB application opens, and then a new separate window opens with a new message that contains the info of this page. In previous versions, the main TB application did not first open, just a TB new message window would open. This was much faster than what 115 does. </p><p>I have a number of email accounts in TB and I cannot use Unified folders, so I have to check the Inbox and other folders of each account separately. </p><p>I would install the Unified Folders Debugging 115.3 addon but I noticed it gives a warning before install that says it will have access to my whole computer, and my company's security policy will not allow installing based on this warning. </p><p>To be clear, I am not posting this to request help, nor to complain about this. I am posting this because I am a grateful long term user that appreciates what Mozilla provides, but think it is important for Mozilla to know the amount of issues that  some users are experiencing with 115. </p><p>I use a Linux distro that lags having the latest version of TB, but I have checked the release notes of 115.4.2 and 115.4.3 and I dont see any of these issues being fixed, but I look forward to them hopefully being fixed in upcoming releases. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1618688;,hiker11
