A legutolsó frissítés után aktiválódott a témacsoport funkció. Sajnos a levelező partnereim - ez lehet csak nálam jelentkezik - a ""tárgy"" mező kitöltését teljesen kaotikusan és össze vissza kezelik. Ezt azt jelenti hogy nem feltétlenül abban a témában írnak levelet ami a téma, hanem elővesznek egy korábbi levelet amit nekem írtak és valami teljesen más témáú levelet írnak mint ami az ereseti téma. Ez szerintem a levelezési kulra hiánya, de nem tudok vele mit kezdeni... </p><p>A kérdésem az lenne, hogy hogyan tudom a ""témacsoport"" funkciót kikapcsolni? Tehát nem összecsukni akarom hanem a levelek érkezzeek meg szépen sorban, ne legyenek semmi módon a korábbi levelek alá rendezve. </p><p>A mellékletben lévő képen az látszik hogy a ""Előzetes Műszaki felmérés / Részleges gyártásindítás"" mintha egy beszélgetés lenne, de nem.

It may be that as I get used to it I will find some of the new features helpful, but right now I am more concerned about what was taken away that was helpful: </p> <ol><li> I keep getting 'not responding' -- especially when trying to set my theme 'yet again (and again, and again)!!!!  I am mostly shut-in due to illness and the themes make a difference emotionally compared to a stark 'black and white'.  Furthermore, what is the point of having TB themes when they don't hold -- I often have to re-set mine several times a day </li><li>tabs are now hidden -- I need to colour-code messages so I know which I need to get back to soon or can wait. Having them hidden under that new right arrow makes extra steps to do so </li><li>the row of custom colours no longer hold: what is the point of being able set a row of custom colour if they don't hold!!!  I used different colours to indicate different response in a thread -- thereby having an immediate way to see the order of responses. </li><li>I need layers of sub-folders -- often to add a new name to a group I belong to, or a new year.  I have been asking again and again over several years for the ability to create a new sub-folder WHILE one is moving an email from the inbox to a folder or sub-folder.  Having to 'go' to the folder first, make a new sub-subfolder, return to the inbox, and then move the email is an unnecessary waste of time.  </li><li>'a picture says a thousand words' -- emojis are so useful in this way, especially when one is tired or can't think of the right words to say.  This feature was taken away years ago, and I wish that TB would bring it back.  The minimal 'yellow faces' are minimally useful. </li><li>The 'signature switch' button is in the wrong place -- exactly where one would normally click to get back into TB after doing something in another program.  It needs to be moved over to the left, or placed somewhere else. </li></ol> <p>It seems to me that the TB functions (at least the ones that I need) are getting less and less useful and increasing 'cognitive burden'. </p><p>Sorry to be so negative, but I do wonder who TB is trying to please/appease -- it is not this user. </p><p>Blessings </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",quaternalmoon131

It's mosty been smooth, thunderbird is great as usual. Thunderbird connects to the email server using IMAP. This person is using supernova. Recently the person that uses folders most often has been seeing issues. I can provider full detail because the user can't recall everything they did. But a list of things I'm sure of: [1] she has a good number of folders under her main email account, those look like user@domain.com </p><pre>  \att   \bigco inc </pre> <p>etc [2] she normally creates new folders at the top section of the sidebar, where it has Inbox\user@domain.com. New folders historically manifest in the lower section under the folder that is dedicated to user@domain.com (this is what I've been told). [3] Now if we try to create a new folder at the top under inbox\user@domain.com, it seems to be created, but we can't find it anywhere [4] If we create a new folder under the lower section that is dedicated to user@domain.com, the new folders appear under her universal inbox area at the top (inbox\user@domain.com); not under the folder that is dedicated to user@domain.com. [5] If I log on to the webhosting company's server and view the folders in roundcube, most folders seem to be where they belong [6] one 'misplaced' folder we found under the trash folder; I moved it back to user@domain.com, and it was there for a while, then it moved itself to the templates folder - very strange. </p><p>What is the right course of action for this? If there isn't an 'inside tbird' fix, should I just delete the account from tbird and rejoin? I wonder if this is all due to supernova. I've heard that others have had real issues with it. My own thunderbird just freaked out - all of the tabs I have had loaded that had emails I wanted to keep at hand just showed up blank - no message loads, the tab itself has no label. For my own part I just got the most recent tbird today: 115.4.3 </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1618172;,sparrowtwo
