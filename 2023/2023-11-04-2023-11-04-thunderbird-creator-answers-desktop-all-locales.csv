Since I can access both accounts via the Internet, it is not <a href=""http://sbcglobal.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sbcglobal.net</a>'s problem.  The rep also mentioned that blocks of email accounts are being updated on their servers.

I'm happy to have found the solution just now... read on.] </p><p>I accidentally installed Thunderbird 115 last night, thinking it was a Firefox update.  This time I can't revert to the prior version, because I don't have a recent backup of my profile folder. </p><p>So I'm stuck with Thunderbird 115.  The only major problem I see so far is, when I open a message in a new window, <strong>the Reply and Forward buttons are missing</strong> from the toolbar.
