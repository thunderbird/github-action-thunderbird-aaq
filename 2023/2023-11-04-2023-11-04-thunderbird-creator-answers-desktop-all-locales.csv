One is still working when I use Mozilla Thunderbird to access my emails.  The other just stopped working today.  I can neither send nor receive my email messages in Thunderbird.  I spoke to a <a href=""http://sbcglobal.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sbcglobal.net</a> rep and they said to contact Thunderbird, as the message I am getting says server error.  Since I can access both accounts via the Internet, it is not <a href=""http://sbcglobal.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sbcglobal.net</a>'s problem.  The rep also mentioned that blocks of email accounts are being updated on their servers.  Maybe Thunderbird needs to reconnect with yahoo and at&amp;t, etc.??? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rexss
