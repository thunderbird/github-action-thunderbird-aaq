Could still send messages from another ISP account. Have to save the message composed in Thunderbird then log in to the Hotmail web interface to send it.

Eventually removed the Hotmail account from Thunderbird, re-added the Hotmail account to Thunderbird, and it worked, for a while. Downloading a lot of messages in IMAP, so that they stay on the Hotmail server takes a long time. Sometimes will have to close Thunderbird, then resume the downloading of messages later. Trying to send a message, when it is now FAILING again, could it be that Thunderbird is WAITING UNTIL IT HAS COMPLETELY FINISHED DOWNLOADING ALL OF THE MESSAGES in some sort of queue, before it gets back to seeing that the user is trying to SEND a message, and to process that and communicate with the Hotmail server? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1559236;1559340;1559443;1559503;1559617;1559632;1559844;1559850;1560033;1561485;,tk21

I shut my computer and it should have gone to sleep. When I returned tonight, it appears that Windows had updated and restarted the computer. I say all of this because Thunderbird may have been forced closed and this could be a source of the problem. </p><p>In any case, when I opened Thunderbird this evening, it opened to an account set up page. Home was opened in another tab, but all my accounts, folders, address books were missing. I looked in the profiles folder and it seems my profile is intact. It's like Thunderbird knew about my profile folder and thought it was loading it, but then it didn't actually load it at all. I've tried some various things but have yet to find a solution. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1559321;1559342;1559352;1559373;1559465;,spheric1

The host has placed an exception for me on their firewall, but during cleanup cycles, it appears the exception is dropped and I am placed in email jail until I convince MidPhase to re-add the exception. </p><p>Do you agree this behavior can be caused by Thunderbird?
