I guess this would be a contacts file. This can only be opened in a dbase application. So, I cannot compare. Nevertheless, from Vista Mail I created a stripped .csv file, - only name, e-mail address. I was able to import this into ""Personal Address Book"". It looks OK. But, I cannot use it as expected. Whet I start a ""write"", I cannot bring up a contact address into the ""TO"" field from this file. From GMAIL TB imported addresses into a CARDBOOK (what is this, and why&nbsp;?). Only addresses from CARDBOOK can be used automatically in TO field. In TB settings I directed the use of Address Book. But still only CARDBOOK is usable, and shows up in the right upper corner. In Personal Address Book I can search, find addresses. But, only editing is offered, not the use in TO, or WRITE. So, it is not much of use. While, if I import single .vcf file, the contact works correctly, But, reasonably I cannot import 1700 .vcf files one-by-one. There must be a better way to make this work. </p>",zszemeti,false,0,0

It goes into Personal Address Book.The directory/hierarchical structure is not understandable. I would expect All Addressbooks on the top, Personal Addressbok, and Collected Addressbook below. And, it should be possible to direct the tool to use a selected address book when writing a mail.

I do not know where Cardbook belongs to, whether under All Address Books, or what. It was created from Gmail.

It is the easiest, and immediately usable. However, it works only for single .vcf file, not for a list of files in a directory, or a conglomerate. Based on my past experience, I'd like to suggest to create a script, which opens a directory where the .vcf files sit, and imports the single files one-by-one.

However, I cannot use contacts from this file with ""write"", and ""TO"", so the the address would be filled in for me. This is what a user expects. Instead, the only thing I can do with the contact in All Address Book is ""edit"" Then I can copy with the mouse the e-mail address and paste it into the TO field. Versus, and imported .vcf contact shows up in the TO field if needed. So, it looks as if the best way to import contact is the ,vcf format. The problem is that TB can only import single .vcf files. The trick compounding the .vcf contact into one ""merged.vcf"" file does not work. The question remains how to make the .csv methodology working as expected&nbsp;? Or, make the compounded .vcf file work. This could be done with a script, which opens the ""merged.vcf"" and import the single .vcf contacts one-by-one. There could be similarly a directory with the single ,vcf files, and import from there. This could be an add-on to TB. As I can see many pople had similar problem with importing contacts, and earlier there was an add-on to solve this with .vcf. This is not available in the current version.  What can we do&nbsp;? Or, should I just limp with the ""edit"" solution from above&nbsp;? TB is a good mailing tool, it would be a pity to use this cumbersome solution. Regards, Zoltan </p>",zszemeti,false,0,0

Well, you do not even have the same environment as I do (WIN10 64bit), nor the same version of TB, but UBUNTO, and you telling me what works. You did not explain the directory structure of the Contacts, why CardBook shows up when I write a mail, and cannot change it. I dare to attach a file with screen prints to show what works, and how. Be so kind and take a look. TB does not even offer me the opportunity to export a .csv contact. It looks like the to be imported .csv file has to be the same fields, and in the same order as TB expects, then is maybe a chance that it would work correctly. This means that the tool does not understand the Excel header (title of the columns), so it is not intelligent, and just takes in whatever is on the position. So, hand editing is expected&nbsp;? It is not doing much better with single .vcf files either. The result is that it cannot insert a TO address automatically. I can live with this limitations, but it is not nice, and it makes for a while the use of TB cumbersome, as long as there are not enough Collected Addresses. I thought I would help you guys with drawing aattention on these issues.  Do whatever you want, but I keep up my opinion until you give me thorough explantion, and an example.

We have a French Argument (US expression when people are mostly in accordance, but get hooked in side issues, etc). I understand all the explanations. and know what went wrong, finally NOW. It was mostly my fault. .csv is an Excel spreadsheet, and it goes by positions of the column. The one application exports the contacts in one format, the other maybe in a different format, and the import expects it in TB compatible format. When I exported my contacts from Vista Mail, I did not pay attention that one can influence what, and how will be exported. I left everything default. Now, I exported only NAME and EMAIL, and it works mostly in TB, with little glitches. I used .vcf format before, which spells out clearly NAME EMAIL, etc, so it is easier to handle, rather than position based. I owe you a big apology, and I am sorry. I still would like to know what is CardBook on the left side, and as it shows up in TB in the right upper corner. Can I get rid of CardBook, or the content&nbsp;? What would it do&nbsp;?
