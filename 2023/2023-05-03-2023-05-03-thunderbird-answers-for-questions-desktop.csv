Here is my full tutorial, part of which you did, but I encourage you to review and do fully:  Okay, this may sound strange, but here is the real way to set fonts on Thunderbird. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. Notice that my examples set ALL fonts the same. If you are having trouble seeing messages after doing this, increase the font number to 20 and repeat. The number is pixels, not points. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

From where you are, you could increase the font again, and possibly go to the settings page on Firefox and decrease font size there. Cumbersome, but may work. I believe we already tried the View&gt;font size and that didn't work either for you. I know of one other approach:  </p><p>This is a general step that increases fonts somewhat. It may do what you wish. In tools&gt;settings&gt;general scroll to bottom where config editor is. the entry to change is  layout.css.devPixelsPerPx   the default is -1. Try maybe changing to 1 or 2 and see how that looks, but be careful if you set too high. I suggest 1.1 for a start. Before doing this, I recommend exiting TB, locating the prefs.js file in your profile and making a copy of it. Then, if you make the font so big that the screen is unreadable, you can restore the prefs.js from your backup. In using this approach, you should reset the font sizes you increased so that Firefox is back to normal. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Seems like the logic has changed and now every time something is done with any mail, the Windows Defender interrupts and uses 1-2 CPU Cores to scan for about 1 minute per mail or action. I can reproduce this issue with any e-mail action. - click on it - mark is as junk - delete it - receive it </p><p>Thunderbird is now (after so many years) unusable for me. And with all the recent spam mails on my accounts Thunderbird now needs more than an hour to receive all mails. This wasn't a problem before the 102.x version of Thunderbird. I would guess that something in the code makes many small reads what was formally just read once (or out of memory) and now the Windows Defender scans the the accessed files every time. And no, it is not an option to exclude Thunderbird from the Windows Defender. With all those spam mails in recent times, there are also often viruses/trojans in the attachments, I still want the system to get rid of those. </p><p>I do not use any extensions oder addins in Thunderbird. Just Plain Thunderbird (for years now). OS is lastest Windows 11. </p>",reg34,false,0,1
