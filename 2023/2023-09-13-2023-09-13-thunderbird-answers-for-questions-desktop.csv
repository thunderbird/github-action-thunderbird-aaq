Pro jistotu jsem Inbox přejmenoval a nahradil ho prázdným souborem Inbox a s ním nadále pracuji, ale zůstává otázka, zda by se dalo nějak ty zprávy z původního Inbox nějak obnovit, pokud jsou tam interně opatřeny pouze příznakem, že byly smazány (soubor má stále stejnou velikost).

Each email has its own SMTP server login to send mail. If I setup the SMTP server for my main account, all other email accounts are automatically assigned the same SMTP Info as the main account. Of course they will not send, and server rejects the login using the info for the main account SMTP login. If I set up the SMTP Server info for one of the other accounts, Thunderbird automatically changes the SMTP Servier login information in the main account setting to match the SMTP login info of the secondary email account, and therefore, the main email account SMTP login is now rejected by the server since the SMTP server login info is not correct for the main email SMTP server login. </p><p>I need each email account to go back to using its own SMTP server login info so all of the email accounts can send mail. </p><p>By the way, receiving email is not an issue, since all accounts can and do contiue to receive email as they always have. </p><p>I can send from all of my email accounts on my Apple devices, iMac, MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and iPhone 13 normally.
