You might try settings&gt;server settings and click advanced tab and set IMAP server directory to [Gmail] to see if that changes the display. OR, create a new folder and name it something such as Trash2 and set that as the trash folder. I'm making some guesses here, as when online with Gmail, there is more than one Trash folder.  My guess is that your deleted messages may be found somewhere in the online account.  </p><p>Ok, on to POP. This is most easily done when Thunderbird is not running. Assuming you know in what Windows folder the old POP messages are, here is a suggestion: click Help&gt;moretroubleshootinginfo and scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'  - Now, exit Thunderbird and you will be inside the profile. You will see the Mail folder and, inside it is the Local Folders folder. This is where you want to copy/paste your POP message folders.   - OK, now to the POP folders. If the old profile is available, they will be in the Mail folder under the account name (e.g., Mail\accountname\&lt;message folders&gt;) such as Mail\accountname\INBOX and INBOX.msf  (you will notice that all folders appear named twice.) Copy them to the above-mentioned Mail\Local Folders folder and paste them there.  - then, start thunderbird and you should them there.  Let us know how it goes. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If I am using Multiweek view If I use mousewheel <strong>UP</strong>/Forward it moves the calendar to reveal previous week at the <strong>Top</strong> of calendar. If I use mousewheel <strong>Down</strong>/Backwards it moves the calendar to reveal next week at the <strong>Bottom</strong> of calendar. </p><p>Findings: UP displays more/previous at TOP DOWN displays more/next at BOTTOM. </p><p>I find this quite logical as the up and down refers to what is displayed and where. </p><p>If you scroll down a list, any list in any program, you will see more appear at the bottom, so the list is actually moving up. </p><p>Loads of examples: Assume you see a scroll bar on the left of an email messages which you are reading. When you scroll down - use mousewheel backwards, the email content itself looks like it scrolls up to reveal more of message at the bottom.  OR In a browser and viewing this forum or website. If you see a scroll bar on the right and you use mousewheel Down/back the screen moves upwards to reveal more at the bottom and vis versa eg: mousewheel up to force page down to show more at the top. Or Open a folder on computer to see a load of files it contains. Mousewheel Down will scroll down to show more at bottom, so in effect the view of files is scrolling up. </p><p>It is the same process and it is used everywhere in all applications and loads of more practical uses in everyday life. </p><p>If you have a series of images in a row. If you move quickly from left to right, those images can become a movie. You are moving to see next on the right, but to keep focus in the middle of the view, the scrolling is actually moving off to the left to reveal more on the right.  </p><p><br> Do not be confused about the actual direction of the scrolling/movement of the page or view, the mouse instruction to computer tells it the direction of what needs to be displayed. You want to move down to see more at Bottom so when mousewheel says go Down - pull screen view up to show more at bottom. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
