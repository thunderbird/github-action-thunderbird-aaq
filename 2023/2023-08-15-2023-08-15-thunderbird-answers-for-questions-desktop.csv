'All Mail' is the storage of all your emails, incoming, sent and archived.

Logon to webmail. Delete an email and note the name of the folder which auto contains the deleted email. </p><p>In Thunderbird click on 'Trash folder so it synchronises with folder - do you see that deleted email in the imap Trash folder&nbsp;?

Delete being clicking on a delete bin icon or delete button or delete key. Gmail will auto remove any deleted emails from the TRash after 30 days. Thus allowing you some time to retrieve an email deleted in error. But you can choose to manually right click on imap gmail Trash folder and select 'Empty Deleted' to clear it. Once email is fully gone it is also removed from 'AllMail'. </p><p>If you use the 'Shift' + 'Delete' then this deletes the message bypassing Trash (no Undo!). In effect this action removes a label, but does not delete email from AllMail. Email has been archived. Because this does not put the email in the imap Trash folder, it means you no longer see email in that imap folder, but it's not properly deleted. Note: this special type of delete is useful if you have more than one copy of email - it displays in eg: Important and Inbox, but you only want to see the one in Important. So, 'shift+Delete' on the one in Inbox, removes email from Inbox, gmail removes 'Inbox' label.  Email is still seen in 'Important'. A standard 'Delete' would have removed all labels, so both copies would be deleted. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
