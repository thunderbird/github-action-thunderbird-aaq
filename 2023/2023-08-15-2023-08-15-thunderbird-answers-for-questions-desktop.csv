Once email is fully gone it is also removed from 'AllMail'. </p><p>If you use the 'Shift' + 'Delete' then this deletes the message bypassing Trash (no Undo!). In effect this action removes a label, but does not delete email from AllMail. Email has been archived. Because this does not put the email in the imap Trash folder, it means you no longer see email in that imap folder, but it's not properly deleted. Note: this special type of delete is useful if you have more than one copy of email - it displays in eg: Important and Inbox, but you only want to see the one in Important. So, 'shift+Delete' on the one in Inbox, removes email from Inbox, gmail removes 'Inbox' label.  Email is still seen in 'Important'. A standard 'Delete' would have removed all labels, so both copies would be deleted. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
