Regarding IMAP, it keeps them online until you delete them. That is, if you read a message and delete it, it's sent to trash. You did not describe, in detail, what you did. You had a POP account and those messages should be on your PC unless you deleted the POP account, in which case it depends on how you deleted it. I do not know what you mean by writing that you imported 1,000s of messages. If on the server, no import was appropriate. If you respond with explicit steps, I'm sure someone here can give you a full assessment. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I believe I originally had a POP3 set up on Thunderbird with the ""leave a copy on the server"" checked, but I received an email from my hosting company, Newtwork Solutions, that told me I needed to reconfigure my Thunderbird because of a change to TLS 1.2 with new recommended IMAP settings. I thought IMAP settings left emails on the NS server no matter what I did on my PC - like a mirroring. When I hit ""go"" to initiate the new IMAP settings on Thunderbird, 1000s and 1000s of my emails from NS began flowing in, populating my Thunderbird desktop inbox. It took nearly a day. I do have all my emails on Thunderbird on my PC. I then subsequently organized the emails into folders, which I thought meant those folders would also appear (be ""mirrored"", which is what I thought IMAP did) on the Network Solutions server, but when I went to my NS webmail app, all my emails were gone from the server. That ""flowing in"" looks like it was a removal of all the emails from the NS server. I have someone at NS supposedly restoring my emails, after which I think I should use the new Netsol POP3 settings: ""Incoming Mail Server POP3: <a href=""http://netsol-pop-oxcs.hostingplatform.com"" rel=""nofollow"">netsol-pop-oxcs.hostingplatform.com</a>. Port: 995 / Outgoing Mail Server SMTP: <a href=""http://netsol-smtp-oxcs.hostingplatform.com"" rel=""nofollow"">netsol-smtp-oxcs.hostingplatform.com</a>. Port: 587"". Does anyone know, will this Thunderbird POP3 set-up allow me to specify ""keep on the server"", so no matter what I do on my PC, my emails will remain in my Network Solutions webmail app's inbox? I like Thunderbird, but want to use it only if my emails are safely stored on the Network Solutions server. Also, how long will Thunderbird be safe to rely on for my business use now that is is no longer officially supported? I am wondering if I should just go over to Google. But I've used Thunderbird for so long, I don't want to change. THANK YOU TO ALL. </p>",robertlaporta,false,0,0

In your second post, you didn't explain what you did. All I can infer is that you moved the messages to various local folders, which would have removed them from the server. On your POP-related question, Thunderbird will keep messages on server if that is what you specify. From one of your last sentences, you implied that Thunderbird is no longer supported. That is NOT TRUE. Thunderbird has a paid staff of developers and god-only-knows how many volunteers actively involved. I doubt you will find any email client more actively supported than Thunderbird. We have millions (yes, millions) of active users, and a major upgrade coming this summer. Stay tuned.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I am hoping my host Network Solutions will be able to restore my email data that was cleared off their server by my recent IMAP Thunderbird installation. At that point, I intend on setting up a new Thunderbird account as a POP3 with ""leave a copy on server"" checked. If I delete the existing IMAP version on my PC without opening it (so that it doesn't open and start pulling everything off the server again), can I keep all the folders with all the emails on my PC so my new POP3 version will see them? BTW, I am currently saving a copy to a backup drive of my Thunderbird ""profile"" folder, which is about 24 GB. As it is copying, I am seeing the names of all the folders I have on my PC that have all the emails the IMAP version pulled off the Network Solutions server. Could I point my new POP3 Thunderbird account to this folder so that when the POP3 version is up and running all my folders and emails would be there?

BTW, this Profiles folder has two folders in it, both oddly named, and one almost empty and another full of stuff. Again, this is the Profiles for the IMAP Thunderbird on my PC that has all my folders and emails. I went over to my laptop, and tried to swap in that Profiles folder for the one that was there (I just swapped it in) and Thunderbird wouldn't open. Then  I swapped it back, TB opened, I went to the server settings tab and using the Browse for the folder function at the bottom I chose the Profiles I want to use from the desktop where I put it (from the SD card copy), and that didn't work. What did I do wrong? My goal was populate my newly configured POP3 TB on my laptop with the 1000s of email that got zapped from the server through IMAP.

I have plenty experience with Microsoft Outlook as a stand alone email application and that also includes Windows Mail.  </p><p>What has forced me to Thunderbird is the fact that Comcast/Xfinity has now disallowed any 3rd party stand alone email applications to be used on customers accounts. I prefer to have a client side email application as opposed to web paged interfaced email access. </p><p>I have changed back the name of 'Local Folders' mail account from 'Robert' back to 'Local Folders' and want set up the Pop account to use it's own set of folders to be accessed on my desktop computer through Thunderbird. </p><p>Below I posted a picture that shows that I only have the outgoing SMTP Comcast mail settings. I have no incoming settings being applied. I have tried several times to redo the Comcast setup by going to ""FILE""---&gt; ""NEW""---&gt; ""EXISTING MAIL ACCOUNT"" and go through the complete setup prompts. Thunderbird guides me through the setup procedures and recognizes my Comcast account and password, but does not give me an inbox with a Comcast folder with my email pop account. So I'm unable to create an email. </p><p>Also Thunderbird is not showing in Windows Firewall at all. When I reinstall Thunderbird I never get a Windows Firewall prompt with regards to allowing access.  </p><p>So I can't get Thunderbird.exe file as an allowed rule in Windows Firewall program. </p>",rvegola,false,0,0

Further investigation since my last post has uncovered a copy of the same email folders on the PC with MS365, so I can put the iiNet laptop aside from the issue before me. But my objective is to get those folders set up so I can see them from WITHIN TB, not outside it - if that is possible.  That would give me ready access to saved messages that I am likely to refer to in the future. The mail folders are located at D:\Thunderbird\sp5uno6a.default\Mail\<a href=""http://exchange.iinet.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">exchange.iinet.net.au</a>.  I assume they were written there when I was using iiNet for email on this PC.  There are two folders for each subject, one an MSF file (which could be an index) and the much more substantial File proper, which I assume contains the saved messages. The most recent activity on folders in this directory corresponds with the date I switched to MS365, confirming that these are the folders I am after. The Account Setting currently on TB for Message Storage shows the Local Directory at D:\Thunderbird\Local Folders. Although I have inserted manually in TB folders with the same names as those saved earlier, and a few of them now have one or two messages stored in them, I cannot find where they are being saved.  I'm guessing that would be where I might save copies of the folders saved earlier.  But mine is an uneducated guess. Any advice that will enable me to copy those email folders to where I could again access them from within TB would be greatly appreciated. </p>",BruceM1,false,0,0

My objective is to place them somewhere inside TB so I can at least refer to them there, preferably in the same account. I have now confirmed that TB is writing the ""new"" mailboxes (ie mailboxes entered into the single account on this TB installation) at C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\sp5uno6a.default\Imapmail\<a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>. As an experiment, with TB closed I copied from my D drive (ie archive location)  to the above address the mail files Amazon (2,802 KB) and Amazon.msf (65 KB), which were saved from a previous account. Now when I open TB and select the folder Amazon, I initially see all the messages stored in this box on my D drive.  After a very short time, they all disappear.  When I check back using Windows Explorer, I find that the file Amazon.msf has been over-written and is now just 4 KB in size. What is going on here, and how can I overcome it, please? </p>",BruceM1,false,0,0

Although I don't know the mechanics as well as some on this forum, IMAP accounts sync to the server, not to the PC. Since those messages are not on the server, they are removed. It is possible to create the folder online, and then to copy from PC to online folder, but that is a problem-prone process that doesn't work well (I say that after having read of the attempts by others on the forum), but you may want to do that. If you do, I suggest doing only a small percentage at a time. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Interestingly, most of the files did not complete the pasting process on the first attempt.  When I fired up TB and looked in Local Folders, they were not there.  But after I pasted a second time (which generated the progress marker) they were all good. I turned TB back on, and they are all there in local folders.  I also tested opening one of the archived messages and sending to my own email address a message in response, and that worked. With your kind assistance, I have achieved exactly what I sought. Again, many thanks. </p>",BruceM1,false,0,0
