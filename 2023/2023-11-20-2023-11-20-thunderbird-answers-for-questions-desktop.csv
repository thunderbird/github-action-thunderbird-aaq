I continue to struggle to understand the details of the link between 'Lightning' and 'Google Calendar'.  All my established calendars seem to have excellent two-way communication (e.g., changes in either calendar are reflected in the other), while the (internally generated) Birthday Calendar does not.  Puzzling.  I do note that Birthday Calendar displays perfectly within 'Lightning', but is 'tagged' with a 'locked' icon.  Attempts to remove the 'read only' status are unsuccessful.  Nevertheless, even as 'read only', it would seem that Google Calendar should be able to reach out and 'read' the file.

Should I do something more to have it installed properly, such as ensuring that the same version is on the external drive and the new install?

I entered the username and password for my TB account, and it opened with my profile with the same information as before,  but there were no email accounts. I had to add them, one at a time, before I could see everything in my inboxes, etc. Maybe I don't understand what creating the appropriate profile folder, and overlaying the default, mean.

I expressly mentioned the missing <strong>Mail Toolbar</strong> (<strong>not </strong>the Menu Bar, not the Composition Bar, nor any other toolbar). The Mail Toolbar has the following buttons: Get Messages, Write, Tag, QuickFilter, Print, Address Book, Reply, Forward and any other buttons you can customize it with. This Mail Toolbar is totally missing in Version 115.4.3. The new version has customizable “Spaces” one of which is the “Mail Space.” However, customizing the “Mail Space” with buttons does not make the Mail Toolbar appear. </p><p>I repeat: If you keep changing the toolbars <strong>and  </strong>the vocabulary, you are going to confuse everyone, including yourselves. Now the user cannot customize the Menu Bar (or the Unified Toolbar), so the main buttons on the Mail Toolbar (Get Messages, Write, Chat, Tag, QuickFilter, Address Book etc.) are just not there. There is also no visible way to display the Mail Toolbar. It seems that in their desperate indecision as to whether the Menu Bar or the Mail Toolbar should be on top, the developers of Thunderbird decided to eliminate the Mail Toolbar altogether. What an unfortunate decision. Give us back our Mail Toolbar!' </p>",groucho3,false,0,0

To ensure you have the columns that TB wants, I suggest creating a csv export of what is already there, then open in a spreadsheet program to view the header row. That lets you know the default.  Now, open your desired csv in the spreadsheet program and be sure to have a header row with text that matches the text of the sample.  Save that as csv and on the import, it should be easier to specify the right columns. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
