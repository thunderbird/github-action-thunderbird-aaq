The action to send an email is very specific and there is no code associated with 'Move to' that could 'send' an email. </p><p>All copies of emails you sent will be in the 'Sent' folder. Emails which you chose to 'Send Later' and stored in the 'Outbox' can get sent if you chose to 'send unsent messages' - if you went into 'Offline' mode and have settings to auto send anything currently in the 'Outbox' before going offline then an email can get sent. </p><p>re&nbsp;: Mimecast saying 'your message couldn't be delivered'.

If someone was abusing your email address - pretending to send as you - to a bunch of random email addresses hoping some would get through to inboxes and people might respond then spammer knows the email address is live and who knows what was in the content.  However, it it got sent to an email address that is unknown then it gets bounced back to what the server thinks is the sender - you. Sometimes this is the first indication that some nefarious person is trying to use your email address. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:not one I have a record of previously sending to.</em> If you have preferences set up to save outgoing email address in the 'Collected addresses' address book then there will be an entry for that email address. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I continue to struggle to understand the details of the link between 'Lightning' and 'Google Calendar'.  All my established calendars seem to have excellent two-way communication (e.g., changes in either calendar are reflected in the other), while the (internally generated) Birthday Calendar does not.  Puzzling.  I do note that Birthday Calendar displays perfectly within 'Lightning', but is 'tagged' with a 'locked' icon.  Attempts to remove the 'read only' status are unsuccessful.  Nevertheless, even as 'read only', it would seem that Google Calendar should be able to reach out and 'read' the file. Anyway, although this remains unresolved, I'll mark this as 'solved' and move on with life. Thanks again. </p>",Grizz952,false,0,0

I expressly mentioned the missing <strong>Mail Toolbar</strong> (<strong>not </strong>the Menu Bar, not the Composition Bar, nor any other toolbar).

This Mail Toolbar is totally missing in Version 115.4.3.

Now the user cannot customize the Menu Bar (or the Unified Toolbar), so the main buttons on the Mail Toolbar (Get Messages, Write, Chat, Tag, QuickFilter, Address Book etc.) are just not there. There is also no visible way to display the Mail Toolbar. It seems that in their desperate indecision as to whether the Menu Bar or the Mail Toolbar should be on top, the developers of Thunderbird decided to eliminate the Mail Toolbar altogether.
