Should I do something more to have it installed properly, such as ensuring that the same version is on the external drive and the new install? After that, should copying the profile from my laptop to my desktop computer bring all the folders with it? I thought that was what I did when I upgraded to the OS I have on the desktop now. I entered the username and password for my TB account, and it opened with my profile with the same information as before,  but there were no email accounts. I had to add them, one at a time, before I could see everything in my inboxes, etc. Maybe I don't understand what creating the appropriate profile folder, and overlaying the default, mean. Do you know of somewhere I can read step-by-step instructions for exactly how to do this? Thank you. </p>",frank.p.pro,false,0,0

There are two types: A tradtional 'User Account' which most people use their own name/nickname and set up as Admin. This means you are using a computer User Account and any files folders documents etc etc are stored on th computer within that User Account. </p><p>There is another method pushed by Microsoft. I know this because when I got a new computer the first thing it offered was to logon to a Microsoft Account. Bit cheeky - it did not mention I could set up a normal User Account - I had to dig around for it.  When you logon to a Microsoft User Account, you can get access to various apps without needing to logon separately. In other words you may be using Onedrive to store stuff on the Microsoft account and not necessarilly storing stuff on your computer. This could get awkward if you get locked out of your Microsoft Account which happened to me. I only used to get access to certain forums but I cannot get it back - I'm continually set in a loop.

Now the user cannot customize the Menu Bar (or the Unified Toolbar), so the main buttons on the Mail Toolbar (Get Messages, Write, Chat, Tag, QuickFilter, Address Book etc.) are just not there. There is also no visible way to display the Mail Toolbar. It seems that in their desperate indecision as to whether the Menu Bar or the Mail Toolbar should be on top, the developers of Thunderbird decided to eliminate the Mail Toolbar altogether.

This wasn't a problem until that folder got corrupted but maybe you can help me on which file or files might be the issue as I know the problem.  I tried to send from one of my accounts and got ""relaying disallowed from my_email"". It took me a little bit to understand, but I'm using an online account with my own domain, and I have several email address with that domain. For example for myemail@mydomain.com, myemailjunk@mydomain.com, and say myotheremail@mydomain.com. It's all being sent to a single online email service with the same domain that you would normally use like <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> or <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> but it requires a login with the entire email at the same SMTP address. Two of these are getting the SMTP settings conflated. I found myemailjunk@mydomain.com with the SMTP username of myemail@mydomain.com, but when I change it, it changes the other myemail@mydomain.com as well and visa versa. So two have become one in the SMTP settings. So, I'll have one of these broken all the time unless I find the file where this is corrupted at.  </p><p><br> On the symlink: Maybe, but I need to move to a more devops ci/cd linux solution. Part of that is going to be separating data from the program. The other is having flat file configurations that can be dropped for setup rather than having to be configure. I'm learning this for work/jobs but it's needed at home to. As a non-youngster resetting up your system all the time, is just wearing. I need to get it where it's highly configured, but all automated and where my data is separate from the code/program.  (encapsulation kind of thing)   </p><p>Currently, the symlink is to a nas, where that data should be safer... I need to set up an automated git push on that folder, if I can get it down in size to just the config/settings. Currently, I know only I would exclude the mail directory. I wish there was better documentation on what files are what; if there is let me know. </p>",larrysjunk,false,0,0
