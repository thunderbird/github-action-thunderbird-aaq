Because if you create it in Thunderbird then computer must be left switched on and never go to sleep nor hiberate; your User Account must be logged into and Thunderbird must be running. This is not adviseable from a security point of view if you are 'not in the office'. </p><p>But if you really do want to do it then: </p> <ul><li> create an email with Subject eg: 'out of office' which says appolgies I 'll get back to as as soon as possible or whatever you want to say and save as a 'Template'.   </li></ul> <p>It then gets saved in the 'Templates' folder. </p><p>In 'Message Filters' </p> <ul><li> Create a new filter named Out of Office </li><li> Apply filter when 'Getting new mail' </li><li> Suggest you use 'Filter After junk Calssification' because you do not really want to be reponding to junk mail. </li><li> Select 'Match all the following' </li><li> Select 'To' 'contains' and type your email address </li></ul> <p>So only responding to emails sent to you. Action: </p> <ul><li> select 'Reply with Template' and choose the 'Out of Office' template you created. </li></ul> <p>Make sure this message filter is not enabled until required. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0
