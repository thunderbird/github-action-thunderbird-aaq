Recently have had a number of serious security incidents&nbsp;!. In writing this suggestion/request, may I as an Older person suggest in your HELP, you have a ""Wish List""&nbsp;!. In looking thru lots of themes &amp; apps nothing equates to what I would like and maybe many others. Wish No 1. TB powers up in ""Offline"" mode, (DEFAULT ). ALL Systems, Windows/Linux. Wish No 2. Enable H/W interrupt to stop programme immediately if conconcerned&nbsp;! ( suggest Cntrl/Return ) Wish No 3. Download messages into main email folder with subject line, Then ""STOP""&nbsp;!. In UK I use BT IMAP as main server, I have several email folders with different passwords. Recently on TB ver 102.10 Win10 64bit. SMTP will not link to server, checked out passwords &amp; direct on BT, ALL OK. This time I set ""Pasword Manager"" box&nbsp;! since then NO problems (YET ). This leads me to believe we have a BUG/Corruption of password when using SMTP without ""Password Manager""&nbsp;?. No doubt SMTP picks up paswords from different places, Ie "" Profile "" or "" Password Manager "" Wish No 4. LETS GET SOME COLOUR&nbsp;!!! I would like to have ""Sub Main Domains"". These ""Sub Main Domains"" could have a choice of different colours, which would help other folk to use TB easier, also resize for poor eyesight,  maybe a good little marketing statement&nbsp;? These Sub Main Domains wlii not allow data entry but if clicked will bring up option ""Create New Sub Folder"". </p><p>I hope you find my wish List of interest. There are are several others, so I await your response. Rgds Gordon. Stay Safe. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1575944;,rugbyguy1

Somehow, the Oauthor got changed to normal password which will not work with AT&amp;T.  I got a new code from them but when I go to change my password I only see an outbound server now. My inbound server is listed as  <a href=""http://inbound.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">inbound.att.net</a> as the server name but when I go to saved passwords I do not see an inbound provider.  just outbound. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>I can access my email on the att website. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",david-gipson
