Just the user interface to get to the settings is different. </p><p>I did have a look here <a href=""https://cheapsslweb.com/blog/how-to-fix-pr-connect-reset-error-in-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cheapsslweb.com/blog/how-to-fix-pr-connect-reset-error-in-firefox</a> and a few other sites with articles mentioning the error and it looks like they have a fairly standard diagnostic process before pointing the finger at the antivirus. 1. Clear the cache.  (There is a button for that at the top of the troubleshooting information on the help menu.) 2. Disable security measures – antivirus &amp; firewall (generally here, unless there is some clear reason,  we do not suggest disabling Windows defender) 3. Disable and virtual private network(VPN) and proxy 4. Disable addons. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

My Thunderbird serves two separate email addresses with their own separate inboxes.  If inbox A receives two new messages and inbox B receives one new message, the Thunderbird taskbar tray icon will show (red circle number) 5 new messages.  In contrast, if inbox A receives one new message and inbox B receives two, the icon will say 4 new messages.  A single new message in A is shown on the icon as two; a single new message in B is shown as one.  Clearly, the icon new message counter is double counting only inbox A.  Very weird!  This selective inbox A double counting happens constantly regardless of the combination and number of new messages for each inbox.  This happens in real time as new messages come in.  To repeat above, every other aspect of Thunderbird email works perfectly fine and the counts of all folders is correct within the Thunderbird window. </p><p>My Thunderbird is kept up-to-date and this double counting has been going on for at least 3 months. </p>",cvancant,false,0,0
