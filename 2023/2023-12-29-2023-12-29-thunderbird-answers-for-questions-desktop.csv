Just the user interface to get to the settings is different. </p><p>I did have a look here <a href=""https://cheapsslweb.com/blog/how-to-fix-pr-connect-reset-error-in-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cheapsslweb.com/blog/how-to-fix-pr-connect-reset-error-in-firefox</a> and a few other sites with articles mentioning the error and it looks like they have a fairly standard diagnostic process before pointing the finger at the antivirus. 1. Clear the cache.  (There is a button for that at the top of the troubleshooting information on the help menu.) 2. Disable security measures – antivirus &amp; firewall (generally here, unless there is some clear reason,  we do not suggest disabling Windows defender) 3. Disable and virtual private network(VPN) and proxy 4. Disable addons. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
