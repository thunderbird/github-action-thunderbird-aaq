About 2 months ago T-bird stopped bringing in all the e-mails from my local provider (<a href=""http://kos.net"" rel=""nofollow"">kos.net</a>). The account is set up as an I-map account. Some emails came into the inbox, but not others. To see them I had to go to my server's webmail, and they were all there. To me it appears rather random. At the same time, T-bird disappeared a lot (but not all) of the emails that I had moved to various local folders. I have a very complex setup of local folders. I just recently discovered the 'file repair' function under properties, so I tried it on the main inbox and on various local folders. Presto, all the emails were now displayed in T-bird. Alas, as soon as I left the folder I had repaired, and then came back to it, the emails were disappeared again. I don't believe I have broken through any file size numbers that may affect T-bird. I am not a geek, and don't know where to turn next. Any suggestions? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1573751;,eehtak

Is there an option to Repair only that email instead of Repairing the whole inbox.  Thunderbird is connected to Gmail which is the source email. Observed, if I deleted the corrupted email in Thunderbird this also gets deleted in my Gmail inbox and vice versa.  Seems Thunderbird still retaining the Gmail email ID when deleting so is it possible to bring down only that email using that source inbox email id. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1573733;,shettyna

There was no option to ""remove"" it like normal Favorite Folders.   </p><p>I couldn't find any setting to remove it and even looked in Config Editor.  I removed the account completely and, yes, it removed the Favorite Folders entry.  However, the minute I added the account back, it returned.   </p><p>The only fix I found was to copy the profile from the other machine over, delete the current profile, and replace it.  That worked.   </p><p>Is this a bug in the beta that just happened to manifest on one machine and not the other, or is there a Favorites Folder setting I missed that somehow added the account folder rather than an individual folder/subfolder?

1409787,2023-04-01 10:18:08 -0700,2023-04-02 14:00:54 -0700,filters sending everything to Junk folder,"<p>I'm at quite a loss about filters. I've used TBird for decades but this was never as important as it has become. Anyway, I have about a half-dozen filters. Each of them contains multiple addresses and I've clicked to match ANY of the following. Each is set to mark the message as NOT junk and send it to a specified folder.  </p><p>In all cases, I've checked to apply the filter when MANUALLY RUN and GETTING NEW MAIL . Next to the latter, I've chosen FILTER BEFORE JUNK CLASSIFICATION. But now I'm wondering whether I actually understand this last part.  </p><p>I'm wondering because I set up a FINAL filter to mark a message from every sender who is NOT in my personal address book OR in collected addresses as JUNK and send the message to the junk folder. Further, I've set this to execute BEFORE junk classification.  </p><p>But virtually all of my mail is getting branded as junk and going to the junk folder. That is, mail from a person who is in my personal address book AND is listed in a previous filter is STILL going to junk. So am I misunderstanding just what ""filter before [after] junk classification"" really means? I assumed (famous last words) that the filter would be applied before TBird's own heuristic (?) operation. Or is that final filter my problem? When I disable that, I get some improvement. Of course, it's hard to test every variable in a short period of time.  </p><p>What am I missing here? Where should I look first/next? </p><p>Many thanks, Jeanne  Windows TBird 102.7.2 (32-bit) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1573750;1573841;,JeanneR
