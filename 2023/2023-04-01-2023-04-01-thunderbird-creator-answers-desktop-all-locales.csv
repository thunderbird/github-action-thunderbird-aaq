Is that possible?  One inbox for mail A, but sent as mail A or mail B with each own SMTP.  </p><p>Case: </p> <ol><li> Mail A has IMAP and SMTP access </li><li> Mail B has SMTP access </li><li> Mail A and mail B has different SMTP </li><li> Mail B has no IMAP/POP access but all email received are forwarded to Mail A </li></ol> <p>Purpose: Send email like normal (choose one click sender, then write the rest of mail) using email with only SMTP access </p><p>It works well if they are on the same SMTP. As each account can only have one SMTP, I have to change SMTP manually to mail B after sending mail as mail A.

Was working fine with Nord VPN. The problem is with Thunderbird app since I have no pb with my phone or tablet that uses FairEmail. No pb while using the browser version pf my email provider (posteo) either. I only get the ""sending of the email failed"" when using Thunderbird app on Windows 10.  I did all the troubleshooting on the general help pages, nothing helps so far. And I can't seem to find any live support or even an email address for support.

I've used TBird for decades but this was never as important as it has become. Anyway, I have about a half-dozen filters. Each of them contains multiple addresses and I've clicked to match ANY of the following. Each is set to mark the message as NOT junk and send it to a specified folder.  </p><p>In all cases, I've checked to apply the filter when MANUALLY RUN and GETTING NEW MAIL . Next to the latter, I've chosen FILTER BEFORE JUNK CLASSIFICATION. But now I'm wondering whether I actually understand this last part.  </p><p>I'm wondering because I set up a FINAL filter to mark a message from every sender who is NOT in my personal address book OR in collected addresses as JUNK and send the message to the junk folder. Further, I've set this to execute BEFORE junk classification.  </p><p>But virtually all of my mail is getting branded as junk and going to the junk folder. That is, mail from a person who is in my personal address book AND is listed in a previous filter is STILL going to junk. So am I misunderstanding just what ""filter before [after] junk classification"" really means? I assumed (famous last words) that the filter would be applied before TBird's own heuristic (?) operation. Or is that final filter my problem? When I disable that, I get some improvement. Of course, it's hard to test every variable in a short period of time.  </p><p>What am I missing here?
