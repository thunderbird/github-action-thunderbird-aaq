The cause is fairly simple,  so is the cure. </p><p>Thunderbird defaults to using a junk and a trash folder.  Google use a Spam and a bin (apparently) folder. </p><p>When the account is initially created the IMAP mail server is supposed to offer folders with their special flag and Thunderbird is supposed to honor that,  but as you see that is not always what happens. </p><p>Go to the account setting for the account and in server settings make sure the folder trash is moved to is the bin folder. </p><p>Then move to the junk settings and again change the folder to the one google chooses (spam) </p><p>Follow that with restarting Thunderbird.  This ""should"" reset you to have the folders,  but only one of them having the special icon.  Once the folder is ""just a folder"" you can delete it. </p><p>IF the restart does not change the icon, you can force the issue using this addon. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/</a> I do not recommend changing it in a forced manner if any of your account setting are still pointing to it as special as that is just mess things up in a big way. </p><p>Note if you do not want to have the [gmail] sub folder you can add to the server settings advanced dialog that the imapo server directory is [gmail].

And then to install fresh. The message folders for the POP account could then be copied back to the Local Folders section so that they would not be lost. Let me know if this sounds workable for you. As far as account passwords go, you should be able to get new ones from your email provider. In summary, all is not lost.  (TIP: Your old profile is in the folder at c:\users\&lt;youid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles. There may be more than one folder there, so you can get name of what was the active profile by viewing a small text file at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.ini.

While I see the toolbar has changed ever so slightly, I couldn't tell you the difference from 102 except it's slightly easier to read and a bit more colorful.  I pay yearly for Thunderbird, as I think all regular users should, but I just don't understand why you hyped up such a minor change that it's just about irrelevant.  When you see a jump from 102 to 115 you expect something dramatic and a drastic improvement.  It's evolutionary, and it works, but it's just no big deal and it should have been another iteration of 102.  In fact, overall, it might a more of a negative than a positive, because many of the add-on's I was using no longer work on 115. </p>",chunnel,false,0,1

You could argue that Thunderbird was not behaving correctly in 102. If you select email then it should go to Thunderbird app and open the selected email.
