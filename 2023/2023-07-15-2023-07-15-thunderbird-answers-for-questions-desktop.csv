If yours was a POP account, I would suggest, before deleting anything, to use Windows file explorer to copy the profile to another folder and then to delete the current Thunderbird AND also any remaining data. And then to install fresh. The message folders for the POP account could then be copied back to the Local Folders section so that they would not be lost. Let me know if this sounds workable for you. As far as account passwords go, you should be able to get new ones from your email provider. In summary, all is not lost.  (TIP: Your old profile is in the folder at c:\users\&lt;youid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles. There may be more than one folder there, so you can get name of what was the active profile by viewing a small text file at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles.ini.
