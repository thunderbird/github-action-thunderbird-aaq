La dimensione è superiore a 2G e il mio timore è che facendo la copia manuale oltre a trasferire account di cui non mi interessa (thunderbird nel pc da cui trasferire include diversi account di posta che devono restare dove sono) ho il dubbio che si possa sovrascrivere sul nuovo pc dove , ripeto, esistono altri account di posta che intendo conservare con la loro storia. Mi dite come fare senza perdere niente, grazie. Pino </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,it,"",pinotraina

When I delete an attachment, the original email containing the attachment is not deleted. So I have two versions of the email in my postbox, one with the attachment, the other without. </p><p>Probably I'm missing a setting?  </p><p>Thunderbird version 115.3.3 (32-Bit) </p><p>Sincerely yours, Markus Piotrowski </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Markus.Piotrowski

Every time I send an email from that account, Windows Security opens up a dialogue box, asking me to select a certificate for authentication onto <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>. It offers a Microsoft Your Phone certificate (see image attached),which works OK, but being Windows, the dialogue box opens behind the other open apps without any further notifcation - and if I'm busy, I won't notice it, and the email won't be sent.  </p><p>I've tried installing the certificate, but that hasn't changed anything. </p><p>I've also attached a screenshot of my SMTP settings. </p><p>Can anyone suggest a permanent solution? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",humphries.edwin

Anyway, when trying to create an email, and using the ""Bullet"" option, I install a bullet, then when I try to put a word in bold or regular text, the text jumps above the bullet.  Also, when typing a line that is not bold, if I have to backspace for a spelling error, it turns the font to bold every time. It seems there are a lot of bugs when writing emails now.   Try using ""bullets"" in an email and try to type behind that bullet and see what happens. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1613688;,GuardianoftheIdiots

There are over 20,000 messages, and I want to find and delete ones with BIG attachments. Is there a way to order my view by attachment size?  </p><p>The sort-by option lets me choose 'attachments', so emails with attachments are listed above those without, but the list is still ordered by date, and the attachment size is shown only per email when the message is selected. </p><p>Any clues much appreciated.. thanks Alan </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1613689;,anadem
