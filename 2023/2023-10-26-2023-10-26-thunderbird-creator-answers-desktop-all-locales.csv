Andava tutto bene quando una di queste mattine il client si è aperto, mi dava l'intestazione e la barra di stato, ma tutto il resto era bianco. Ho utilizzato la funzione ""Modalità risoluzione problemi"" e ho riportato il client come se fosse in impostazioni di fabbrica. Il problema è che ora anche se visualizzo tutto bene non ho più le cartelle unificate. La posta in arrivo è in tutti gli account in modo separato e la consultazione è alquanto fastidiosa e difficile. Premetto che prima di questo problema e dopo l'aggiornamento tutto funzionava bene, non so cosa sia successo. Ora anche se provo a spuntare la modalità ""Cartelle unificate"" viene spuntata sul momento ma non succede nulla e se rientro per vedere la indicata modalità il segno di spunta è sparita; ho anche provato a mettere il segno di spunta e riavviare il client ma non è cambiato nulla. Ho cercato in internet qualche soluzione ma non ha funzionato nulla. Non so più che pesci prendere. Grazie a chi vorrà aiutarmi. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,"",e.ru2208

If I minimized (or expanded) a thread, it stayed that way:  either thru a Thunderbird restart, or just returning to the same folder.  It seemed to remember. </p><p>Sometime in the last few updates, I'm noticing all threads are fully expanded.  I can minimize them, but if I go to another folder, and then come back -- they are again expanded. </p><p>This is a bit annoying, is there a setting I can change?

But it doesn't seem to work for folders. </p><p>I noticed the problem when I went to my server, changed the location of a folder (moved it under another one) and then went back to thunderbird. Of course, the folder didn't automatically change but I was ok with that, but to my surprise when I hit the button on the top left, I found out that nothing changed (And clicking on the folder that I moved gave a ""this folder doesn't exist on the server"" type of message). </p><p>After reading this thread: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1113404"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1113404</a> </p><p>I realized that this problem has existed for years, I minimized the email, went to another email (like the thread implies as the best solution, clicked on the local folders as well and then returned to the email that I was working on. And like magic the folder in front of my eyes moved under the other folder. That means that closing and reopening thunderbird would work as well, but I really don't think that should be a solution. Other programs like outlook show you that they are also searching for changes in the folders as well when you hit the sync button. Why is there no similar functionality in thunderbird? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",georgekalan29
