There are over 20,000 messages, and I want to find and delete ones with BIG attachments. Is there a way to order my view by attachment size?  </p><p>The sort-by option lets me choose 'attachments', so emails with attachments are listed above those without, but the list is still ordered by date, and the attachment size is shown only per email when the message is selected. </p><p>Any clues much appreciated.. thanks Alan </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",anadem
