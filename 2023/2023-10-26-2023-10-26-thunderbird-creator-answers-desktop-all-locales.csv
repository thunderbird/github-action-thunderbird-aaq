The last couple of years have seen updates that alter the UI and none of them have been things I wanted. </p><p>So for me, and perhaps you, the upgrade process (without asking) just like on other systems I've noticed recently (Slack), has been a progressive mandatory downgrade process. I do not think the ""designers/engineers"" have the slightest idea. Their goal, apparently, is change. Period. A constant seemingly compulsive re-organizing and over-engineering, when what is needed is *refinement* and leaving the layout to the users. People have their own workflow - DUH - and these upgrades are doing nothing for those who do *not* want to change the layout. Did the designers/engineers genuinely ask the question for each and every change no matter how small: ""How does this impact our users and why is this needed?"" </p><p>On the glitzy, page-after-page of huge screenshots of busy-ness, I was hit with the overwhelming feeling of ""here's how to [deal with] your new upgrade"". I saw a slider comparison of the two versions and I *immediately* liked the one on the right and *immediately* disliked the one on the left. It took me several looks to realize the one on the left *was the upgrade* ...&nbsp;:: eyes roll&nbsp;:: </p><p>Opened Thunderbird and I have lost all formatting, everything is overly compact and busy, a 1000 icons that all look the same where I don't want any, even my email summary list is squished and tedious to read and navigate and guess what? I now apparently have to see 9 of these at a time when I only want 4 or 5. Can't even control something that small - WTFGrrrrr Even the Thunderbird icon is whacked: it looks like a huge blue claw holding an egg it is about to crush - something really symbolic about that methinks... </p><p>This ""upgrade"" basically ruined my day and now I am grieving for yet another software package falling into Design Hell where apparently the designers/engineers don't care one bit - to them ""the design is the thing"" when actually ""the users are the thing"" and they have either forgotten or are never using it day-to-day in the real world. </p><p>I tried for a few minutes to find controls to turn things off and revert but frankly I do not have the time and energy to try to unwind someone else's crappy design decisions. I also *could not find anything useful*. I actually started looking for alternatives and am thinking about just doing web-based email - another project I didn't need to start... </p><p>Thunderbird should be about making my life easier and it just did the opposite, so thanks for the older versions but this one Jumped the Shark. </p><p>And thus I propose a new term for all software that goes this route: ""They 115'ed it!"" </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",wacrosby
