The last couple of years have seen updates that alter the UI and none of them have been things I wanted. </p><p>So for me, and perhaps you, the upgrade process (without asking) just like on other systems I've noticed recently (Slack), has been a progressive mandatory downgrade process.

A constant seemingly compulsive re-organizing and over-engineering, when what is needed is *refinement* and leaving the layout to the users.

Can't even control something that small - WTFGrrrrr Even the Thunderbird icon is whacked: it looks like a huge blue claw holding an egg it is about to crush - something really symbolic about that methinks... </p><p>This ""upgrade"" basically ruined my day and now I am grieving for yet another software package falling into Design Hell where apparently the designers/engineers don't care one bit - to them ""the design is the thing"" when actually ""the users are the thing"" and they have either forgotten or are never using it day-to-day in the real world. </p><p>I tried for a few minutes to find controls to turn things off and revert but frankly I do not have the time and energy to try to unwind someone else's crappy design decisions. I also *could not find anything useful*.
