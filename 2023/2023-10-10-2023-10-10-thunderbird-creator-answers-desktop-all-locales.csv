Authenticated messages: </p><pre>   Help protect recipients from malicious messages, such as spoofing and phishing messages.    Help protect you and your organization from being impersonated.     Are less likely to be rejected or marked as spam by Gmail. </pre> <p>Set up email authentication for each of your sending domains at your domain provider. In addition to following the instructions we provide, you should also refer to your domain provider's email authentication instructions. To verify messages are authenticated, Google performs checks on messages sent to Gmail accounts. To improve email delivery, we recommend that you always set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your domains. Make sure you're meeting the minimum authentication requirements described in Sender Guidelines. Messages that aren’t authenticated with these methods might be marked as spam or rejected with a 5.7.26 error.  If you use an email service provider, verify that they authenticate your domain’s email with SPF and DKIM. We recommend you always use the same domain for email authentication and hosting your public website. SPF SPF prevents spammers from sending unauthorized messages that appear to be from your domain. Set up SPF by publishing an SPF record at your domain. The SPF record for your domain should reference all email senders for your domain. If third-party senders aren't included in your SPF record, messages from these senders are more likely to be marked as spam. Learn how to define your SPF record and add it to your domain. DKIM Turn on DKIM for the domain that sends your email. Receiving servers use DKIM to verify that the domain owner actually sent the message. Learn how to turn on DKIM for your domain. Important: Sending to personal Gmail accounts requires a DKIM key of 1024 bits or longer. For security reasons, we recommend using a 2048-bit key if your domain provider supports this. Learn more about DKIM key length. DMARC DMARC lets you tell receiving servers what to do with messages from your domain that don’t pass SPF or DKIM. Set up DMARC by publishing a DMARC record for your domain. To pass DMARC authentication, messages must be authenticated by SPF and/or DKIM. The authenticating domain must be the same domain that's in the message From: header. Learn how to add a DMARC record at your domain. We recommend you set up DMARC reports so you can monitor email sent from your domain, or appears to have been sent from your domain. DMARC reports help you identify senders that may be impersonating your domain. Learn more about DMARC reports. When you set up DMARC, you can then optionally set up BIMI to add your brand logo to messages sent from your domain. Learn how to add your brand logo with BIMI. ARC ARC checks the previous authentication status of forwarded messages. If a forwarded message passes SPF or DKIM authentication, but ARC shows it previously failed authentication, Gmail treats the message as unauthenticated. We recommend that senders use ARC authentication, especially if they forward email regularly. Learn more about ARC authentication. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1610141;1610166;1610171;1610183;1610219;1610389;1625171;1625173;1625192;,cyclonecomputer

This gives me groups of Older, Last 14 Days, Last 7 Days, Yesterday and Today with arrows to collapse or expand the groups. I keep the first 4 groups collapsed and only group Today expanded. </p><p>Problem 1: When I navigate to a different folder then back to Inbox, all the groups are now expanded and must be re-collapsed. In 102 the Message List Display would remember the collapsed/expanded state of each group while 105 the state for all groups is changed to expanded. </p><p>Problem 2: In 102, when a group is collapsed the Message List Line shows for the group shows only the collapse/expand arrow, the group name and the number of messages in the group.  Example: ""                                      &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                                                                   "" </p><p>In 115, when a collapse is executed, the group name line below is not properly erased so that From, Received, and Size fields show the From, Received and Size from the message that previously was on that specific screen line which is the top message in the newly collapsed group. Example: ""                                &gt; Older (19)                                                                                                   "" Example: ""       AT&amp;T                &gt; Last 14 Days (2)                         9/3/2022, 4:29 PM                1.6 MB     "" Example: ""       LinkedIn           V Today (6/6)                                8/20/2023, 1:18 PM              42.5 KB    "" (Other fields may behave similarly but I have not seen it because those fields were blank anyway) </p><p>Problem 3: This occurs in 115, and in 102 which I have previously reported but did not get fixed in 115. When the popup requesting file cleanup pops up and continue is clicked, when it finishes the Message list display options Sort by &gt; Grouped By Sort becomes unchecked and my message list is no longer grouped by sort.
