I use a number of Inbox rules to move new messages to their intended destinations.  When new messages arrive the numeric counter or badge to indicate that there's a new message somewhere in the branch appears correctly at the parent level, but when I expand that branch to see where the message is the counter no longer appears for intermediate branches.  I have to rattle through and completely expand *every* branch of the folder tree until I find the folder where the new message resides at which time the badge once again magically appears.  This makes screening new mail very inefficient and negates much of the value of Inbox rules. </p><p>This is a new issue and only appeared with the latest update (115.3.1). </p><p>Please advise / thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1609784;,braywood
