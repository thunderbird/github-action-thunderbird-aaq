After Thunderbird updated late last week I have been having problems sending emails with my work Microsoft Outlook Office365 account (no such problems up to last Thursday 13 July)&nbsp;: Emails with just a couple of words in the body arrive but with nothing in the body. Emails with just a couple of words in the body and a text file attached arrive but with nothing in the body and without the attachment. Emails with just a couple of words in the body and a Excel file attached fail to send at all (error message). No such problems sending emails via the Office 365 web portal. I have Exquilla installed and its licence is current. Tried removing the Outlook account and re-installing it, but this made no difference. Temporarily disabling my ESET NOD32 AV software made no difference either. Tearing my hair out.  Would anyone have any ideas on how to fix this&nbsp;? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1591012;1591014;,ejbax
