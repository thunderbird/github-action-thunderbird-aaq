And indeed: some messages - that I know have been sent to me - simpy have not arrived, which is worrying. </p><p>The email is downloaded via the POP protocol, and I have now changed the settings to keep the mail on the server for two days. Then I can use webmail, and indeed there the missing messages are present. </p><p>I already used the Repair option in the Properties of the Inbox.  Not sure if that helped, as the problem is present only now and then.

Now I'm not getting some of my service providers emails coming into thunderbird. I'm getting most of them but some are not getting through. I know to look for these by seeing that some emails show as unread (bold) but it looks on thunderbird that every one has been read. So I go to Spectrum and I find them there. I read them there and the bold comes off on Thunderbird. But the emails don't come through so I can only read them from the Spectrum website.

I am very disappointed it has not been fixed in the latest release as I filed a bug report on Bugzilla over a year and a half ago and it appears it has not been followed up on.  I used to use the badge extension that did the same thing, but since the developer noted that since Thunderbird added the feature, he is no longer developing or supporting this add-on.  This is unfortunate, because IT DOESN""T WORK unless you use an admin account.  I have verified this using my admin boot and my laptop which only has an admin account, but my bug report still says after a year and a half this is ""unverified"".  Apparently I will die from something before this gets fixed.  Until then, with my poor eyes unable to see the tiny red dot in the system tray when I have new mail, I will have to open Thunderbird each time to see of any of my family has sent an email. </p><p>BTW, I have tried checking the box to get system notifications in Windows 10, but this has proven to be unreliable with Microsoft seemingly breaking something with every monthly security update I get. </p><p>Is it too much to ask to get a working new email badge in non-admin accounts? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1591659;1591661;1591662;1608328;,lmw2020
