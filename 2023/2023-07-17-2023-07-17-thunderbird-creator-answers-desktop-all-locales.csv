(se è più facile o utile posso ripetere la domanda in italiano),"<p>I was trying to make order in my Thunderbird archives by creating some ""mega-directories"" in order to store there several old directories. I was able to transfer a lot of existing directories, but I failed with two of them, very big and full of sub-directiories. During the operations I lost almost all the subdirectories. How can I use a backup to recover the lost subdirectories? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,"",l.piccioni

Recently a disturning issue came up though: incoming emails sometimes seem to disappear from my inbox. </p><p>What happens is that when checking my email the Thunderbirds status bar says ""downloading message n of m"" and ""received n of n messages"", however no new messages are shown in my Inbox.  And indeed: some messages - that I know have been sent to me - simpy have not arrived, which is worrying. </p><p>The email is downloaded via the POP protocol, and I have now changed the settings to keep the mail on the server for two days. Then I can use webmail, and indeed there the missing messages are present. </p><p>I already used the Repair option in the Properties of the Inbox.  Not sure if that helped, as the problem is present only now and then. Also: the missing emails did not seem malformed (and downloading emails is not totally blocked, what could be caused by a mailformed email). </p><p>Does anyone have a suggestion about what may case this problem&nbsp;? </p><p>Lex. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1591029;,lennings

I can receive them OK. </p><p>I have checked my modem to confirm it is working correctly and appears to be doing so, it will send out data on my browser, i.e. a google search term will generate a result. </p><p>The last email I can confirm sending successfully was 12 July 2023 - sent to myself at my work email address. Although I have sent others since I can't confirm if they went successfully, although they appear in the Sent folder. </p><p>So far as I am aware there have been no changes of any type in recent weeks/months.  In testing today to try to find the issue I have 'turned off' then 'turned on again' my modem, Firefox, computer and allowed all to reset when turned back on again.  I also ran Firefox in Troubleshoot mode, but it made no difference. </p><p>The SMPT settings appear to be OK (to my untrained eye) when following the Troubleshooting guide. </p><p>Assistance please. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1591033;,loxphoto

After Thunderbird updated late last week I have been having problems sending emails with my work Microsoft Outlook Office365 account (no such problems up to last Thursday 13 July)&nbsp;: Emails with just a couple of words in the body arrive but with nothing in the body. Emails with just a couple of words in the body and a text file attached arrive but with nothing in the body and without the attachment. Emails with just a couple of words in the body and a Excel file attached fail to send at all (error message). No such problems sending emails via the Office 365 web portal. I have Exquilla installed and its licence is current. Tried removing the Outlook account and re-installing it, but this made no difference. Temporarily disabling my ESET NOD32 AV software made no difference either. Tearing my hair out.  Would anyone have any ideas on how to fix this&nbsp;? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1591012;1591014;,ejbax
