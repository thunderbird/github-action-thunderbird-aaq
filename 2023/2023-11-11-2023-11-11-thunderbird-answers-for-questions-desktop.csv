It would be hidden until I went to the Junk folder, and then it would appear.  However in v115, there is only the JUNK button under Customize Toolbar options, but no NOT JUNK button.  Is this a bug, or was it removed on purpose? </blockquote> <p>FYI ... I am using v115.4.2 (64-bit) on Windows. </p>",jeff18,false,0,0
