The email is in a folder structure which I would like to preserve. I would like to avoid having to recreate the folder structure by hand on the target; that would be very time consuming. I have been experimenting with a small nested set of folders before moving on to the real problem. </p><p>My first thought was to drag and drop the top level folder to local folders. First I checked that I could do it one folder at a time - no problem. If I try with a top level folder with sub-structure it only works if I specify that all sub folders are to be held locally. There is no way to mark a whole branch for local storage (that I have found), so that is a bit tedious running down the folder list ticking. So question 1: is there a better way. </p><p>Then I want to drag and drop from the local folders to the second account. For a single folder this works. For my small test folder with sub-structure it does not work. </p><p>It may be significant that the IMAP server for BOTH accounts (same server) does not support folders with both messages and sub-folders; the option ""Server supports folders that contain sub-folders and messages"" is therefore unticked for both accounts. I wonder if the information that a specific folder only contains sub-folders is lost in the move. </p><p>I then tried the ImportExportTools-ng plug-in. That suffered pretty much the same problem. I could export (same synchronise issue as above). I could import the result to Local Folders, but I could not import the same data to my target account.  </p><p>I would be grateful for any other ideas. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",steve538

Thinking it must be something on my computer (Linux, as is hers) I installed Evolution on the same machine.

Now for certain email addresses I am unable to send encrypted email.  Thunderbird says:  ""Sending of the message failed. You specified encryption for this message, but the application failed to find an encryption certificate for xxx@xxx.xxx""   However, I can see via the Account Settings and People certs that  those Certs exists and are valid.  Also, via command line reading the cert9.db and key4.db, the Cert for those users exist: </p><p>Certificate: </p><pre>   Data:        Version: 3 (0x2)        Serial Number: 363175 (0x58aa7)        Signature Algorithm: PKCS #1 SHA-256 With RSA Encryption        Issuer: ""CN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXC=US""        Validity:            Not Before: Thu Jul 07 00:00:00 2022            Not After&nbsp;: Sun Jul 06 23:59:59 2025        Subject: ""CN=XXX@XXX.XXX - OU=XXX, OU=XXX, O=XXX </pre> <p>Anyhow, I noticed that the cert8.db and key3.db had older entries, and I move that file to a backup folder so Thunderbird is only using cert9.db and key4.db.  Again, the cert exists and Thunderbird sees it with the GUI.   I didn't have this problem previously. I did obviously try keeping  the cert8.db and key3.db along with cert9.db and key4.db in the Thunderbird dir, but again, it appears Thunderbird has moved on to using cert9.db and key4db.  Some users with Valid Certs work for sending encrypted emails and some users do not. BTW: The intermediate signing and root signing certs are all trusted.  </p><p>Also, for this new Version, when I run the GUI Tool/Tab from Thunderbird -&gt; Security -&gt; View Certificates of Recipients the output shows Not found for any users, even for the users who I am able send an encrypted email to (like myself). I can send myself an encrypted email, but tool output shows as Status ""Not Found"" for even my own cert even though I can send an encrypted email and read the encrypted email to myself via Thunderbird. </p><p>Please advise. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1582314;,mishra771

I am receiving emails in this account, and now drafts are being saved but not sending.  I have checked every setting and password.  I am at my wits end.  Copying a formatted message from T-bird to gmail is a big extra step.  This is now a weeks worth of hassle.  I've read every help article and most are fore MUCH earlier versions.  I am fully updated on T-bird, Mozilla and using Windows 10.  Two other gmail accounts are working fine on T-bird. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582449;1582483;,lorilohman

It helps very much in knowing whether a help article pre-dates the version a user has installed, and in deciding which of similar articles is the most recent, etc. Thanks for considering this! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582428;1582444;1582446;1582450;,libcub1

Lets call them A1 and A2. last week A1 all of a sudden stopped working. Google asked me password and second pass verification. But when trying to connect to google again a message ""authentication error"" arrived.  </p><p>I then disinstalled TB and downloaded it anew. A2 started working immediately, but when trying to redefine A1 the above message ""Unable to login..."" appeared.  I then tried to define A1 on the TB of the laptop of my girlfriend. There it started working without any problems.  Both PC's have the same TB version and are working under Windows 10 with the same version. Seems to me very strange.  </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582445;1582491;1582503;1582538;1584589;,aherz10@gmail.com
