I have dealt with lots of support issues over the years where folk are lost moving their profile to a new device because of such a change and have forgotten it.  It usually appears as the profile not moving or mail being missing post the move and take a load of back and forth before the penny drops that they changed something about locations 5 years ago. </p><p>For this reason I always recommend using the profile manager or About:profiles to create a new profile in the desired location and setting it to default.

Sorry to take a week to say so. </p><p>2)  Matt, when  I said ""obscure"", I didn't mean it was hard to get to.  Rather, I meant that for a new user - myself, at least - I don't think of an email account as a file, so I wouldn't expect it to be under File / New.  It's a combination of the location and the labeling that makes it obscure. </p><p>3)  I followed the instructions in David's 6/30/23, 5:10 AM post before seeing Matt's 6/30/23, 6:20 PM post.  Here's where that's at. </p><p>a)  I added all my accounts successfully.  The data went into C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\ </p><p>b)  With TB closed, I copied the Thunderbird folder to K:\AppData\Thunderbird\ </p><p>(The folder copied easily, except for one .js file.  However, I was able to copy that file too in Windows Safe mode.) </p><p>c)  With TB open, I changed the profile location of each account in that account's server settings. </p><p>d)  On that basis, when I ""get messages"" for each account, files change in the K drive location, not the C drive location, meaning that TB is utilizing the K drive location for the account.  Good. </p><p>e)  HOWEVER, when I close TB then remove the Thunderbird folder from C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\ and then reopen TB, it opens with no accounts.  This means that even though the information *FOR* each account is in K drive, and *SOME PART* of TB knows to use K drive for the account, *THAT PART* of TB - that is, *THE PART WHICH TELLS TB TO USE K DRIVE* - is itself on C drive, somewhere in C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\ </p><p>f)  Then I wanted to tell TB to look on K drive - in K:\AppData\Thunderbird\ - for the information about the accounts (and everything else TB needs to know, besides what's in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird), so I can delete the Thunderbird directory in C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\  </p><p>(That's really optional, since at least I've got TB dumping my messages into K drive, which has room for them, instead of my cramped  C drive, but I'd like to get rid of a directory that's (almost) only clutter.) </p><p>g)  At this point, after doing all the above, I finally saw Matt's 6/30/23, 6:20 PM post.  And with this page ... </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles</a> </p><p>I managed to get to Help / Troubleshooting Information / Profiles / about:profiles </p><p>(Actually, on my TB 102.12.0 64-bit, it's ""More Troubleshooting Information"" rather than ""Troubleshooting Information"".)  </p><p>h)  That page (see attached image) shows two profiles.  The first says ""This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted."" </p><p>So on the second profile, I clicked on Open Folder.  I figured I would navigate to the location of K-drive copy of the first profile.  However, when I got there, I found that I couldn't save the new location.  There's no Save button. </p><p>i)  So Then I figured I would create a new profile and make it the default, as per Matt's suggestion.  But when I opened the Create Profile Wizard, it said (again, see attached image), ""Your user settings, preferences and other user related date will be stored in:"" and then showed the C drive location. </p><p>I suppose I can still follow through on my intention in ""i"", which might immunize me to the problem Matt pointed out with David's suggestion, but it seems i still can't wipe out the Thunderbird folder on C drive. </p><p>Stymied again! </p><p>Your comments, suggestions and warnings at this point, gentlemen? </p><p>Thanks again to you both! </p><p>Keith </p>",firefox2367,false,0,0

I gave instructions to change the location of the accounts - which works perfectly - but I also made the error of stating you could then remove the original profile. My error. My instructions to copy profile to another drive and then change settings for account in thunderbird are  a quick and easy way to move profile, BUT, that still leaves the original profile pointing to accounts in the new profile. SO.... when you deleted the old profile, the pointers to the new profile died. To fully remove profile from drive C, you need to use profile manager. But even then, you still have a commitment to drive C, as that is where Thunderbird gets its information. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Some people expect it should be Undo the last letter I typed; some think Undo last word I typed, Undo the last sentence or Undo parargraph.   </p><p>However, Undo it means undo everything back to last start point. The start point may be the start of the email if you kept typing and inputting in a ongoing forward manner. But if at any point you perform an edit of a section then a new start point has been effectively created. </p><p>If you type some text and then paste some text and then undo - it will undo everything because it is a contiguous input.  This is not new, it has been the same for so long I cannot recall it being any different. </p><p>Example: If you typed some text such as <strong>what gets undone</strong> and went to a new line and typed the word <strong>test</strong> (at this point all the text on both lines is part of the same block using undo now would remove all of it - so do not do it) then used 'back space' to edit thus removing the <strong>t</strong> so you have <strong>tes</strong>, this effectly means this is a new starting point as there has been an edit, now retype in the letter <strong>t</strong> and that becomes the new start point; now use Ctrl+Z to undo, you will find only the letter <strong>t</strong> gets removed. Use Ctrl+Z again and the t is reinserted as that was the previous edit section, Use 'Ctrl+Z' again and everything is removed as that was all part of the same contiguous editing block. </p><p>Note:  if you ever type a section and then want to preserve it - add a space and use backspace to clear the space or type a double full stop/period and then use backspace to clear one of full stops. This acts like an edit meaning if you then pasted in text and needed to undo, a Ctrl+Z would only undo back to last new starting point - the edit of the space/full stop so Undo in this case would only remove the pasted section. </p><p>This is a neat trick to remember - using the backspace as an edit to reset a start point. This is particulary useful for those who like to use Undo. </p><p>That's all well and good but what happens if by accident you used Undo and the whole lot disappears. Do this: 'Edit' &gt; 'Redo' (<strong>Ctrl+Y</strong>) will get it back. Using 'Ctrl+Y' Redo is used as a reverse of Undo 'Ctrl+Z' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

I get your point about different expectations about ""Undo"".  </p><p>Actually everything would be fine for me, if the 'Redo' would work as you describe, yet in case of normal paste from MS Word it simply does not work in my case - the pasted text with the entire section back to the last edit point will disappear and cannot be restored.

So the solutions you propose unfortunately do not work in this particular case. </p><p>Only if I paste text from Word as ""paste without formatting"", the 'Redo' behaves normally - as you describe it.
