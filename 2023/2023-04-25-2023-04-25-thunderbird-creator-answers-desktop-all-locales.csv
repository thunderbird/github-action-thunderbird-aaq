I've deleted the .thunderbird directory and restarted Thunderbird, and that hasn't worked. I've also run sudo apt remove thunderbird and sudo apt purge thunderbird then reinstalled it, but that hasn't worked either. I just can't seem to get OAuth2 to pop up. I've also tried going into the advanced settings under account settings as some say the dropdown option only appears there, but still, it doesn't for me. </p><p>I'd really appreciate any help! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",cameronmpoe

Currently, I am having trouble receiving and sending messages in Thunderbird. It started with a series of events. </p><p>At first, I am having trouble receiving a form to Thunderbird from a plug-in in Wordpress. I checked the settings in the plug in and saw that the email is correct. I suspect it might have went to spam or junk mail but I do not see any settings in the Thunderbird interface that allows me to see as such. Fyi, I tested sending the form in other non-Thunderbird email addresses and it pushed thru successfully. </p><p>Now here's where things got downhill, in a desparate attempt to find the junk mail, I altered and deleted the SMTP passwords in the Saved Passwords as shown in this article [<a href=""https://www.softaken.com/blog/thunderbird-not-receiving-emails|here"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.softaken.com/blog/thunderbird-not-receiving-emails|her...</a>]. However, after closing/restarting Thunderbird, the browser did not prompt me for any password. My email is still logged on. may have tampered with other areas in the settings that I forgot. I think because of this. I am now receiving this error as shown in the attached image. Can anyone please assist me? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1577381;1577415;,skellytan1835
