Windows crashed so often and the restoration of my thunderbird was just too cludgy and time consuming. I had some time and I decided to try thunderbird again recently. The first time my windows crashed I seem to have lost all my emails going back some 20 years, despite have done a few backups according to the mozilla instructions.  </p><p>I tried to restore but the online information is very confusing. One lot info says to use profile manager, another says that you need to do it via file manager. A supposed Mozilla agent says online that he uses a different process of copying the original folder and then reinstating it after the crash. I tried that and it did not work. I suspect that there are probably several folders from a couple of locations that need to be copied for that to work. </p><p>Thunderbird has been around for a long time now and it seems that this area has been overlooked in development. I do understand that a computer expert would know what to do in his sleep, but I am not an expert even though I do know a lot about them. </p><p>I respectfully am trying to encourage the thunderbird team to improve this whole process. I do believe that it should not be too hard, either from within thunderbird or from an external application. Anything has got to be better than what exists currently. It is possible that I just cannot see the logic about the thunderbirds team on leaving it the way that it is. If this is so would someone be kind enough to enlighten me. </p><p>I envisage an application that allows selection of any profile for backup, any profile for restoration , and any profile for use. Having the ability to merge profiles and upgrade to newer profiles would be icing on the cake. </p><p>A disappointed longtime supporter, Greg Standfield </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1627460;,gstandfield
