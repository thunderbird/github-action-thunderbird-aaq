For most people, copying the entire profile works best, as that simplifies the restore process. Just copying the mbox files creates a complex set of steps to reconstruct the account that many will not be able to do unaided. Also, Thunderbird 102 implemented simple menu-driven steps for doing backups and restores, much simpler than in the past.

The only time you see lockouts is if the IMAP connection and other devices have already used all available connections to the server (logins.)  This occurs in recent times on Yahoo as they have apparently made some changes on total connections.  Thunderbird will use up to five on an IMAP server.  This can be set in Account settings&gt; server settings &gt; advanced to a lower number.  If you have an Apple product in the mix,  they will just keep trying to connect until the server refuses more connections. (A real good way to lock out competitors and frustrate folks really) </p><p>Then you see some other odd things with some providers,  like, and this is just my observation, refusal to connect if it is less than 5 minutes since you connected last (for any reason)  (That was hotmail BTW)  That applies even if you click get mail twice in quick succession the second connection will fail. </p><p>I blame antivirus as a knee jerk reaction because they are so often guilty of messing things up.  The more ""integrated"" the more they can quietly mess up.  Things like Norton's ""sonar"" preventing the new account wizard probes to detect server settings, or scanning of secure connections without fully installing the necessary certificates to decrypt and encrypt so no mail arrives.  These things have nothing to do with Thunderbird,  but that is where folk see the failures. </p><p>Go to this <a href=""https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/options/mail/accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">link </a>(I assume it works for all outlook account types) and check the server names and ports match what you have in Thunderbird. </p><p>You might also want to ""try"" changing the authentication method to oauth.

But this morning I decided to test again turning off AVG and trying to send. And it worked! So I will be contacting AVG again, on the same thread I was previously discussing this with them, and ask if there is another log that I can run directly in Windows so they can see what it is that AVG is blocking. Maybe it relates to that 127.0.0.1 local host issue. I did find a few others online asking about that over the years. Thanks for the help in any case.

This also indicates you have issues with Third party software.  Probably the same Antivirus/firewall that causes issues with account setup.  It does not recognize the current version of the software so locks it out.  Old versions are in it's ""known good"" list.  Unfortunately Thunderbird can do nothing to force these products to not interfere,  or to not block Thunderbird access to the web. </p><p>Generally you will see folk suggesting restarting the operating system in safe mode with networking.  This is a backhanded method of getting these products off the system so the setup can actually complete without being crash tackled mid setup. </p><p>Fundamentally two factor authentication can not work with a mail client.  That is why oauth is now used.  Thunderbird does not stop and wait for a text message and the code to be input.  It asks for a password and uses it.  Personally I suggest folk either use an application password or oAuth,  two factor authentication really only works with a web page, not an application which initiates new connections every few minutes.  When setting up,  disable two factor authentication. </p><p>Generally folk blame the messenger.  Thunderbird does not work,  hence it has a problem. I have been around Thunderbird support for around 10 years and the number of real Thunderbird bugs in account setup can probably be counted on two hands really in that time.  Buggy anti virus products.  Dud firewalls,  folk using VPN's and IP V6 issues.  They all out number genuine Thunderbird issues like 100 to 1.   I have no idea how to fix that,  or any of the many other problems caused by security software.  Other than to recommend to folk to use only that which comes with their operating system.  My life using Thunderbird has been pain free using only Microsoft Defender. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,2

Good thoughts but it does not answer my question:    Has something changed around version 102 in the way new accounts are added?  Like the new account setup wizard?  If the answer is 100% absoutely NO change in that area from say 91.13.1 to 102.6.1 then I would agree it MUST be something else.  I know that 91.13.1 works OK for me, 102.6.1 does not.  I don't know why firewalls, anitvirus, IP v6, would change behavior between the 2 versions. Generally, from my experience when things stop working I go back and look at what changed last and COULD it be related somehow.  This issue appears to happen even on two different devices.  Yeah, this is the first time I've ever had an ANY issue with Thunderbird.
