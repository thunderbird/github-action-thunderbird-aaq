My simple piece of feedback, purely for your information, is that connecting to the Thunderbird and collecting messages has now become very slow. In the past the process was almost instant, not so now. I am sure that you are aware of this but if not I hope this is useful to you. Keep up the great work. Thank you.

In the Properties for my Calendar, when I try to associate the Calendar with an email account, I see two, sometimes in the past three, identical email addresses listed, and that's the email address that I need to associate with the Calendar.  Sometimes, I just keep trying one after the other until my Calendar becomes writable and I can save the emailed invitation.  However, most of the time, no matter what email address (in the Properties list) that I choose, I still get the error that my Calendar is not writable. </p><p>I use Thunderbird with Exquilla for Microsoft Exchange.  That works fine.  Earlier, I had tried Thunderbird with Owl for Microsoft Exchange, which also seemed to work but my office suggested continuing with Exquilla. </p><p>Thank you for any assistance with this showstopper problem.

I had copied the respective sub address books to .csv  files. How can I import the selected .csv files to a sub folder under my Personal Address Book?

However I am no longer using Windows, but a Mac. Does that mean they are redundant and I could delete them?  </p><p>Background: I am moving my Thunderbird profile from the iMac to my Macbook when traveling. And afterwards I am moving it back. I seem to have lost mails from earlier years but just found them on the Macbook. For some reason the synchronization did not transfer all the subfolders. The strange thing is that the iMac (which did not show the older mail folders) has lots of .mozmsgs folders, while the Macbook (which showed the older mails) does not. I am using only POP never IMAP.  </p><p>2) I organize my mail folders in yearly folders. After some years, when I am less likely to looking things up, I move the year folders into an archive folder. I do this inside of Thunderbird. Now I just noticed that I have empty .sbd and .mozmsgs folders in the original location (zero bites). Again I am wondering if these folders are redundant and could be deleted?  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1573058;,faithdance59

I take emails from one machine to another by putting the emails in a folder, then attaching the two related files to an email to myself. When I get the attachments on the next machine, I save the files to a  hard drive folder containing my email folders. I exit Thunderbird and restart it and there's the folder with the transferred emails. I've recently added a 64 bit machine to the mix. I have a problem in that the 64 bit machine will not see the transfer folder when emailed from a 32 bit machine. If I copy the files to a flash drive from the 32 bit machine and then onto the 64 bit machine, then it sees the folders. Any ideas how I can fix this? It's a pain to be using flash drives back and forth. Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1572806;,rar9757

Freezing and locking up PC for almost 3 years.,"<p>I have had the same issues with TB freezing and locking up my PC that many here have had. For me, this has now gone on for almost 3 years. I have done everything I can think of, and everything I have read about online to deal with the constant freezing.  I have: --upgraded countless times (now on Ver 102.9.0, 64 bit, Win 10, 32GB RAM, 3TB hard drive) --reinstalled Thunderbird many times --deleted various profiles and created new ones, deleted various config files as suggested.  --reinstalled Windows 10, upgraded all associated files, drivers, etc.  --started Windows in Safe Mode --disabled all add-ons and extensions in TB --reset all toolbars and controls in TB --started Thunderbird in Troubleshoot Mode --gave an exception to TB in my Windows Defender [and turned off Defender entirely] --ran MANY virus scans --disabled ALL virus software </p><p>Thunderbird is the ONLY piece of software on this PC that locks it up. It exhibits the same behavior that many here are seeing: freezes when I try to click on something; freezes when I try to reply to an email; freezes for no apparent reason. I can't MAKE it freeze up... it just seems to do it at random, constantly. Right now, it's open on another screen and has been frozen for about 3 minutes, and just unfroze. Most of the time, it freezes so that I cannot shut TB down. It is completely unresponsive. Sometimes it will freeze the computer so that I cannot do ANYTHING... I cannot open Task Manager and force a shutdown. Eventually, it releases and works again, only to freeze up a few minutes later.  </p><p>I'm pretty much out of ideas, but I continue to browse online, looking for answers. As I said, three years of this is enough, and I see complaints about this going back even further. I love Thunderbird. I'm a longtime user and have not found any email client that comes close to the way TB works for me, so I'm VERY reluctant to leave. But I'm really tired of being a beta tester. And yes, I have donated many times over the years, and I'm happy to do so. I'm not concerned with the money. I just want it to work like it used to. If you have any fresh ideas, I'm very open to hearing them. But a warning, that I have likely already tried the fixes offered. I appreciate any input, in any event. </p><p>So, unless a miracle comes along, I reckon I'll have to cut bait and find a replacement for Thunderbird. Thanks for allowing me to blow off some long-held frustration.  </p><p>best, </p><p>--john </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1572816;1583715;1583716;1583839;1592391;1592410;1592417;1592459;1592469;1592539;1592570;1592640;1592641;1592682;1592710;1592712;1592968;1592969;1593112;1593462;1593546;1594264;1594284;1594388;,johnegenes
