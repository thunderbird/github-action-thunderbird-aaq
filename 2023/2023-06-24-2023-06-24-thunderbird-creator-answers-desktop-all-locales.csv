1416665,2023-06-23 19:38:57 -0700,2023-06-23 19:38:57 -0700,Select Messages Feature,"<p>Across the top where it can show ""From,"" ""Account,"" ""Date,"" ""Subject,"" etc., I have ""Select Messages.""  When I put a check in the box of a few messages and then click ""Delete,"" the system marks the topmost message that I had not selected with a checkmark after the selected e-mails delete.  If I don't notice it, I could start selecting messages to delete again and accidentally delete something I want to keep.  I have to remember to always uncheck the box.  This happens on my desktop; I don't think it happens on mobile, but I cannot remember for sure and have nothing to delete right now to test it.  Is there a way to make it not put a check box in the Select Messages box of the uppermost e-mail after deleting a number of messages?  I feel this is a bug that needs to be fixed.  Please help if there is something I can toggle on my end.  Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",cookiemonster217

1416683,2023-06-24 02:26:16 -0700,2023-06-25 12:45:42 -0700,Can I recover auto-saved Draft emails lost in a TBird crash,"<p>I think my issue relates to the difference between ""Save this message to Drafts folder"" that happens when you close the Write window and are asked whether to save the draft or discard it, versus the drafts that are just saved via the ""Auto Save"" feature. (My autosave is set at every 5 minutes, in the Settings &gt; Composition).  I am hoping to recover a draft that I know was auto-saving, but in some apparently only in a temporary way that doesn't fully post to the Drafts folder.  </p><p>I had 4-5 email windows open in TBird, under composition.  They lingered as draft emails for several days, as I worked through a bookkeeping job and compiled lists of questions to email out.  In particular, one ""Draft"" is actually a long to-do file of notes, which I continuously update.  I regret not closing it more frequently in order to Save its latest version to the Drafts folder.  Instead, I got behind in my work and just left that ""write window"" open for weeks.  TBird abruptly closed/crashed last night, and those draft-emails I had open are gone, and not in the Drafts folder.  They are not Sent of Deleted/Trash either.  So its like they never existed since I didn't specifically say ""Save a Draft,"" but I believe they still auto-saved.   </p><p>Only my to-do list with is a longstanding ""Draft email""  is still existing, but it's the version from a couple weeks ago, which I guess is the last time I actually closed its ""write"" window!  (yes, I probably should restart TBird and my laptop more often).  I would like to recover the latest version of that draft, and ideally the handful of other emails I had open. </p><p>So would those auto-saved drafts exist in some mozilla hidden-folders or something??  It seems to me that the auto-saved drafts interact with the email server (1and1, via IMAP) somehow, because if my internet is out, any draft-email that I have sitting open keeps bugging me that it can't auto-save.  So it must autosave on a server, not just locally in a TBird file, right?   </p><p>I contacted 1and1 and they restored things deleted over the last few days, but that didn't help at all, probably because I hadn't actually deleted the drafts.  It's like they didn't get formally deleted because they were never formally saved as drafts, yet they existed &nbsp;:) </p><p>So where to look?   Thank you all!! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1587232;1587233;1587238;,heymali
