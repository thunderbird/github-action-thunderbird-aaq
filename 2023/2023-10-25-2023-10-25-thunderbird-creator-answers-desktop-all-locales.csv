Utilizzo il programma Thunderbird sia per la posta ordinaria che per la PEC.

Come devo fare per far visualizzare nella barra di sinistra anche l'account PEC, come per la posta ordinaria? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,"",brunosquillaci

The error message I get is </p><pre> From Microsoft: ""We can't sign you in Your browser is currently set to block cookies. You need to allow cookies to use this service.""    (NB my Firefox browser cookies is set to 'standard' and the settings had not been changed.  Plus I've tried playing with the settings, makes no difference)   From Thunderbird: ""Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> timed out. Try again."" </pre> <p>When?          Started on 6 or 7 Oct,  At this point, both receive and send failed. Last message was just before a Thunderbird update.  We were in France, using hotel internet, which Microsoft hates.  (so I didn't try to fix it until we got home).       </p><p>Other info:        However my hotmail address still worked well on my laptop's Outlook; internet login, Thunderbird on another  laptop (Win 11, and more recent installation of Tb) and on my phone (Android, FairEmail), ie has not been blocked.   My usual laptop is Win 10.  All other emails within my Thunderbird are working fine.   The outgoing SMTP for hotmail is: smtp://<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> (smtp://<a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>)   See image attached.   </p><p>What since:      A forced update of Windows (as rec'd by local techy) restored the receive function and speed, which had become sluggish.   Hotmail still can't send.  I've logged in and out of my microsoft account online, and have changed my MS password (and therefore that of my hotmail account), plus restarted everything lots of times.  No difference. I have not got office365 except what came free with windows.   I avoid office/MS apps where possible.   </p><p>PLUS:  Discovered that my Tb profile is humungous, 45gb, of which a fair chunk is this last couple of weeks.  Most of it is not visible emails.  Any advice&nbsp;? - can I start a new profile and ditch the old?  </p><pre>                   Help please...................... </pre> <p>Thanks Eunice Lord </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",eunice.lord

I didn't particularly like the appearance of the new version so I decided to downgrade back to V102. I downloaded the V102 installer, deleted compatability.ini and ran the installer. The install seems to have worked and I am back to V102.15.1 but my add-ons still think I have V115 installed so are marked as incompatible. If I look at the update history in settings the latest entry is the upgrade from V102 to V115, ie the downgrade is not showing. How do I convince my add-ons that I am back to V102 and that they are compatible? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",mjp21ff
