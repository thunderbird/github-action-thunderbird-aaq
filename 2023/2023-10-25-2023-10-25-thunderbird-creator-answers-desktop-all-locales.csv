When the update was complete it appears to have split my profile into two and created two of Inbox, Drafts, Sent, and Trash.  I use Earthlink which is the name of the POP3 account.  Now there are Inbox, Drafts, Sent, and Trash for ""Earthlink"", and a set for ""Local Folders"".  Junk and Archives are only associated with ""Local Folders"", and ""Outbox"" shows up under a ""Local Folders"" header along with all of the folders I used to organize received messages.  When new messages are downloaded they appear in ""Inbox / Local Folders"".  Nothing appears in any of the ""Earthlink / ..."" folders. </p><p>I don't recall exactly what it looked like before but there was only one set of the primary folders, and the local folders I created to organize my inbox.  I have attached screenshots of the the folder navigation pane, as well as the odd organization of the ""Account Settings"" tab.  I am admittedly not an expert.  Any help is appreciated. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",pete48
