My personal Gmail is fine and works as usual, but my Google workspace email account for work is having weird issues.  It's almost like it's authentication issues from what I can tell.

The account settings seem to change when I restart the app, but I can't always reproduce.  It's so strange.  I've deleted the account and added it again multiple times, and still can't figure it out.  When I try and send, sometimes it's stopping on copying to sent folder .

Since the <strong>update to 115.3.3. </strong>(<strong>macOS</strong>), Thunderbird adds an <strong>unnaturally large line spacing</strong> (about 1.5 or 2.0) to <strong>emails that are composed in HTML</strong> mode, as well as to HTML signatures, which makes the messages very ""long"" and doesn't look nice. When the mails are created in plain text mode (i.e. without HTML), the line spacing is still regular at 1.0. </p><p>The problem has occurred in the same way on about 15 different Mac computers since the update. The setting under Settings&gt;Compose is unchanged ""Arial"" with size ""small"". The option to use paragraph format instead of normal text was and is not activated, that's not the reason - especially since it's about the line spacing and not the spacing after a paragraph. </p><p>Therefore, I suspect that in<strong> (some) style files</strong> (CSS?) that contain the <strong>template for composing emails, the developers accidentally inserted a (too large) line spacing in the Mac version</strong>, which cannot be changed in the normal settings of Thunderbird, since there is no line spacing option there. With this in mind, I'd be very grateful for any advice on how we can fix this. The problem is probably not only with us, but probably with all Mac users who compose mails in HTML mode. </p><p>Attached are<strong> two photos</strong>, the first (with red bars) is how it used to be when sending mails with Thunderbird, and the other photo shows the state since the update. Please ignore the German language, but the content of the mails is not important&nbsp;:) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1613983;,8nzfhb6gdf
