After inadvertently replacing 102 with 115 on Windows, we will absolutely not downgrade to 115 for the foreseeable future.  But in 102, the only update settings I can find are either to automatically update, or automatically check for updates and nag us.  The nagging has been an issue for months now, since previous versions of 10x have broken the ability to read POP mail, to send mail, etc, so we have had to back-install previous versions.  But always that whining, nagging update notice. </p><p>Is there any way to stop that? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",greggbrickner

When the update was complete it appears to have split my profile into two and created two of Inbox, Drafts, Sent, and Trash.  I use Earthlink which is the name of the POP3 account.  Now there are Inbox, Drafts, Sent, and Trash for ""Earthlink"", and a set for ""Local Folders"".  Junk and Archives are only associated with ""Local Folders"", and ""Outbox"" shows up under a ""Local Folders"" header along with all of the folders I used to organize received messages.  When new messages are downloaded they appear in ""Inbox / Local Folders"".  Nothing appears in any of the ""Earthlink / ..."" folders. </p><p>I don't recall exactly what it looked like before but there was only one set of the primary folders, and the local folders I created to organize my inbox.  I have attached screenshots of the the folder navigation pane, as well as the odd organization of the ""Account Settings"" tab.  I am admittedly not an expert.  Any help is appreciated. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",pete48
