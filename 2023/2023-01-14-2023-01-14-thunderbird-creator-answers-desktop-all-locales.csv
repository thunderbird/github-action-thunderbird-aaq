When I moved to macOS Monterey, the Reminders app turned out to be one which could only sync with the events on the Mac using Apple's iCloud service. I want to keep my event data local to my machine, so I do not want to use iCloud.  </p><p>Is there a way to sync macOS Reminders with Thunderbird Tasks?  Ideally this would result in Thunderbird being a front end to the macOS store of events. Apple has an EventKit framework which apparently manipulates this store. However, I would settle for a one-way import of the macOS events into Thunderbird, storing them in Thunderbird's event store from then on.  </p><p>If this ability is not built into Thunderbird, maybe there is a plug-in which can be a bridge to macOS Reminders? </p>",other;macos;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",JDLH

Tbird worked before like charm. Then it was a new installation 2 years ago. I moved mail data from Vista Mail on a Toshiba PC to my then new GP PC, with W10. Now, I have to re-install all the apps, and try to import/collect data. Luckily, my Vista PC is still working, so I can recover things from there. So, in Vista Mail i exported contacts, tried .csv, and .vcf. Csv seemed to work, however the import in Address Book was not functional. The names and e-mail addresses were mixed up. Then, I tried .vcf: with a single contact it works fine, but not with a list of .vcf files. Then, I found the advice to create one .vcf file for all contacts via copy *.vcx merged.vcf. The file got created, and looks fine. The windows contact too can open it, one-by-one. Windows10 Mail can handle it also. But, when I try to import this in TB I got as far as START import. Then, the message ""Import failed unexpectedly, more information may be available in the Error Console"". I do not see error console, and more hints. I must tell, extracting contacts from GMAIL works too. But, unfortunately I do not have set up gmail so that it saved all contacts upon referencing, so I just have a subset of contacts there... Do you guys have a working solution, or is this a new chart again&nbsp;? By the way, the TB version is the newest one, a guess it is 102.
