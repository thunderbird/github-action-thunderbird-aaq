Don't filter on address is!  it sounds like is is exact and just what you want,  but it rarely is. </p><p>Email from this forum comes from the address no-reply@support.mozilla.org but the from header of the emails actually contains From: Mozilla Support Forum &lt;no-reply@support.mozilla.org&gt;  So from is no-reply@support.mozilla.org is not a match,  because there is more there than the filter contains.  Likewise,  I get mail from various groups that use the same sending address for the entire list,  but substitute individual people names before the email address (display name) so the mail ""looks"" like it comes from that individual instead of the list. </p><p>Using contains as the criteria neatly side steps this and works to deliver what you want.  It also means that is the sender uses say <a href=""http://ebay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.com</a>, <a href=""http://ebay.us"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.us</a>, <a href=""http://ebay.za"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.za</a> in their mails you can drop the last bit of the address and it will still be included by the filter. </p><p>Next is the fact that if you move an email,  it is no longer there for the filter to act on.  So if the same email is ""valid"" for two filters and the first moves it,  the second will not even see it. </p> <blockquote> I have been marking as Junk on some messages for years now. When does TB ever send those directly to the Junk file? </blockquote> <p>Lets again back up to the fundamentals.   Thunderbird ignores the from address in determining if an email is ""spammy"" and in marking mail as junk.  Always has and probably always will. Something that is probably missing from the relevant article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#</a>  A much older,  but also more detailed discussion on the junk filtering can be found here <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls</a> Thunderbird will not mark a message for someone in your selected address books in account settings as Junk/SPAM.  This can be an issue if the address book is selected in account settings and you are using it in your spam filters.  One thing fights the other. </p><p>Blocking an individual is beyond the scope of junk filtering. It is not looking at the content of the email to determine if it might be spam, just at who sent it.  So this part is best done using filters.  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender#</a> </p><p>Just be aware that it is probably better to not hand out your email address than it is to do a lot of filtering to block the unwelcome mail signing up for things generates. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

(Example: From/is/<a href=""http://foscodevelopment.org"" rel=""nofollow"">foscodevelopment.org</a>. Have you ever heard of fosco development? Well, I haven't, but I get email from them. And those emails should go direct to JUNK ON LOCAL FOLDERS. The problem may be my using ""From"", ""is"", ""email address"" and ""Move Message to"" ""Junk on Local Folders"". I had been moving to the junk folder for each address and that seemed to be extra work, so I though moving them all to that one file under Local would work best. What kind of confuses me is that I have successfully had specific emails from a specific source  go to a separate inbox rather than the normal inbox. (Example: I get email from ""MRH"" and I filter that so that those messages bypass the inbox and go direct to a folder marked ""MRH"". And that works for the email address. ""news@mrhmag.com"".

Silent failures in this sort of action are not really all that uncommon.

Generally it is slow and there is no feedback as to when the process is completed.  It might be many minutes after you see things zip around on screen for the actual process to complete.  It should not be attempted while offline at all as the entire process requires multiple round trips to both servers.  It is certainly not a function I would encourage doing with a filter, as the filter will just kick off the process and not wait for any confirmation of the completion of the IMAP sync. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Man mano che i miei corrispondenti iniziavano ad usare il nuovo indirizzo creavo un filtro locale che spostava il messaggio nella stessa cartella (appartenete all'indirizzo precedente POP) per cui in queste sottocartelle venivano convogliati messaggi ricevuti con il vecchio indirizzo POP e con il nuovo IMAP. Ho verificato che i messaggi scomparsi sono quelli provenienti da account IMAP, confidavo nel fatto che essendo una cartella di un account POP non ci fossero contrindicazioni ma evidentemente non è così.

They have used a contracted service with yahoo for probably the last 10 years and it has at best been a dogs breakfast.  Special passwords and odd setting to get yahoo to work with the ATT email. </p><p>There are many mail providers out there.  Google is not the only one.  Personally I have a weakness for GMX,  because the parent company is based in Germany and must use German privacy laws,  they don't retain much information about you at all.  Where as the US folk do their utmost to retain everything about you they can. but that list is far from complete.  Try googling free email providers on google,  they list close to 30. </p><p>Now we get to the real issue.  I assume your mail is currently downloaded as POP,  as IMAP mail will not survive the closure of the mail account on the server. </p><p>You worry about ""Merging"" stuff.   </p><p>I can not speak for Eudora,  but unless you have already imported that mail to Thunderbird it is about lost.  Eudora is not able to run on some of the more recent operating systems so I would suggest you import that mail before you actually loose it.  Eudora stores mail in a proprietary format so with no Eudora reading it becomes a real problem. </p><p>Next you talk about adding a gmail account to your existing profile like as if data is all going to be merged together.  That can be the case if you choose to use POP and a global inbox,  but simply selecting not to use a global inbox for the account will have the account added to the folder pane as it's own entry and having it's own inbox and associated folders.  Personally I use the global inbox, and Thunderbird reports it as being almost 7 and a half GB in size.  That is not the profile,  just the inbox.  The profile is over 50.  I have some 25 accounts,  mostly mail accounts registered in Thunderbird and I am starting to see cracks,  but data loss is a long way off I think.  I do however make a manual backup of the profile every couple of months, so loosing historical stuff is not really an issue and the google and outlook account retain copies of all mail in the past couple of years anyway. </p><p>Yes you can add the account to Thunderbird. Yes you can ""merge"" it is you want. I would suggest against it really.   </p><p>What you need to be sure of is your use of POP mail as that makes immutable local copies.  IMAP does not, even though it's downloading of whole folder structures and their contents is very handy,  it is only as good as the server it connects to. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

We used Eudora <strong>exactly</strong> as we now use Thunderbird! All of our messages saved in Eudora were imported to Thunderbird about 12 years ago after Qualcomm stopped supporting Eudora. Our ISP for 15 years has been Windstream and we both had Windstream addresses. I didn't realize that AT&amp;T no longer offered email except through Yahoo. </p><p>Now to the good part:  You may have solved my problem! I, too, have been concerned about Gmail and privacy. Thank you for mentioning GMX. I have a friend who uses that. If we can set up GMX addresses for both my husband and me and then get those to work in Thunderbird, the problem is solved. My older Gmail account can still be totally separate. </p><p>If the GMX addresses are brand new, then there will be no merging problem. Thank you.
