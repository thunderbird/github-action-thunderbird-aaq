Silent failures in this sort of action are not really all that uncommon.  Having stuff move back from whence it came is perhaps one of the signs that silent sync failures are occurring. </p><p>It does sort of work, most of the time.  Generally it is slow and there is no feedback as to when the process is completed.  It might be many minutes after you see things zip around on screen for the actual process to complete.  It should not be attempted while offline at all as the entire process requires multiple round trips to both servers.  It is certainly not a function I would encourage doing with a filter, as the filter will just kick off the process and not wait for any confirmation of the completion of the IMAP sync. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Don't filter on address is!  it sounds like is is exact and just what you want,  but it rarely is. </p><p>Email from this forum comes from the address no-reply@support.mozilla.org but the from header of the emails actually contains From: Mozilla Support Forum &lt;no-reply@support.mozilla.org&gt;  So from is no-reply@support.mozilla.org is not a match,  because there is more there than the filter contains.  Likewise,  I get mail from various groups that use the same sending address for the entire list,  but substitute individual people names before the email address (display name) so the mail ""looks"" like it comes from that individual instead of the list. </p><p>Using contains as the criteria neatly side steps this and works to deliver what you want.  It also means that is the sender uses say <a href=""http://ebay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.com</a>, <a href=""http://ebay.us"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.us</a>, <a href=""http://ebay.za"" rel=""nofollow"">ebay.za</a> in their mails you can drop the last bit of the address and it will still be included by the filter. </p><p>Next is the fact that if you move an email,  it is no longer there for the filter to act on.  So if the same email is ""valid"" for two filters and the first moves it,  the second will not even see it. </p> <blockquote> I have been marking as Junk on some messages for years now. When does TB ever send those directly to the Junk file? </blockquote> <p>Lets again back up to the fundamentals.   Thunderbird ignores the from address in determining if an email is ""spammy"" and in marking mail as junk.  Always has and probably always will. Something that is probably missing from the relevant article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages#</a>  A much older,  but also more detailed discussion on the junk filtering can be found here <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls</a> Thunderbird will not mark a message for someone in your selected address books in account settings as Junk/SPAM.  This can be an issue if the address book is selected in account settings and you are using it in your spam filters.  One thing fights the other. </p><p>Blocking an individual is beyond the scope of junk filtering. It is not looking at the content of the email to determine if it might be spam, just at who sent it.  So this part is best done using filters.  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/blocking-sender#</a> </p><p>Just be aware that it is probably better to not hand out your email address than it is to do a lot of filtering to block the unwelcome mail signing up for things generates. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

And that draft folder could be caused by invalid email address and created on Thunderbird. So you have to check to insure that email address is correct. The email service is provided by yahoo email not Thunderbird. Thunderbird connects to the email provider it by itself can't do the email or retrieval without connecting to a email service provider like yahoo or such. So if Yahoo email changes it's POP3/IMAP settings that would have to get that from yahoo email support to correctly connect to the email provider. </p>,Dropa,false,0,1
