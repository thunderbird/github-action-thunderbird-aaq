In fact, I typed the word ""Subject"" above by mistake. I just rechecked all my filters and they all read the same. Except for filters that do have Subject. Or any other configuration. In other words. I double checked and wrote down exactly what each filter shows. Identical except for From/Subject - email address/subject. </p>",PennsyNut,false,0,0

Fancy meeting <em>you</em> here. </p><p>Looks to me as though the only thing you might be doing wrong is putting the email address in the Subject category instead of the From category. The filter won't see the Subject as containing the email address you're trying to send to Junk under Local Folders. Try it again with From and see whether it works the next time you get a message from that email address. Good luck! </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

And that draft folder could be caused by invalid email address and created on Thunderbird. So you have to check to insure that email address is correct. The email service is provided by yahoo email not Thunderbird. Thunderbird connects to the email provider it by itself can't do the email or retrieval without connecting to a email service provider like yahoo or such. So if Yahoo email changes it's POP3/IMAP settings that would have to get that from yahoo email support to correctly connect to the email provider. </p>,Dropa,false,0,1
