The third, however, 'loses' its Sent emails somewhere between two 'Sent' folders in an additional ""Local Folder"" (which I neither asked for nor want) or disappears completely, leaving me with no record of the sent email! I have checked the box to ""copy email to address&gt;sent"" (as I have done for all 3 accounts). I would really prefer to get rid of the 'Local Folder' group as I have no use for it, but how at least do I get TB to do the same basic housekeeping for all 3 accounts?

As soon as I open a message, all of the orange or yellow stars that indicate new messages disappear. To me, that is illogical and unnecessary. Is there a setting in thunderbird that would change this behavior and keep the stars beside the new messages? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1572058;1572080;1572642;,rbhall52

I exported my private openPGP keys from Thunderbird on linux and imported them into the program on windows. When I use the windows program to send encrypted emails between accounts (e.g. from my gmail account to my hotmail account) the message can be decrypted but it says it has an invalid digital signature. This does not happen when I do this under linux. Any idea how I can fix this? Many thanks! </p>,privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",richardjpitman

I hadn't checked it since beginning of 2022.   Now it's in random order.    I do allow updates to download and run automatically since I've never had any issues with a Mozilla product.
