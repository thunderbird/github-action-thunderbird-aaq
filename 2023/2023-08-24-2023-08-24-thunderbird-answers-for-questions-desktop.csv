Can you post a picture? </blockquote> <p>So, if your message list is set to card view, this button disappears, but if it's set to table view, like  how it used to be before, There is a button, that says: ""Toggle message threads  button"" when  my screen reader focuses onto it. To focus onto it, first, press tab until your focus is in the folder list. then press tab one more time. Instead of focusing on the message list, your focus is on this button. If you still can't see it, i'll  send in a picture </p>",hadi.gsf,false,0,0
