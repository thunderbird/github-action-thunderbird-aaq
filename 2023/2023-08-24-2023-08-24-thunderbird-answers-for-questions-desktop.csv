That made the problem go away, but I consider that a work-around, not a solution. </p><p>I would still call this issue a bug, for these reasons: 1.  The System theme has worked for many years, and it quit working with Thunderbird 115. 2.  The description of the System theme is ""Follow the operating system setting for buttons, menus, and windows"".  Windows does not use black text on a dark blue background for menus, but Thunderbird is doing that, so it's not following the operating system settings. 3.  Windows does not change the text color on a menu item when the mouse pointer moves over it, which is also what Thunderbird is doing. </p><p>Considering that I think this is a bug that should be addressed, but it's not the issue that I started this post with, what should I do with this now?  Should I start a new issue that is just this menu color problem? </p>",drkaden,false,0,0

This means that among other things that system integration will be improved as the underlying components move from the proprietary and deprecated Mozilla XUL.  So while you think that you have a bug because your choice of operating system color schemes does not work well with Thunderbird.  It is not a bug.  That is a consequence of your choice of color scheme.  You may have a point that Thunderbird's behaviour is divergent from the operating system.  I really don't know.

So my old DELL laptop operating on Windows 10 and using quite an old version of TB blew up but I did manage to recover TB file memory. See attached. Using a Reader, with this info, I tried to move my TB account to my new HP laptop operating on Windows 11 but I could not. After so much time trying and not being very good with computers I thought it would be a good idea to pay Geek Squad to try and recover my TB files for me and set up on my new laptop. They downloaded a new version of TB and set up an account using my same email address but could not communicate with AOL. “ Authentication failure while connecting to sever <a href=""http://imap.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.aol.com</a>” I have now learned that will not locate my TB files anyway because its on a different version.  I have since changed my password with AOL.  Not sure how I would change password on TB and probably should not do so on the new version but I am at a loss.  Any advice on what to do at this stage would be really appreciated. It's been really frustrating. I love using TB. Thank you!!  Martyn </p>",mjconquest,false,0,0
