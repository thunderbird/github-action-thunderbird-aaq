As much as I appreciate what you are saying it seems to me that if I am having the same problem with both add-ons then it is a Thunderbird 'glitch' not anything to do with one of the add-ons so the authors aren't going to be interested in solving a problem which is nothing to do with their particular development. I have uninstalled 'Old Icons,' and restarted Thunderbird and as I said in my initial post the Phoenity icons flash up and then disappear almost instantly so no resolution there. It sounds as if I am a voice in the wilderness here and am not going to get any help or support so I suggest I'll just put up with the problem or try to solve it myself. Great outcome from Mozilla Support. </p>",njtinker,false,0,0

Addons are not created by Thunderbird. They are a piece of code written by a person - an author - and they are solely responsible for their addon. If you experience a problem with an addon then you need to communicate with the author. It may be useful information for the author. At the link above, on the right hand side of window, there is a 'Support Email' link you can use to email the person responsible for the add-on.  </p><p>However, before you go down that route, you mentioned you had previously used other addons for buttons/folders etc. The area of code being manipulated is the same when using addons that perform same type of functionality. So, it is possible there is some conflict in the code - basically one addon is messing up another addon. </p><p>Did you fully uninstall the Phoenity Icons and Buttons addons and restart Thunderbird to ensure they had been removed? If no then I would do this first. </p><p>The alternative would be remove addons and use the 'userChrome.css' method to insert and use old folder pane folder icons. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
