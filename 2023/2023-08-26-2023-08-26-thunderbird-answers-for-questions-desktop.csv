Addons are not created by Thunderbird. They are a piece of code written by a person - an author - and they are solely responsible for their addon. If you experience a problem with an addon then you need to communicate with the author. It may be useful information for the author. At the link above, on the right hand side of window, there is a 'Support Email' link you can use to email the person responsible for the add-on.  </p><p>However, before you go down that route, you mentioned you had previously used other addons for buttons/folders etc. The area of code being manipulated is the same when using addons that perform same type of functionality. So, it is possible there is some conflict in the code - basically one addon is messing up another addon. </p><p>Did you fully uninstall the Phoenity Icons and Buttons addons and restart Thunderbird to ensure they had been removed? If no then I would do this first. </p><p>The alternative would be remove addons and use the 'userChrome.css' method to insert and use old folder pane folder icons. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

How do they become aware of an issue that requires fixing either in their addon, or Thunderbird if no one reports it it?  Addon authors have access to a whole API to modify Thunderbird, they also have access to a dedicated <a href=""https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/addons"" rel=""nofollow"">addons developer mailing list</a> where they discuss issues and seek resolution.    You assume that these two individuals will simply dismiss your issue out of hand.  Why you make that assumption escapes me. </p><p>Personally I am somewhat suspicious of the versions each suggests it supports as V102 and 115 are significantly different under the hood in relation to the toolbar.  With one of the ""new features"" of V115 being a new unified toolbar.  Perhaps the authors can support both versions in a single addon XPI.  I do not know. It would not be the first time I saw an addon marked as compatible with a version in which it did not work.  Perhaps in creating their 115 versions they have lost something that allowed it to work in V102 </p><p>You notice I am guessing,  because I am neither an addon author or a user of those addons, that is the best I can do.  The authors however know how it works and what to suggest to fix issues.  It might be as simple as a problem with oyur video card that can be fixed by changing the hardware acceleration setting.  But I really have no specific idea,  neither does anyone else in this forum. </p> <blockquote> It sounds as if I am a voice in the wilderness here and am not going to get any help or support so I suggest I'll just put up with the problem or try to solve it myself.

Please note bugzilla is not a chat forum, so comments need to be factual eg: exact step by step on how to reproduce a problem, image of problem, data shown in the error console, etc.  Bugs have to be reproduceable in order to sort out what is going wrong.  Bugs also get prioritised, so most important tend to get done first and in some cases bugs are getting fixed by volunteers, so you have to cut them some slack, they may choose bugs based on their field of expertise or time available. </p><p>You tend to discover more iritating bugs when a major new design is developed and the supernova 115 has seen a massive rewrite of code. It is inevitable there will be gremlins in the early stages and as more parts of the design get rewritten. However, that's why anyone using 102* is not being auto updated at this point in time. Although anyone can choose to download and install 115*, but I would advise creating a backup of profile first just in case of problems or prefer to go back to 102*. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

There was nothing rude about what I said.  Claiming to switch to a superior product that doesn't have the problems I was complaining about is not rude.  What is rude is silencing a user's complaint for some BS reason that isn't even defined in the TOS or forum rules, and then making the same suggestion themselves and getting away with it because you have moderator priveledges.  I don't think there should be anything wrong with suggesting to use anything not made by mozilla, but the fact that moderators are allowed to suggest to users to use more superior software and users cant, clearly shows a double standard. </p><p>If you can't see that then that is your problem. </p>",gsrgtrdg4565653,false,0,0

If there is absolutely no connectivity with server then it's possible your Firewall is blocking access to the internet. Thunderbird must be set up as an allowed program in the Firewall.
