Because it is not really obvious how one would use that ZIP file.  With most ZIP files, the first thing that needs to be done is to unzip it, .... and then what?   Just the fact that a ZIP file is mentioned makes it sound like this will be a complicated process, which it is not. I figured it out.  But it would certainly help to explain this on that same Export screen, clarifying how that ZIP file should be used later on. </p>",Emilio2000,false,0,0

I spent way too much time trying to move individual mailing lists manually - which was unsuccessful.  </p><p>There are just 2 related issues here:  </p><p>1.  <strong>Calling it a Profile.</strong>   Most other places, a ""profile"" is just a few swhort pieces of information about the person, motsly the contact infor about that person adn perhaps some preferences.  So,calling it  ""moving a profile"" in Thunderbird is a bit misleading.  I saw that option, but in my mind I erroneously interpreted that as follows: ""I don't want to move my profile, I want to move my mailing lists.""    So, instead of call it a ""profile"", how about swaying: ""Back up and move everything in Thunderbird.""  </p><p>2.  <strong>Moving mailing lists. </strong> For the past many years, ever since Outlook Express has been discontinued, I have tried several other email programs and was disappointed every time, finding that there is no way to back up or move mailing lists.  So, I just assumed that preserving mailing lists was too complicated and that's why nobody is able to make that work.   All the email software can back up and preserve the basic address book, but not the mailing lists.  So, for me, it was quite a revelation that Thunderbird CAN preserve mailing lists.  And now that Outlook Express is gone, Thunderbird is the only email software I know that can preserve mailing lists.  That's why I think it's important to spell that out in the Export instructions.  Because, otherwise, the general assumption is that NOBODY can export mailing lists.  </p><p>In other words, just saying that the Address books will be exported is not enough.  Other similar software can export the Address Book but not the mailing lists.   Most people don't know that this is now possible in Thunderbird. </p><p>Thunderbird should be shouting it from the rooftops: ""WE CAN NOW PRESERVE YOUR MAILING LISTS. NOBODY ELSE CAN DO IT!!!""  </p><p>Just a suggestion. &nbsp;:-) </p>",Emilio2000,false,0,0

If this is a POP account, the excessive downloads may happen if the popstat.dat file in the profile is corrupted. That is the file that keeps track of which messages have already been downloaded.
