So, it's only natural that there would be a gentle reminder on this topic. However, it is easily removed at settings&gt;general and untick the daily start page. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My guess is the answer to that is no,  despite your comment about how everything is there but the address book.  A download from the web and a setting up of IMAP accounts will get you to this point with mail and no address book.  Or addons Or calendar Or personalization settings. </p><p>I suggest you create the zip and try importing it.  Or the SQLITe database that forms the address book in that ZIP. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If this is a POP account, the excessive downloads may happen if the popstat.dat file in the profile is corrupted. That is the file that keeps track of which messages have already been downloaded. Another possibility is if you are using the AllMail folder, which contains all messages and is a duplicate of messages in other folders. Otherwise, I have not seen that problem before. Someone else here may have more suggestions. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

But why are you trying to download it? I appear to be already installed.  Reinstalling is almost guaranteed not to fix anything.  It is about the last thing anyone in this forum would recommend for most issues related to getting mail or sending mail.  It can work for operating system integration issues.
