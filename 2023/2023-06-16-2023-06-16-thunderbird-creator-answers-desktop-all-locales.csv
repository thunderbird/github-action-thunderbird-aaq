1416040,2023-06-15 17:28:25 -0700,2023-10-30 11:54:19 -0700,Spurious messages are garbled/displayed as code.,"<p>Some messages appear garbled/appear as code only: Some appear correctly at first, then at a subsequent reading, they have become garbled. Some messages suddenly (not on the initial reading, but on subsequent readings) have an erroneous Subject or Sender, and I recognize the (often garbled) content as belonging to another Subject or Sender. The problem is spurious: For instance, most e-mails from a particular Sender will read correctly, but every now and again a message appears garbled. When this happens, the From and Subject field will be empty when I open the message. (See attached images) These errors began when my e-mail provider Telenor (@online.no) started to upgrade their e-mail service a few months ago, and so far, they have not been able to pinpoint the cause or correct the problem. But all messages appear correctly on the server, so I suspect TB is not able to fetch and sort messages correctly. As a possible workaround: Is there a way to re-download a particular message to get a ""clean"" version of that particular message in TB? (I use TB version 102.11.2, Build ID 20230526152851).
