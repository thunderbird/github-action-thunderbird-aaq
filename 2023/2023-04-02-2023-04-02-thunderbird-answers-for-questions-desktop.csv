Or do I have to create them?</em> </p><p>At the moment, Gmail has no knowledge about the folder structure in your Pop account. Pop accounts and all folders therein are completely independent of the server. No Pop account folder can synchronise with any server folder/label. All pop account folders and emails are stored on your computer. The only connection is Thunderbird is allowed access to the Gmail 'Inbox' label to download any emails it has previously not downloaded. </p><p>Any email you have sent via gmail Pop account will go through the gmail smtp server. Recently, gmail decided to start putting copies of those emails into the 'Sent Mail' folder/label on server. Just in case you ever chose to view via webmail. This means, if you logon to the gmail webmail account via a browser, you may find the 'Sent Mail' has some of your emails. </p><p>Any email you delete in a Pop account goes to pop Deleted folder, but gmail has no idea where it went. If you have a setting that deletes from server Inbox, then gmail see this as a 'remove the Inbox' label, so email still exists in the gmail server 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Gmail Imap accounts are entirely different. Gmail stores all your emails in one folder called 'All Mail'. Gmail understands it is not the best method for people to use - it's not exactly very workable to have everything incoming, sent and archived in just one folder, so they invented 'labels'. 'Labels' are like applying a special tag allowing a virtual view of an email so it is displayed in a more logical folder style. It also means you can apply several 'labels' allowing one email to appear in various folder views. </p><p>Gmail has a set of default 'labels' so emails stored in 'All Mail' can be viewed in a more logical manner. 'Inbox', 'Drafts', 'Sent Mail', 'Spam', 'Trash (sometimes called 'Bin'),'All Mail'. So when you create an imap account you will get all of those default folders automatically 'Subscribed' to be seen. You can set the gmail webmail to 'not show in imap' eg: 'All Mail' folder. Any other folder you require in Thunderbird imap account needs to be created either via Thunderbird or a label via gmail webmail account and set up to be 'shown in imap'. </p><p>All imap folders can be set up to download full copies of emails - aka fully synchronise with server OR just download headers to save space - those emails get downloaded when selected to be viewed and temp stored in a cache. </p><p>When you delete an email in gmail imap account it should go to the gmail imap 'Trash' folder. As folders synchronise with server, gmail will understand email has been put in gmail Trash so delete email from the 'All Mail' folder.  Any email that has been in the gmail Trash folder for 30 days will get auto deleted by gmail off server and therefore will disappear from the imap Trash folder as well. </p><p>The imap gmail account folders cannot be considered as completely independent of the server and can only display whatever is on the server.  </p><p><em>2) If the Gmail account had some labels that have no corresponding folders in TBird will folders be created automatically in TBird? Or am I excepting too much of TBird?</em> </p><p>So, when you create the imap account, you will only see the folders matching the labels that are already created on the server and set as  'show in imap' and see/download any email that is in any of the server folders/labels which you have subscribed to see.  Any other imap folder must be created by you. Senario: If you need an imap folder called 'Family'  - this folder/label does not automatically exist on the server as a default folder. You can create a new imap folder called 'Family' in Thunderbird imap account and it will auto get added as a label in the gmail webmail account. </p><p>OR if you created a new label called 'Family' via the gmail webmail account which you set up to 'show in imap'. Then in Thunderbird you need to subscribe to see the 'Family' folder/label and it would auto display in the imap account. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

In addition - when you remove a Pop account via: 'Account Settings &gt; select pop account name' &gt; click on 'Account Actions' and select 'Remove account' you can keep all the pop account files intact in the  profile folders. Just in case you need to get access to anything. It then just removes pop account from Account Settings and also from Folder Pane, but keeps the data in the profile folders. </p><p><br> Then start to create the imap accounts one at a time, but check the following first.
