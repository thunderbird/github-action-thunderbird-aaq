But, ehen Im only trying to export my addressbook/contacts which are missing still from new computer pressing the address book under tool and export lets me only download a complete zip file. And the desktop when i want to import the addressbook coz it wants it as a first choice as csv and then some similar choices. Where has gone the possibility to download only addressbook to usb stick and then import only the addresses as csv to the new one. This seems to be very complicated. Or are there any specific files in the system which contain the addresses and I could just copy them from my laptop and replace them to the same place where contacts are ususally stored to make the new computer understand and get use of them. I see many people have hard time with this issue and now it seems itsbeen made very difficult. So better to move to another email svc or do you have an easy solution for this? </p><p>Teemu Tuuri teemu.tuuri@kolumbus.fi </p>",other;mobile;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1626355;,teemu.tuuri

But then I bought a new computer and I want to migrate all my Thunderbird settings, including the mailing lists, to my new computer.  </p><p>Why is that not possible?  If I export my complete Personal Address Book, shouldn't that automatically include all my mailing lists?  </p><p>Why encourage people to set up mailing lists if there is no way to preserve them?  I have backed up each mailing list separately.  But, if I import them into my Personal Address book, they simply create duplicates of contact that are already in my PAB.  </p><p>I can only import those separate mailing lists into other address books, but then when I compose a new email, I cannot select all the contacts in those separate address books.  So, what's the use of having separate address books when they seem to be totally unusable?  </p><p>The old Outlook Express was the only email program that could easily back up all the contact lists (called Groups in IE) and just as easily import them into another computer, completely preserving all the mailing lists.  Microsoft had a perfect email program, but then they discarded it and replaced it with ever poorer products that gradually stripped away all the useful features. In the latest Microsoft Mail program you can't even set up a mailing list.  Useless. </p><p>If Outlook Express could preserve mailing lists, why can't other email clients do it too?  </p><p>And what is the point in Thunderbird to allow me to only import my old mailing lists into a new address book that is then completely useless, or import them into the main Personal Address book, where they just create duplicate contacts?  It seems Thunderbird offers us these useless features, while completely ignoring the most important issue:  HOW TO PRESERVE MAILING LISTS?  </p><p>Some of my mailing lists contain over 100 contacts.  It is extremely time-consuming to recreate these lists manually, one record at a time.  </p><p>Fixing this should be the highest priority.  Or is there some workaround for now?  Is there any way to preserve mailing lists? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1626349;1626463;1626465;1626712;,Emilio2000
