""team"" folders as favorites they are displayed in ""favorite folders"" view with their name ""team"" only (without ""project1"", ""...2"", ""...3"" prefix), so i can't see, if one is ""team"" from ""project1"" or from ""project2"" etc., and currently in stable tb 102.10.1 as well as in 113.0b6 the  ""favorite folders"" view only offers automatic alphabetical sorting resulting in a tree like this: </p><p>inbox ads google info support team team team youtube </p><p>all the ""team"" folders are sorted one after the other, but i'd like to move/sort in the second ""team"" folder right after ""inbox"" as it is a more important folder (for me) compared to the other two... </p><p>so,  does anybody know more about this; will it maybe possible to manually sort favorites within ""favorite folders"" view following one's personal priorities in the final release 115? or is it at least on some to-do-list? </p><p>thanks a lot and kind regards, lyrabee </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",lyrabee

All clients loaded whole profile correctly, when I received any email it appeared on all devices at the same time, however upon closing and reopening TB the client redownloaded latest message again, displaying notification afterwards. This happens on every reopen with or without other users having TB open. Deleted emails are still visible on launch and disappear as soon as ""new"" emails are downloaded. Am I doing something wrong?

For years, I saved them in Documents/Thunderbird for easy backup with SyncToy.  I am finally transitioning from laptop running Windows 7 to another laptop running Windows 10.  The Windows 10 laptop previously had a hard drive failure and since it was mostly used for web browsing at that time, we replaced it with a small 128 GB drive so I store all files on external drive. </p><p>First issue: last May I set up fresh Thunderbird folder, renaming the bulky previous folder  and didn't find out until last week that both folders stopped saving to the Thunderbird folder 5/22/2022, almost a year ago.  Today is 5/08/2023. </p><p>Resulting in related issue on Windows 10 laptop: When I started dragging new emails into local folders, I found that no Local Folder has a date more recent than 5/22/2022. Went back to Windows 7 laptop and all the recently saved emails are in Local Folders. </p><p>When checking storage, Windows 7 showed as being in C:\Users\Name\AppData\Thunderbird\Roaming\Profiles\ default I'm guessing it was inadvertently changed.  So I made new folder syncing the AppData folder with the Documents/Thunderbird folder and copied it to the Windows 10 AppData Thunderbird folder, then set it as the local storage folder.  STILL have no recently saved emails in Local Folders.  I went back and followed the instructions on this link as well: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a> </p><p>I've synced and copied several sets of folders to no avail.  I KNOW the emails exist on the Windows 7 laptop but I cannot find where or how to save or transfer emails from May 2022 to May 2023.  What am I missing? </p><p>One thing I can't quite understand is that Account Settings\ Copies &amp; Folders archives options shows Local Folders on drop down list also showing archives on the 3 email accounts I download into Thunderbird but it will NOT let me choose Local Folders.  None are grayed out but the Local option is simply not allowed.  This is true on both laptops.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help in something that is normally so easy.
