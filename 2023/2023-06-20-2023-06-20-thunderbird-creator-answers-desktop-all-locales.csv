The settings need to be updated from POP/IMAP to Exchange. Our company has received this same alert from Godaddy several times in the last couple of years, each with different sunset dates. TB continues to function with our MS accounts as of the posting date of this question. Proposed solutions included changing the incoming and outgoing sever settings in TB to ""OAuth 2.0"" as well as downloading a 3rd party AP such as ""Owl"". Some report that the Apps do work, but wreck the existing TB folder structure. We have tried the OAuth 2.0 settings in the past but they always result in a ""cannot connect to server"" error message. Going back to ssl/tls [incoming] and starttls [outgoing] settings restores functionality. GoDaddy advises us that, as TB is a 3rd party email client, they do not have any guidance on a resolution and to just use the MS web based Exchange portal or install the Exchange AP, which management does not want to do. </p><p>We need to continue to use TB. Can anyone advise for certain how to configure the settings to work with MS Exchange email? If there is no way to do so, which app[s] are know to work from direct experience and won't break the TB folder structure?

As a result, I get a few email messages every day containing ""Storage limit exceeded"" as the subject.  I spoke to the vendor, and they don't know what causes the message to fire.  They also confirmed that I have never come close to exceeding my storage limit. I can't mark the sender as a spam account, because they occasionally send me legitimate correspondence.  I did a little research, and it looks like Thunderbird will allow me to filter by subject. If that works as I suspect it might, that would allow me to filter out the unwanted messages and still receive other communications from this vendor. I went to the following page: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/organize-your-messages-using-filters#w_create-a-new-filter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/organize-your-messages-using-filters#w_create-a-new-filter</a> </p><p>Under Create a New Filter, the instructions say: Click the Application menu button and then Tools followed by Message Filters. The problem for me is that no such Application menu button (three horizontal lines) appears anywhere in my Thunderbird display, unless it's hidden really well. The most I can do at the moment is Click the Settings icon, which allows me to drill down to Privacy &amp; Security. From there, it's unclear how I should proceed. </p><p>I guess my first question is, does the absence of an application menu button mean there's something wrong with my Thunderbird installation, or is that linked instruction page simply out of date? The second question is, can I use my current interface to block incoming email based on subject instead of sender, and if so, how do I do that? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1586516;1586539;,DLESNER123
