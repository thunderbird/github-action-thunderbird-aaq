Perhaps it would be easier to find if it were given a separate label when right-clicking the folder so that one doesn't have to select ""properties"" before finding it. It wasn't intuitive to me to look for a ""repair"" function behind a ""properties"" function. Possibly, this function could also get a separate heading in the ""Help - more troubleshooting information"" top menu item? That is where I looked initially, and didn't find it. Thanks again!

You have changed the port from from 465 to 587 and now I assume you get some sort of sending error.  What is it?  Clearly it has nothing to do with TLS.  Without knowing what the actual error is, offering anything but platitudes is not really an option. </p><p>What I do know about the bargain basement solutions offered by network solutions is they fail entirely to offer a valid SSL certificate for the server you are asked to connect to and a manual exception has to be created for each and every host and port used.  You I guess have an exception recorder for the old port but not the new.  I also have seen a couple of topics suggesting a bug in the request for a certificate not occurring if the password is saved.  So I suggest you go to the saved passwords in Thunderbird and delete the saved password for that outgoing account.  That should allow the prompt to appear (if my reading between the lines is any good.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

That might offer some clue as the the source of the issue. </p><p>Also delete any saved passwords for the account in the password manager.  Not having a password may allow the actual error to bubble up to where it can be seen.  But I would guess, like you, that the certificate is no longer valid. </p><p>Finally what are the settings being used for the outgoing server? </p><p>A DNS search for the domain you mention <a href=""https://intodns.com/edcmeals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intodns.com/edcmeals.com</a> shows the mail exchanger is registered as <a href=""http://mail.edcmeals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.edcmeals.com</a>.  While this may not be the mail submission server,  it usually is.  A test of the SSL/TLS for the domain using the default encrypted port of 465 got me a result that the mail server is vulnerable to about every serious hack in the last 5 years.  It got a F rating  <a href=""https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/mail.edcmeals.com/2pHva0TL/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/mail.edcmeals.com/2pHva0TL/</a> </p><p>I am guessing the main issue of is the size of the key at 1025bits.  2048 has been a basic requirement for the majority of the last 10 years.  The logjam vulnerability having come to light in 2015. </p><p>Personally I feel the encrypted connection is next to useless in this case.  I would suggest you look as using a non encrypted connection to the server if you can do nothing about the general standard of the encryption used.   </p><p>I look at the whois registry information for the domain <a href=""https://who.is/whois/edcmeals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://who.is/whois/edcmeals.com</a> and using the diagnostics there and a traceRT,  it looks like the server may be an on premises device, hosted on the old road runner network.
