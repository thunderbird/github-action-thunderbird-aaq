A computer programmer colleague advised me to change to Thunderbird because it has no capacity limit and therefore can be used infinitely for an email archive.    However from what you say Matt, it sounds like the problem is with Windows.   I never realised it has a limit on how many files can be open at any one time but since 2007, when I first started using Thunderbird there have been many versions of Windows and my Thunderbird has been transferred in its entirety onto several different computers.    How can one see how many files are open in Windows at any one time to ensure one is within the limit?   Do individual documents open in Word or Acrobat count as one file?  Do open Web pages also count?  Returning to Outlook I must have around 300 folders and subfolders.   If I delete some and amalgamate some others into one folder is that likely to reveal my lost folders?

Phone, tablet or another computer. </p><p>The other alternative is Thunderbird can not actually connect to the mail server (thing like antivirus and firewall are common issues and more recently VPN's as many don't support email and many ISP providers do not support VPNs connecting from outside the ISP provided network.) When this occurs and the account type is IMAP then the contents of folders will synchronize to oblivion,  even folders other than the default inbox trash etc will also go missing.  Again it looks as you describe because the same mechanism is involved. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
