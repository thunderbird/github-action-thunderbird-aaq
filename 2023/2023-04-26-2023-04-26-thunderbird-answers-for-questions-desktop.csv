However, on your question, a simple approach about using the other drive would be to move the full account over to the external drive. To do that:  - exit thunderbird - in windows file explorer, locate the account at  c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles\&lt;profilename&gt;\imapmail\<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> (assuming account is imap and gmail)    and copy to the other drive.   - start thunderbird  - highlight account, rightclick and select 'settings' - select 'server settings' - click the browse button and locate/select the folder you placed on external drive - test account to be sure all is working normally.  - exit thunderbird - in windows file explorer, you may now delete the folder at imapmail\account name  </p><p>Tip: If you don't use the Allmail account, you can just highlight account, select 'subscribe' and unsubscribe from the folder. Also check under 'synchronization&amp;storage 'advanced' tab to ensure you do not have the folder selected for offline use. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
