If I click on any of the options in that menu, the email accounts appear, but the messages are still not being sent. When I open thunderbird again, the system reappears without showing the mail accounts. </p><p>b) emails cannot be sent, but they can be received. </p><p>c) It seems to me that the MC Afee antivirus program sent me an alert from thunderbird and sent some files to quarantine. This probably happened after a thunderbird update, so I've tried unquarantining the files, i.e. restoring them, but it still doesn't work. </p><p>I tried to reinstall thunderbird without uninstalling the one I had so I don't lose all my folder settings, but it still doesn't work. </p><p>Any ideas how to fix this without losing the many backup folders I have? </p><p>greetings and thanks </p><p>SPANISH Hola, actualmente tengo dos cuentas de correo de outlock (exchange) configuradas con el complemento Exquilla.

It told me to delete emails for it to be able to compact. It had been set to advise me every time it had more than 10Mb to compact and up till then, it had always compacted successfully. So I deleted 100Mb of emails, yet it still told me that it needed me to delete more emails. The Profile folder was located in its own 10GB partition.  So I checked the partition and found that it had less than 100MB of space left.  So I copied the Profile folder into another 30GB partition and within Thunderbird, I changed the location of the four email local directories by typing the new location address in each of the Server Settings - Message Storage - Local Directory folder.  I very soon noticed that I also had to change the address of the Profiles folder in the Profiles.ini and installs.ini folder.  So I changed that manually.  When I opened Thunderbird it appeared to open without any problems.  My emails appear to be intact.  I haven't noticed any missing or corrupted emails.  The email structure e.g. sub folders, appear to be all there and correct, but it is not asking for the emails to be compacted. Under General Settings, the original setting is still set i.e. inform when more that 10MB and ask every time before compacting.  The old Profiles address is not accessible to Thunderbird any more, although I can still access it and am keeping it as a backup.  When I choose an email folder to compact, nothing happens.  I have tried the Repair Folder dropdown for the main INBOX folder but nothing happened.  I did notice that once all the Profile addresses were changed, Thunderbird automatically started to and completed re-indexing all the folders/files.

1418138,2023-07-12 05:09:48 -0700,2023-07-12 05:09:48 -0700,Thunderbird is empty,"<p>A few weeks ago I started a project to transfer emails from a webmail service (a POP3 account) to local storage on my PC, using TB to move the emails and to be the 'container'.  A trial download of around 90 emails appeared to be successful and the messages were moved into a number of TB local folders.  Daily life then overtook the project. Now resuming, it's a bit of a shock to find TB almost completely empty:  no emails, no folders, and no account for the webmail, no accounts at all.  (The only thing there was a handful of collected addresses from a failed attempt some years ago to set TB up as an active client for a different webmail service.)  I thought I exited TB after the trial download before manually deleting the messages on the webmail server but maybe I didn't — if this is significant.  And I don't know what the TB settings for the webmail account were, which it set up automatically, as the account has now vanished.  I should have checked at the time, I realise. Not much to go on but can anyone surmise what happened, what I did wrong? Should I assume that the emails are lost for good?  I did not take a specific TB back up.  There is nothing in the TB profile.  File History was on an hourly schedule at the time but I am unclear what exactly it backs up, or how, and I can't see anything relevant there.  And comments in the forum suggest you can't restore successfully from there anyway. And I'd be very grateful for any advice on how to do this properly so that the emails, etc.,  do not evaporate.
