Data loss is to be expected from the procedure as backwards compatibility is not guaranteed any longer. </p><p>As for updates,  you can repeatedly click on not allowing a proposed update,  but disabling the search for update and download is really only an option for enterprise users who  utilize other update mechanisms in many cases. Generally I just leave it to update automatically.  There are occasional issue with addons and updates.  But the days of V68 when masses of them were left behind as they had not been updated for that change are behind us.  Then there is the constant change to data storage which when updates are skipped tends to cause more issues that addons these days leads me to just let it do it's own thing. </p><p>Thunderbird is a multi threaded / multi core application,  as are most modern applications and appears in task manager as running in multiple instances on multiple cores. I assume this is what you are talking about when you talk of ""about five copies of Thunderbird running at once"".  If you mean something else,  perhaps be more descriptive and exact in your language.  As for your system updates.  Thunderbird checks the system integration on each startup.  I guess you have UAC set to notify you of those requests.  Or you are denying the update and it is repeated over and over for the integration updates to occur. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is not updating.  No one had MY authorization to make changes on MY computer.  Therefore, there is no update to undo.  My question is why does Thunderbird THINK it's going to update when, without my authorization, it is most certainly not going to. </p><p>And if some jackass took it upon themselves to make unauthorized changes on my system, where are the files for the update.  Believe me when I tell you I have those skills.  And if I find out that someone there did this without my authorization, first, I'll make sure everyone knows that Thunderbird thinks they have the right to make changes to just anyone's system without the authorization to do so, and that it's a bad MUA. </p><p>Also, while I have your attention, I added a third email address from <a href=""http://gmx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.com</a>.  Every time Tbird shuts down and restarts, it vanishes, along with its filters.  WTF is going on? </p><p><strong>Finally, again, if some jackass did make these changes without my permission, tell me where the files for the update are stored on M$ CrashOS 10 so I can undo this update before it happens.  I mean, who the fsck does whoever did this think they are?  Do THEY own my system?  Did they buy it from me?  No on both.</strong> </p><p>It probably won't matter for much longer, as I'm fed up with M$ doing the same thing, crashing my system to do updates right in the middle of my using it for projects I'm working on AND NOT RESTORING it back to exactly where it was when they're done (meaning I lose any work I haven't saved and that hasn't been autosaved).  I'm working on switching to either Slackware or FreeBSD (I've used FreeBSD for years in the past, and remember Slackware as coming out shortly after I built my own BSD4.2 Linux system back in '92. </p>",jim174,false,0,1

No one does that, at least, no one who values personal rights and freedoms.  And that's why I just installed emClient instead of thunderbird.
