It has fixed the problem for loads of people already If the wrong font settings are currently operating , these font settings are set up in your profile folder name not in the program itself.

However, I've already told you how to fix that and it should only take you about 5 minutes. I'm assuming you are fully capable of following instructions, creating a folder,  copy pasting text which is already supplied and saving the file with a name in the newly created folder, so it will be no problem. </p><p>It's not that simple to go back to a previous version because the profile will have been made compatible for the new version.  The instructions offered at that link will probably mean you would get a new profile and need to set up everything again and then go through the process of moving required files to the new profile and that will take up time. It's not the installation that will take time, it's the complete recreation of all accounts and restoring address books etc. But you can try to force a backwards compatibility on your current profile, before you start Thunderbird after installation,  access the profile folder name and delete the 'compatibility.ini' file.
