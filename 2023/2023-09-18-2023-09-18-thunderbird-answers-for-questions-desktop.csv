While they usually do update if I wait long enough, this is really impacting my productivity.  So I just went back to 102.15.1 using a copy of my profile that I saved right before I made the upgrade and a saved version of the earlier code.  Perhaps there is some kind of issue with scratch space cleanup or something like that which causes this issue to get worse over time.

A naptáraink működnek telefonokon, webes felületen, az utolsó Outlook-os gépünkön még azzal is (egy ősrégi Outlook caldav szinkronizáló kiegészítővel). A 115-ös verzióra váltás előtt a Thunderbirdökkel is ment minden rendben. Most amint felveszem a naptárakat és szinkronizálni akarja azokat, kiakad.

If I set the time/duration to anything else, it does not appear. Editing an ""all day"" event to (for example) 12-1pm doesn't make it appear. - this is for Win11 </p>",bringtheglow,false,1,0
