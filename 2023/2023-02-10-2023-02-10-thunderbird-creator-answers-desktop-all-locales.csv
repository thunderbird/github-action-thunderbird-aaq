Ho configurato 5 account differenti di posta elettronica, che utilizzano ciascuno un gestore della posta differente. Ho gmail, gmx, tiscali, alice, libero. Dopo moltissime tribolazioni sono riuscito a importare da Outlook Express il mio archivio di 3 GB di posta di 15 anni, con un passaggio intermedio tramite Windows Mail di Vista. Gli account inviano e ricevono posta regolarmente. Sistema operativo Windows 7 a 64 bit. Il mio problema è che non ho capito come inviare simultaneamente le varie email dei miei 5 account. Allo stato attuale, quando compongo una email, posso solo inviarla subito. Quando ad esempio scrivo 2 email per ogni account da inviare, sono costretto a scrivere e inviare una email per volta. Invece su Outlook Express potevo scrivere le 10 email e tenerle nella cartella comune ""Posta in uscita"". Quando avevo finito, mi connettevo al web e con un unico comando di invio le 10 email partivano una dopo l'altra automaticamente. Siccome trovo molto frustrante invece essere sempre connesso e comporre e inviare ogni email una per volta, mi sono chiesto in cosa sto sbagliando. Esiste in Thunderbird la possibilità di raggruppare tutte le email che compongo per l'invio in una singola cartella, e poi inviarle tutte assieme con un unico comando? Questa è quindi la mia domanda. Ho cercato invano sul web, sia su alcuni forum che tramite ricerca su Google, ma la mia domanda viene sempre interpretata erroneamente come invio di una sola email ad account multipli. Quindi ricevo risposte inutili. Grazie a chi mi illumina suggerendomi la soluzione. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1565097;1565291;,mikarav

I also tried the 102.7.2  tar.bz2 version from Thunderbird website with same results.  </p><p>I find that I need to use different browsers for different purposes. The setting in Settings&gt;Files and Attachments&gt;https I set to Always ask. Every time I click on a link Thunderbird opens the link with what ever browser is set as the default in KDE Plasma SystemSettings&gt;Applications&gt;Default Applications. The setting in Thunderbird Settings&gt;Files and Attachments&gt;https is rewritten to that browser. This does not seem correct. </p><p>I have tried this with network.protocol-handler.warn-external.https set to true and false and that seems to have no affect. That having no affect seems odd. </p><p>So it appears something is causing the settings in Thunderbird to be overridden by settings in KDE Plasma desktop. Not what I need. </p><p>If I use an old profile this works as expected. Not sure how old that profile is but maybe v. 99 or 100.  </p><p>I do not know if this is for sure Thunderbird not respecting it's own settings or something else.
