I am still monitoring if this issue still exists in 115 but I suspect it will as the engine hasn't changed? </p><p>It appears more regularly if I start up Thunderbird for the first time and while it is still downloading emails over IMAP. During the IMAP synchronisation, if I click on an email that is yet to be downloaded, sometimes, Thunderbird will fail to load the email body entirely. </p><p>This ""empty"" email stays in the inbox. </p><p>If I load my email provider's webmail interface via a browser, the email shows up fine. If I move this email to another folder and then move it back into the inbox, I force Thunderbird to perform an IMAP sync for the folder content change and the email is then properly shown in Thunderbird. </p><p>Outlook and Mailbird on Windows does not have this issue. Nor does iOS Mail, Gmail, FairEmail and TypeApp on Android. There are no VPNs in use. AntiVirus software is active but its also active for Outlook and Mailbird. Extensions for Thunderbird which are active are Identity Chooser, quickFilters and Remove Duplicate Messages. </p><p>Repairing and Compacting the folder in the past does nothing to fix the issue. I will monitor for the issue on 115 and try it again but thought I should put this out here in case anyone else has experienced similar issues and worked out what was causing it. It seems to be very specific to the way Thunderbird handles email loading especially under load (while its performing other actions like folder synchronisation). </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",mikechan

I tried changing the font size, it didn't improve or make worse the jammed together rows. </p><p>The settings page has nice rows, the calendar has nice rows. </p><p>However the inbox and the list of accounts is gross. </p><p>First I will need to downgrade to the previous version without losing my data...then tell me how to adjust the row spacing? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",fortestingpurposes
