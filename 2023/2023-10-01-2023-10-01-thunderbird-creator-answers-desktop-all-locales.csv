After repeated failures to import my Mail folders to Supernova, I copied my entire profile from the previous version, the one just before 115.3.1 (64-bit), to another hard drive. Then I uninstalled Thunderbird and deleted the remaining files in AppData\Local and AppData\Roaming. Then I got a fresh copy of Supernova and copied the old files into AppData\Roaming. Next, I used the Import feature, selecting 'Import from another Thunderbird installation'. Under the 'Choose what to import', I initially selected all four options, but that didn't work at all. Next I selected just 'Accounts and Settings'. That worked. So, next I selected 'Mail Messages'. That seemed to be working for a couple of minutes before an Error Message appeared which read 'Import failed unexpectedly, more information may be available in the Error Console'. So, I closed the program and then opened it again. Oddly enough, a few of the Local Folders showed up. The other 16 folder did not. I've supplied six screenshots so you can see what's still missing.
