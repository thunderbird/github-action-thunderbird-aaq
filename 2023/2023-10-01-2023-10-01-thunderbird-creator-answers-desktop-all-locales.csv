There is now less space between lines, and when I scroll one click of the scroll wheel on my mouse moves the list about 6 messages up or down, while previously it moved only 3 messages.

I am tempted to bare metal revert versions but that won't fix the security vulnerabilities. this reminds me of a transporter incident, somehow an attempt was made to make a 'unified folder' system when there was in fact only one account, now it is all a hodgepodge. </p><p>HELP! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1607362;,jw98g26yvd
