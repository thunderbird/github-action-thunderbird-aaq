This is because all IMAP accounts can only synchronise with the server for that email address and display the same folders and emails that are on the server. So the imap account folders for an account show a mirror copy of the folders you normally see when you logon to your webmail account.  </p><p>That leaves you with two options: <strong>Option 1:</strong> use the 'Unified' folder view in Thunderbird.  Menu icon &gt; View &gt; Folders &gt; select 'Unified'. This creates a virtual folder for each of the default folders eg: Inbox, Drafts, Send etc It's like a search result, putting all your Inbox emails for all accounts into one Inbox. You can expand the Unified Inbox to see the individual Inboxes if required. All other folders which you created are listed separate per account below the set of default folders. See images below as a guide to how it looks.  First image shows all the default folders as Unified folders at the top. They are in a collapsed state denoted by the &gt; shown on the left of the folder name.  Followed by the remains of the other four mail accounts which have unique folders created by me. The next image shows the same set of Unified default folders, but this time I've expanded the set of default Unified folders, so you can see that each Unified folder can also display each individual eg: Inbox. I would try this out first as it is simple and quick. It means you can check one Inbox to see all incoming mail from all Inboxes yet still have the ability to organise and store emails in individual accounts. Sort of best of both. </p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> <em>re&nbsp;:I know that gmail and outlook allow this. </em> Thunderbird is not a server so it does not have that capability. Gmail and Outlook server allow forwarding of emails from another server into the account you hold in gmail or outlook. So in effect all emails are now visible in eg: gmail or Outlook.  Gmail and Outlook provide this as their way of saying you can view all emails in one account - the gmail webmail account. However, if you create a gmail account for yourself and then set up to forward emails from your other email address into the gmail account - all done via webmail account - You can then create a gmail imap mail account in Thunderbird and download everything from gmail server into the gmail imap account in Thunderbird. So basically you now have emails in one account. Make sure you also set up to be able to send using those email addresses via the gmail server. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It is not only incomprehensible that some other program on the box would eat up enough free space to impinge on a Thunderbird function, it simply is not happening. </p><p>I monitor this system much more than I suspect you can imagine, which is not any knock on you, it's just that you don't know me. Nothing is ""clogging it up"". Moreover, I'm almost obsessive about keeping Thunderbird's folders compacted and the database free of any gunk. One of the addons I use is MultiXpunge, and I run it much more frequently than is probably necessary.  It's not only on the file menu, it's a button on my toolbar. </p><p>I also have a near fetish about running things like task manager from time to time. There simply are no problems with my system, other than this intermittent error that Thunderbird is throwing up. </p><p>I've run Thunderbird for years, and almost all of that time with pretty much the same array of software on the box that it currently sports. I cannot image there are any conflicts, but of course there's always a small possibility that some update may have changed some compatibility. </p><p>I think (but cannot prove of course) that the error is either in the Thunderbird build I was using (until yesterday's update to 102.8.0) or in one of the addons, that perhaps had a bad update itself. </p><p>In any case, since the T-Bird update at least, the error message has not come back. If it does, I think one thing I will try is to uninstall the addons, one-by-one, and run T-Bird for a few days with each one disabled, and see what happens. I sure hate to do that, because I don't have any T-Bird addons that I don't consider kind of essential. But it may have to be done. </p><p>My antivirus is Malwarebytes, and it's also been working with T-Bird for many years, and there have been no problems. </p><p>Thanks very much for your reply, however. I was hoping someone would say something like, ""Yeah, it got that error message, too, and I discovered it was ..."" </p><p>Maybe that will still happen. </p>",yukitaga1,false,0,0

When you setup your Gmail account in Thunderbird (or any email account for that matter), only one identity is added, called the <strong>Default </strong>identity. The email address associated with the default identity is used as the ""send as"" address, that is, it's what the <strong>From </strong>field of sent messages will contain. What you need to do, therefore, is to set up a new identity in Thunderbird, for each of the other email addresses you wish to use as ""send as"" addresses. It's similar to how you setup the 5 email accounts in Gmail. Once you've setup those identities, you will be able to select whichever identity to use when sending replies.
