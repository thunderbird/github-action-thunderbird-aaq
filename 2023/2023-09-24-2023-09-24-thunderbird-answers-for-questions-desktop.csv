If this was wrong in the program then it would effect everyone and the outcry would be huge. Such as when the middle click was not opening selected email in a tab in the background. This effected everyone because the code did not exist and a bug report was created and they are working on this. </p><p>However, any pressing/clicking of mouse means a signal is sent to the computer and the computer performs the specific event as per program code. If computer is not receiving signals correctly then it is not the program. The likely problem is with the keyboard unless you have been doing something by creating your own keyboard shortcuts. </p><p>I've done some tests some only using keyboard and others using a mix of keyboard and mouse. </p><p>To select various random emails in list to hightlight: <strong>Test 1:</strong> Press 'Ctrl' on keyboard and use left click with mouse to select various emails Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p><strong>Test 2</strong>: Press/ Hold 'Ctrl', use up/down arrow keys to navigate to email, press 'Space' bar to select/highlight. Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p>To select contigous emails in a block: <strong>Test 3:</strong> Select an email and press and hold  'Shift', use mouse to select an email several further down list and all in between get highlighted. Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p><strong>Test4: </strong>Select email, hold down 'Shift' and use up/down arrow keys on keyboard to select and highlight emails Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p><br> So, with a fully working keyboard, all the above are working correctly for me. I'm using beta 118.0b6, so this is version 115* - just a few updates ahead of the release version. </p><p>I would advise you to start by checking your keyboard because your computer sounds like it is not getting the necessary signals so cannot perform the task in the code.  </p><p>Possible things to check: Is the 'Scroll Lock' switched on&nbsp;? Maybe the keyboard is in need of a clean.  Maybe you are using  'Razer Cortex' and it's stolen the shortcuts.

It works perfectly ok in 118.0b6, maybe the issue has been recently fixed and not yet appearing in the release version.  I did notice the following has been fixed in 115.2.3 </p> <ul><li> <em>Multiple selected messages could not be opened simultaneously if selection included more than 19 messages</em> </li></ul> <p>Otherwise so you must have something going on as I mentioned.  </p><p>2) ""- cant select multiple folders -also didn't work"" Now this is not the same as the first problem. This particular issue does sound like the problem mentioned at the link you supplied. It also tells you a bug report was created and it also tells you it is a Wontfix which I feel is wrong. I am amazed that a new major upgrade has lost this particular functionality which effects workflow. </p><p>I would advise that you go to the following locations and vote for both of these bugs.

If I had been using the preview pane all along I would have made this suggestion years ago. </p><p>I think adding an ""Open"" button to the preview pane message header right next to the other buttons is an excellent productivity enhancement.

Gmail will auto delete any emails that have been in the  gmail Trash after 30 days, thus allowing you time to retrieve an email deleted in error. Gmail will auto remove any deleted emails from the 'All Mail' folder if those emails have been put into the gmail Trash folder. </p><p>Note: If you by pass the gmail Trash folder then gmail reads this as remove only a label which means the email is archived meaning email is still in All Mail but all labels are removed so you do not see it anywhere else. </p><p>So everything works perfectly ok until you decide to delete an email from an 'All Mail' folder which you know has already been deleted. Why are deleting emails from  'All Mail'? It does take a little while for Thunderbird to jibber jabber with server about what has been deleted and then server gets up dated and then the imap 'All Mail' folder gets synchronised again to reflect changes. </p><p>Bottom line is this if you have set everything up correctly and it sounds like you have everything set up correctly....then Do not delete anything from the 'All Mail' folder. I would go as far to say do not do anything with an 'All Mail' folder and the best solution is unsubscribe from seeing it. </p><p>If you delete an email from 'All Mail' then it will automatically get deleted from whatever folder it was displaying in eg: Inbox.  Strongly advise you do not do anything in a gmail 'All Mail' folder. It is the one and only copy that truelly exists as far as gmail is concerned and nothing in an imap account can be truelly regarded as a separate independent copy because all folders synchronise with server. </p><p>As far as gmail is concerned there is only one copy of an email and it is in 'All Mail' folder. The only reason you see it in Inbox is because gmail applied a kind of filter tag which they call a label. This means a virtual email is shown in the server Inbox. Thunderbird downloads the virtual copy and stores it as an email in imap folder. When you delete it and email goes to Trash, gmail sees this as delete the email which is in 'All Mail'.   </p><p>Why have you subscribed to see the 'All Mail' folder&nbsp;? It's just a duplicate of everything.  You can't use it for anything useful because it just full of everything - there is no organisation or reasoning to it and you should never move delete etc etc anything in 'All Mail' as it may effect emails you want to keep. It's really just too risky to contemplate. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Now thunderbird focus is on that email. </p><p>Now here is a race condition that occurs within mili-seconds or in a second. </p><p>You are about press Del key to delete that email from that Folder. But in the mean time (just before you pressed Del key) thunderbird synced that folder and on its own deleted your email. (because it realized that this message was deleted from Gmail server and no more exists in the folder) Now after deleting the email on its own, thunderbird moves focus to next email that is important email. Now your Del key gets hit by your fingers. But since focus has moved to next important email, you end up accidentally deleting an important email. </p><p>This did not happen before Supernova. When thunderbird synced a folder and focus was on email which was deleted, then focus is released completely instead of putting focus on next email. So even if you press Del key, nothing happens and nothing is deleted accidentally. </p><p>I re-read my bug report, I do believe that I have explained the issue properly. </p><p>Requesting you to please re-read the bug report. </p><p>Thank you </p>",amish,false,0,0
