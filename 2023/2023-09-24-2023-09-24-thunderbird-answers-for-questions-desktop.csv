If this was wrong in the program then it would effect everyone and the outcry would be huge. Such as when the middle click was not opening selected email in a tab in the background. This effected everyone because the code did not exist and a bug report was created and they are working on this. </p><p>However, any pressing/clicking of mouse means a signal is sent to the computer and the computer performs the specific event as per program code. If computer is not receiving signals correctly then it is not the program. The likely problem is with the keyboard unless you have been doing something by creating your own keyboard shortcuts. </p><p>I've done some tests some only using keyboard and others using a mix of keyboard and mouse. </p><p>To select various random emails in list to hightlight: <strong>Test 1:</strong> Press 'Ctrl' on keyboard and use left click with mouse to select various emails Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p><strong>Test 2</strong>: Press/ Hold 'Ctrl', use up/down arrow keys to navigate to email, press 'Space' bar to select/highlight. Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p>To select contigous emails in a block: <strong>Test 3:</strong> Select an email and press and hold  'Shift', use mouse to select an email several further down list and all in between get highlighted. Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p><strong>Test4: </strong>Select email, hold down 'Shift' and use up/down arrow keys on keyboard to select and highlight emails Result: works perfectly ok in both Table View and Cards View. </p><p><br> So, with a fully working keyboard, all the above are working correctly for me. I'm using beta 118.0b6, so this is version 115* - just a few updates ahead of the release version. </p><p>I would advise you to start by checking your keyboard because your computer sounds like it is not getting the necessary signals so cannot perform the task in the code.  </p><p>Possible things to check: Is the 'Scroll Lock' switched on&nbsp;? Maybe the keyboard is in need of a clean.  Maybe you are using  'Razer Cortex' and it's stolen the shortcuts. I did locate this which effected alot of people, not necessarilly using Thunderbird, but a keyboard issue would not necessarilly be Thunderbird specific. <a href=""https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel/ctrl-shift-arrow-up-down-not-working/m-p/1857249"" rel=""nofollow"">https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel/ctrl-shift-arrow-up-down-not-working/m-p/1857249</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1
