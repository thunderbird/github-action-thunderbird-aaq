I had suspected that it had something to do with me inadvertently having linked Thunderbird to my gmail account (a link I definitely don't want). </p><p>You helped me to get rid of the connection to gmail but the spare Local Folders section is still there. Trying to sort it made me realize that I might be missing the proper Server Settings. </p><p>The full pathway to the Local Directory is:  C:\Users\Windows User\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\828m3ixh.default\Mail\Local Folders </p><p>Thank you again for your kindness, Ulrike </p>",u.i.hill,false,0,0

Is this the case? </p><p>Unfortunately your second screenshot is cut off at the right hand side. What's full path of the 'Local Directory' setting for the 'Local Folders' account? </p>,christ1,false,0,0
