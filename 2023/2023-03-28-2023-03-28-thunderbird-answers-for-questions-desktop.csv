First, I would set the feature of saving drafts to be every 120 minutes. That should remove the periodic attempts. Just a guess on my part, as there may be some default when unchecked. Again, just a guess on my part, as it doesn't make sense that it tries to save otherwise. My other suggestion is to set the folder to save sent messages in to a different folder, just to see if that works. Otherwise, the problem puzzles me. It is possible some settings in Thunderbird got corrupted and reinstalling the account may fix it, but that gets messy for POP accounts, as Thunderbird then attempts to download all prior messages. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

First, if you keep current structure, I suggest creating a folder under 'Local Folders' with name of the errant account, e.g., RogueSent. Then, in account settings, set the sent folder to that folder. All it accomplishes is that it keeps sent messages for that account separate from other accounts. I agree that putting the sent messages in sent folder for another account can be confusing.  </p><p>Now, back to the main problem. Something I overlooked is that the 'bad' sent folder may just need repairing. To try that,  - set the sent folder back to the proper assignment - from main pane, rightclick that folder, click 'properties' and then click 'repair.'  - send a test message to yourself and see if it worked.  </p><p>Okay, on your suggestion: it may work if above did not. Always worth a try. To try that - click help&gt;moretroubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' - click 'open profile'  - now exit Thunderbird, leaving the File Explorer window showing  - if account is POP, click the Mail folder, if IMAP, the Imapmail folder - click the account and the folders should appear - the sent folder is two elements, names such as  Sent   and Sent.msf  - delete both  - restart thunderbird and reset default assignment back to original assignment if not already done - attempt to send message again.  </p><p>My hope is that the repair did the trick, but I'll be equally pleased if your suggested solved it. And resorting to the LocalFolders isn't pure, but it works. Do let me know. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Here are the details... </p><p>I'd already tried the folder repair several time before posting here and it didn't work. I tried it again though, and it still didn't work.  </p><p>I started following your procedure and found there were two folders for this account.

Ogni provider è libero di stabilire il numero massimo di destinatari a cui è possibile inviare uno stesso messaggio. 200 destinatari sono comunque un numero elevato per quasi tutti i provider.

Ovviamente se le invii a più destinatari, ogni destinatario viene contato come un messaggio. </p><p>Per cui la prima cosa che dovresti fare, secondo me, è chiedere al tuo provider quali limiti applica. </p>",@next,false,0,0
