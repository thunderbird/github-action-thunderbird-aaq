Resta il rammarico, secondo me, che Thunderbird, cioè che i suoi programmatori, non abbiano pensato di incorporare il bottone &lt;Invia dopo&gt; come popup nel bottone Invia, ovviamente per ciascun account. Non conosco le ragioni di tenerlo distante e separato sotto il bottone File, ma mi piacerebbe conoscere su questo le opinioni degli altri. Quanto a me, ho dovuto affrontare non poche difficoltà per trasferire da Outlook Express di XP l'archivio di posta. Dapprima ho usato Thunderbird 38, ancora compatibile con XP, poi ho utilizzato il sistema dei profili, ed ho utilizzato per TB 102 il profilo di TB 38, con il trasferimento così avvenuto di fatto. Ben più problematico invece il creare i 5 nuovi account, che non ne hanno proprio voluto saperne di configurarsi e funzionare con la presenza del precedente archivio trasferito. Ho dovuto cambiare sistema. Ho ripianato il tutto e creato dapprima i 5 account, che funzionavano correttamente. Poi ho cercato di trasferire l'archivio, con le varie funzioni Importa ed anche provando una estensione ad hoc. Ma non c'è stato nulla da fare. Allora ho trasferito l'archivio di Outlook Express su Windows Mail di Vista, con la funzione ""Importa"". Quindi ho provato a trasferire l'archivio da Windows Mail a TB 102, con la funzione ""Importa"", ma circa il 30% delle email non veniva importato. Allora ho provato ad aprire sia Explorer che Total Commander ed a trascinare i file EML con il Drag&amp;Drop dentro lo spazio ""interfaccia"" di TB 102, in ciascuna rispettiva cartella di Cartelle locali, ma mentre quelle già importate in precedenza si copiavano, quelle prima rifiutate non entravano nemmeno con il Drag&amp;Drop. Alla fine, aperti i rispettivi profili corrispondenti di TB 102 e TB 38 con Total Commander, ho copiato direttamente i file di TB 38 entro le cartelle di System File di TB 102, seguendo la corrispondenza dei nomi dei file di sistema. Al termine di una ventina di ricopiature, per cartelle e sottocartelle, riaprendo TB 102 ho ritrovato tutto l'archivio all'interno dell'interfaccia utente, con cartelle, sottocartelle e tutte le email. Se non avessi avuto conoscenza del Computer ed una esperienza da 40 anni in informatica (TB a parte, mai usato finora), non avrei potuto trasferire interamente l'archivio della posta, datato 20 anni. Tutto questo per fare un favore ad un'amica ex insegnante. Quanto a me, che ho 40 account di posta con 7 ISP differenti, ho creato 10 profili, ciascuno con un archivio separato per ISP, più gli account estinti, e solo così posso gestire su TB il mio archivio di posta di oltre 10 GB, mentre su OE6 utilizzavo più semplicemente le ""Identità"". Mi restano alcuni dubbi non tanto sulla sicurezza ed efficienza di TB, ma sulla macchinosità di certi passaggi e sulla difficoltà di importare correttamente con procedure di default un archivio di 3 o più GB di posta su molti account e con una 30ina di cartelle e sottocartelle. E tutto questo nonostante una settimana passata a navigare sul web per 4 ore al giorno per poterci capire qualcosa di più approfondito su TB, sia in lingua italiana che inglese. Auspico la creazione di una Guida ""seria"" su TB, e non dei suggerimenti su come si crea e configura un account. C'è ben altro e direi molto, su come gestire appieno TB, così pieno di funzioni, ma anche piuttosto complesso e talvolta labirintico. Ma ormai, con la faccenda di OAuth2 e compagnia cantando, credo che con TB ci lavorerò finché verrà supportato. Tutti gli altri client, a cominciare da MS Outlook, per me non esistono. Infatti uso come browser soltanto Firefox sin dalla versione 3, ma lo apro dentro Sandboxie, per una sicurezza praticamente assoluta, e con la conservazione del Profilo (ne ho comunque diversi e con copie di sicurezza), che viene ricopiato in Sandbox ad ogni nuova connessione, previa la cancellazione di tutte le tracce della navigazione precedente, Profilo incluso, entro Sandbox di Sandboxie. Grazie ancora per i suggerimenti e per la pazienza di aver letto fin qui. </p>",mikarav,false,0,0
