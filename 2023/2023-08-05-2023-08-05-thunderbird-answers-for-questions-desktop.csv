Migrating your Thunderbird profile can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got you covered! Instead of using the export/import method, try these steps: First, copy your profile to the flatpak profile directory, usually located at $HOME/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/cache/thunderbird/. Then, launch Thunderbird using the -P option to create a new profile and specify the path of your copied profile. Remember, you might encounter some old messages popping up – those 1970 ones – but don't fret, it's just Thunderbird catching up. If you run into any issues, you can always clean up your old profile data manually. </p>",suram080,false,2,0

Generally most of this goes on in the hidden appdata folder,  but you apparently are dissatisfied with the standard location of your operating system (appdata) and have chosen to mess up your documents with Thunderbird data.  </p><p>Personally I fail to even understand this desire to clutter up document folders with application data. </p> <blockquote> How do I combine these folders, (without losing any emails, passwords, filters, address book, calendar, and so on) so that I only have one profile folder to backup? </blockquote> <p>You can not.  Most of them are application data anyway,  not profile data. </p><p>Generally the profile folder and it's children is what you back up.  This is the folder you land in when you click on the profile show button in the Troubleshooting information on the help menu. As for a backup to be functional Thunderbird must not be running on the system  most automated backups of Thunderbird simply are either corrupt or incomplete, especially those created by backup routines that require the data to be in the documents folder. </p><p>Personally I use the backup option in the importexport tools <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> I do find it much faster to just copy and paste the appropriate folder to a backup location as required.  As most peoples contacts, calendars and mail as held on caldav, carddav and IMAP servers,  to importance of backups of this data is significantly less that is was 20 years ago.  But to what extent you have copies of data in the cloud will depend on how you have configured your Thunderbird. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Don't worry, we can definitely help you out. Sometimes, drafts might not appear where you expect them to be. To fix this, try checking the ""Local Folders"" section in Thunderbird's left-hand pane. Drafts might be saved there instead of the account-specific folders. If you still can't find them, let's try this: go to ""File"" &gt; ""New"" &gt; ""Message"", and in the top menu, select ""File"" &gt; ""Save As"" to save a new draft. This might refresh the drafts folder. If you're still having trouble, it could be due to a setting or add-on. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

The missing scrollbar in the tags menu can be a bit frustrating when you have a bunch of tags. Unfortunately, Thunderbird doesn't have a built-in scroll feature for the tags menu, but there's a workaround you can try. You can use your keyboard to navigate the tags quickly. Just press the first letter of the tag you're looking for, and it should jump to the tags starting with that letter. Also, make sure your Thunderbird is up to date, as sometimes updates bring improvements. I hope this helps you manage your tagged emails more efficiently. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

Don't worry, we can sort this out. When Thunderbird hangs or times out while sending from certain servers, it might be due to some server settings. Try these steps: Double-check your outgoing server settings for the ntworld server and make sure they match the requirements provided by your email provider. Also, ensure that any security or firewall settings aren't blocking Thunderbird's access to the server. If the issue persists, you might want to consider reaching out to your email provider's support for more specific assistance. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

You say they are apparently somewhat coy about price, this may be because they really have not yet developed the product they want to sell you in a years time. However,  Thunderbird can not replace your server as you suggest. </p><p>Thunderbird is a mail client,  so will not act as a server,  nor does the project provide an email address directly for those seeking one.  There are commercial arrangements in place where you can get an email address via mailfence or ghandi but it will cost you.  That is not necessary in my personal opinion for the average person. Free mail accounts work well except for those in business,  and even then I still get invoices from Gmail accounts. </p><p>As a general mail user, which I am guessing you are.  You are probably going to the best served by one of the free mail providers or really a couple of providers, as you have to have a password recovery email address for most of them.  The obvious choices for Australians are <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, Gmail and Yahoo because they have heard of them.  Personally I have all three along with GMX and AOL, all of them deliver what they say they will.  But I like to include GMX in the mix because unlike the US based providers. I like their privacy statement.  GMX is a subsidiary of a German company and as such is subject to German privacy laws,  some of the most strict in the world. But as I found out today you have to hold the alt key when you select to create an account with them or the pop up blocker in the browser makes a mess of the process.  I do suggest you look at them as a provider.  Not so popular in Australia,  but in Europe they are fairly well known. </p><p>In you migration you will have to consider a couple of things;   </p> <ul><li> If you existing account is configured as IMAP you will need to export any mail you wish to save as once the account goes dark with the provider the mail will be lost as it is synchronized to the mail server.  If your account is POP then that is not a consideration. </li><li> If you want your correspondents to know of your changed address,  you will need to tell them.  But do not fall foul of the SPAM laws about unauthorized contacts. <a href=""https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam</a>  Remember that using CC sends the email addresses to everyone on the mail.

However most companies do not have a reply address for email.  So you will be doing some updates over the phone or whatever for emailed bills. </li><li> Thunderbird will remove folders for an account when you remove it from account settings.
