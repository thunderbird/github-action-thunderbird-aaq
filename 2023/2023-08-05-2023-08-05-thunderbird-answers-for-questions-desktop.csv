You say they are apparently somewhat coy about price, this may be because they really have not yet developed the product they want to sell you in a years time. However,  Thunderbird can not replace your server as you suggest. </p><p>Thunderbird is a mail client,  so will not act as a server,  nor does the project provide an email address directly for those seeking one.  There are commercial arrangements in place where you can get an email address via mailfence or ghandi but it will cost you.  That is not necessary in my personal opinion for the average person. Free mail accounts work well except for those in business,  and even then I still get invoices from Gmail accounts. </p><p>As a general mail user, which I am guessing you are.  You are probably going to the best served by one of the free mail providers or really a couple of providers, as you have to have a password recovery email address for most of them.  The obvious choices for Australians are <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, Gmail and Yahoo because they have heard of them.  Personally I have all three along with GMX and AOL, all of them deliver what they say they will.  But I like to include GMX in the mix because unlike the US based providers. I like their privacy statement.  GMX is a subsidiary of a German company and as such is subject to German privacy laws,  some of the most strict in the world. But as I found out today you have to hold the alt key when you select to create an account with them or the pop up blocker in the browser makes a mess of the process.  I do suggest you look at them as a provider.  Not so popular in Australia,  but in Europe they are fairly well known. </p><p>In you migration you will have to consider a couple of things;   </p> <ul><li> If you existing account is configured as IMAP you will need to export any mail you wish to save as once the account goes dark with the provider the mail will be lost as it is synchronized to the mail server.  If your account is POP then that is not a consideration. </li><li> If you want your correspondents to know of your changed address,  you will need to tell them.  But do not fall foul of the SPAM laws about unauthorized contacts. <a href=""https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam</a>  Remember that using CC sends the email addresses to everyone on the mail.  That ""could"" cause issues. <a href=""https://www.mondaq.com/australia/privacy-protection/780826/have-i-just-breached-privacy-laws--i-did-not-use-the-bcc-email-function"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mondaq.com/australia/privacy-protection/780826/have-i-just-breached-privacy-laws--i-did-not-use-the-bcc-email-function</a> </li><li> You might want to start Replying with your new address to all mail that comes in advising on the first instance that your address going forward has changed.  However most companies do not have a reply address for email.  So you will be doing some updates over the phone or whatever for emailed bills. </li><li> Thunderbird will remove folders for an account when you remove it from account settings.  Please copy mail to Local folders before you remove the account and associated folders. </li></ul>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

This doesn't happen with previous emails in that thread or with gmail, exchange, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>, icloud, etc....   </blockquote> <p>That has been a known issue with Microsoft's various mail domain offerings as well as gmail.  Both force a copy of sent mail as it goes out through their servers.  The simple solution is to turn off Thunderbird's saving a copy in account settings. </p> <blockquote> Now, I have an issue where the pop ups for calendar notifications keep popping up non stop and either won't go away by hitting ""Submit to changes anyway"" or if they do go away, they immediately pop back up again.  115 is a big disapointment for me, it's been highly glitchy, many add ons no longer, some that should work, don't work properly, it was hyped a major upgrade and I see very little that distinguishes if from 102 in any meaningful way except some of the icons are more colorful.  Is there a way to go back to 102?  Either that or I may start using Mac Mail again due to all these bugs. </blockquote> <p>This bit I can't offer much on.  Perhaps use the <a href=""http://connect.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">feedback forum</a> linked from the help menu and let the developers know what you feel.

It just won't stay put where I put it.  I might use Moom to have it on the left two thirds of my right monitor and then it moves randomly.  Then I disabled Moom and used a window manager from Parallels tools and then it changes monitors randomly and appears on the other monitor.  No other program does this or reacts to these window managers this way.  This program is highly defective and a big disapointment. </p>",chunnel,false,0,0
