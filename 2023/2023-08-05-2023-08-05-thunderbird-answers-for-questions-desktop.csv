It just won't stay put where I put it.  I might use Moom to have it on the left two thirds of my right monitor and then it moves randomly.  Then I disabled Moom and used a window manager from Parallels tools and then it changes monitors randomly and appears on the other monitor.  No other program does this or reacts to these window managers this way.  This program is highly defective and a big disapointment. </p>",chunnel,false,0,0
