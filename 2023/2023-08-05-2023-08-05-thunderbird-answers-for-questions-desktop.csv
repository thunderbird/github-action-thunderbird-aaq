Don't worry, we can sort this out. When Thunderbird hangs or times out while sending from certain servers, it might be due to some server settings. Try these steps: Double-check your outgoing server settings for the ntworld server and make sure they match the requirements provided by your email provider. Also, ensure that any security or firewall settings aren't blocking Thunderbird's access to the server. If the issue persists, you might want to consider reaching out to your email provider's support for more specific assistance. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

The missing scrollbar in the tags menu can be a bit frustrating when you have a bunch of tags. Unfortunately, Thunderbird doesn't have a built-in scroll feature for the tags menu, but there's a workaround you can try. You can use your keyboard to navigate the tags quickly. Just press the first letter of the tag you're looking for, and it should jump to the tags starting with that letter. Also, make sure your Thunderbird is up to date, as sometimes updates bring improvements. I hope this helps you manage your tagged emails more efficiently. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

Instead of using the export/import method, try these steps: First, copy your profile to the flatpak profile directory, usually located at $HOME/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/cache/thunderbird/. Then, launch Thunderbird using the -P option to create a new profile and specify the path of your copied profile.

One thing you could try is to check the ""Local Folders"" section in Thunderbird. Sometimes, when you drag emails around, they end up there. If you don't see them there either, it's worth checking if you have any backups, perhaps on an external drive or a cloud storage.
