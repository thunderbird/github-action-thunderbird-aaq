Do we really have to use a third-party add-on to do this?

Gmail understands this is a very inconvenient way to view emails so they created 'Labels' eg: Inbox This means the email in 'All Mail' folder gets a type of flag or tag called 'Inbox' thus allowing a virtual view of the email with the 'Inbox' label to be seen in the 'Inbox'. </p><p>In Thunderbird, it uses 'folders' not 'labels'. All imap account folders synchronise with server 'labels' to show whatever is in the respective 'label'. </p><p>When you delete an email and you make sure it has gone into the gmail imap Trash' folder, gmail reads this as delete the email from the 'All Mail' folder. If you delete an email but do not put into the gmail imap Trash folder then Gmail reads this as remove the 'Inbox' label and archive original in 'All Mail'. </p><p>If you delete the 'All Mail' folder, then gmail reads this as delete the 'All Mail' folder and contents. By default it always recreates the 'All Mail' on server because it is the one and only folder that stores emails. As nothing is in the 'All Mail' folder then nothing can be displayed in any of gmail 'labels'. </p><p>When an imap account then synchronises will server 'Inbox', it displays what is in Inbox label - nothing. </p><p>Regardless of whether you download full copies or only headers, the contents of that imap folder can only display whatever is on server. </p><p>If you then try to add emails back into the imap account via replacing a backup copy whilst Thunderbird is closed, upon start up the first thing Thunderbird imap does is to synch with server - nothing on server so emails are deleted as per what is on server. </p><p>You need to import the backup mbox files into 'Local Folders' mail account. Then you  can use right click on selected emails and use 'Copy to' and select 'Inbox' - this should put emails back on the server as you are now uploading to server. It would take quite a while as there is a limit on how much you can upload to server via imap. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
