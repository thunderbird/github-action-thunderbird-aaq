Gmail understands this is a very inconvenient way to view emails so they created 'Labels' eg: Inbox This means the email in 'All Mail' folder gets a type of flag or tag called 'Inbox' thus allowing a virtual view of the email with the 'Inbox' label to be seen in the 'Inbox'. </p><p>In Thunderbird, it uses 'folders' not 'labels'. All imap account folders synchronise with server 'labels' to show whatever is in the respective 'label'. </p><p>When you delete an email and you make sure it has gone into the gmail imap Trash' folder, gmail reads this as delete the email from the 'All Mail' folder. If you delete an email but do not put into the gmail imap Trash folder then Gmail reads this as remove the 'Inbox' label and archive original in 'All Mail'. </p><p>If you delete the 'All Mail' folder, then gmail reads this as delete the 'All Mail' folder and contents. By default it always recreates the 'All Mail' on server because it is the one and only folder that stores emails. As nothing is in the 'All Mail' folder then nothing can be displayed in any of gmail 'labels'. </p><p>When an imap account then synchronises will server 'Inbox', it displays what is in Inbox label - nothing. </p><p>Regardless of whether you download full copies or only headers, the contents of that imap folder can only display whatever is on server. </p><p>If you then try to add emails back into the imap account via replacing a backup copy whilst Thunderbird is closed, upon start up the first thing Thunderbird imap does is to synch with server - nothing on server so emails are deleted as per what is on server. </p><p>You need to import the backup mbox files into 'Local Folders' mail account. Then you  can use right click on selected emails and use 'Copy to' and select 'Inbox' - this should put emails back on the server as you are now uploading to server. It would take quite a while as there is a limit on how much you can upload to server via imap. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If you want to complain (and you certainly have that right), I suggest you - be explicit in your suggestions, as many of the tens of thousands of users happen to LIKE ver 115.

For Thunderbird (or any other email client) to work, it needs to know the internet address of the server with incoming mail and the internet address of the server that processes outgoing mail. So, to create an account for gmail on Thunderbird, here are the basic steps:  - click File&gt;new&gt;existing email address - on that pane, enter the information for the account but do NOT enter the email password - click CONTINUE - Thunderbird will then search for the technical stuff for the account and, since gmail is common and popular, it has that and displays it.  Now click DONE - if all goes well, you will be presented with a screen from Google, requesting your gmail password and asking you to confirm that you will allow Thunderbird to access your email. Click 'Accept'.   - and  you're done.  </p><p>NEW TOPIC:  - when the old account is removed from service, you can remove it from thunderbird by these steps: - highlight the account to be removed - rightclick and select 'settings'  - scroll down left side bar until you see 'account actions', which is a menu.
