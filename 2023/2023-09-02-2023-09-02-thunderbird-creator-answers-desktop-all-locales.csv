I could reinstall Thunderbird hoping that will solve the problem. However before I want to backup the mailfiles. These are substantial and have  a lot of emails in many folders and over many years. It would be a disaster if I lost them. I cleaned up a lot in webmail.

It should permit users to nominate where to store these backed up folders - eg. external disc.  </p><p>On the Restore side, it would be ideal if the backed up emails in the Local folders were added, rather than replaced emails stored in the Local Folders - in case more had been added since the Backup was taken. An option for replace or ignore duplicates would be desirable. </p><p>The Backup and Restore functions should be added to the standard Thunderbird Menus - perhaps under Tools. </p><p>Would Mozilla consider adding such a function as it is an important shortcoming in the curent system? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",graeme.hurst16

Every time I create a new folder, I need to go through the same routine. Every time I download a new version of Thunderbird, all my folders are changed back to 'Threaded' and 'Correspondents' and are in Ascending date order, so I have to go through the whole process again. What I need is a simple 'global' setting in a menu, so that I can change the settings for ALL my Thunderbird folders in a simple series of clicks, without needing to go to each folder every time. Better still would be a 'once for all' fix that would prevent Thunderbird changing my settings every time I download a new version. There must be thousands of Thunderbird users who share my frustration with what is lotherwise an excellent email program. Please fix it! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",blackberrylane.co.uk

Each of my email accounts can have it own signature, customized for home, work or whatever.  Great! </p><p>But my complaint is that the signature is at the very bottom of the email, not immediately following my written message.  In other words: </p><p>Hi, Jack, </p><pre>  Thanks for your note. I'll get on this right away </pre> <p>(followed by Jack's scathing admonition of my tardiness in completing the project) Best regards, </p><pre>  Jim </pre> <p>It would be really nice to be able to insert the HTML signature with a keystroke, rather than accepting its placement at the very bottom.  As it is, I am able to highlight the entire HTML signature, Ctrl+X it to the Windows clipboard, then Ctrl+V it where I want it.  But that's an extra step.  Moreover, there are emails in which I'd rather not put the signature, which means it has to be deleted before sending.
