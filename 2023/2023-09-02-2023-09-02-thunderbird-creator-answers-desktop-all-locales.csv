My ISP wont support any third party email platforms but the tech bloke had me generate a new password. Zoho generates a password that has spaces between the groups of nombers/letters. The tech guy said not to use the spaces. </p><p>As it's a one time try with the password, I manually typed the password in. It didn't work. </p><p>I don't know if I'm missing something in my email settings or not. All the user details seem to be spread all over the place and just not one one page to view. I changed my username back to the old one, changed the server settings but I must be missing something. </p><p>Is there anyone here with experience of dealing with the zoho platform? Personally I think it's a pos but I have no other option. My emails was working fine for at least 2 years before I moved. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",kakashi

The program simply cannot find any of my profiles anymore. This is the second time that this has happened to me this year. Only my address book is still visible within the program when I click on the appropriate icon on the left-hand side of the screen and select ""All Address Books"".  </p><p>Rather than start over again and create new profiles, how can I correct this problem, i.e. easily restore my profiles? </p><p>Note: I've created a ""XXXXXXXX.Default User"" zip file using the program's internal export function, but, oddly enough, the folder that was created for this is ""0 KB"" in size. </p><p>I've also made a backup of my ""profiles"" folder, which is huge: over 9 GB in size. </p><p>I look forward to hearing from you! </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Paul </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",paulcohen
