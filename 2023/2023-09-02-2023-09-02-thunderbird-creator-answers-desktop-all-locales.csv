I'm essentially starting from scratch. When attempting to add an account, I get the following error (please see screenshot). I will pass this error on to our IT department, but I also wanted to get your thoughts on this. Many thanks in advance. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",joel.dewitt

Suddenly, only today, all my incoming Outlook emails on Thunderbird and the Outlook website are going to the Deleted Folder. Someone suggested on Microsoft Community to go to Options&gt;Mail&gt;Automatic Processing&gt;Inbox and Sweep Rules. But I can not find where any of these options are.? They suggest to look to see if a rule is set up to send messages to the Deleted Items folder. Sounds easy but if I could find in my Outlook mail  (Options) that would be great. I have also accidently deleted everything that I was keeping  in my Inbox, I went to properties, on there it suggested that the folder could be corrupt so I clicked on that to clean it up and everything disappeared!! I can't win tonight. When I try to put the emails back in the Inbox they pop back in the deleted file straight away. Thunderbird did an update this morning, maybe that is the cause. Hopefully someone can help, I have tried everything I know. I am a senior person, so you have already guessed I am not very computer savvy.

Every time I create a new folder, I need to go through the same routine. Every time I download a new version of Thunderbird, all my folders are changed back to 'Threaded' and 'Correspondents' and are in Ascending date order, so I have to go through the whole process again. What I need is a simple 'global' setting in a menu, so that I can change the settings for ALL my Thunderbird folders in a simple series of clicks, without needing to go to each folder every time. Better still would be a 'once for all' fix that would prevent Thunderbird changing my settings every time I download a new version. There must be thousands of Thunderbird users who share my frustration with what is lotherwise an excellent email program.

I'll get on this right away </pre> <p>(followed by Jack's scathing admonition of my tardiness in completing the project) Best regards, </p><pre>  Jim </pre> <p>It would be really nice to be able to insert the HTML signature with a keystroke, rather than accepting its placement at the very bottom.  As it is, I am able to highlight the entire HTML signature, Ctrl+X it to the Windows clipboard, then Ctrl+V it where I want it.  But that's an extra step.  Moreover, there are emails in which I'd rather not put the signature, which means it has to be deleted before sending.
