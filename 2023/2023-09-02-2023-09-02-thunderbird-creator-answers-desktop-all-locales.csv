It keeps saying ""authentication failed connecting to <a href=""http://server.imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">server.imap.gmail.com</a>"" . I am sure I have entered the email address and password correctly. I have tried multiple times with the same result. Any ideas?

The program simply cannot find any of my profiles anymore. This is the second time that this has happened to me this year. Only my address book is still visible within the program when I click on the appropriate icon on the left-hand side of the screen and select ""All Address Books"".  </p><p>Rather than start over again and create new profiles, how can I correct this problem, i.e. easily restore my profiles? </p><p>Note: I've created a ""XXXXXXXX.Default User"" zip file using the program's internal export function, but, oddly enough, the folder that was created for this is ""0 KB"" in size. </p><p>I've also made a backup of my ""profiles"" folder, which is huge: over 9 GB in size. </p><p>I look forward to hearing from you! </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Paul </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",paulcohen
