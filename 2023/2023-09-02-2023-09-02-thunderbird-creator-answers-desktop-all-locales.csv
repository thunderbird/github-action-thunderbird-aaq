Every time I create a new folder, I need to go through the same routine. Every time I download a new version of Thunderbird, all my folders are changed back to 'Threaded' and 'Correspondents' and are in Ascending date order, so I have to go through the whole process again. What I need is a simple 'global' setting in a menu, so that I can change the settings for ALL my Thunderbird folders in a simple series of clicks, without needing to go to each folder every time. Better still would be a 'once for all' fix that would prevent Thunderbird changing my settings every time I download a new version. There must be thousands of Thunderbird users who share my frustration with what is lotherwise an excellent email program. Please fix it! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",blackberrylane.co.uk

Each of my email accounts can have it own signature, customized for home, work or whatever.  Great! </p><p>But my complaint is that the signature is at the very bottom of the email, not immediately following my written message.  In other words: </p><p>Hi, Jack, </p><pre>  Thanks for your note. I'll get on this right away </pre> <p>(followed by Jack's scathing admonition of my tardiness in completing the project) Best regards, </p><pre>  Jim </pre> <p>It would be really nice to be able to insert the HTML signature with a keystroke, rather than accepting its placement at the very bottom.  As it is, I am able to highlight the entire HTML signature, Ctrl+X it to the Windows clipboard, then Ctrl+V it where I want it.  But that's an extra step.  Moreover, there are emails in which I'd rather not put the signature, which means it has to be deleted before sending.  Just saying... </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1601234;1601244;,Electrojim

My ISP wont support any third party email platforms but the tech bloke had me generate a new password. Zoho generates a password that has spaces between the groups of nombers/letters. The tech guy said not to use the spaces. </p><p>As it's a one time try with the password, I manually typed the password in. It didn't work. </p><p>I don't know if I'm missing something in my email settings or not. All the user details seem to be spread all over the place and just not one one page to view. I changed my username back to the old one, changed the server settings but I must be missing something. </p><p>Is there anyone here with experience of dealing with the zoho platform? Personally I think it's a pos but I have no other option. My emails was working fine for at least 2 years before I moved. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1601228;,kakashi
