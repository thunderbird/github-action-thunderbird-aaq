The problem is occurring on a Win10 system. I use POP by strong preference, and I have TB v 102.15.0 (64 bit) recently upgraded, but the problems were evident on the previous 102.14 version, not sure if previous to that one. I have Gmail set to delete emails from gmail once they have been accessed with POP.   </p><p>My Inbox in TB was very full, I deleted the 11,000+ emails and have compacted files. When the problem occurred a few weeks ago, I probably had 8,000 emails in it.  Could a crowded INBOX be a source for either or both the problems below? </p><p>Two problems that have developed fairly recently: </p><p>1)  A group of emails are visible when I check Gmail with the app on my phone, but they do not download into TB.  The first time this happened none of the trapped emails were important, but this time there are client emails. I will deal with these one at a time, but I need to know what is wrong and how to avoid this. </p><p>2)  Despite clearing the Inbox and Compacting, right now, TB will not download more than about 24 emails at a time. To get all my email from gmail, I have to repeatedly check mail. &nbsp;????  It's been true for a while that TB seems to sequester groups of emails and doesn't download everything all at once, but it would normally show that there were say, 255 emails on gmail, but would only download largish some portion of those.  I would tell it to check again and again until all are downloaded into TB.  Now, it doesn't ""see"" all the emails on gmail, it only says it sees 24 or so at a time, downloads those, and then I have to tell it to get mail again.   </p><p>[BONUS ISSUE]  3) Sometimes, even though email has been downloaded into TB, one or more emails doesn't get deleted from Gmail. </p><p>This is so confusing, and I've been limping along with it.
