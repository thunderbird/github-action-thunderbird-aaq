If Thunderbird is refusing to start, sending a message that you need to enter a Primary password, that indicates that the owner of the account put a password on Thunderbird and that must be entered before Thunderbird will allow access to accounts. Let us know if more information is needed. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
