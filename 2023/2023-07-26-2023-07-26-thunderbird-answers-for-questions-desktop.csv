I noticed the following. Unified Inbox has newest at the bottom so I checked 'Sort by' on that 'Unified Inbox' and it says 'Sort by' &gt; 'Date' &gt; 'Ascending' &gt; 'Unthreaded' I also see a load of column headers which are like a default set and not the ones I prefer to use nor displayed in the order I prefer. </p><p>Selected the mail account Inbox subfolder and I see the settings I had set up. I also see all the column in the order I prefer. Sort by' &gt; 'Date' &gt; 'Descending' &gt; 'Unthreaded' </p><p>I had to select the Unified Inbox and reset to 'Sort by' to my desired setting. But in my case this worked, Unified Inbox now has new mail at top and focus at top. </p><p>I noticed it is impossible to use the ordinary Inbox and then use column header options to apply to all 'Unified' folders regarding the column choice or the sort by view choice. It's also not possible to do this just for Unified folders. So that is something to look at as well. </p><p>So this looks like whatever is set for Sort by when using 'All', the opposite is applied to 'Unified' folders. </p><p>Did another test altering settings to replicate what you use. Set all my normal folder in 'All' view to sort by Date Ascending Unthreaded - like you. Set 'Unified' Inbox folder the same. Unselected the View &gt; Folders &gt; Unified. REstarted Thunderbird. </p><p>All my normall folders still have  Date Ascending Unthreaded Enabled the 'Unified' view Checked Unified Inbox. It has Date Ascending Unthreaded which is desired, but the focus is at the top. </p><p>I do believe I've managed to recreate the same problem as you.  This does not fix your issue, but it means I can present a bug with full instructions on how to replicate it and that's what the bug people like - good info on how to replicate. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
