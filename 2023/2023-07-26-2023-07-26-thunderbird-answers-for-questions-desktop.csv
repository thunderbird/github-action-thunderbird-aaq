All 50 attachments in each mail have the same file name, that's the problem which Thunderbird can't handle by itself (like automatically adding numbers to the file names). </p><p>Interesting, Thunderbird handles the same problem very well when I save multiple emails to files (""save asâ€¦"") and it happens that 2 or more mails have the exact same subject and time (which the file name is made of), then the second file will have ""-2"" at the end of the filename before the dot, the third ""-3"" and so on. </p><p>The reason why those attachments that I received have the same name and why the sender can't just change them is secondary. The attachments are emails forwarded as attachments, which all have the same subject thus the same file name. </p>",gregor12,false,0,0

I don't see how Gmail has anything to do with this. </p><p>No matter, you could change Thunderbird's settings so that it always asks where to save the attachments. That option is in <strong>Settings &gt; Files &amp; Attachments</strong>. When you select Save all, it will ask for a location to save those files. You will then be able to choose a different location for each message that you want to save the attachments from. For example; Message 1 with 50 attachments saved in Folder 1, Message 2's attachments in Folder 2 etc. I am assuming that the attachments in any given message have unique names. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0
