I have 'Sort by' &gt; 'Date' &gt; 'Descending' &gt; 'Unthreaded' meaning newset at top. </p><p>I switched on 'View &gt; Folders &gt; 'Unified' so it appears below 'All' folders in Folder Pane. I noticed the following. Unified Inbox has newest at the bottom so I checked 'Sort by' on that 'Unified Inbox' and it says 'Sort by' &gt; 'Date' &gt; 'Ascending' &gt; 'Unthreaded' I also see a load of column headers which are like a default set and not the ones I prefer to use nor displayed in the order I prefer. </p><p>Selected the mail account Inbox subfolder and I see the settings I had set up. I also see all the column in the order I prefer. Sort by' &gt; 'Date' &gt; 'Descending' &gt; 'Unthreaded' </p><p>I had to select the Unified Inbox and reset to 'Sort by' to my desired setting. But in my case this worked, Unified Inbox now has new mail at top and focus at top. </p><p>I noticed it is impossible to use the ordinary Inbox and then use column header options to apply to all 'Unified' folders regarding the column choice or the sort by view choice. It's also not possible to do this just for Unified folders. So that is something to look at as well. </p><p>So this looks like whatever is set for Sort by when using 'All', the opposite is applied to 'Unified' folders. </p><p>Did another test altering settings to replicate what you use. Set all my normal folder in 'All' view to sort by Date Ascending Unthreaded - like you. Set 'Unified' Inbox folder the same. Unselected the View &gt; Folders &gt; Unified. REstarted Thunderbird. </p><p>All my normall folders still have  Date Ascending Unthreaded Enabled the 'Unified' view Checked Unified Inbox. It has Date Ascending Unthreaded which is desired, but the focus is at the top. </p><p>I do believe I've managed to recreate the same problem as you.

If people think I should instead post this in its own thread, please say so. But I'm wondering if these are related issues. </p><p>Bear with me this is a little hard to explain. Used to be that whenever I opened (i.e. clicked on) an email inbox folder, it would by default pop to the newest email on the list (in my case the bottom of the list). Since the most recent update to 115.4.1 Supernova, when I click on an inbox folder for any of my email accounts, it pops to seemingly random emails in the list of emails in that folder. This means to see my newest (unread) emails, I need to click on an inbox, then manually scroll down to the newest emails every time. If I click on another folder, then click back to the first one, it pops to a different seemingly random email. If I click the date field header twice, it does move to the newest email. But again, that is an extra step I didn't used to have to perform. I seem to recall a checkbox years ago that said something like ""open to newest email"", but can't find that now.

I have deliberately set one of my folders - lets call it 'TB Support' to use 'Ascending' and it gets new mail filtered into it.  Then I select to view newest mail at bottom and then move to aload of other folders. Much later, when I got new mail in that 'TB Support' folder, I selected it and focus was still on the last email selected. There was in fact about 12 new mail which were completely hidden at the bottom and it needed me to scroll in order to see them. </p><p>In addition to the two clicks on 'Date' column header to force a sort by date which then gets focus in correct location, if you have focus in the Message List - aka selected any email in list - 'Ctrl'+'End' keys do get you to bottom of list quickly. </p><p>Until this bug is fixed it may be less stressful to sort by descending then all new mail are at the top and it words perfectly ok. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I do not see any and you referenced one from three years ago in your initial post related to version 68  The solution to which was to close the color picker.  You did not say you had done that or make any other statement as to your actions.  Your expectation that someone voluntarily trying to assist you would take the time to read a two page topic to tray and determine what ""tried all options, nothing works"" means to you is perhaps a little unr4ealistic.  I at least expect you to spend the time to say what you did,  not ask me to research what you might have done and then find later you did not do it. SO I ask ral questions that have clear and defined answers to try and determine exactly what the situation is and what you have already tried. </p><p>That mac users are a small minority of Thunderbird users, and probably also testers, does perhaps lead to more operating system interaction issues.  I do not know,  as a windows user I can not even try and replicate issues that mac users come up with.  When there are repeated reports, I email someone I know uses a mac and ask them to replicate the issue.  But without exact steps they can't and in some cases without the exact email that is being replied they still can not with exact steps.  </p><p>However in this topic I still have nothing but a bland statement as that ""Cannot change font colors on MacOS"" and a lot of personal assumptions based on the linked topic that it is related to the compose window and writing an email. &lt;/blockquote&gt; and that there are people in this forum calling others liars. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Are there?  I am not aware of that. </p><p><br> There are 20 years of bugs in <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home"" rel=""nofollow"">Bugzilla</a>,  some open, some closed and some fixed.  I would search it in many instances, particularly in relation to non windows issues as I can not repeat your steps to establish what might already have been reported as a bug,  but I have insufficient step to determine if another font bug is even related or not.  Perhaps  you might prefer to do your open searching. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I know that all the emails that I received will be re-downloaded (they are all passed through Gmail) but I think that all the emails that I have sent in the last few weeks will not be saved and will be lost - is there any way to save them and bring them into the (hopefully) fixed new install - they are on the new computer obviously?

I am using 102.14.0 (64-bit) on the new computer and the same version but 32-bit on the older one</em> </p><p>I've got an idea on this. I recall some time ago when versions in 64bit first became available, some issues occurred. In the end, the developers decided to force 64 bit to get installed in the old 32bit location. This happened to me and I was well confused and looked into it. Hence why I know what was going on at the time. But these days everything gets auto installed in expected location. </p><p>Now, you would have been using 32bit on old computer, so profile is ok with that on the old computer. The 64bit should not be a problem but it might be a problem with where it is installed on the new computer. </p><p>In Windows OS Thunderbird program gets downloaded into one of two locations depending upon whether it's a 64 or 32 bit version: For 64bit version of Thunderbird: </p> <ul><li> C:/Program Files/Mozilla Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>For 32bit version of Thunderbird: </p> <ul><li> C:/Program Files(X86)/Mozilla Thunderbird. </li></ul> <p>On your new computer, I bet 64bit got auto installed into&nbsp;: </p> <ul><li> C:/Program Files/Mozilla Thunderbird </li></ul> <p>I'm going to suggest you have the same set up as me, because both of us previously used 32bit versions. Maybe that old issue is effecting you when you try to use 64bit. </p><p>Do this: </p> <ul><li> Uninstall Thunderbird program. </li><li> Access: 'C:/Program Files(X86)' folder </li><li> Create a folder called 'Mozilla Thunderbird' </li><li> Download and install the 64bit version, BUT this time when it asks whether to use Standard or Custom - select 'Custom' </li><li> You can then choose&nbsp;: C:/Program Files(X86)/Mozilla Thunderbird folder as location to install, then continue install as normal. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
