You can easily verify where your profile is click help&gt;moretroubleshootinginformation, scroll down to profiles and click 'about:profiles' to see the exact location. To 'look' at the profile, click help&gt;moretroubleshootinginformation and scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder'. That will open the folder in Windows File Explorer and you can see the location of the profile. After confirming the real profile, I suggest - exit thunderbird (important) - copy the profile to a USB stick  - install thunderbird on new PC - use the tools&gt;import&gt;import from another machine to install the profile from USB stick. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If Thunderbird is refusing to start, sending a message that you need to enter a Primary password, that indicates that the owner of the account put a password on Thunderbird and that must be entered before Thunderbird will allow access to accounts. Let us know if more information is needed. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

At the link which david gave you - see earlier comment. You will notice an icon on the right and if you hover over it it says 'download raw file' - click on it. The 'import-export-tools-ng-14.0.0-b6-tb.xpi' file will get downloaded to computer Downloads file or where you have set up to receive downloaded files. </p><p>Then you need to get it imported into Thunderbird. Nothing has changed since the dawn of time on importing addon .xpi files.
