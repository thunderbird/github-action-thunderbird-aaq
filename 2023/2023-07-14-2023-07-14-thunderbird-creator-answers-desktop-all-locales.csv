Sono passato alla Versione 115 di Thunderbird dalla 102 ed utilizzo il Lettore di Schermo Nvda. Come è possibile, ora, riordinare le Colonne in Thunderbird, quelle dove vi è lo Stato, ad esempio, quindi anche il Pulsante per Scegliere quali Colonne Visualizzare. Sino alla precedente versione, ciò si poteva fare, non agevolmente, usando la Navigazione ad Oggetti di Nvda, oppure con un Addon di Nvda, che ora non funziona più, ma quest'ultimo è un problema dello Sviluppatore del Componente, di cui attenderò Feedbacks. Nel frattempo, ho urgenza di poter riordinare le Colonne, giacchè la voce ""Non letto"" mi viene letta immediatamente prima dell'oggetto, a me interessa avere invece prima l'Oggetto e poi il ""Non letto"", dunque dovrei scambiarle. Inoltre, quando un messaggio è stato letto, viene detto 2 volte dalla sintesi, siccome avevo nelle versioni precedenti, anche lo ""Stato"" attivato. Spero di essermi spiegato e resto a disposizione per collaborare, al meglio delle mie possibilità! Grazie a tutti! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,it,1590545;1590548;1590578;1590584;,barramaurizio68

I deleted the Thunderbird folder in the AppData&gt;Local directory, and renamed the Thunderbird folder in AppData&gt;Roaming to XThunderbird.  Then I downloaded the current Beta install file and ran the installation.  </pre> <p>Amazingly, upon opening Thunderbird Beta, all my emails and accounts were displayed and up to date (Big sigh of relief!).   </p><p>But when I open the AppData folders there are NO THUNDERBIRD folders in either Local or Roaming.
