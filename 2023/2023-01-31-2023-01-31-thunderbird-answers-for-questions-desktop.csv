I simply cancelled it for a while but gave in to the thought it was a scam request. Hopeless I know and on looking into the address/password listing I accidentally erased some of the listed email addresses. When I started seeing non working email addresses I became concerned. Fortunately I had a dream - lots of them, and remembered the large page with the opportunity of again seeing (long time no-see) email addresses at the bottom left of the email page. Today I have made some progress of re-setting email addresses  and many missing emails suddenly turned up. Not quite there yet as advanced age plays a part in diminishing skills.  </p><p>However I think I'm making progress and hope that tomorrow will see all is well. </p><p>Again apologies for wasting your time - G Davies aged and forgetful BSc MSc CEng MIMechE - at least on paper with coding and computing construction expression long long ago - best wishes </p>",gg.d1,false,0,0

Thought I was on an upward curve having responded to my dream memory and going to the email addresses at the bottom left of the ""Inbox"" column to the left of the screen and entering name, email address and using appropriate passwords then ticking on the various POP etc inputs. Thought I had succeeded BUT still no inputs to my email arrival screen. Then on attempting to send emails, getting various versions of re-enter pass words. Lots and lots and lots. The passwords I've use are those stored on my password manager. I eventually managed to track down my list of passwords on my Virgin site but no means in sight of looking at anything related to those passwords. My modem would not turn on yesterday. Thankfully did not dismantle connections because I was promised a replacement modem today. Late morning I reconnected the power input and golly the modem came on again. Replacement still  not arrived. </p><p>If I leave my computer for maybe 10 or 20 minutes or so, when I return there are lots and lots of warnings of non acceptance after trying to send emails.  I'm scared of deleting the emails and starting from scratch in case I lose existing emails related to the problem address. I can of course save all inbox emails to a third hard drive hoping to protect  those emails - must have a clear out all the way back to c2010 </p><p>Sorry to be such a nuisance.

True? How many email accounts do you have? I am assuming they are all POP?  Your reference to modems and the lengthy time indicates you may be using dialup access?  If the accounts are setup but password seems wrong, you might go to settings&gt;privacy&amp;security, click 'saved passwords', then click 'show passwords', then highlight the rows of an account (there are two rows per account) and delete them. Then click to retrieve mail and when prompted, enter the proper email. That gives Thunderbird a clean start for that account, and I think that may get an account working. If that is successful, you might repeat for other accounts. Again, my inference is that the accounts are setup, but password isn't working. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Il modo più semplice per farlo e fare una copia delle cartelle del profilo come spiegato qui -&gt; <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/profili-thunderbird#w_effettuare-una-copia-di-sicurezza-del-profilo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/profili-thunderbird#w_effettuare-una-copia-di-sicurezza-del-profilo</a> </p><p>Se non lo hai fatto, si può comunque provare un recupero ma molto dipende dal problema che è insorto e dal tipo di account che utilizzi( POP3 o IMAP). Per procedere </p> <ol><li> Fai il backup del profilo come indicato sopra </li><li> Di questo backup fai una ulteriore copia su cui fare le prove di recupero </li><li> Segui il canovaccio di questa guida -&gt; <a href=""https://radiofaro.neocities.org/kb/index/002"" rel=""nofollow"">https://radiofaro.neocities.org/kb/index/002</a> </li></ol> <blockquote>* Nel profilo individuare la cartella mail/imapmail o simile, al suo interno individuare i file mbox che contengono gli archivi di posta     * I file mbox sono file senza estensione. I loro nomi coincidono con i nomi delle cartelle predefinite di Thunderbird (in inglese): inbox (in arrivo), sent (inviate), trash (cestino), junk (spam), etc.     * Se sono state create nuove cartelle o sottocartelle, ad ognuna di esse sarà associato un nuovo file mbox con il nome della cartella stessa. Similmente se si è usata la funzione Archivia di Thunderbird per suddividere la posta per anno o mese     * Fare una copia di tutti questi file in una cartella a parte.    *  Installare poi in Thunderbird l'estensione ImportExportTools NG -&gt; <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/it/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/it/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/</a>     * Sempre in Thunderbird, sotto Cartelle locali, creare una nuova sottocartella in cui recuperare i messaggi    *  Fare click con il pulsante destro del mouse su questa cartella e seguire il menù ImportExportTools NG &gt; Importa file mbox; Indicare quindi di importare il primo dei file mbox salvati sopra     *Ripetere la procedura per tutti i file mbox elencati sopra. </blockquote> <p>In particolare se ti ricordi i nomi delle cartelle mancanti, puoi individuare i relativi file mbox ed importare solo quelli con ImportExportTools NG </p>",@next,false,0,0
