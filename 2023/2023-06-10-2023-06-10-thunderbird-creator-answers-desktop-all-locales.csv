I have set up Tbird (also v102.12.0) on an HP laptop with Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and an SDD system disk, which predictably performs much better. I have all the email accounts I need installed and running well there, but to complete the migration, I really need to transfer the TBird address book amassed over years on the desktop to the laptop. I have tried copying over the active profile on the desktop TBird installation, moving aside the current profiles for the laptop installation (with TBird shutdown), and copying the desktop profile in their place, then restarting TBird, but that didn't provide a populated address book as I'd hoped. Can anyone help me with that? All I want to achieve is to transfer the old TBird address book into the new TBird installation. Can that be done without affecting the new email accounts on the laptop installation? Many thanks ...

I am using OAuth2 in Thunderbird, which I understand qualifies as a form of modern authentication. Despite having correctly configured OAuth2 authentication in Thunderbird, I continue to face difficulties. </p><p>The error I receive when attempting to connect my Office 365 accounts to Thunderbird is: ""The STAT command did not succeed. Error getting message number and sizes. The mail server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> responded: Server Unavailable. 21"". This issue only occurs with some of my Office 365 accounts, while other similar accounts work without any problems. Specifically, on a computer with 6 configured accounts, only 2 of them experience this issue. I have searched for differences at the server level (licenses, keys, etc.) between these accounts and found none. They are identical in both client and server configuration. </p><p>It is important to note that everything was working perfectly until yesterday morning. After contacting Microsoft, I was informed that they no longer support POP, which confuses me as I understood that it should still be possible to use POP with modern authentication (OAuth2). </p><p>I am using the latest version of Thunderbird, and I have verified my authentication settings to ensure that OAuth2 is correctly set up. I have also attempted to configure my account with IMAP instead of POP, but without success. </p><p>I am seeking clarification and possible solutions to this problem.

Mail server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> responded: Server Unavailable.""  A MS tech says the server *is* available and that the problem is that they've phased out IMAP and POP (my account is set up as the latter) and all local clients must now be configured as Exchange Online. </p><p>Does this sound like a plausible explanation for why I suddenly can't connect?  FWIW, the link he sent me doesn't say IMAP and POP are deprecated.  It dealt only with authentication.  (Last year Microsoft started requiring OAuth2 instead of Basic Authentication and I changed my server settings accordingly.) </p><p>If he's right, what are my options?  Is it possible to switch server type on TB to Exchange Online?  How?  And if I did so, what would happen in terms of archiving my messages after they're downloaded and being able to specify how long they're kept on the server? </p><p>FWIW, I tried deleting my password, restarting, and reentering PW when asked as well as trying other security settings. Also, I have TB on two computers (both running Windows 10), and the same problem now shows up on both.  One of them was just updated to v. 102.12.0, while the other still has the previous version. </p><p>Thanks for any help you may be able to offer. </p><p>EDITED TO ADD:  A second MS tech contradicted the first one and said IMAP and POP protocols are still fine to use.  That's a relief, but it also leaves me wondering whether there's anything I should do other than wait and hope the problem is on the server side and will eventually be resolved. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1584860;,BlebNevus1015
