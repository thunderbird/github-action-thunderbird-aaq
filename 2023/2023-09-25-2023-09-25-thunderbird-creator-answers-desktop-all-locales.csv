On MacOS I have MailSteward which keeps years of email archive from 5 accounts. What I normally do is export mail from an account into a mbox file, load the data into MailSteward and then delete the mail from the account (keeping only the last couple of months) - I am doing this more or less at the beginning of every calendar year, just to keep email accounts not too large. </p><p>I can export the existing data (which is several GB of data - email and attachments) back out to mbox files - to be imported to Thunderbird. As far as I have understood  I can import those mbox files into local folder in Thunderbird. </p><p>Now the question: how is Thunderbird behaving with these archives while using it on ""active"" email accounts? Does it become unusable or does it work normally while only using the ""active"" accounts until I open a local folder to search for some old email? Anyone using Thunderbird with both (large) archive and normal, active email accounts? </p><p>Thanks for your insights.

From... Subject... Etc.) more visually distinct.  As is, they look exactly the same as a read message -- same font, not bold, no color, etc.  I support some very inexperienced Thunderbird users, and they have a distressing tendency of accidentally clicking on a column heading, which changes the email-list's sort order -- and often confuses them.  I'm thinking that if the column headings had a background color tint (the specific color doesn't matter), it would make it more obvious that the heading row is not just another message.  Taking the idea one step further, if the color for the selected sort-order column was a darker shade than the other columns, it might even be more obvious that the headings are in fact a *control*, not just another read message. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1605969;1605972;,gfwalker
