Unfortunately, that email is 4.9 Gb in size! I have moved a whole bunch of emails (several thousand) out of my inbox into an subfolder of Archives and then compacted the inbox folder, but seems to have made no difference at all. So, how do I decrease the size of that inbox file? I just downloaded the latest TB 115 onto my Windows 10 laptop.

I successfully configured Thunderbird to work with their Google some years ago. Recently I have had numerous problems and now it barely works.  </p><p>Sending: If I send a test message with a few words it sends. But any real message does not send and I get an error message about unable to compact folders such as inbox. Another error message is, Cannot save a draft.  </p><p>Receiving: for the last three days I can receive nothing. When I was still able to receive messages would show in the inbox but would take minutes to display the contents of the message.  </p><p>I can access both receive and send on my iPad using the same Telus email address.  </p><p>I think I had an update of Thunderbird in this same time period. Also I have uninstalled a number of large programs. Also moved many large files to an external hard drive. Also moved many messages from my Inbox to trash and emptied trash </p><p>Suggestions please </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",simmonsm
