When attempting to print a message that should fit on a single page, the email program prints many more pages, leaving about 80% of each page blank where the text should be. I have attached an example in the sent attachments where one printed page is turned into multiple printed pages. I've tried various methods such as changing the text encoding and scaling, but nothing seems to help. Please assist. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",99blazejwozniak99

From... Subject... Etc.) more visually distinct.  As is, they look exactly the same as a read message -- same font, not bold, no color, etc.  I support some very inexperienced Thunderbird users, and they have a distressing tendency of accidentally clicking on a column heading, which changes the email-list's sort order -- and often confuses them.  I'm thinking that if the column headings had a background color tint (the specific color doesn't matter), it would make it more obvious that the heading row is not just another message.  Taking the idea one step further, if the color for the selected sort-order column was a darker shade than the other columns, it might even be more obvious that the headings are in fact a *control*, not just another read message. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1605969;1605972;,gfwalker

And both the folders have same mails. </p><p>So: Inbox shows 1/2 (one unread, total 2 messages) All mail also shows 1/2 (one unread, total 2 messages) </p><p>As I said earlier, I mostly use Keyboard shortcuts. </p> <ol><li> I open Inbox. </li><li> And read first message (with subject: This is new but unimportant message). </li><li> I find unimportant. So I press 'Del' key to delete that message </li><li> Then I immediately press 'n' to move to next unread message </li><li> Now thunderbird takes me to All Mail folder of GMail </li><li> Since All Mail still does not know that 1st email was deleted from Inbox folder, it shows me same email again in All Mail folder. </li><li> So I press 'Del' key to delete that message (which was already deleted from Inbox but not synced with All mail) </li><li> But by the time I press 'Del' key the thunderbird synced the All Mail folder, and on its own deleted the first message and focus was dropped on 2nd email. </li><li> Now since focus was dropped on 2nd (important) email while I was pressing the Del key, instead of deleting first unimportant email, I accidentally deleted 2nd important email without realizing what happened. (Important message is gone without me realizing) </li><li> This issue was not there earlier (I believe before Supernova). Earlier focus did not fall on 2nd email automatically but thunderbird completely de-focused the pane. So even if I press Del key it would not delete anything. </li></ol> <p>I have had many instances of important email going to Trash because of this newly introduced bug. Noticing mostly after Supernova was introduced. </p><p>In above example there were just 2 emails, so one would immediately notice that How come all emails vanished when I just deleted one email. </p><p>But in reality I have hundreds of new messages and would not realize that Del key was pressed on an important email because thunderbird changed the focus. </p><p>Please look in to the bug and resolve </p><p>Thank you </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",amish

Unfortunately, that email is 4.9 Gb in size! I have moved a whole bunch of emails (several thousand) out of my inbox into an subfolder of Archives and then compacted the inbox folder, but seems to have made no difference at all. So, how do I decrease the size of that inbox file? I just downloaded the latest TB 115 onto my Windows 10 laptop.
