Despite popular ideas to the contrary computers remain highly technical tools and are not even now in the same category as an old DVD player that you can expect to ""just work"".  Despite the fact they often did not with the new Disney releases. Interestingly the advances in monitor sizes and hence the size of pixels (which is the basis of Thunderbird scaling) means that occasionally the software gets it wrong.  This is not really to be unexpected when it required a cooperative interaction between Thunderbird, the operating system and a video driver usually written by the video card manufacturer to work flawlessly. </p><p>I am guessing you got an update and your font is apparently smaller.  Where I do not know,  because you forgot to mention that part,  so I will guess it is in the message lists and folder names. </p><p>Go to the View menu (in V102). Click on the plus sign on that menu  Go to the menu and click on the plus sign beside the word Font (in V115) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

That image looks to me like both the unified view and the all folders view are both enabled. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0
