BUT, just below the Local Folder (in the tree) was the Mail folder you see in the screenshot. AND, it had all of my 20+ gigs of mail folders. So, I simply dragged that Mail folder to the 'oiwuy5s.default-release' folder. When I did that, the computer asked if I wanted to merge the files, and I said YES. Then when I opened Thunderbird again, all of my mail folders (over 9000) were there.

I remembered that Yahoo categorizes some messages as spam, and when it does, Thunderbird will not download them. I tried to get Yahoo to stop doing that and/or Thunderbird to download those messages, since many are not actually spam, but have been unable to figure out a way to do that. So it made me wonder if perhaps the bug is related to that interface. Then I remembered that I routinely tell Yahoo to block addresses that are legitimately spam, and I wondered if that could be involved in the problem too. So I went to my account on Yahoo and deleted all the addresses I had stored as blocked. Then I opened Thunderbird, entered my password yet again, and this time the messages downloaded. Time will tell if this is a permanent solution or just a temporary one, similar to the work around others have found by moving messages in and out of the inbox on Yahoo. </p>",AnMarieJ,false,0,0

I was scanning through messages here last night and noticed there is at least one more post about Frontiernet and several more about AT&amp;T/Yahoo.

Thursday I got mail more normally on Thunderbird.  Friday it was sporadic.  Yesterday I was able to download a FEW emails.  This morning, nothing.

I've deleted all old download files, webmail files, any older file/cache that even remotely refers to TB or mozilla. When the ""new"" TB file loads up it looks exactly like the deleted version up to and including any emails or address's. The new program should, I think, come in blank, new and requiring initial account setup. It doesn't. </blockquote> <p>Reinstalling the program itself rarely fixes anything because the problem usually has nothing to do with the program but is related to your profile data which includes everything to do with the accounts. </p><p>When the new TB was started - before you could perform any set up an account  - it shows all your original emails account etc  - WHY because all the profile data is not stored in the same location as the program for very obvious reasons and it seems you did not delete it. </p><p>If anyone has a connection problem regarding a pop mail account then are are a couple of things that frequently cause download issues. </p><p>1. Account Settings are not up to date. Do not use old insecure server settings when more secure settings are available. </p><p>2. Anything to do with 'Passwords' for accounts that use a Yahoo server must set up 2FA and generate an app specific password to use in Thunderbird. This does not apply if anyone is using Auhentication Method: Oauth. But if using Authentication Method: Normal Password' then you need to use an app generated password and this applies to both incoming and outgoing smtp server settings.

Pop accounts do have limits on number of emails they can store on server. Reach that limit and suddenly you cannot send or cannot receive emails until emails are deleted off the server via webmail. Meaning if you delete a few old emails via webmail account then suddenly it starts working again, but not for long. In webmail account perform a serious major deletion of all your old emails. This problem particulary effects POP mail accounts because they do not get offered as much space as IMAP and people forget to delete old mail from webmail accounts, they tend to download and leave copy on server. </p><p>4. Sometimes a blockage occurs due to a bad email. Usually fixed by emptying the webmail server Spam folder or access webmail Inbox - read and move to another foler or delete the oldest email which has not been downloaded to Pop account. </p><p>5. Anti-Virus products intervening downloads, scanning etc and causing non responsive issues so server times out or they think an email is no good so they end up trying to fix a file not understanding it may contain hundreds of emails. Basic rule do not let any AV mess around with your storage of mail.  </p><p>Please note: Thunderbird does not show remote content by default for a good reason. Do not be conned by emails that tempt you to clickon stuff which has a different link than it seems or open any attachment because you are curious. Any bad email will not cause a problem providing you do not start trying to be curious about attachments or randomly start clicking on links. Simply delete the email and then compact the folder and email is gone - zapped and does not need to 'fixed' by any AV.  If you like using a AV to scan incoming documents which is a reasonable function, then do not let AV scan profile folders in scheduled scans and set up AV to ask what to do - never fix anything automatically until you know what it's fixing. Never let it fix anything to do with Thunderbird. There are other ways of dealing with it which are just as easy and less risky of losing emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

The robot gave detailed instructions and the new secure password worked.  Some other documentation on AT&amp;T's server said that they recently changed to requiring a secure password for mail accounts and specifically mentioned Thunderbird as not being able to handle secure passwords.  But the secure password solved my Thunderbird not getting email problems.  Hope it lasts.  The secure password shows up in my Thunderbird passwords for my <a href=""http://login.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.yahoo.com</a>  So if you get a secure password, just enter it when Thunderbird asks for your password.

Third (still taking things one at a time), If you right-click beside Get Messages and choose Customize and slide a Flexible Space up to the right of Get Messages, that should move Get Messages back to where you want it. If not, try (in that Customize window) moving Get Messages all the way to the left. </p><p>Fourth, I use Cards view instead of the Table view you're using, and I don't use the Message Pane, because I have my TBird set to open messages in a new Tab, not at the bottom of the message list.

Finally, in order to fill out the Unified Toolbar (Delete, Write, Reply, etc.), right-click next to Get Messages, choose Customize and drag the elements you want up into that bar in the order you want and with optional flexible spaces between items as you wish.

We will probably agree but it is not germane to a support topic. </p><p>Now to address the last topic first.  Downgrading is perhaps the worst thing you can do.

I have been hanging around these support forum for more than a decade,  and my observation is the vast majority of ""utter failures"" to function post update actually have nothing to do with Thunderbird and everything to do with security software.  Primarily Antivirus software firewall, antivirus scanners and sometimes VPN's.   a simple test of their involvement is to restart Thunderbird and then the operating system in troubleshooting mode/ safe mode.  The Thunderbird troubleshooting mode is the quickest and easiest, and primarily exudes rogue add-ons that have caused issues post update.  Unfortunately this also includes components ""injected"" into Thunderbird from security software.  But it is a rather important first step.  The operating system safe mode is more time consuming,  but unfortunately is about the only way to get a clean benchmark against which to determine if the problem is Thunderbird or other software. </p> <ul><li>Restart Thunderbird with add-ons disabled (Thunderbird Safe Mode). On the Help menu, click on ""Restart with Add-ons Disabled"". If Thunderbird works like normal, there is an Add-on or Theme interfering with normal operations.
