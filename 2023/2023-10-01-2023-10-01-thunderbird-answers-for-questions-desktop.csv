IN the screenshot you see the folder Player_A-J, and at the time I took the screenshot, there were 4955 unread emails. Now there are 13163 -and counting. You see, Player_A-J is the main folder, and inside that folder are dozens of sub-folders, and inside those sub-folder are the individual folders of dozens of customers. The unread emails are scattered throughout literally thousands of customer folders (approximately 9000). Here's just one example of a partial list of customers with the first name David,  and this is just for DavidD-Debra. Right now, the only way to get the messages Read is to right-click and select Mark Folder Read. It could take weeks, if not longer, to do that. </p>",tuttleja,false,0,0

HOWEVER, that's not the way the directory looked ten minutes ago. Ten minutes ago, there was another Mail folder and it had the Local Folder under it. BUT, just below the Local Folder (in the tree) was the Mail folder you see in the screenshot. AND, it had all of my 20+ gigs of mail folders. So, I simply dragged that Mail folder to the 'oiwuy5s.default-release' folder. When I did that, the computer asked if I wanted to merge the files, and I said YES. Then when I opened Thunderbird again, all of my mail folders (over 9000) were there. (There was lots of other Local Folders and Imported folders, but I deleted all of them until all I had left were the right ones.  </p><p>Now the only thing I'm wondering is, Can I get rid of some of those 'smart mailboxes'?

Despite popular ideas to the contrary computers remain highly technical tools and are not even now in the same category as an old DVD player that you can expect to ""just work"".  Despite the fact they often did not with the new Disney releases. Interestingly the advances in monitor sizes and hence the size of pixels (which is the basis of Thunderbird scaling) means that occasionally the software gets it wrong.  This is not really to be unexpected when it required a cooperative interaction between Thunderbird, the operating system and a video driver usually written by the video card manufacturer to work flawlessly. </p><p>I am guessing you got an update and your font is apparently smaller.
