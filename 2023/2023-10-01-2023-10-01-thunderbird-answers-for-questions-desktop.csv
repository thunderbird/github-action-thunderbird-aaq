Despite popular ideas to the contrary computers remain highly technical tools and are not even now in the same category as an old DVD player that you can expect to ""just work"".  Despite the fact they often did not with the new Disney releases. Interestingly the advances in monitor sizes and hence the size of pixels (which is the basis of Thunderbird scaling) means that occasionally the software gets it wrong.  This is not really to be unexpected when it required a cooperative interaction between Thunderbird, the operating system and a video driver usually written by the video card manufacturer to work flawlessly. </p><p>I am guessing you got an update and your font is apparently smaller.

So it made me wonder if perhaps the bug is related to that interface. Then I remembered that I routinely tell Yahoo to block addresses that are legitimately spam, and I wondered if that could be involved in the problem too. So I went to my account on Yahoo and deleted all the addresses I had stored as blocked. Then I opened Thunderbird, entered my password yet again, and this time the messages downloaded.

Thursday I got mail more normally on Thunderbird.  Friday it was sporadic.  Yesterday I was able to download a FEW emails.  This morning, nothing.

It is possible to use ""OAuth2"" as an incoming server setting.  &gt; - However, TB DOES NOT OFFER A SETTING OF OAuth2 for outgoing emails for people entering them manually. (It does recognize OAuth2 outgoing when TB detects automatically. But one can only use auto-detect if setting up a new email account, not to change an existing email account.) [My outgoing email works with the ""normal password"" setting that was in place previously.] </p><p>It worked for me - hope this helps! </p>",dnthunder,false,0,0

I've deleted all old download files, webmail files, any older file/cache that even remotely refers to TB or mozilla. When the ""new"" TB file loads up it looks exactly like the deleted version up to and including any emails or address's. The new program should, I think, come in blank, new and requiring initial account setup. It doesn't. </blockquote> <p>Reinstalling the program itself rarely fixes anything because the problem usually has nothing to do with the program but is related to your profile data which includes everything to do with the accounts. </p><p>When the new TB was started - before you could perform any set up an account  - it shows all your original emails account etc  - WHY because all the profile data is not stored in the same location as the program for very obvious reasons and it seems you did not delete it. </p><p>If anyone has a connection problem regarding a pop mail account then are are a couple of things that frequently cause download issues. </p><p>1. Account Settings are not up to date. Do not use old insecure server settings when more secure settings are available. </p><p>2. Anything to do with 'Passwords' for accounts that use a Yahoo server must set up 2FA and generate an app specific password to use in Thunderbird. This does not apply if anyone is using Auhentication Method: Oauth. But if using Authentication Method: Normal Password' then you need to use an app generated password and this applies to both incoming and outgoing smtp server settings.

Pop accounts do have limits on number of emails they can store on server. Reach that limit and suddenly you cannot send or cannot receive emails until emails are deleted off the server via webmail. Meaning if you delete a few old emails via webmail account then suddenly it starts working again, but not for long. In webmail account perform a serious major deletion of all your old emails. This problem particulary effects POP mail accounts because they do not get offered as much space as IMAP and people forget to delete old mail from webmail accounts, they tend to download and leave copy on server. </p><p>4. Sometimes a blockage occurs due to a bad email. Usually fixed by emptying the webmail server Spam folder or access webmail Inbox - read and move to another foler or delete the oldest email which has not been downloaded to Pop account. </p><p>5. Anti-Virus products intervening downloads, scanning etc and causing non responsive issues so server times out or they think an email is no good so they end up trying to fix a file not understanding it may contain hundreds of emails. Basic rule do not let any AV mess around with your storage of mail.  </p><p>Please note: Thunderbird does not show remote content by default for a good reason. Do not be conned by emails that tempt you to clickon stuff which has a different link than it seems or open any attachment because you are curious. Any bad email will not cause a problem providing you do not start trying to be curious about attachments or randomly start clicking on links. Simply delete the email and then compact the folder and email is gone - zapped and does not need to 'fixed' by any AV.  If you like using a AV to scan incoming documents which is a reasonable function, then do not let AV scan profile folders in scheduled scans and set up AV to ask what to do - never fix anything automatically until you know what it's fixing. Never let it fix anything to do with Thunderbird. There are other ways of dealing with it which are just as easy and less risky of losing emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That's responsible for the colours and a number of other things you see in my shot. Second, I get rid of that huge Search space-hog by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; way down to Indexing &gt; uncheck Enable Global Search. Third (still taking things one at a time), If you right-click beside Get Messages and choose Customize and slide a Flexible Space up to the right of Get Messages, that should move Get Messages back to where you want it. If not, try (in that Customize window) moving Get Messages all the way to the left. </p><p>Fourth, I use Cards view instead of the Table view you're using, and I don't use the Message Pane, because I have my TBird set to open messages in a new Tab, not at the bottom of the message list. That means, of course, that I can't see the message list when I have an open message, but I'm fine with that. </p><p>I haven't ventured into a discussion of the use of CSS here, but if you are curious about any element of what you see in my screenshot, please just ask, and I'll do my best to answer as clearly as possible. It's not complicated, but it's complex -- by which I mean that it's not difficult (complicated) to use CSS, but it has many different bits and pieces (it's complex); it ain't a one-switch (simple) thing. </p><p>Please come back with  a report on what you've done, if anything, in my first four points above, and post an ""After""  shot if you wish. No hurry. </p>",danawilson001,false,1,0

Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; waaaay down to Indexing, and UNcheck Enable. That should remove the big white bar blob. In order to have the Unified Toolbar on a line of its own, without the minimize, maximize, and Exit buttons in that line, you have to have the Title bar. Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Language &amp; Appearance, Window Layout, and UNcheck Hide system title bar. Finally, in order to fill out the Unified Toolbar (Delete, Write, Reply, etc.), right-click next to Get Messages, choose Customize and drag the elements you want up into that bar in the order you want and with optional flexible spaces between items as you wish. I use a flexible space between Get Messages and Write, and another to the right of Print to keep the other buttons more or less centered. Give all that a try, and please come back and report your successes and problems, if any. Oh, and screenshots are always a big help when you have probs. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

I did play around some, and learned one thing. To the left of the new blue New Message button there is a tiny icon that looks like a cloud with a down arrow. This a Get Messages button.

At least I hope so as this is a support forum,  not an appropriate location for feedback.  Feedback needs to be directed here <a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://connect.mozilla.org/</a> </p><p>I don't like supernova so just don't bother telling me what you think of it.  We will probably agree but it is not germane to a support topic. </p><p>Now to address the last topic first.  Downgrading is perhaps the worst thing you can do.  It almost guarantees you will loose data of some sort because the profile data storage formats have changed in the new release however we can work towards making the new release at least usable. </p><p>Unfortunately I have to ask you for information as you initial post,  whilst containing plenty if invective and emotion,  contains very little useful information from a diagnostic perspective. </p><p>So lets just back up.  I have been hanging around these support forum for more than a decade,  and my observation is the vast majority of ""utter failures"" to function post update actually have nothing to do with Thunderbird and everything to do with security software.  Primarily Antivirus software firewall, antivirus scanners and sometimes VPN's.   a simple test of their involvement is to restart Thunderbird and then the operating system in troubleshooting mode/ safe mode.  The Thunderbird troubleshooting mode is the quickest and easiest, and primarily exudes rogue add-ons that have caused issues post update.  Unfortunately this also includes components ""injected"" into Thunderbird from security software.  But it is a rather important first step.  The operating system safe mode is more time consuming,  but unfortunately is about the only way to get a clean benchmark against which to determine if the problem is Thunderbird or other software. </p> <ul><li>Restart Thunderbird with add-ons disabled (Thunderbird Safe Mode). On the Help menu, click on ""Restart with Add-ons Disabled"". If Thunderbird works like normal, there is an Add-on or Theme interfering with normal operations. You will need to re-enable add-ons one at a time until you locate the offender. </li><li>Restart the operating system in <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_mode"" rel=""nofollow"">safe mode with Networking</a></strong>.
