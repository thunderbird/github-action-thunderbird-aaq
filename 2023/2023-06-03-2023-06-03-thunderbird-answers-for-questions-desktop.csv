I can understand why this was not removed in the uninstall process. Anyway to make a long story short&nbsp;: the reinstall of TB was ultimately successful and it recovered all the folders and sub folders. Phew! So I learned that the folder arrangements are not part of TB setup but belong the ISP.  So all's well that ends well - and I learnt more esoteric information that I might put to good use one day.  Thank you Mozilla Thunderbird - an excellent product indeed. </p>,13pgus,false,0,0
