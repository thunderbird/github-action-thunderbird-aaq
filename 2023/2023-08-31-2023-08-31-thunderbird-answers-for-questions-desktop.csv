It sounds like the 'popstate.dat' file got deleted or renamed or was corrupted and  a new one created. </p><p>'popstate.dat' file keeps a record of all emails download so it does not download again. In your case, it sounds like a new one was created for some unknown reason and therefore Thunderbird had no knowledge on what had been previously download. It contacted server Inbox and downloaded everything that was in the server Inbox. </p><p>This would mean you see emails you had moved to other folders or deleted and never deleted off the server etc. </p><p>One of the main reasons for a popstate.dat file being recreated is caused by the Anti-Virus program. Maybe your anti-virus had tried to scan the 'popstate.dat' file and tried to fix it and ended up corrupting it or deleted it. </p><p>I have set my Anti-Virus to never scan the Thunderbird profile folders or it's files etc. I have never had a problem. </p><p>In pop account, Account Settings &gt; Server Settings have you selected to delete off server when you delete emails? Do you compact the Inbox on a regular basis? Sometimes I've discovered you need to do that before it is properly removed off server. </p><p>Another method which is useful is to logon to webmail account and create a folder, then move all emails which have been downloaded out of the Inbox and into that newly created folder. This means if you get an issue with 'popstate.dat', it will not download all those emails because they are not in the Inbox. It also means if you need to get a full download for some reason, you can put emails back in Inbox, delete the popstate.dat file (must exit Thunderbird before you do that) and get a fresh download. </p><p>This will not help you sort out stuff but it will help to prevent an unwanted mass download if some thing goes wrong in the future. </p><p>The popstate.dat file is stored in the pop mail account name folder in profile: </p> <ul><li> C://Users/&lt;User name&gt;/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/&lt;profile name&gt;/Mail/&lt;pop account name&gt; </li></ul> <p>You could check that location to see if there is more than one 'popstate.dat' file, maybe one with a number. Example image below. </p><p>You could also check your Anti-Virus to see if it quarrantined anything. Although if it tried to do something to that popstate.dat file, it would have just got corrupted. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

You do not need to create any mail accounts anywhere.  You are wanting to use your old 'Thunderbird' profile folder.

The results are generally the same but I have more information. </p><p>When I open TB without connecting to the Internet, I can see the following tabs: Outbox - Local folders lists:  Inbox, Junk, trash and other folders.   All are empty, No other folders are listed. </p><p>Write:  Brings up a blank message form and on the left are my address books.  </p><p>Account Settings:  lots of setting for Default identity.   These could only have come from the profile copied to appdata. </p><p>Setting:  general, language and appearance.  Seem to be identical. </p><p>The above information (address books, settings, etc) had to have come from the Profile.   I have made and tried more than one copy of the profile.  Same results. </p><p>But I have none of my email folders, with folders within. </p><p>I have gotten the same results from making new copies of the profile and transferring it to the new computer.   I have checked the name and size of the original copy of the profile with the profile I copied into the new AppData profile. Original on old computer:  438 GB   628 files   36 folders copied into appdata on target computer  438 GB   603 files   36 folders      Difference of 25 files. The profile name was the same. </p><p>I have previously made a new profile by making minor changes and then saving that profile.  Did not compare the sizes but got the same results on the target computer. </p><p>What I call Local mail is all the folders I would have made to file all my email moved from the inbox, all the attachments, sent mail, and contents, not just headings.   And there were many folders, within folders, within folders etc.   Are their limits I could have exceeded? </p><p>To make a file of 438 GB they must be included in the profile file.  But where are they and how to I show them on the target computer. </p><p>The target computer has almost nothing installed except all the junk that comes with Windows 10, no additional security, only some dell programs and Firefox, my browser of choice. Could any of MS's security programs cause the problem? </p><p>I want to rebuild the computer where my current Thunderbird is running.  But before deleting it, I want to be sure it is working on another computer. I and Dell have run diagnostics on the target computer and find nothing wrong with the hardware.  They can't assist me with Thunderbird. </p><p>In this process I have reinstalled windows and limited my installations to the above to make the problem clearer. </p><p>Version numbers:   I downloaded and installed Version 102.15.0 from the Thunderbird site (archives) to match the version currently running on my original computer. On my computer it says I am ""up to date"". I see that you currently are only downloading 115.2.0.  </p><p>It appears that I can not upgrade my original Thunderbird files to 115.2.0 .  If I did install the new version, would it accept the profile file from a 102.15.0  installation? </p><p>Thank you for your help.  What would you suggest I do (try) at this point? </p>",Renders,false,0,0
