I own a new domain name that ends in .Agency. I use Gmail because it works so well, and I've been told I can still use it (getting my mail through Thunderbird) with a non-gmail domain. But everytime I go to gmail to set it up, it wants me to confirm that it's me using the new address. Except that when I try to use it, Google doesn't recognize it and asks me to set it up... which I do, and get asked by gmail to conform the new address which I can't because Google doesn't recognize it. Vicious circle. May I please ask... a) can I use my own domain name to set up mail through gmail? b) if so, is there any way around the identity check problem?   c) would it be easier if I set up a new gmail account and simply changed the name of it after I have it, if that's possible? d) what else can I do? Many thanks. I appreciate you for helping me. Best/ JR </p>",jr40,false,0,0
