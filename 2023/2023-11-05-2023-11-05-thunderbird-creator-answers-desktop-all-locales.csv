The problem is that I send myself emails with reminders and other information that I want to access later.  Now, whenever I send myself an email, it ends in Junk. I made sure my email address is in all of the address/contacts lists on Thunderbird. Every time emails from my own address end up in Junk, I use shift+J to mark them ""not junk"". I have done this at least a 100 times for numerous messages. I disabled junk processing, restarted, delete the junk folder, re-enable junk processing, start thunderbird again.  How can I remove my own email address from the Junk filter? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1616150;,RML_Seattle

I have tried to repair the folders. But no change.  It was OK at first but now its irritating.  </p><p>I think it happens after I have had new mail in a folder. As if it looses its place. I just tested that, and going to the folder and back was fine, new mail came in and it was showing emails from 2021.

Almost every day I delete an email from my inbox by right-clicking and selecting delete from the drop-down. Maybe the chain is complete, quite often it's something suspicious that has slipped by the spam filters and I simply do not want to open it, sometimes it's a delivery company telling me that my parcel has arrived, which I already know. It is always a simple operation and I carry on with my activities. Now however, when I do this, the inbox resets to the very beginning, to the first email that I did not delete, back in 2010 when I first became a user, and I have to scroll through 13 years to get back to today. </p><p>Please fix it, quickly.
