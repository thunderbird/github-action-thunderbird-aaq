The problem is that I send myself emails with reminders and other information that I want to access later.  Now, whenever I send myself an email, it ends in Junk. I made sure my email address is in all of the address/contacts lists on Thunderbird. Every time emails from my own address end up in Junk, I use shift+J to mark them ""not junk"". I have done this at least a 100 times for numerous messages. I disabled junk processing, restarted, delete the junk folder, re-enable junk processing, start thunderbird again.  How can I remove my own email address from the Junk filter? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",RML_Seattle

I think the best way to show you is with the screen shot. I went back to this folder, and the bar on the right is not at the bottom.  Some times it is, sometimes not. I have tried to repair the folders. But no change.  It was OK at first but now its irritating.  </p><p>I think it happens after I have had new mail in a folder. As if it looses its place. I just tested that, and going to the folder and back was fine, new mail came in and it was showing emails from 2021. But not everytime! </p><p>Any suggestions please?  </p><p>Rupert </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rupert.bowling
