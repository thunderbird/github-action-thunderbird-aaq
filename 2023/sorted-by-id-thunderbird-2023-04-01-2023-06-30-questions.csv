I've used TBird for decades but this was never as important as it has become. Anyway, I have about a half-dozen filters. Each of them contains multiple addresses and I've clicked to match ANY of the following. Each is set to mark the message as NOT junk and send it to a specified folder.  </p><p>In all cases, I've checked to apply the filter when MANUALLY RUN and GETTING NEW MAIL . Next to the latter, I've chosen FILTER BEFORE JUNK CLASSIFICATION. But now I'm wondering whether I actually understand this last part.  </p><p>I'm wondering because I set up a FINAL filter to mark a message from every sender who is NOT in my personal address book OR in collected addresses as JUNK and send the message to the junk folder. Further, I've set this to execute BEFORE junk classification.  </p><p>But virtually all of my mail is getting branded as junk and going to the junk folder. That is, mail from a person who is in my personal address book AND is listed in a previous filter is STILL going to junk. So am I misunderstanding just what ""filter before [after] junk classification"" really means? I assumed (famous last words) that the filter would be applied before TBird's own heuristic (?) operation. Or is that final filter my problem? When I disable that, I get some improvement. Of course, it's hard to test every variable in a short period of time.  </p><p>What am I missing here?

For the past few years I've been accessing it via webmail. The webmail has been getting harder to work with in recent months, and I finally decided to go for the client route. I went for Thunderbird as I used to use it a few years ago, I'm a fan. </p><p>I wanted this account configured for IMAP, as the emails aren't mine. The next person in my position needs to access them, so the syncing to webmail was the obvious best option. </p><p>Version 102.9.1. Windows 10 64 bit. </p><p>It has been more than a week, and Thunderbird still seems to be syncing with the server. There is always a message like: abc@xyz.com: Downloading message 79 of 60 in <em>Folder Name</em> at the bottom. It jumps around a bit between folders, it is often nonsensical (79 of 60 for example), and it has been in this state for more than a week. New emails arrive in the inbox just fine. It just seems odd, should I just try to wait it out? Or is it in some sort of infinte loop. The email account is not huge, I don't know how big, but call it 30 folders, maybe on average 60-70 emails per folder... nothing compared to some users. </p><p>What's really scaring me, is that the emails are now all screwed up in my webmail. A couple folders seem blank, and some folders have half the messages that only say ""No Subject"" I can tell there is an attachment, I can see the size of the email (600kB for example). But I can't see a sender, I can't see the real subject, and if I click on the message body I get nothing (image attached). It seems like the emails that are in ""no subject"" state change, I'm assuming this changes as Thunderbird continues to work on it. So unfortunately I can't even fall back on webmail right now. I'm kind of stuck.  </p><p>So far I'm just hoping that Thunderbird eventually finishes syncing, and at that time all of the emails in my webmail will be rebuilt. Is that a viable strategy? Or should I be taking steps to do something else. </p><p>The webmail/mailhost is <a href=""http://easyhosting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">easyhosting.com</a> if that's interesting to anyone. </p><p>Thank you for your time. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1574734;1574761;1575133;1575658;1575844;1575984;1576536;,kraher99

Please check the password and verify the 'Authentication method' in 'Account Settings | Outgoing server (SMTP)"" The authentication method is ""Normal password"" so I tried the password associated with this account (I have 4 email accounts) at GD, this did not work. Since OL is a Microsoft product, I also tried the password associated with my MS account, to no avail either. Finally, I get the TP message: ""Server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> has disconnected. The server may have have gone down or there may be a network problem."" </p><p>So I did the following: I called GoDaddy and after a lengthy discussion, was finally told that, because OL is working when I access it through GD and it is also working on my mobile devices, it had to be an issue between TB and OL and that I should contact MS and TB. </p><p>I then contacted MS support via chat (65 minutes total!) and was finally told that ""outlook has an issue now and it's a BUG"" and ""Just to inform, we are aware of this concern. Currently, there's number of customers who are affected of this issue. Our research engineers are currently working on this. Rest assured, we are doing our best to get everything up an running the soonest. "" and finally ""Are you contacting TB? I consulted our higher support for your concern and you also have to contact TB for this."" </p><p>I'm essentially at my wits' end.. I don't think that the problem is at GD because OL for which I have signed up works fine on all the devices. It's something between OL and TB and since OL does not seem to know if this sudden connection failure is an issue of the OL server I'm connected to, I hope that someone in the TB community knows what's going on. </p><p>Any advice is greatly appreciated, I have used TB for years and really like it and would hate to have to be relegated to using OL online &nbsp;:( </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1574865;1575430;1575741;,Aegeri1046

Note that this is also the case if you right click the message a chose Delete - go to the Trash and you will see that the message is no longer in bold. This is obviously annoying in case of spam and outright dangerous if you got a suspected virus message. </p><p>Today I got the latter and after unsuccessful google search I found a <strong>safe workaround that deletes the message without opening it</strong>. </p><p>Here is my solution: </p> <hr> <p>Lets say, your message has ""Info"" as a subject and ""Home"" as a sender (as did mine, it also had an attachment). 1) You go to the dashboard of the affected account and chose ""Manage message filters"".  2) A small window opens, there you chose ""New"" to create a new filter. 3) In the filter creation window, try to make the conditions as specific as possible, so that they fit only the email(s) you want to get rid of. In my case, I chose ""if subject is Info"" AND (!!) ""if sender is Home"". AND means ""Match all of the following"". 4) In ""Perform these actions"" chose whatever you like. You may want the message to be outright deleted, moved to Trash or to Spam. I have chosen Mark as Spam, in the hope the Spam filter will learn (though I've never seen an evidence of that), and Move to Spam folder - since I wanted to be able to verify that the message is there still in bold. 5) You click OK and get returned to the previous window. 6) There, with the new filter highlighted, chose a folder you want to apply it to and click Run now. 7) Now go to the folder where the message was supposed to be moved and verified the results. In my case, I went to Spam and saw that the message was there, still unopened. 8) After that right click on the Spam or Trash folder where the message is and empty it. The message(s) should be gone forever. </p><p>I have no reasons to think that the message was opened at some point in the process (notably during emptying the Spam folder), so to my best knowledge this method is safe. If you have reasonable doubts, pls share them here. For the future users, with higher TB version, I would first advice to make a test with some ""innocent"" messages, esp. if you're trying to remove a virus message. </p><p>The best thing would of course be <strong>if the TB engineers fixed this obvious security issue</strong>. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,,trescojones

I believe the version of Thunderbird would have been 24.0.1. I still have the installation file (Thunderbird Setup 24.0.1.exe) but Windows 8.1 tells me it's corrupt so I can no longer install this version. Also, I fully expect the structure of the data files has changed since those days so I'm not sure I will be able to just install any version of Thunderbird, copy the profile directories, launch TB, and be successful in accessing the emails.

Suddenly last night I started getting messages that I needed to enter a PW to log onto my three email servers, but each attempt was met by another request to log onto the server.  I can use email just fine on my iPad and I can log onto the servers individually using web-based email clients, so I know what the current passwords are, it's just that when I use those passwords in Thunderbird it doesn't work.  I bounced Windows and the router to no avail. The only big recent event in Thunderbird was that I moved it from the C drive to the D drive (an external SSD) in preparation for moving to a new Dell computer. It worked fine - I've been using Thunderbird on my new Dell Windows 11 computer for a couple of weeks.  My Thunderbird is at 102.10.0.  I tried changing the Authentication Method from ""Normal Password"" to ""Encrypted"" for one of the email servers but I got a message from Thunderbird telling me that the site didn't support encryption and that I should change it back to ""Normal Password"", which I did. </p><p>The only thing I could imagine was that some recent Thunderbird maintenance introduced a problem so I hoped that I'd discover that the problem was fixed with new maintenance this morning.  Didn't happen.  I'm at a loss and it's really upsetting me.  Please help.  Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1575596;1577783;1581166;1581314;1581391;1581477;1581530;,tcluster

Attached is that update box with the bar that never moves, just appears for a second then T'Bird is running without having updated. </p><p>The extreme slowness updating running T'Bird from the flash drive has been ongoing for a long time but this failing to update at all is something new for the last 2-3 versions at most (AFAICT). </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1575267;1575288;1575651;1575657;,habanero.dave

I can't see why it would need to use a separate connection for every STATUS command; nothing in the RFC suggests any good reason for this. </p><p>This smells like a bug to me, or at least a stupid way of checking mailboxes from an efficiency perspective. There are so many additional roundtrip times added here that this adds a huge amount of unnecessary overhead for both the client and the server. </p><p>Is there any way to force Thunderbird to reuse the existing connection, rather than continually closing and reopening connections? </p><p>I've noticed this on every Thunderbird/based client that I've tested this with, and it's driving me nuts.

I badly need help with Thunderbird, which has been acting very strangely for some days. To make things as clear as possible, let me first give the details of my setup. I am using an iMac running OS High Sierra. These are my Thunderbird account settings: </p><p>Server type: IMAP mail server User name:  mail@myaccount.com Server name: <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> Port: 993 Connection Security: SSL/TLS Authentication: Normal pw </p><p>Outgoing Server (SMTP): <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> - <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> User name: mail@myaccount.com Port: 465 Connection Security: SSL/TLA Authentication: Normal pw </p><p>The problem: Endless churning when I attempt to download emails, leading eventually to a “server timed out” error message. However, a further wrinkle: sometimes a few emails will come through anyway. When I try to send a message, more churning, then an error message saying “Sending of message failed. The message could not be sent because connecting to the Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://xxxxx.hpdns.net"" rel=""nofollow"">xxxxx.hpdns.net</a> failed. The server may be unavailable or is refusing SMTP connections. Please verify settings and try again”. Sometimes, when I try again, I get a different error message: “Your draft message was not copied to your drafts folder due to network or file access errors”. </p><p>What is particularly confusing and distressing is the seemingly random and inexplicable nature of the problems, and the fact that until about ten days ago, Thunderbird worked fine. Any assistance would be very welcome. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1576484;,stathatos1

Well, unfortunately that prediction has now come to pass.  Between now and the end of the month (they didn’t give us a specific date), IMAP access to UF Mail will no longer be supported or available.  Since Thunderbird relies primarily on IMAP for access to mail, it will no longer be able to retrieve UF mail. Only mail clients that support mail access via MAPI, EWS or EAS protocols will be supported.  The only UF supported mail client on desktop or laptop computers is Microsoft Outlook.   Apple Mail uses MAPI/EWS, so should continue to work (unless configured to use IMAP).

Network Solutions hosts my domain, and my email is based upon that domain (name@domain.com). I use the most current Thunderbird version (April 2023) for my PC email. Up until recently, my server settings left emails on the NetSol server. I believe they were POP3 settings. I had my Thunderbird folders on my PC all nice, and then a big email bucket on the NS server. Maybe the folders were there, too. I hardly ever looked at my NS webmail app. I just figured it was there as ""backup"". NS recently sent an email advising about an upgrade to a TLS 1.2 server, and providing new server settings: ""We’re updating our security... Due to an increase in attacks and security vulnerabilities in recent years, older versions TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer being used. To make sure your data continues to be safe, we are supporting the more advanced TLS 1.2"". When I reconfigured my Thunderbird settings, I opted for an IMAP set-up, which I thought always left a copy on the server. Later, after watching my Thunderbird with its new settings import 1000s of emails over many hours into my PC, which I then sorted into folders, when I accessed my NS webmail inbox, all my emails, the 1000s that came in, were gone. The new IMAP setting seems to have removed (rather then ""mirrored"") my emails from the NS server. Is this right? I thought IMAP left emails on a server, and POP3 took them off unless a user specified ""leave a copy on the server"". PLEASE can anyone help? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1576578;1576676;1576679;1576708;1576711;1576715;1576716;1577657;1577689;1577700;1577708;1577714;1577733;1577755;1577758;1577848;1577849;1577850;,robertlaporta

I typically have a half a dozen tabs open at a time in TB, generally the same half a dozen. For at least a year now when I re-open TB the same number of tabs open, with the last-selected tab selected. So far all is well, except that the selected tab switches from the email account that it was open in against when I shut down TB to the first account in the Folders pane. I then have to switch it back to the correct account every time. It's gotten annoying enough that I've now joined this Support site so I can ask how to fix this. I tried the ""open the profiles folder, quit TB, delete the session.json file and re-open TB"" dance, but all that did was cause it to forget all of the previously opened tabs. I re-opened them in the desired order, selected the 4th one at random, then quit TB. When I re-started it, the 4th tab was selected, but the content was the first account in the list instead of the one it should have been. For reference purposes, all the other tabs still have the appropriate accounts open in them. I have the same version of Thunderbird installed on 2 different Windows 10 computers, and both of them are manifesting this behavior. I'm currently running TB 102.10.0 (32-bit). Please advise as to how I can fix this. If there is any other information that I can gather that will assist you with resolving this issue please let me know.

(All I can figure is they're accidentally mis-typing something and hitting the Alt-V, S and another letter to change the sort column and/or order.) </p><p>I've just been experimenting with a user.js file to set the default order, but this doesn't appear to have any effect once I've elected to change the sorted order via the UI. I've set mine to: user_pref(""mailnews.default_sort_type"",18); user_pref(""mailnews.default_sort_order"",2); user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"",0); But when I change the message sort column and restart, it doesn't reset to the new defaults.

I am using Thunderbird and pop3 to do download the emails (roughly 90GB) and all emails are left on the gmail servers for now. The server is conacted every 5 minues and like this over a few weeks every 5 minutes some emails are downloaded. In the beginning it was thousands of emails every time, but it slowed down quickly, to only around 10 emails every 5 minutes in the end.  On my first try, I successfully downloaded all emails between 2006 and 2016, then Thunderbird announced there were no more new mails. Gmail online shows that emails between 2016 and 2023 are well present on the server. I went into the gmail settings, re-marked all emails as eligible for pop3 and started to download everything again. This time it downloaded all emails 2006-2014 (again, requesting every 5 minutes and with diminishing new emails on every request). Again Thunderbird announces ""No new emails to download"" even though theres plenty between 2016 and 2023 that can be found through the gmail web application.  Using the ""recent"" setting (adding 'recent:' in front of the pop3 user-name, I manage to download the past month worth of emails but nothing more.) Google Support said all my settings looked correct, they couldn't help and I should ask Thunderbird Support. Could you help me? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1577655;1577659;1577662;1577664;1578495;,SUPI1

It was wonderful that after decades Earthlink FINALLY added IMAP (I've been with Earthlink since about 1985).

Earthlink instructions on incoming IMAP security are unusual - 'none' is the default, but TLS is optional (but only if you set outgoing SMTP security to 'None'???)   My IMAP connection security is at the default 'none'.  Earthlink is silent on which [Thunderbird] IMAP authentication method to use ('password transmitted insecurely' or 'encrypted password' or Kerberos / GSSAPI' or 'NTLM' or 'TLS certificate' or 'OAuth2').  My [Thunderbird] authentication method is set to 'password transmitted insecurely'.

Please clarify with a definition of a ""profile"" since most threads talk about moving a profile to another machine. I have already used the Export tool on the old laptop and copied the zip file it created to the new laptop.  The snag is that in my haste to use e-mail on the new laptop, I recreated the same three e-mail accounts on the new laptop, so both laptops have been getting the same e-mails. Before I use the Import tool on the new laptop, what do I need to do about the accounts on the new laptop? I noticed that for each e-mail account, there is an Account Settings button that leads to an Account Actions menu with Remove Account as an option. How should I proceed? It would be more helpful if these tools had a prologue that explained what the process was and helped set expectations.

All clients loaded whole profile correctly, when I received any email it appeared on all devices at the same time, however upon closing and reopening TB the client redownloaded latest message again, displaying notification afterwards. This happens on every reopen with or without other users having TB open. Deleted emails are still visible on launch and disappear as soon as ""new"" emails are downloaded. Am I doing something wrong?

For years, I saved them in Documents/Thunderbird for easy backup with SyncToy.  I am finally transitioning from laptop running Windows 7 to another laptop running Windows 10.  The Windows 10 laptop previously had a hard drive failure and since it was mostly used for web browsing at that time, we replaced it with a small 128 GB drive so I store all files on external drive. </p><p>First issue: last May I set up fresh Thunderbird folder, renaming the bulky previous folder  and didn't find out until last week that both folders stopped saving to the Thunderbird folder 5/22/2022, almost a year ago.  Today is 5/08/2023. </p><p>Resulting in related issue on Windows 10 laptop: When I started dragging new emails into local folders, I found that no Local Folder has a date more recent than 5/22/2022. Went back to Windows 7 laptop and all the recently saved emails are in Local Folders. </p><p>When checking storage, Windows 7 showed as being in C:\Users\Name\AppData\Thunderbird\Roaming\Profiles\ default I'm guessing it was inadvertently changed.  So I made new folder syncing the AppData folder with the Documents/Thunderbird folder and copied it to the Windows 10 AppData Thunderbird folder, then set it as the local storage folder.  STILL have no recently saved emails in Local Folders.  I went back and followed the instructions on this link as well: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a> </p><p>I've synced and copied several sets of folders to no avail.  I KNOW the emails exist on the Windows 7 laptop but I cannot find where or how to save or transfer emails from May 2022 to May 2023.  What am I missing? </p><p>One thing I can't quite understand is that Account Settings\ Copies &amp; Folders archives options shows Local Folders on drop down list also showing archives on the 3 email accounts I download into Thunderbird but it will NOT let me choose Local Folders.  None are grayed out but the Local option is simply not allowed.  This is true on both laptops.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help in something that is normally so easy.

It is a big problem for me professionally. I did not see the error but it was reported to me by the client who received the email from the wrong address and was very confused.  I have been using both addresses extensively in the last few days and it has only seem to happen for that message. I did not hear about any similar pb with any other email I have sent. </p><p>I have checked the following - I have checked the sent folder and the email I sent is only in the sent folder of address 2 - the correct one.  - SMTP outgoing servers. They are all configured with the correct email address. The gmail smtp was set as default which may explain why some emails appear have been sent from gmail. I have now set it to address 2 which is my main address. - Outgoing server specified for each email address is the correct one </p><p>I am now in a situation where my client is worried about confidentiality which is very problematic for me. How can I convinve myself and my client that this glitch will not occur again.  Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1579635;1579653;,jean-francois1

I've tried copying the emails (they are in the Local Folders, and there are 49,500 emails) without any luck; I've added another gmail just for the transfer to see whether the org server was preventing the downloads, but even with a brand new gmail it won't copy more than 3,000 emails before it stops working.  </p><p>Questions: 1) It seems that given the large volume of emails something (maybe gmail) is preventing the emails from being copied back into the org email (or really any gmail). Is there a way to fix this? </p><p>2) Is there another way I can share/copy the emails via some other device/program that will allow the org to read and access the emails (i.e, external hard drive, but not sure what format the export would need to be for them to be able to access/read the emails?) </p><p>3) Last resort: is there a way to make an account/profile in Thunderbird that will allow my boss to access the one Local Folder on her own laptop, without having access to the other emails on my Thunderbird account?

So far, so good. During this process, I changed the sound volume of my Mac using the keyboard buttons, which are right above the Backspace key. So I wasn't precise enough and hit the Backspace key while Thunderbird was archiving. That was a bad idea, because Thunderbird then started to delete all selected messages at the same time as it was archiving them! I was able to recover some e-mail from the Trash afterwards. </p><p>So I'd suggest that Thunderbird only allow one command to be executed at a time, lest they interfere with each other.

For many years I had zero issues, but a few years ago my troubles began. </p><p>For some reason at some time during the day, Thunderbird will stop automatically synchronzing my inbox and folders.  It's really frustrating because I never know when it happens, but after a few hours I will notice ""I haven't gotten any messages in a while. ""   This happens at least twice a week.  Sometimes I might not realize it until much, much later, and by then I've missed dozens upon dozens of email messages. </p><p>At first this happened when I was still using POP on a gmail inbox.  The only way I could trigger Thunderbird to start re-syncing again was to completely shut down Thunderbird and reopen it.  It gets really annoying having to do this so frequently. </p><p>At some point, I decided to convert to IMAP.  This works only marginally better.  Thunderbird still occasionally stops syncing, but usually I just have to navigate to a different folder and then back to Inbox, to get it to start again.  But it may take several minutes before the messages start flowing in. </p><p>I can't see that there are any errors happening, but maybe I don't know where to look.  I'm perfectly happy to look for error logs or whatever to help troubleshoot the issue. </p><p>I really don't like the gmail interface on Chrome, and the phone app is even worse, and would hate to have to stop using Thunderbird.  But with gmail I never have to worry if my inbox is current, and I'm beyond tired of missing email messages. </p><p>Has anyone experienced this before or could help with advice on figuring this out? </p><p>Thanks so much! </p><p>P.S.

I managed to recreate my four accounts without any difficulty, but an unexpected consequence of one or the other of these actions seems to be that most addresses have vanished from my address books. It is as if the address book records are pointers to intray email headers, and when those emails are removed, so are the address book entries ... though I'm sure that's not what's actually going on! Maybe it's just coincidence, but whatever the explanation, it <em>is </em> the case that my address books are shadows of their former selves.

I then (in file manager) copied the all the contents of my Postbox 3.x Profile (the root folder files and Mail Folder, did not include minidumps) to the new created Thunderbird Profile (overwriting everything with same name). Then restarted Thunderbird and Popup came up saying migration updating or something like that, but it came up with all my old Postbox email folders and email and all my account settings. My old Postbox profile had the [ ] Check for new messages at startup UNCHECKED, which that all came up in Thunderbird just fine. Because I wanted to check Thunderbird out a bit before I started taking stuff off the server with it.  I then checked the TB version and it was then 60.9.1 (32bit).  So it did update which was surprising since I had updates set to OFF both in Thunderbird and the old Postbox Profile accounts.

Looking at the Tbird certificate store the stored certificate is out of date, but the certificate on the domain and in the windows certificate store is current. I'm running Windows 10, 64 bit, version 22H2, Thunderbird 102.11.0(64Bit). IMAP server for domain <a href=""http://thebarretts.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">thebarretts.net.au</a>. I have a couple of laptops plus a PC, all have the same issue, started on 9thMay, when the certificate expired. The attached screen shots show the error, the Windows certificate store, the certificate in Tbird and the certificate information stored in the domain. The email still works provide I cancel the add exception window, my calendar and contacts also fail. I have tried a number of tests such as restart in safe mode with networking to see if anything else could be affecting this, also added and exception in Tbird but this doesn't make any difference, checked that my AV (Kaspersky Premium) has an exception for the domain, turned off Kaspersky but same issue when Tbird starts, turned off Tbird addons but still fails. Tried to import a replacement certificate but Tbird tells me the certificate exist so will not import. Can anyone help me resolve this issue? If you need more info, screen shots or other data please let me know. Cheers Rob </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1581198;1581222;,rob216

Podle operátora helpdesku České pošty je nastavení v pořádku a kontrola certifikátu přes iSignum proběhla také bez potíží. Pro kontrolu jsem certifikát ještě zkusila ze stejné zálohy naimportovat do malého laptopu s Win 10, zde bez problémů funguje.

Needless to say, I have had to rebuild my software, one program at a time.  After setting up Thunderbird, I was able to import the mail from a second machine on my network.  However, that left me missing a large chunk of mail from earlier in 2023 and later 2022.  In looking through all the profiles, I find that the messages whose date matches my missing mail are in appdata/roaming/thunderbird/profiles/default.sja.  That directory contains two subdirectories, cache2 and mail.  Under cache2 I have directories called doomed, which is empty, and entries, which has all of the messages whose dates match those that I am missing.  My question is really simple -- how do I get those messages into my current user profile?  I've tried the import tool, but that fails.  I am at my wits end on this one.

I used Thunderbird for many years and have just returned to it. When I use the inbuilt add-ons manager it goes to the en-gb extensions site ( not unexpectedly, but I'm slightly surprised there is more than one site.) If I specify my version of Thunderbird it supplies outdated and/or unsuitable extensions which will not work with my version of Thunderbird. After a Usenet discussion I tried getting them from the en-us version of the site and got at least one extension that worked OK. However, subsequently the same has happened from the en-us address, despite specifying the correct version of Thunderbird, extensions fail from there too. For example the ""Open Google Calendar"" extension sort of works but has random text overwriting parts of the the calendar. Others are similar. My questions therefore are:- </p><p>1) Are the en-us and en-gb sites really separate sites, or am I wasting my time specifying which site I use? 2) Is the extension system really as comprehensively broken as it seems to be? 3) Is anyone doing anything about it? I don't know where to contact the devs direct. 4) I not, what on earth is the problem? </p><p>Failing all else can anyone point me to any more help on the topic.

Results were the same - one active image and slow response.  </p><p>Started Windows 7 Pro in SAFE mode with internet.  Started task manager and TB in normal mode.  Sent a message. Did Get Message and the mail was downloaded immediately.  Sent a second message and had the same result. </p><p>Started Windows in normal mode.

The email is in a folder structure which I would like to preserve. I would like to avoid having to recreate the folder structure by hand on the target; that would be very time consuming. I have been experimenting with a small nested set of folders before moving on to the real problem. </p><p>My first thought was to drag and drop the top level folder to local folders. First I checked that I could do it one folder at a time - no problem. If I try with a top level folder with sub-structure it only works if I specify that all sub folders are to be held locally. There is no way to mark a whole branch for local storage (that I have found), so that is a bit tedious running down the folder list ticking. So question 1: is there a better way. </p><p>Then I want to drag and drop from the local folders to the second account. For a single folder this works. For my small test folder with sub-structure it does not work. </p><p>It may be significant that the IMAP server for BOTH accounts (same server) does not support folders with both messages and sub-folders; the option ""Server supports folders that contain sub-folders and messages"" is therefore unticked for both accounts. I wonder if the information that a specific folder only contains sub-folders is lost in the move. </p><p>I then tried the ImportExportTools-ng plug-in. That suffered pretty much the same problem. I could export (same synchronise issue as above). I could import the result to Local Folders, but I could not import the same data to my target account.  </p><p>I would be grateful for any other ideas. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,,steve538

I connect by the 'CalDAV' protocol to my email/calendar provider. The connection link looks somewhat like this: </p><p>https://.....com/interface/caldav.php/calendars/user@mail.com/calendar/ </p><p>The idea was to sync my appointments to my mail host servers and have a safe backup like this. Now, the issue that comes in, is about time. For every new event I create the time changes unexpectedly on the day of the event by 2 hours difference. When I add a 'Reminder' it is even worse. It will change the time by 2 hours later instantly. I need to open the event again change it to 2 hours early (15.00 becomes 13.00) and then lightning will set the correct time (15.00) But....at the day the event takes place, again lightning will set the wrong time for the same event.  Very unhandy. </p><p>I started to check the system time of the o.s., which is correct now.  I checked the bios time, which is correct. I checked 'timezone' under settings (calendar) . It says Europe which is correct. (By the way the provider servers are also in europe, it should be correct) </p><p>Now, I cannot figure out what causes the issue.  Maybe very far fetched, I hard copied the thunderbird profile I use from a windows thunderbird application to a linux thunderbird profile. Never had problems with that procedure. Could there be a reason for this lightning time issue hidden in there?   Later I started using caldav to sync my messages to my provider servers' . </p><p>I opened a ticket for my email provider explaining this problem, but they claim they have no answer for it. They state that for other mail applications like outlook calendar work good and the problem doesn't occur. Which is the point where I created this ticket and ask politely for your support. </p><p>Thanks. </p><p>Dirk. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,,Busje2020

This makes it very hard to use Thunderbird as the focus is constantly changing from the list of messages to another unwanted tab. I have also started seeing this problem in Zotero, which uses the same underlying interface as Thunderbird, so I believe it is a general problem impacting all applications that use that (XUL?) interface. This is not a mouse problem as I have seen this on two different computers using two different mice, one of which is connected to the computer via a cable. I also have not noticed this problem in any of the other applications I use, so it is limited to Mozilla apps (but I have not seen this in Firefox for whatever reason - I believe firefox no longer uses XUL, right?). </p><p>Thanks, David </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1582791;,dmkaplan2000

Contact ATT Tech support advised to try to login via their portal <a href=""http://currently.com"" rel=""nofollow"">currently.com</a>, try to sign in, advised to change password suspicious activity, do the whole forgot password thing.  Notice a telephone # not mine on my confirm who you are, so use security questions, advise ATT about the #, they said they will pass the ticket on to upper support. Long story short for the past 2 months hackers have had access to my email placed orders, transferred money via accounts, not mine, sent money via Wester Union and sent over 10K porn emails and my draft folder continues to be filled daily with porn emails and sent out daily about 1K, my ip is a disaster. Then one day while deleting drafts I see an odd email that has <a href=""http://smtp.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.mail.att.net</a>,587,k******@sbcglobal.net,owxwe*************** I take this information and input into Thunderbird bam work, also located in the same email is the outgoing mail details different password, input into Thunderbird works. Contact Office of the President at ATT, speak to his ""executive assistant"" who is amazingly nice at first after about 3 conversations, she advises she will have their executive team look into it. Send those above login details to a good friend in Canada, inputs it into Thunderbird and Mailbird works. I advise ATT ""executive assistant"" that this info works in Thunderbird even though it does not work at <a href=""http://Currently.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Currently.com</a>, her reply ""If it doesn't work in <a href=""http://Currently.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Currently.com</a> or <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a>, you have malware, or viruses on your pc allowing hackers to use your pc to send and open emails?""  I advise I changed the password daily now, and the changed password works via <a href=""http://Currently.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Currently.com</a> and <a href=""http://att.com"" rel=""nofollow"">att.com</a> but not via Thunderbird but the info the Draft email has works fine via Thunderbird, your servers have this data an it needs to be removed.   Not there problem its a thunderbird/third party software issue. I have Bitdefender, and SuperAntiSpyware and check my pc daily, no viruses, malware or trojans etc. Is it truly a Thunderbird issue or&nbsp;??  This has been on going for over 2 months now and get nowhere with ATT their solution delete the email and create a new one, but all my bills and accounts online are sent to this email, and I have had it for 20 plus years, I have numerous emails I need to save, as a dear friend passed away a few years ago and I have all their emails saved, along with personal emails I need.

The html source that I see in Thunderbird is: &lt;a href=""https://www.domain.tld/""&gt;https://www.domain.tld/&lt;/a&gt; </p><p>and I then reply to that html email in plain text, Thunderbird converts that line, in my plain text reply, to: &gt; https://www.domain.tld/ &lt;https://www.domain.tld/&gt; instead of keeping it as &gt; https://www.domain.tld/ </p><p>Then if the other person replies in html to my plain text reply. So I receive an email with this line: &gt; https://www.domain.tld/ &lt;https://www.domain.tld/&gt; where those are hyperlinks - the source code of that message is: &gt; &lt;a href=3D""https://www.domain.tld/"" rel=3D""noreferrer"" target=3D""_blan= k""&gt;https://www.domain.tld/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D""https://www.domain.tld/"" rel= =3D""noreferrer"" target=3D""_blank""&gt;https://www.domain.tld/&lt;/a&gt; </p><p>And if I reply to that in plain text Thunderbird multiplies the hyperlinks yet again so that I send this: &gt;      &gt; https://www.domain.tld/ &lt;https://www.domain.tld/&gt; &gt;     &lt;https://www.domain.tld/ &lt;https://www.domain.tld/&gt;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>And so, on. Each time that I send a reply, Thunderbird doubles the hyperlinks in that part of the message. </p><p>Eventually I get messages with 4MB or more of text in them (no attachments) and Thunderbird gets very slow, freezing, etc. </p><p>Basically Thunderbird converts each html hyperlink into an enhanced plain text in this form: https://www.domain.tld/ &lt;https://www.domain.tld/&gt; </p><p>Is there any way to stop Thunderbird 'enhancing' my reply to: https://www.domain.tld/ &lt;https://www.domain.tld/&gt; and just keep it as the simple displayed text, as seen in the email that I'm replying to. i.e.: https://www.domain.tld/ </p><p>Cheers, Mark </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,,mark463

Back then I discovered that if I added another view, TB would then get all the new messages for all accounts.  By ""adding a new view"" I mean I normally run with Unified Folders.  To get TB to download new messages I could ""Add folders all"" and the status bar would show TB was logging in to my accounts and downloading  new messages.  If both Unified and All folders were being viewed, I could just remove the All folders view and the downloads would execute. So that is the way I have been operating for 20 months.  But now even that doesn't work!  Nothing I do will cause TB to get new messages. To make things worse,  if I do About Thunderbird it shows 102.9.1 (32 bit) but it also shows ""Checking for updates"" and that never completes.  I just get the spinning circle for hours. </p><p>How can I restore the TB functionality on this Windows 8 tablet? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,,petejc

As a result, I am now missing a bunch of folders. I know the folders still exist because I can see them when logging in through the web portal, but they are nowhere to be found in Thunderbird. When I first set out to switch to the Exchange settings in T-bird, it seemed to work fine until I restarted, at which point the email account disappeared completely. I then tried to add the email account again but got some error stating that the server already existed and wouldn't let me move forward. Figuring some settings were being stored somewhere I couldn't find, I decided to just do a fresh T-bird install. After the new install, when setting up the account I saw a note about T-bird not natviely supporting Exchange, and that I needed to install the Owl plugin. That seemed to work fine, and after adding the account I was able to see everything. However, when I restarted T-bird the account disappeared again, and I got the same ""existing server"" error keeping me from adding the account. Several reinstalls later, all with the same result, I dug a little more and found mentions of using the ExQuilla for Exchange plugin instead of Owl, so I took that route. That seemed to work, with the account able to be added, and sticking around after T-bird was shut down and restarted. However, the problem now is that I'm missing some (not all) folders. Previously, with the IMAP server setup, there was the option/functionality to ""subscribe"" to specific folders, but I don't see that now with the Exchange setup. Here's what I'm currently running: </p><p>OS: Windows 10 Home (22H2) Thunderbird version: 102.11.2 (64-bit) ExQuilla for Exchange version: 102.1 (updated May 27, 2023) - Trial version because I wanted to make sure it worked first </p><p>At this point if someone could either guide me how to find the missing folders using ExQuilla or let me know how to keep the account from disappearing using Owl I would be very grateful. </p><p>Best, G.C. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,,gcseibert

Also, everything I see about Owl or ExQuilla is dated 2022 or earlier. Is Owl or ExQuilla still the only solution to be able to send email? Does anyone know how to do this, and if so, can you share how to do it or point me to the info I need?

I truly hate the Outlook interface and the way it handles the names, I haven’t found any equivalent to “Display Name” in Thunderbird and I cannot live in a first name only world when looking at a list of email. </p><p>Another question: Is there anyway to make an IMAP account work like a POP account? I prefer to leave nothing on the email server. I like retrieving the email when I want to check it, vs having it pushed to me. I also like deleting it from the server after I have retrieved it and just keeping the email in my email client. I have lots and lots of folders and filters for both my incoming and sent email and I do NOT want to try recreating it for Outlook.  </p><p>I hope someone has experience with this Godaddy/Exchange/Office365/M365/Outlook problem and how it works with Thunderbird 102.11.2. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1583571;1585399;,at1357

However, upon checking, I find that all the emails have been read and there is no actual new mail. </p><p>I have ensured that all the settings for my account are correct, and both my computer and mobile device are configured with IMAP. This problem seems to occur consistently after the computer resumes from hibernation. </p><p>I have already taken the following steps to troubleshoot the issue: </p><p>-Updated Thunderbird to the latest version available. -Checked the account settings and ensured that the ""Notify me of new messages"" option is enabled. -Disabled and re-enabled notifications in Thunderbird. -Verified that both Thunderbird and my mobile device are set up for email synchronization. -Restarted Thunderbird and my computer multiple times. </p><p>Despite these efforts, the issue persists. I suspect that it might be a bug in Thunderbird. </p><p>I kindly request your guidance and support in resolving this issue. If anyone else has encountered a similar problem or has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate your input. </p><p>Thank you for your attention and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,,user252992465391717174180942609179899377653

It was a straightforward service, which I used for nearly 20 years, but with limited online storage.  I used Windows Live Mail (and its predecessors) as an offline archive (using the word in the conventional sense) of emails, locally stored (and backed up) in a large set of folders within WLM, only going online to offload mails from webmail as needed. I should like to do the same with Gmail, keeping only active messages online.  But Gmail will not talk to WLM so I am hoping to use TB instead.  I do not wish to synchronise TB and Gmail, nor to send/receive messages in TB — just in effect ""import"" mails from Gmail into TB, arrange them in locally created folders within TB, then delete them from Gmail.  Usage of TB would be largely offline. Is it possible to use TB this way?  I have  read many useful question threads in the forum and some wiki articles but remain quite uncertain as to whether and how.  I am quite old now and though I have used PCs at work &amp; home since they first appeared I am not technically proficient... I have made the Gmail account POP3, which I think is right.  I am aware only Inbox will show in TB and am happy to move messages from Sent, etc., in order to move them into TB. I'm unclear if I can set automatic delete from Gmail of moved messages:  this may be an IMAP only thing.  But I am happy anyway to manually delete them later in Gmail;  we're not talking 1000s of emails. I'm fairly sure local folders can be created in TB. WLM (I think) saves messages in separate .eml files.  I am unsure if that would be, or could be, the same in TB or if an extension is necessary.  I have seen talk of mbox and maildir but do not understand when these issues arise. I am sure there are others factors I should take into account and some I have forgotten already to list here.  I shall be grateful for any advice offered. I apologise for this long message:  thank you for getting this far!

So I loaded my wife's profile from a backup.  It solved the problem, but for how long?   Another person with a similar issue previously noted that another symptom was a vast increase in storage requirements for the profile, and I saw that the profile was more than three times the size it used to be.  There were a series of files named NSTMP in the gmail profile that aren't present on my profile.  I deleted them from my wife's profile and recovered the storage, without changing the performance.   I suspect the profile became corrupt and the corruption resulted in generation of multiple NSTMP files, and eventually started wiping out message content as well.

I've had this problem persistently for years, and decided to finally try and get to the bottom of it on one of my accounts. </p><p>I filed <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1835023"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1835023</a> and tried variations of different fixes, but the main clue that this was related not to Thunderbird, but the server, came when I saw the same ghost folders appear on a completely separate/fresh install of Thunderbird, after nuking every shred of Local/Roaming/etc profiles, on a completely separate machine that didn't have TB installed before. The ghost folders *had* to somehow be known to the server, as otherwise how would TB know about them? </p><p>In the end, with much to-ing and fro-ing with my email host provider (who, bless them, did their own bit of research and sent me to various posts here where the various ""solutions"" are discussed - e.g. unchecking the ""Show only subscribed folders"" option, which really just hides the problem rather than fixing it), it turns out the core issue was indeed a borked subscriptions list on the server. </p><p>&gt; I located the folder mentioned in the subscriptions file that is generated by cPanel / Roundcube: /home/splinter/mail/<a href=""http://splintered.co.uk/redux/subscriptions"" rel=""nofollow"">splintered.co.uk/redux/subscriptions</a> [ed: my account is redux@splintered.co.uk, so this will obviously vary depending on your specific server setup] &gt; &gt; I've re-created this and re-subscribed the folders via Roundcube - i'm no longer seeing the extra folders in the above file. </p><p>This, getting the subscriptions to be regenerated on the server, is what in the end fixed this for good. All other tips (unchecking the subscribed folders option, or trying to create a new folder with the same name as the ghost folder, etc) seem to just effectively ""plaster over"" the fundamental problem. </p><p>Your mileage may vary, but thought I'd post this here too, as I'd have loved to see this solution being noted here too, instead of sending me down various fruitless rabbitholes... </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1584969;,redux3

I also assume that the W11 PC would only need one installation of Thunderbird itself. </p><p>With that in mind, I'd welcome any advice about the sequence of what I install / copy, and under what logins each step is done. Also whether the two profiles should be separated into the two users' user folders, or kept together in a Thunderbird data folder. </p><p>By all means point me to any existing documentation if it exists - I couldn't find it myself. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1585140;1585143;1585145;,carlwark

I don't do any folder sorting; I just keep messages in ""inbox"" until I archive it. I don't have any plugins. I don't have any identities other than what is made with each account. I am updated to the latest TB version, 102.12.0 (64-bit). </p><p><br> PROBLEM: </p> <ol><li>1: </li></ol> <p>I send an email from personal@gmail.moc to contact@mybusiness.moc. The message eventually arrives in the inbox of business@gmail.moc. When I reply to this message (reply or reply all), a compose window opens with: From = personal@gmail.moc To = contact@mybusiness.moc </p><p>These should be: From = business@gmail.moc To = personal@gmail.moc </p><p>I get the expected behavior when: I send from someone else's account external@gmail.moc to my contact@mybusiness.moc.

When I click reply, the compose window shows: From = personal@gmail.moc To = oldaddress@gmail.moc </p><p>These should be: From = bills@gmail.moc To = personal@gmail.moc </p><p><br> DISCUSSION: It seems that when a message is forwarded to another address AND Thunderbird has BOTH the originator account and the recipient account, a reply to that message picks up the wrong FROM and TO fields. When testing this setup, I initially thought the problem was more widespread affecting external accounts too but now I see that it is only if the same instance of TB has both accounts. I suppose as it is, this isn't a big problem as I don't actually send messages to myself. I only did this for testing and it confused me for a while. </p><p>I have seen a couple other posts mention this problem. The suggested solution is to configure identities but this /has/ to be a bug that should be resolved.

I found that one of the two ""APP"" names I had entered, so that AOL could create two associated passwords, for that email address had disappeared.  The password that I used for incoming mail (associated with <a href=""http://pop.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.verizon.net</a>) was present, and I could still receive email from that xxxx@verizon.net address with Thunderbird, Version 102.12.0 (32bit).  But the one that I used for outgoing mail (associated with <a href=""http://smpt.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smpt.verizon.net</a>) had disappeared from the AOL list.  I attempted to add the lost APP (and associated password, even if AOL created a new one), but AOL responded with a red message:  ""Sorry, this feature is not available right now!""  I searched AOL help messages and found no reference to this problem.  So, I decided to try using the one surviving APP (and its associated password that I had created for incoming mail) for outgoing mail also, and it worked!  The details follow. </p><p>To make this fix, no change was made in AOL, only in Thunderbird.  I opened Thunderbird and chose Tools/Settings/Privacy and Security/Passwords, and clicked on ""Saved Passwords"".  Under ""Provider"" I selected (highlighted) the outgoing (smpt) server, and hit ""Remove"" to remove just it (and its associated password), and then hit ""Close"".  Then I wrote a test message using this email address and attempted to send that message.  Thunderbird immediately requested a password.  I entered the one password that had survived in AOL, with the SAVE feature activated to assure that the password would be remembered by Thunderbird.  I then attempted to ""Send"" the message, and Thunderbird could not complete the send.  I closed Thunderbird and reopened it, and pressed ""Send"" again on the same message, and it was sent promptly.  From then on, both incoming and outgoing features of Thunderbird worked on this email address. </p><p>I assume that it was necessary to close and reopen Thunderbird to get Thunderbird to read the password change on reopening. </p><p>SPECULATION:  Just this one email address, out of several that I have, was affected by AOL's loss of my outgoing password for that email account.  Perhaps this occurred because AOL either has an error in its records, or it is upgrading the particular server which serves that particular one email address.  So it seems possible that other email addresses may soon be affected and that I may need to use this method again. </p><p>QUESTION:  If you know of any adverse effects from the change that I made above, please let me know. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,,Ron4

I understand my version of Outlook stores emails in the cloud, not on my local PC.   </p><p>I've been notified that cloud-based storage for my emails is nearing maximum capacity.  One option is to pay for more storage but I'm reluctant to do that.  Further, I would like to create copies of my emails, store them on my local PC, and then delete the oldest from Outlook.  That frees up cloud-based storage AND lets me preserve the emails on my own hardware.  After MANY chats with forum volunteers knowledgeable about Outlook, I've learned that only the desktop version of Outlook has the ability to export folders of emails to my local PC for archiving.  Also, those emails would only be viewable using desktop Outlook.  In all cases, the volunteers also suggested Thunderbird as a method for archiving my emails.  That's why I'm here. </p><p>I've checked through as many old posts as possible but would still like a bit of encouragement before downloading and using Thunderbird.  Here are my very basic questions: </p><p>1.  Will Thunderbird allow me to access and download email folders from my web-based Outlook program? 2.  Once the emails are safely on my local PC, what software will I need to open and read the messages?  My current mail program (Outlook)?  Thunderbird?  Something else? 3.  As I understand it, my version of Outlook stores messages in Folders, as opposed to Gmail which uses labels.  Will I be able to preserve my Folders in the archiving process or do all archived emails go into one large folder?  By the way, I'm not looking for automatic archiving; I'd be happy to archive manually once per year. </p><p>Many thanks in advance.  I look forward to giving Thunderbird a try. </p><p>Dick </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1585660;1585680;1585686;1585696;,rjfelts

The duplicates are nearly always quite old (several months or even years). When Thunderbird does this there are always exactly two of each duplicate (never one). </p><p>I can't tell if the problem has something to do with filters or actual redundant server downloads. </p><p>I think this problem has occurred with both Pop and Imap accounts, but I've primarily noticed it in Pop accounts. </p><p>I run: Windows 7 Pro OS Thunderbird 102.11.0 (32-bit) on: <a href=""http://Sonic.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Sonic.net</a> Internet service </p><p>This is not a huge problem but it is an irritating interruption to getting work done smoothly. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Eric Brooks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1586231;,brookse321

The problem is spurious: For instance, most e-mails from a particular Sender will read correctly, but every now and again a message appears garbled. When this happens, the From and Subject field will be empty when I open the message. (See attached images) These errors began when my e-mail provider Telenor (@online.no) started to upgrade their e-mail service a few months ago, and so far, they have not been able to pinpoint the cause or correct the problem.

Yesterday I downloaded the software and successfully added 2 email accounts.  They are infrequently used accounts so I can afford to experiment before adding my primary email account. </p><p>My primary email account is web-based Outlook.  I'm bumping up against the maximum storage before needing to purchase more storage or deleting emails.  If possible, I want to copy entire folders from the primary account to local folders on my PC using TB.  I thought that process would be called archiving but am now thinking it's called exporting.  To be sure I don't lose anything, I absolutely want to leave the original folders/emails in my Outlook account until I've copied them to local folders and verified everything came through.  Once I'm sure the emails are safely in a local folder, I'll delete most of them from the Outlook server. </p><p>From my very, very short experience with TB, it looks like ""archiving"" means moving (not copying) items from one folder to another but the folder receiving the items still resides in TB, not on my PC.  Is this correct or am I mistaken?  I also think that ""exporting"" means moving (not copying) items from one folder to another folder that may, or may not, be a local folder on my PC.  I think the choice of folder and location is mine during the export process.  Is this correct? And is it correct that the items are permanently removed from their original folder during exporting?  If so, this export process would NOT be what I want because the items would have been removed from the Outlook server before I could verify a good transfer. </p><p>While playing around with one of the email accounts I successfully moved to TB, I selected a group of 10 emails in a particular folder, right-clicked on the group, and selected ""Copy to ..."" where I selected a new local folder.  This successfully placed copies of the 10 emails in the local folder while leaving the originals in the folder on TB.  I suppose I could use this process to place the emails from my primary account into local folders but it would be time-consuming (unless I could ""select all"" for a given folder and copy a very large number of emails at one time).   </p><p>I'd very much like to know if my understanding of archive, export and copy are correct and, if so, which I should use to get my emails into local folders.

Using an office computer requires those contacts to be accurate on both systems and updated in the back ground.  Use of Google to do this is out of the question due to the lack of Groups or it's called Label. An organizational field like Doctors or Customer service.  I notice some these fields on my phone contact are nonexistent on Thunderbird contacts.  Why?  I thought it was converted to VCard format with contains many more fields. Editing a Contact only shows a minimal number of fields compared to VCard. CardDAV just looks confusing and I can't tell what is what, and causes duplicates. So why is there no merge without duplicates if the same Name field is already on file.  I've tried to use tools like BirdieSync, but it just duplicates every dam contact causing a mess.  This is really a problem because computers are here to make life better not add more work. So, before I get rid of TB just what is down the road for this problem?  My phone Contact software should have a APP that connects to my PC and copies new contacts or updates contacts to the Thunderbird contacts and visa versa. If they are both using VCard what's the problem? PC to Phone and phone to PC, without Google or Microsoft data theft of my contacts.

As a result, I get a few email messages every day containing ""Storage limit exceeded"" as the subject.  I spoke to the vendor, and they don't know what causes the message to fire.  They also confirmed that I have never come close to exceeding my storage limit. I can't mark the sender as a spam account, because they occasionally send me legitimate correspondence.  I did a little research, and it looks like Thunderbird will allow me to filter by subject. If that works as I suspect it might, that would allow me to filter out the unwanted messages and still receive other communications from this vendor.

From there, it's unclear how I should proceed. </p><p>I guess my first question is, does the absence of an application menu button mean there's something wrong with my Thunderbird installation, or is that linked instruction page simply out of date?

(My autosave is set at every 5 minutes, in the Settings &gt; Composition).  I am hoping to recover a draft that I know was auto-saving, but in some apparently only in a temporary way that doesn't fully post to the Drafts folder.  </p><p>I had 4-5 email windows open in TBird, under composition.  They lingered as draft emails for several days, as I worked through a bookkeeping job and compiled lists of questions to email out.  In particular, one ""Draft"" is actually a long to-do file of notes, which I continuously update.  I regret not closing it more frequently in order to Save its latest version to the Drafts folder.  Instead, I got behind in my work and just left that ""write window"" open for weeks.  TBird abruptly closed/crashed last night, and those draft-emails I had open are gone, and not in the Drafts folder.  They are not Sent of Deleted/Trash either.  So its like they never existed since I didn't specifically say ""Save a Draft,"" but I believe they still auto-saved.   </p><p>Only my to-do list with is a longstanding ""Draft email""  is still existing, but it's the version from a couple weeks ago, which I guess is the last time I actually closed its ""write"" window!  (yes, I probably should restart TBird and my laptop more often).  I would like to recover the latest version of that draft, and ideally the handful of other emails I had open. </p><p>So would those auto-saved drafts exist in some mozilla hidden-folders or something??  It seems to me that the auto-saved drafts interact with the email server (1and1, via IMAP) somehow, because if my internet is out, any draft-email that I have sitting open keeps bugging me that it can't auto-save.  So it must autosave on a server, not just locally in a TBird file, right?   </p><p>I contacted 1and1 and they restored things deleted over the last few days, but that didn't help at all, probably because I hadn't actually deleted the drafts.  It's like they didn't get formally deleted because they were never formally saved as drafts, yet they existed &nbsp;:) </p><p>So where to look?

For at least 4 months I've been experiencing issues while using Thunderbird.  It started when a couple more file folders were added, (Not by me), to the ""Folders Group"" under my email address.  Those folders that were added are:  ""JUNK ITEMS"" and ""DELETED ITEMS"".  The only folders I've ever used were the ones that were installed in the beginning many years ago.  They simply read: ""JUNK"" and ""DELETE"".  Yes, I've always updated whenever an update became available. </p><p>I cannot remove the Junk items or the Delete folders from the folder file.  When I attempt to do so, I receive the message which states: ""The following process failed. Messages cannot be ""RENAMED""!  This happens even though I selected the ""Delete Tab"" from the drop-down menu, even though I selected the ""DELETE"" option. To add to all of this now every time I open the Thunderbird program to check my e-mail, it loads those very slowly.  When it's completed the downloads, and I start selecting e-mails to view, I may get through 2 or 3 and they suddenly ""disappear"" from the inbox list.  If I wait for about a minute or less, they suddenly re-appear. </p><p>Another issue is this occurs often while I'm trying to view the remaining e-mails, AND at times some of the e-mails I have ""DELETED"" suddenly re-appear from the ""TRASH FOLDER""!  I have un-installed and re-installed the Thunderbird program without any changes to the issues. </p><p>If I knew how to SAVE all of my e-mails that I keep, and do a ""Restore"" operation without loosing my e-mail files, I'd do that.  I'm currently running Windows 10 on an HP ENVY 700 Series PC and have Centurylink for my ISP. </p><p>Is there anyone who can help me identify what is causing all these issues with Thunderbird?

Because there are (or appear not to be) means to simply enter those passwords within Thunderbird, there must be another way that TB acquires them.  From having used TB for years, I've observed that TB serves a response that asks for a password when authentication between the TB client software and an ISP mail serve.  I have inferred that it is this pathway that allows TB to acquire passwords that it then stores when they have been used successfully validated.   </p><p>Does email account password acquisition by Thunderbird function in the way I described (or close to it, even)?  If that is not how it is done, how is it done?  IOW, How do I tell Thunderbird what passwords to use to validate email message exchanges with my ISP? </p><p>This question arises from my attempts to resolve my problem, but leads to questions about how I decided I would resolve the issue of unrecognized passwords.  My plan was to delete passwords for these email accounts from Thunderbird and from my ISP and start fresh with new passwords.  To that end, I learned how to find the passwords that TB stores buy following Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Saved Passwords &gt; Show Passwords.  I then captured that information in a separate text file so that I would not lose those passwords and deleted all the passwords in Thunderbird. </p><p>I ran into problems with my ISP in trying to delete and set up new passwords.  I'm trying to make them own the problem and they are saying that the problem is in TB therefore beyond their responsibility.  What's worse is that they are using the email password validation problem to refuse ownership of their email address password interface problem.  That's why I'm back here asking questions . . .   to exonerate Thunderbird or learn what I don't know. </p><p>Thank you for any assistance you can give to help me understand how TB acquires and uses email account passwords. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1588002;1588117;1588166;,rabbithutch1
