Il cambio di policy di Google che prevede l'uso di OAUTH fa si che ogni client (nel nostro caso il tuo Thunderbird) sia univocamente individuato. E quindi il server di Google sa anche quando lo stesso client sta configurando un secondo account. Dopo di ché, come spiegato nella discussione a cui ti ho rimandato non tutti gli utenti registrano problemi il che rende ancora più incomprensibile la situazione.

This is a text file and notepad or other text editor will do.  - it will show the path to the active profile  - exit the text editor  - make a copy of profiles.ini for safety - now, in the profiles folder, copy the active profile and store it on the external drive. Give it any name you wish as the name itself is irrelevant to Thunderbird  - now open profiles.ini again and type in the correct path, e.g.,  Path=D:\myprofile and save.  - restart thunderbird and verify that all seems ok. You can verify the new location by clicking 'account settings' and clicking the 'server settings' pane and the bottom line should show local directory is the external drive. The profile on drive C may now be deleted, if desired.  - Now, when you upgrade to new PC, just install TB on new PC, and copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to the new PC at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming and then start TB.  </p><p>Footnote: Thunderbird has a profile manager that can do this, but use of it seems to cause confusion, so I use the more fundamental approach. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Thanks very much for that suggestion.  In safe mode, TB got the OAuth2 token from gmail, and I was able to download new mail.

However, I was not able to diagnose the underlying problem, so if TB ever needs to get a new OAuth2 token then I expect it to fail again.  Any suggestions on what the underlying problem might be, or on methods for further diagnosis? </p><p>&gt;&gt;   I am running TB 114.4.1 on Windows 10. </p><p>&gt; Then you're running an outdated beta.

However, the Network Firewall component has been turned on.  I tried temporarily turning Network Firewall off, and it made no difference; TB was still unable to get an OAuth2 token when attempting to set up a new account.  Thus, the underlying problem remains undiagnosed and therefore not fixed. </p><p>After using Safe Mode With Networking to get an OAuth2 token for the problematic gmail account, it worked in normal mode for a few days.  Then gmail inexplicably required a new OAuth2 authorization, which again failed.  At the same time, a new problem arose:   when attempting to SEND email from the same account, the process never completes.  The ""Sending mail..."" popup remains displayed forever (until I press 'cancel').  Nevertheless, the email has been sent.  This problem persists even in safe mode.  In my other email accounts configured in the same instance of TB (including another gmail account), this problem is absent; sending mail works normally. </p><p>I was able to go back into Safe Mode and get another OAuth2 token so that I can again operate in normal mode, but I don't know how long that will last.  Getting into Safe Mode is not easy on this computer, since it requires me to type in a 42-digit ""Bitlocker recovery key"".  Further, it seems that Safe Mode With Networking does not support wifi, so I have to connect via a copper Ethernet port; I can do that, but it's another step. </p><p>Any other ideas? </p><p>Regards, Larry </p>",larry9850,false,0,0
