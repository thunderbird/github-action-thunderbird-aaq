Il cambio di policy di Google che prevede l'uso di OAUTH fa si che ogni client (nel nostro caso il tuo Thunderbird) sia univocamente individuato. E quindi il server di Google sa anche quando lo stesso client sta configurando un secondo account.

This is a text file and notepad or other text editor will do.  - it will show the path to the active profile  - exit the text editor  - make a copy of profiles.ini for safety - now, in the profiles folder, copy the active profile and store it on the external drive. Give it any name you wish as the name itself is irrelevant to Thunderbird  - now open profiles.ini again and type in the correct path, e.g.,  Path=D:\myprofile and save.  - restart thunderbird and verify that all seems ok. You can verify the new location by clicking 'account settings' and clicking the 'server settings' pane and the bottom line should show local directory is the external drive. The profile on drive C may now be deleted, if desired.  - Now, when you upgrade to new PC, just install TB on new PC, and copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to the new PC at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming and then start TB.  </p><p>Footnote: Thunderbird has a profile manager that can do this, but use of it seems to cause confusion, so I use the more fundamental approach. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The ""Sending mail..."" popup remains displayed forever (until I press 'cancel').  Nevertheless, the email has been sent.  This problem persists even in safe mode.  In my other email accounts configured in the same instance of TB (including another gmail account), this problem is absent; sending mail works normally. </p><p>I was able to go back into Safe Mode and get another OAuth2 token so that I can again operate in normal mode, but I don't know how long that will last.  Getting into Safe Mode is not easy on this computer, since it requires me to type in a 42-digit ""Bitlocker recovery key"".

Per the instructions, I have  Shift+J the messages 100 times or more. My email address is on the white list. Nonetheless, the filter continues to send emails sent from my own email address to the Junk folder. My question is to find a better way to remove the ""junk"" marker from emails sent from my own email address.  Would re-installing Thunderbird solve the problem?  Or, would the saved backup file also include the junk marker on my own email address? </p>",RML_Seattle,false,0,0

I assume that has something with the update of the address book.  </p><p>Anyway, I will follow your instructions. I've re-purposed another PC as a test PC on which I will do this. There are too many problems with doing this on my main PC. </p><p>One of the key reasons I've had to stay with 52.9.1 is the need to be able to encrypt emails only for selected recipients without having to do multiple actions to achieve that. I've used an addon called ""Security settings from address book"" which totally automates the process. Perhaps I'm not understanding TB115 properly, but it looks on the surface as it will do what I need natively, since the addon no longer works. As this is a daily process, I can't be on a version of TB that doesn't provide that functionality, at least not without going crazy from all the extra clicks. </p><p>If TB115 doesn't support this functionality, then I'm pretty much stuffed. I'm stuck on 52 until someone writes another add on to achieve the functionality. I think I'd be waiting for a long time&nbsp;:) </p><p>So, in the mean time I would like to recover my main PC if possible. I've got everything working, though I spent all night last night on it (I didn't anticipate the restore would corrupt TB entirely so I hadn't backed up my passwords and address book so I had to do all that from scratch). It had me going for a while when trying to recreate accounts that have long since been retired, then I found that if I didn't enter a password I could create the account. I need to preserve all emails from all accounts for legal reasons. </p><p>So, as it stands now I have got 52.9.1 almost back to where it was.  </p><p>Except for the theme. All I have is a sickly blue color on the top. I have all the original profiles, so is there a way I can copy the theme from the old profile, or perhaps set a background for the tab/address/menu bar area? </p>",citizen1138x,false,0,0

If you have concerns about 115, my suggestion is to first download the portable version, setup an account, and test the features you want. That is much safer than upgrading to 115 and then determining that it cannot meet your current needs.
