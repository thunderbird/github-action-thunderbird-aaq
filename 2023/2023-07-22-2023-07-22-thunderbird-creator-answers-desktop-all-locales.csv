I'd like to have my mail marked as un-read even after preview (in the preview pane), but marked as read after double-click (open email), reply / reply-all or forward. </p><p>The motivation for this BP is that I know I read the email, but it's still on my ""to-do"" list. </p><p>As you know TB's options are to mark as read immediately or after a given time period (basically the same regarding my BP). </p><p>Couldn't find an add-on for that. </p><p>It's extremely frustrating to have to manually mark as read each email. </p><p>Any idea?

I had to go back, and, also, restore my profiles folder. One of my accounts has some 100 folders in its directory, and, some 200 filters. I built this up over more than 10 years, and, relied on it for saving my mails. Also, the last time I did a major upgrade, firefox interfered with the profiles and I needed to work around that also. So, can someone guarantee me that the upgrade will mean that I can simply inmstall it and run it exactly as i do now?

Last time I used a profile backup to repair the issue. I am tired of this crap. Seriously if you cannot manage this issue leave it alone. It seems to see the existing account / profile as default but will not load it. It is as if no profiled exist at all. I have used and supported TB and Mozilla for years but from here on I am sadly going to have to replace TB with a paid option. Too risky of a software to take a chance at this point. It would be cool to have a quick fix that is automatic but the only quick fix is a backup. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1592093;,vengeful1

They did data migration but when I got my computer back, my thunderbird icon and auto login was missing. They also told me they had to install a new version of windows.  I redownloaded new version of thunderbird, entered my info (can't remember if I was imap or pop previously so when I tried both, I had two email profiles in thunderbird but no history) and I can only get email history for the past month. I have searched through all kinds of help articles and cannot fix the issue.  I had a back up before I took it in, only files I can pull up are the mozilla download file.  Can someone please help? 10years of missing emails is a major problem. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1592094;,shdebruijn

The only way I know to have Thunderbird use any email address is to set up an account in Thunderbird for that address which requires validating the account set up with the email address provider's domain.  If I understand Fastmail correctly, that cannot be done.  Instead, they say I can set them up as identities (if I understand them correctly) but I don't know how to do that without accounts in Thunderbird. </p><p>If anyone has successfully set up multiple @fastmail.com email addresses in Thunderbird, I'd like to know how it was done. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rabbithutch1
