Would really appreciate any advise. </p><p>Thunderbird is syncing on my Windows 11 PC newly and it's working fine. However, I use ESET's security solution with their ESET Internet Security anti-virus product and it has detected some security incidents with some specific Gmail label that have emails within the Thunderbird folders. Also, the usual ESET scan doesn't catch these. I had discussed with ESET technical support and they said that the 'In -Depth' scan feature needs to be used for the scanner to get inside the compressed file to search inside it and then it will check for security detections.  Other way would be to extract the compressed file to a folder and then run a usual scan on the extracted items. But, as explained below, the compressed specific Thunderbird file can't seem to be extracted either. </p><p>I was trying to extract the specific Thunderbird file which has been detected in the real time system background scan, with 7-Zip as it shows the 'Extract' option. But, it doesn't extract and gives an error that it couldn't extract the specific Thunderbird file. </p><p>The specific file name is a label in my Gmail mailbox which has some emails, which Thunderbird has downloaded to it's cache. </p><p>Q: So, could anyone please let me know how do I extract or view which specific email item within the single specific Thunderbird file 'PG Campus.file' could the email item be in that may be infected, or whatever security issue has been detected? </p><p>3 Screenshot attached for your ref. </p><p>Security detection of one of them is at:  C:\Users\User\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\o9rhi2hm.default-release\ImapMail\<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>\Career.sbd\NID.sbd\PG Campus  </p><p>The 'PG Campus' label based filed has no filename extension, but it has a size of 5.5 MB which has 58 emails as I checked on the Gmail web mail. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1620461;1620477;,intellogo

I called it my one stop shop for all my emails coming in from different places to read my emails.  Since this last update (which really needs works on or a patch needs to go out) this is my problem.  Before the upgrade in Thunderbird, I had 5 different accounts.  1 from AOL (My main email), 1 from <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a>, and 3 from Gmail.  After the upgrade, I had to delete the 3 from Gmail because it stop working as I wouldn't get anymore emails.  I tried several times to recreate an account, and after I got to the part where Thunderbird would ping Gmail and said I was good, then another error came up and said, it couldn't reach the server.  So before writing this email to the support of thunderbird, I tried a test.  I can send an email from my AOL account to my Gmail account.  I can then reply to the email from Gmail to AOL account.  I then sent an email from Gmail account to AOL account and then reply from AOL account back to Gmail and it worked.  So what is the problem with the middle man (Thunderebird)?
