All new email coming into my Thunderbird inbox from my gmail account is being marked as Spam, red flame. But is left in the inbox. Earlier in the day I went to Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security  and selected ""Reset Training Data"" thinking that might be how/why things were getting marked as spam. Several hours later I have 7 new messages, all marked as spam. I to Gmail's web interface and the messages are all there and none are marked as spam. I checked the Log of Junk mail and I do not see any of the subject lines there. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",paul.truzzi
