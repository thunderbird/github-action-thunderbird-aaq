Then suddenly it downloaded all messages from Nov 16 until today. BUT it stopped downloading again today at 12:52 pm eastern time. Obviously there is a problem with Thunderbird and I desperately need your help. Please check my account and tell me what to do. Why is this happening. I talked to Yahoo Small Business support, they check everything but they determined that the problem is with Thunderbird and they asked me to contact you. I did that when the problem happened on Nov 16. I did not get any support from you then. I hope you will help me this time, please.
