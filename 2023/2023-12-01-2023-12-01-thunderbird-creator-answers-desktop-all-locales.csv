I then update the Server Name or the User name (they both do the same thing). This then produces a pop-up that says ""Restart is required to apply the server name or username change."" Click OK to restart and when Thunderbird has restarted the Server Name/User Name has reverted back to the old setting. </p><p>A similar thing happens if I try and make the matching changes to the outgoing SMTP settings. They appear to change until Thunderbird restarts at which point the old settings have been restored. </p><p>I needed to make this change to two PC's. One PC (a windows 11 PC) worked fine. The other (a windows 10 PC) consistently fails. The affected PC is using the latest Thunderbird ver 115.5.1. </p><p>What am I missing here? Why can't we change the Server settings? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",ian208

I have done nothing to cause this. It happened suddenly today. Last time it happened was on Nov 16: I could not download my emails for over ten days. Then suddenly it downloaded all messages from Nov 16 until today. BUT it stopped downloading again today at 12:52 pm eastern time. Obviously there is a problem with Thunderbird and I desperately need your help. Please check my account and tell me what to do. Why is this happening. I talked to Yahoo Small Business support, they check everything but they determined that the problem is with Thunderbird and they asked me to contact you. I did that when the problem happened on Nov 16. I did not get any support from you then. I hope you will help me this time, please. Do not ask me to resubmit the question again since you already have my question and I followed the steps you gave me. </p><p>There might be some suspicious activities that are causing this problem. Please check this. On both days the interruption happened (Nov 16 and today Nov 30), I received multiple emails with the following content. Clearly, these are all suspicious emails. Today I received 7 such messages between 3:44 pm and 4:18 pm. The message says: </p> <h6 id=""w_"">=============================</h6> <p>Subject: REMINDER!!!

Someone else did. I suspect these are phishing or scam type attempts. The only difference in the 7 messages sent today was the ""From: "", the body of the messages is the same. </p><p><br> November 30, 2023 From: info@ironandvelvet.co.uk To: smari@arys.org </p><p>November 30, 2023 From: collectorsfest@cnypromotions.com To: smari@arys.org </p><p>November 30, 2023 From: contactus@printland.in To: smari@arys.org </p><p>November 30, 2023 From: sales@wellworthwireropes.com To: smari@arys.org </p><p>November 30, 2023 From: sales@wellworthwireropes.com To: smari@arys.org </p><p>November 30, 2023 From: dealers@hplctechnologies.com To: smari@arys.org </p><p>Again, the problem is that I cannot download my emails at all.

The account smari@arys.org is being processed. Please wait until processing is complete to get messages. Although there are no processing going on. </p><p>Yahoo Small Business support tried to help but they said the problem is with the Thunderbird side and asked me to contact you. Please check this and let me know if I can do anything to fix this problem once and for all. Thank you. </p><p>Waleed W.

After digging for a while I found that when I added a filter on a domain (domain ends with)  I accidentally added another line that had a blank (or null) entry.  This seemed to match every message and lots of messages were moved.   Can you add code that deletes or ignores these entries?   </p><p>Also trying to run this down in the filter log was irritating.  Can you have an option to see most recent filter applications first.   Would  make it easier to debug.   I can live with a large log taking a long time to load but having TO Page down hundreds of times is an issue.   Another option would be Go to end </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Stroh5885
