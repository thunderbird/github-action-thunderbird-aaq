Each time there's a major release, most of my add-ons are disabled and I have to wait to see if their author(s) are going to update them or if I should go back to the old version of TB until they're available.  I love the software and have many years worth of incoming and outgoing messages saved, so it's a great repository of information when supporting my customers.  Unfortunately, that also means it's harder to switch to an app that may have some of the missing features that I currently use add-ons for. </p><p>This strange part is that the availability of these buttons as selections in the Customize window actually existed previously, so I'm not sure why they were removed from there.
