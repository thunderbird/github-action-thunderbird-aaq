For example, if your mbox file is named ZZZ, rename it to XXX.  - copy the file into the Mail\Local Folders folder, overwriting the XXX file (note: you left the XXX.msf untouched). - repeat prior two steps for each message folder - start TB and the messages should appear in Local Folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
