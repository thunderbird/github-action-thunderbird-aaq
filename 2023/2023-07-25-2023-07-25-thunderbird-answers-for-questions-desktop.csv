In Account Settings, Outgoing Server (SMTP), you must have as many smtp servers as you have gmail accounts (same with non-gmail accounts).  They should have identical settings except for the User Name (and Description).  Then, select each account in the left pane of Account Settings and click the Outgoing Server (SMTP) drop-down in the right pane so that gmail account X is sending on smtp X, where the User Name for account X is the same as for smtp X. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
