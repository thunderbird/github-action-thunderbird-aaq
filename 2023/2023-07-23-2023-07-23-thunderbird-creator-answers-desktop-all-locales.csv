Firefox is easy - I just define different accounts for general, motorcycles &amp; cars Thunderbird seems easy with different accounts for 'business' (accountants &amp; lawyers), motorcycle club &amp; general. This makes backing up easy - mirror D: to a removeable drive. Now I realise that address books are not on D: and I cannot specify where to keep them.  ...yet they still appeared when I switched to a new laptop like this year and just copied the folders over. Magic!  Should I worry?   Does Thunderbird take care of this?  keeping backups of address books in the profile and copying them to C:\Users?  Then backing them up again in the profile as changes are made? Deeply puzzled Jem </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",jemini344

Before the upgrade, the ""All mail"", ""Trash"", ""sent mail"" etc were put into a subfolder in my account called ""gmail"". Also, if I created a tag called ""archive/info"" and ""archive""next"", Thunderbird interpreted this with creating a folder""archive"" with subfolders ""info"" and ""next"". Can I somehow make this work again? Or at least, can I somehow influence sorting of folders within the account? Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,cs,"",vojtech.polasek
