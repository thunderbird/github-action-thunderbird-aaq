The width of the columns cannot be reduced so it fits on a 1920 x 1080 pixel screen, see the first image. With extra LH column everything is moved further right, but no narrowing on columns, see the second image. </p><p>But if the LH column is widened the calendar columns are narrowed, but you still can't see the end of the week, see the third imageimage four. </p><p>Can it be arranged so that the default setting shows ALL the calendar columns? </p><p>This is Thunderbird 115.0 (64-bit) </p><p>I tried with Thunderbird 115.1. It now works better on a window 1920 pixels wide, but you still get this, image 4, (1080 pixel wide screen with very wide LH column), and this, image 5, (1080 pixel wide screen, not full screen, with narrow LH column) </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",Rogerh_1

Firefox is easy - I just define different accounts for general, motorcycles &amp; cars Thunderbird seems easy with different accounts for 'business' (accountants &amp; lawyers), motorcycle club &amp; general. This makes backing up easy - mirror D: to a removeable drive. Now I realise that address books are not on D: and I cannot specify where to keep them.  ...yet they still appeared when I switched to a new laptop like this year and just copied the folders over. Magic!  Should I worry?   Does Thunderbird take care of this?  keeping backups of address books in the profile and copying them to C:\Users?  Then backing them up again in the profile as changes are made? Deeply puzzled Jem </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1592328;,jemini344

Before the upgrade, the ""All mail"", ""Trash"", ""sent mail"" etc were put into a subfolder in my account called ""gmail"". Also, if I created a tag called ""archive/info"" and ""archive""next"", Thunderbird interpreted this with creating a folder""archive"" with subfolders ""info"" and ""next"". Can I somehow make this work again? Or at least, can I somehow influence sorting of folders within the account? Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,cs,"",vojtech.polasek
