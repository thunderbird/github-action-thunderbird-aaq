So then I migrated to Thunderibird version forty-something and web content in pages worked fine, but I had to enter my password for each of my 3 accounts in the default profile and enter it again when I sent a message. Several people online recommended deleting pkcs11.txt from the profile so I searched for this file. Deleting it fixed nothing, but there was still an instance at D:\Eudora(Thunderbird)Mail\chome_debugger_profile. Renaming that one did nothing either. C:\Users\John\Appdata\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles has two profiles, k7h2ze74.default dated 2011 and z2wlh2az.default-release dated 2/23/22 - the latter is surely the actual active profile. Is something in that profile directory supposed to point to the password storage location? When I am prompted for credentials, if I ask TB to save the password, it just hangs and never logs on to that account, which tells me TB is trying to write someplace that it has no permission or doesn't exist. </p><p>I am not willing to export my messages and then start with a fresh install because I have ~400 message filters, most of which handle spam. </p><p>The actual location of my messages is in subdirectories of D:\Eudora(Thunderbird)Mail and Thunderbird.exe is at  D:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird </p><p>There is a file profiles.ini in my ...\Roaming\Thunderbird directory which is below: [InstallC1263DE4EAE8A7E6] Default=D:\Eudora(Thunderbird)Mail </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/z2wlh2az.default-release </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default IsRelative=0 Path=D:\Eudora(Thunderbird)Mail Default=1 </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>[InstallB17E77F3210890EF] Default=Profiles/z2wlh2az.default-release Locked=1 </p><p>SOMETHING IS MESSED UP WITH THIS INSTALLATION.

Firefox is easy - I just define different accounts for general, motorcycles &amp; cars Thunderbird seems easy with different accounts for 'business' (accountants &amp; lawyers), motorcycle club &amp; general. This makes backing up easy - mirror D: to a removeable drive. Now I realise that address books are not on D: and I cannot specify where to keep them.  ...yet they still appeared when I switched to a new laptop like this year and just copied the folders over. Magic!  Should I worry?   Does Thunderbird take care of this?  keeping backups of address books in the profile and copying them to C:\Users?  Then backing them up again in the profile as changes are made? Deeply puzzled Jem </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1592328;1592530;1592543;1592671;,jemini344
