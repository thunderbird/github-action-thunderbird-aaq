Before the upgrade, the ""All mail"", ""Trash"", ""sent mail"" etc were put into a subfolder in my account called ""gmail"". Also, if I created a tag called ""archive/info"" and ""archive""next"", Thunderbird interpreted this with creating a folder""archive"" with subfolders ""info"" and ""next"". Can I somehow make this work again? Or at least, can I somehow influence sorting of folders within the account? Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,cs,"",vojtech.polasek
