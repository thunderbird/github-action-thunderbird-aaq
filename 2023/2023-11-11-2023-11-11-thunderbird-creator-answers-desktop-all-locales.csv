My emails and address books did not load. Eventually the emails appeared but after much trouble I still can't see the address books. I tried importing them and those that imported lost a lot of emails and also their names. This is serious for me as my hundreds of personal email addresses and several thousand other important ones are not accessible. I have been using Thunderbird for over 20 years and like it. Please stop mucking around with something that was working. I have wasted about 8 hours or more so far. I HATE the new version. Please tell me how to get my address books up or how to go back to the previous version. Thank you. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",vbivell

I have two IMAP accounts configured. </p><p>I set up a message filter rule to move messages from the Inbox to a specific folder based upon the subject.  That works fine.  Then I changed to rule to instead move the message to a folder on a different account.  That doesn't work.   </p><p>I can manually copy the email from the original account to the second account with no problem.  So, Thunderbird has no problem moving a message from one account to another.  But, it's not doing that when using a Message Filters rule. </p><p>I did look at the filter log.  Thunderbird is applying the filter to the message. </p><p>When I edited the rule to specify to move the message to a different account, Thunderbird listed both accounts and allowed me to select the folder on the second account.  That would seem to indicate that such an operation is valid.  So, is this problem a known limitation or issue with Thunderbird? </p><p>Does anyone know of any workaround? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mozilla474

But starting to see the software frequently hanging in the last week or two. Most often, things will be fine, and I'll go to bed. When I wake up, the software is hanging, no messages have been downloaded for hours, the cursor is a small blue spinning circle, and the program is not responding. I have to force-quit with task manager, start it up again, then it runs fine for several hours, before doing the same thing again. Just now, I found it hung again, without having to go to bed first. </p><p>I have no way of knowing if any email is being lost during this time or not, but I have no reason to think it is. The problem is not anything major (force quit, then reload is not a horrible inconvenience), but I'd like to avoid the problem. </p><p>Only recent change is I created a new gmail account because one place I like to receive emails from seems to be having problems with my own domains' emails, but they don't work with the gmail account either ... go figure. The new gmail account seems to have no problems sending or receiving emails for the most part, but since this problem started happening within the last couple of weeks, and I added the new email in the last couple of weeks, could be connected. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",jon135
