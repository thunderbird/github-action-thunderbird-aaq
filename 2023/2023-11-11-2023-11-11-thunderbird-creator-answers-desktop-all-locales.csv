1430693,2023-11-10 20:53:53 -0800,2023-11-10 20:54:16 -0800,Address Books,<p>Thunderbird upgraded itself to the latest version and I have had immense problems. My emails and address books did not load. Eventually the emails appeared but after much trouble I still can't see the address books. I tried importing them and those that imported lost a lot of emails and also their names. This is serious for me as my hundreds of personal email addresses and several thousand other important ones are not accessible. I have been using Thunderbird for over 20 years and like it. Please stop mucking around with something that was working. I have wasted about 8 hours or more so far. I HATE the new version. Please tell me how to get my address books up or how to go back to the previous version. Thank you. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",vbivell
