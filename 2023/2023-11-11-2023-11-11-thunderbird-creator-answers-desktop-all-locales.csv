My emails and address books did not load. Eventually the emails appeared but after much trouble I still can't see the address books. I tried importing them and those that imported lost a lot of emails and also their names. This is serious for me as my hundreds of personal email addresses and several thousand other important ones are not accessible. I have been using Thunderbird for over 20 years and like it. Please stop mucking around with something that was working. I have wasted about 8 hours or more so far. I HATE the new version. Please tell me how to get my address books up or how to go back to the previous version. Thank you. </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",vbivell

That doesn't work.   </p><p>I can manually copy the email from the original account to the second account with no problem.  So, Thunderbird has no problem moving a message from one account to another.  But, it's not doing that when using a Message Filters rule. </p><p>I did look at the filter log.  Thunderbird is applying the filter to the message. </p><p>When I edited the rule to specify to move the message to a different account, Thunderbird listed both accounts and allowed me to select the folder on the second account.
