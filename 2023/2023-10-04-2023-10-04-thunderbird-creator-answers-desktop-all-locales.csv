I don't post this because I enjoy it; I've handed out Linux distros at Software Freedom Day. But there comes a point when I have a right to be unhappy even with a free tool.  </p><p>The previous version of Thunderbird had a button under tools; I could delete all junk emails in one click. THIS IS MY MAIN REASON TO USE THUNDER BIRD. I run a business email and I get so much spam.  </p><p>But now that tool is gone in Supernova. I am left to deleting ONE junk email at a time which would take hours? Not to mention the safety aspects of this; I need to clean my emails so that my business partner who uses the computer doesn't fall for a scam.  </p><p>PLEASE PLEASE put this delete junk button under Tools back in. If not I have no choice but to look for a different email client. I can put in my own email sever settings.  Fine. I am not asking for an email client that molly coddles me. But this change is ridiculous.  </p><p>I can not under stand why Supernova has done this. </p>,privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",secretelf77

1426139,2023-10-03 20:04:11 -0700,2023-10-03 22:58:17 -0700,Several Suggestions.  [was Supernova menus - a bit of a mess],"<p>I've been using Thunderbird as my default mail client since it first came out. It's always been rock solid, and does what I expect of a mail program, manage my home email accounts and nothing more. The design has always been simple and well layed out. I have my folder list on the left, the folder preview/summary on top right, and actual highlighted email on botton right. </p><p>The new new menu layout is a bit of a mess. It now sits on the top of the Thunderbird window, above the file/edit/view menu, and can't be moved to below the file/edit/view menu. Every other program follows a defacto standard of default menu ontop, and custom menu's below file/edit/view. </p><p>It would be nicer still if I could move this new menu, to sit along side the (Inbox - Local Folders tab), there's all this dead space sitting there. (Where the new tabs sit, when I double click on a email.) </p><p>To be honest, where the menu originally sat, (above the message list) was more intuitive, as it applied to task you can apply to messages. </p><p>There's also the new ""+New Message"" button sitting at the top of the Folder Pane, yet the new menu uses ""Write"" instead of New Message, meaning no consistency. Is it Write or New Message. Also the ""New Message"" button looks out-of-place sitting there, and both buttons have different text pop-ups. ""New Message"" has Compose a new message, and ""Write"" has Create a new message. Again no consistency. </p><p>What would make more sense is instead of the ""New Message"" button sitting at the top of Folder pane, the ""Get Messsages"" button was there instead, as that has more relevance to the mail folders. (I just noticed that there is a small cloud icon sitting there that is the ""Get Messages"" button, but as it has no text I've never paid any attention to it, perhaps add some text to it, so that both buttons look like buttons, or both look like Icons. or an option to select text/icon/both.) </p><p>Further comment on the New Messages button area (at the top of the Folder pane). The space where that button sits, would be great to add other buttons/icons, ie: Address book, or better still combine the Spaces toolbar into this area, with on/off options for each icon. The spaces toolbar is pointless, a bar that runs the full height of the window for 5 icons. </p><p>Trevor.. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",mozilla457
