When I first opened program after update and tried to retrieve mail for one account (of5) got a window telling me password not accepted by pop server (at <a href=""http://zoho.com"" rel=""nofollow"">zoho.com</a>) and asking if i wished to enter a new one. Said no and went to passwords in config to check if they had transferred properly. They had. Tried again to download messages with same results (password not accepted)and clicked to enter new one. Instead window popped up for next account telling me password not accepted by server and did I want to enter a new one. Same results for every account in order without ever letting me access one. Rebooted - no change. Downloaded copy from mozilla and re-installed thinking it may reconfigure what was wrong. No luck. Now when I try to retrieve messages I don't even get password not accepted only ""done"" in bottom left corner where it usually shows download happening. I have used Thunderbird practically since it came out and have installed configured  and transferred accounts across many computers and never had any problem like this! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",divideweb
