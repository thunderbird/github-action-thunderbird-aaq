Sajnos letöltöttem, de szeretném visszállítani a korábbi 102-es változatot és annál újabbat soha le nem tölteni. Hogyan tudom úgy megtenni, hogy ne kelljen mindent elölről kezdenem?

This system always worked well, even when migrating profiles from one computer to another, with the associated changes to the operating systems; until, at some point corresponding to Thunderbird version 102, when starting Thunderbird from Windows, it started downloading all the thousands of messages from the various mail servers I use that had already been downloaded to the local computer (they are all POP accounts); This behaviour did not repeat itself when I was only using Windows and used Thunderbird from that OS for several days. However, when I accessed mail from the Linux OS (Ubuntu and Mageia), everything worked fine here, but when I go back to Windows after using Thunderbird from the Linux OS, Thunderbird starts downloading all the mail that had already been downloaded from all the servers.  </p><p>I have tried some suggestions for similar problems: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310598"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310598</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1392106"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1392106</a> However, by deleting the popstate.dat file or creating a new profile, the problem reoccurs regularly, no antivirus is active, the system is not infected by viruses. </p><p>The behaviour of Thunderbird is as follows 1) Thunderbird on Linux OS works regularly and only downloads new messages if there are any (no duplicates). 2) Thunderbird on Windows 10, however, if Thunderbird on Linux OS has retrieved messages from a particular mail server since the last time it was started, it will retrieve all the messages on that server again; if there have been no changes Thunderbird does not download anything correctly. </p><p>I tried looking at the popstate.dat files after downloading messages from Windows and Linux and I also noticed differences between the file when updated by Thunderbird on Windows or on Linux after downloading messages from the server. Normally, when you set up a new profile in Thunderbird, the messages are downloaded from the server and the popstate.dat file is generated and then updated, which is made up of a series of lines, each corresponding to a different message (each line is made up of a letter (in my case ""k"", because I leave the messages on the server), a series of numbers or characters (UIDL code), a series of numbers that I don't know what they correspond to (sometimes they are the same for some messages with a different progressive UIDL), the lines are reported in the file by arranging the messages in progressive order of UIDL code. In my case, when I use Thunderbird on Linux OS, the popstate.dat file is generated according to this behaviour and when it inherits the updated popstate.dat file from Windows, it keeps the third set of number codes of the messages already downloaded and continues to insert the lines with the new messages. Thunderbird on Windows, on the other hand, downloads all the messages again and generates a popstate.dat file in which the first letter and the UIDL code of each line remain the same, but the third set of numbers changes; the lines are also generated in the progressive order of the UIDL, except for one that is moved from a certain point in the order to the end of the list, without respecting the numerical order of the UIDL; the third set of numbers generated in this way also ""groups"" the messages in a different way from what was done before. The attached image shows the contents of the popstate.dat file in four cases described above: the first is generated by Thunderbird on Linux, the second is the same as updated by Thunderbird on Windows, the third is the same file as updated by Thunderbird on Linux after new messages arrive, the fourth is still the same file as updated by Thunderbird on Windows. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,"",FC-Lin-Moz

[was Supernova menus - a bit of a mess],"<p>I've been using Thunderbird as my default mail client since it first came out. It's always been rock solid, and does what I expect of a mail program, manage my home email accounts and nothing more. The design has always been simple and well layed out. I have my folder list on the left, the folder preview/summary on top right, and actual highlighted email on botton right. </p><p>The new new menu layout is a bit of a mess. It now sits on the top of the Thunderbird window, above the file/edit/view menu, and can't be moved to below the file/edit/view menu. Every other program follows a defacto standard of default menu ontop, and custom menu's below file/edit/view. </p><p>It would be nicer still if I could move this new menu, to sit along side the (Inbox - Local Folders tab), there's all this dead space sitting there. (Where the new tabs sit, when I double click on a email.) </p><p>To be honest, where the menu originally sat, (above the message list) was more intuitive, as it applied to task you can apply to messages. </p><p>There's also the new ""+New Message"" button sitting at the top of the Folder Pane, yet the new menu uses ""Write"" instead of New Message, meaning no consistency. Is it Write or New Message. Also the ""New Message"" button looks out-of-place sitting there, and both buttons have different text pop-ups. ""New Message"" has Compose a new message, and ""Write"" has Create a new message. Again no consistency. </p><p>What would make more sense is instead of the ""New Message"" button sitting at the top of Folder pane, the ""Get Messsages"" button was there instead, as that has more relevance to the mail folders. (I just noticed that there is a small cloud icon sitting there that is the ""Get Messages"" button, but as it has no text I've never paid any attention to it, perhaps add some text to it, so that both buttons look like buttons, or both look like Icons. or an option to select text/icon/both.) </p><p>Further comment on the New Messages button area (at the top of the Folder pane). The space where that button sits, would be great to add other buttons/icons, ie: Address book, or better still combine the Spaces toolbar into this area, with on/off options for each icon. The spaces toolbar is pointless, a bar that runs the full height of the window for 5 icons. </p><p>Trevor.. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",mozilla457
