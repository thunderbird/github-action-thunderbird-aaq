I'm not seeing anything on the bottom half of the screen, not even the message tool bar where you can delete, reply, etc.. </p><p>Strangely -- the very same thing happened to me six months back with a secondary account, but my primary account was unaffected.  So I was using the email interface with one email address (same domain name) which worked fine, while the secondary one only showed headers, and not the actual messages.  </p><p>NOW-- after this download, the secondary email address account is showing both the headers and the messages, while my primary account is only showing the headers. </p><p>PLEASE HELP.  Posted here six months ago for the previous time but never got any solution to the problem then.  Just lived with it, as it was a secondary email address, but I will have to leave Thunderbird if I can't get the primary address showing actual messages soon. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help! </p><p>Zach </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1608449;1609898;,zlevy

If I use webmail to do the same thing, no problems If I use an app on my phone to do the same thing, no problems. So I am pretty sure the issue is in Thunderbird.  </p><p>Also note this is a 'catch all' account - so the account is configured to be able to send from any address within the same domain, through a single configured identity. Any other addresses work fine. There's just one specific address that gives the problem. </p><p>I know I can easily save myself some headaches and change the email address, but I don't like having strange problems and want to figure out what is wrong. If anyone has any idea what could be going on or if you need more information, let me know. </p><p>Example error when sending <strong>from </strong>the address: </p><p>Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: Verification failed for &lt;someaddress@domain.com&gt; Sender verify failed. Please check the message recipient ""someaddress@domain.com"" and try again. </p><p>Example error when sending <strong>to</strong> the address: Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: No such recipient here. Please check the message recipient ""someaddress@domain.com"" and try again </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1608310;,Tosti

This system always worked well, even when migrating profiles from one computer to another, with the associated changes to the operating systems; until, at some point corresponding to Thunderbird version 102, when starting Thunderbird from Windows, it started downloading all the thousands of messages from the various mail servers I use that had already been downloaded to the local computer (they are all POP accounts); This behaviour did not repeat itself when I was only using Windows and used Thunderbird from that OS for several days. However, when I accessed mail from the Linux OS (Ubuntu and Mageia), everything worked fine here, but when I go back to Windows after using Thunderbird from the Linux OS, Thunderbird starts downloading all the mail that had already been downloaded from all the servers.  </p><p>I have tried some suggestions for similar problems: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310598"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310598</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1392106"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1392106</a> However, by deleting the popstate.dat file or creating a new profile, the problem reoccurs regularly, no antivirus is active, the system is not infected by viruses. </p><p>The behaviour of Thunderbird is as follows 1) Thunderbird on Linux OS works regularly and only downloads new messages if there are any (no duplicates). 2) Thunderbird on Windows 10, however, if Thunderbird on Linux OS has retrieved messages from a particular mail server since the last time it was started, it will retrieve all the messages on that server again; if there have been no changes Thunderbird does not download anything correctly. </p><p>I tried looking at the popstate.dat files after downloading messages from Windows and Linux and I also noticed differences between the file when updated by Thunderbird on Windows or on Linux after downloading messages from the server. Normally, when you set up a new profile in Thunderbird, the messages are downloaded from the server and the popstate.dat file is generated and then updated, which is made up of a series of lines, each corresponding to a different message (each line is made up of a letter (in my case ""k"", because I leave the messages on the server), a series of numbers or characters (UIDL code), a series of numbers that I don't know what they correspond to (sometimes they are the same for some messages with a different progressive UIDL), the lines are reported in the file by arranging the messages in progressive order of UIDL code. In my case, when I use Thunderbird on Linux OS, the popstate.dat file is generated according to this behaviour and when it inherits the updated popstate.dat file from Windows, it keeps the third set of number codes of the messages already downloaded and continues to insert the lines with the new messages. Thunderbird on Windows, on the other hand, downloads all the messages again and generates a popstate.dat file in which the first letter and the UIDL code of each line remain the same, but the third set of numbers changes; the lines are also generated in the progressive order of the UIDL, except for one that is moved from a certain point in the order to the end of the list, without respecting the numerical order of the UIDL; the third set of numbers generated in this way also ""groups"" the messages in a different way from what was done before. The attached image shows the contents of the popstate.dat file in four cases described above: the first is generated by Thunderbird on Linux, the second is the same as updated by Thunderbird on Windows, the third is the same file as updated by Thunderbird on Linux after new messages arrive, the fourth is still the same file as updated by Thunderbird on Windows. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",FC-Lin-Moz

This system always worked well, even when migrating profiles from one computer to another, with the associated changes to the operating systems; until, at some point corresponding to Thunderbird version 102, when starting Thunderbird from Windows, it started downloading all the thousands of messages from the various mail servers I use that had already been downloaded to the local computer (they are all POP accounts); This behaviour did not repeat itself when I was only using Windows and used Thunderbird from that OS for several days. However, when I accessed mail from the Linux OS (Ubuntu and Mageia), everything worked fine here, but when I go back to Windows after using Thunderbird from the Linux OS, Thunderbird starts downloading all the mail that had already been downloaded from all the servers.  </p><p>I have tried some suggestions for similar problems: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310598"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310598</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1392106"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1392106</a> However, by deleting the popstate.dat file or creating a new profile, the problem reoccurs regularly, no antivirus is active, the system is not infected by viruses. </p><p>The behaviour of Thunderbird is as follows 1) Thunderbird on Linux OS works regularly and only downloads new messages if there are any (no duplicates). 2) Thunderbird on Windows 10, however, if Thunderbird on Linux OS has retrieved messages from a particular mail server since the last time it was started, it will retrieve all the messages on that server again; if there have been no changes Thunderbird does not download anything correctly. </p><p>I tried looking at the popstate.dat files after downloading messages from Windows and Linux and I also noticed differences between the file when updated by Thunderbird on Windows or on Linux after downloading messages from the server. Normally, when you set up a new profile in Thunderbird, the messages are downloaded from the server and the popstate.dat file is generated and then updated, which is made up of a series of lines, each corresponding to a different message (each line is made up of a letter (in my case ""k"", because I leave the messages on the server), a series of numbers or characters (UIDL code), a series of numbers that I don't know what they correspond to (sometimes they are the same for some messages with a different progressive UIDL), the lines are reported in the file by arranging the messages in progressive order of UIDL code. In my case, when I use Thunderbird on Linux OS, the popstate.dat file is generated according to this behaviour and when it inherits the updated popstate.dat file from Windows, it keeps the third set of number codes of the messages already downloaded and continues to insert the lines with the new messages. Thunderbird on Windows, on the other hand, downloads all the messages again and generates a popstate.dat file in which the first letter and the UIDL code of each line remain the same, but the third set of numbers changes; the lines are also generated in the progressive order of the UIDL, except for one that is moved from a certain point in the order to the end of the list, without respecting the numerical order of the UIDL; the third set of numbers generated in this way also ""groups"" the messages in a different way from what was done before. The attached image shows the contents of the popstate.dat file in four cases described above: the first is generated by Thunderbird on Linux, the second is the same as updated by Thunderbird on Windows, the third is the same file as updated by Thunderbird on Linux after new messages arrive, the fourth is still the same file as updated by Thunderbird on Windows. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1608267;1608286;,FC-Lin-Moz

[was Supernova menus - a bit of a mess],"<p>I've been using Thunderbird as my default mail client since it first came out. It's always been rock solid, and does what I expect of a mail program, manage my home email accounts and nothing more. The design has always been simple and well layed out. I have my folder list on the left, the folder preview/summary on top right, and actual highlighted email on botton right. </p><p>The new new menu layout is a bit of a mess. It now sits on the top of the Thunderbird window, above the file/edit/view menu, and can't be moved to below the file/edit/view menu. Every other program follows a defacto standard of default menu ontop, and custom menu's below file/edit/view. </p><p>It would be nicer still if I could move this new menu, to sit along side the (Inbox - Local Folders tab), there's all this dead space sitting there. (Where the new tabs sit, when I double click on a email.) </p><p>To be honest, where the menu originally sat, (above the message list) was more intuitive, as it applied to task you can apply to messages. </p><p>There's also the new ""+New Message"" button sitting at the top of the Folder Pane, yet the new menu uses ""Write"" instead of New Message, meaning no consistency. Is it Write or New Message. Also the ""New Message"" button looks out-of-place sitting there, and both buttons have different text pop-ups. ""New Message"" has Compose a new message, and ""Write"" has Create a new message. Again no consistency. </p><p>What would make more sense is instead of the ""New Message"" button sitting at the top of Folder pane, the ""Get Messsages"" button was there instead, as that has more relevance to the mail folders. (I just noticed that there is a small cloud icon sitting there that is the ""Get Messages"" button, but as it has no text I've never paid any attention to it, perhaps add some text to it, so that both buttons look like buttons, or both look like Icons. or an option to select text/icon/both.) </p><p>Further comment on the New Messages button area (at the top of the Folder pane). The space where that button sits, would be great to add other buttons/icons, ie: Address book, or better still combine the Spaces toolbar into this area, with on/off options for each icon. The spaces toolbar is pointless, a bar that runs the full height of the window for 5 icons. </p><p>Trevor.. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",mozilla457

I transferred my TB (v 115.3.1 64) Profiles folder to OneDrive because I couldn't find a way to automatically back it up. However I wasn't able to make TB work so I transferred it back into Appdata\Roaming\Thunderbird. Now when I open TB, it has an old folder structure and emails up to 2020 but nothing beyond in any folder. The default profile is big, 25 GB or so. The setup is fine as it connects to my ISP and downloads current emails and those stored on the server. How can I recover the recent profile? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1608153;,rosseddy
