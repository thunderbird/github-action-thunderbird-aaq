I have several problems with folders from several mailboxes not showing in their respective category. For example, inbox that doesn't show in ""inbox"" category, Junk folder not in ""junk"" category, and so on.  I think all of them are caused by thunderbird not being able to recognize the kind of each folder in different mailboxes, because of different providers and their settings. I have accounts in major providers such as Google and Yahoo, but also have several independent (i.e. business or work) accounts. One of the most striking example of this trouble is one university account that has all it's folders (sent, junk etc) organized under it's inbox. This was showing ok in the previous versions (junk was ""junk"" category) but now I get all folders (as subfolders) in the ""inbox"" category, under the account's name. </p><p>I attach screenshot from unified inbox.

I have done a new installation from scratch of Thunderbird 102.5.0 (64-bit). Everything seems to be working except that it does not play a notification sound when new mail arrives.

I have quintuple checked that the option to play a sound is selected, I am using the system default sound, I have gone into about:config and made sure  condstore  is false, and I still do not get a notification sound after restarting Thunderbird or rebooting the system (Windows). I have also tried the add-on ""Mailbox Alert"", and it also is not giving me a notification for all mail.  (It might be working for one of my ""send the message to"" local folders.)  But I shouldn't have to do this, Thunderbird should work correctly ""out of the box"".  I am using IMAP as the connection method to <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>. Thunderbird is always running while the PC is on, in minimized state. One odd thing, though: when I maximize Thunderbird to see if there is any new mail, and I see that there is, I read it.  I then minimize the application, and a second or so later the notification DOES play.  It doesn't make any sense, and it certainly does not do any good, for the notification to play AFTER reading new mail. So: does anyone have any new information on fixing this problem since the previous fixes were posted? I've done web searches for fixes and have found many articles, and have tried everything everyone has suggested, but there is no fix. I'm willing to try working with Mailbox Alert more, but I'd really prefer the problem to be fixed properly at the source.
