I have two questions, one of which is possibly a bug. </p><p>1. The new layout places a lot of buttons in the window title. How do I remove them? I'd like a standard window title like most of the other app (say, Okular) have. </p><p>2. My window manager works with focus-follows-mouse, and a window is raised whenever I click on the window borders or title. With Thunderbird 115 that doesn't work anymore: if the Thunderbird window is partly below some other window, and I click on its borders or title, it is *not* raised. How to fix this? Should I report a bug? </p><p>Cheers! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",pglpm
