I suppose the other 6 are in sub-subfolders and beyond but I can't see where. Maybe I could expand the entire folder tree but I don't want to do that because I have about 173 folders.

I have several problems with folders from several mailboxes not showing in their respective category. For example, inbox that doesn't show in ""inbox"" category, Junk folder not in ""junk"" category, and so on.  I think all of them are caused by thunderbird not being able to recognize the kind of each folder in different mailboxes, because of different providers and their settings. I have accounts in major providers such as Google and Yahoo, but also have several independent (i.e. business or work) accounts. One of the most striking example of this trouble is one university account that has all it's folders (sent, junk etc) organized under it's inbox. This was showing ok in the previous versions (junk was ""junk"" category) but now I get all folders (as subfolders) in the ""inbox"" category, under the account's name. </p><p>I attach screenshot from unified inbox. Note that the inbox from one account is missing and in another account all folders are under inbox. </p>",fix-problems;tb115;tb115unified;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1604803;,eleni.gioti
