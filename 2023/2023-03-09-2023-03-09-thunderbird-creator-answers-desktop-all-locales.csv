Premetto che prima di aprire questa descrizione ho provato a fare una ricerca, ma quello che ho trovato non mi sembrava la stessa mia problematica e pertanto ho optato per una discussione ex novo. Se mi dovesse essere sfuggito qualcosa mi scuso. La problematica, molto semplicemente è questa: Thunderbird, quando scrivo un nuovo messaggio di posta, si blocca quando devo inserire i destinatari nel suo campo specifico. Cosa significa che si blocca? Che, per circa 20 secondi, l'applicazione smette di rispondere (col relativo classico avviso di Windows) e poi riprende a funzionare. Se però modifico/aggiungo un destinatario, Thunderbird si blocca di nuovo, rendendo particolarmente frustrante l'invio di mail. Ho provato a cancellare la cache di avvio ma il problema persiste. La versione di Thunderbird è la 102.8.0 per Windows 11 Pro versione 22H2.  Resto a completa disposizione e ringrazio in anticipo per tutto il supporto.

So far, the only way I've found to move a message to a folder is quite ponderous. First I have to bring the message up in its own tab. Then I have to right click on the appropriate part of the message body. Then move the mouse way down to ""move to"". Then I have to select the email account- same one the message is already in, but this does NOT default. Then a sub folder, and finally the target folder itself. All this by mouse movement, not clicking.  </p><p>If I'm lucky, the folder I want is the same as the last message I filed (very unlikely) or available within Recents, saving me one or two layers of sub-menu expansion.  </p><p>There's also another method, which starts by selecting ""message"", then ""move to"", then all the rest as described above. (Sadly, I can no longer find that UI; I think it's accessed by doing 2 successive right clicks on a different part of the message tab.) </p><p>Are there any easier options available? If so, how do I enable them? </p><p>For example, it would be helpful to have ""move to"" as one of the buttons in the tool bar, along with ""reply"", ""replay all"" etc. Even having it accessed from ""More"" would be better than the right click. Better still if it had a form that pre-selected the same (only) email account, rather than requiring me to select between that and local storage. </p><p>Note for the record: I'm using Thunderbird on linux; IIRC, the Thunderbird UI is not entirely consistent across operating systems. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1569842;,DinoNerd

This is what happens: 1) If I fill in From myname and To hisname, the email in our inbox has myname  for both From and Recipient (and vice versa) 2) Worse, if I fill in both From and To with ""Hisname and Myname"" (the default identity), the email in our inbox has Hisname as both the From and Recipient 3) Worst of all, whoever is  the latest From , becomes the Recipient of all the emails in our inbox that have been received since adding the identities. </p><p>Note: I just  1) deleted the address book listings and all the identities except for the default ""Hisname and Myname""  --&gt; """"Hisname and Myname"" as From and Recipient of ALL emails, not just the more recent one 2) then I tried adding Myname back to the address book and wrote an email with customized Hisname in the To field and Myname in the To field --&gt;  all emails now show Myname as both the From and Recipient.  So, it appears that the name is being drawn from the address book rather than using the default identity. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1569806;1569857;1569885;1569917;1569960;,nonpsvdl

My name is Jackson, currently hoping to use Thunderbird Calendar. I like the feature of adding an attendee in an event (see picture). However, I failed to search all the event involving a specific attendee. I could search an event by its keyword in title or description, but not attendee (see the picture). I am wondering how to achieve this? </p><p>In the attached picture, I hope when I search the name ""Attendee 1"", there will be a list of events, which contains attendee ""Attendee 1"". If I put the name ""Attendee 1"" in event title, or in the notes, there will be search results with events including ""Attendee 1"". </p><p>Best, Jackson </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",user32969950103848662083048409910914702542

Made a back-up of the Ventura operating system on Time machine and re-installed Monterey. Then I re-installed Thunderbird on my computer. Now I want to migrate my thunderbird content, in particular the addressbook, from USB storage (Timemachine) to operating Thunderbird. </p><p>...
