It may be that as I get used to it I will find some of the new features helpful, but right now I am more concerned about what was taken away that was helpful: </p><pre>   a) I keep getting 'not responding' -- especially when trying to set my theme 'yet again (and again, and again)!!!!  I am mostly shut-in due to illness and the themes make a difference emotionally compared to a stark 'black and white'.  Furthermore, what is the point of having TB themes when they don't hold -- I often have to re-set mine several times a day </pre> <pre>   b) tabs are now hidden -- I need to colour-code messages so I know which I need to get back to soon or can wait. Having them hidden under that new right arrow makes extra steps to do so </pre> <pre>   c) the row of custom colours no longer hold: what is the point of being able set a row of custom colour if they don't hold!!!  I used different colours to indicate different responses in a thread -- thereby having an immediate way to see the order of responses. </pre> <pre>   d) I need layers of sub-folders -- often to add a new name to a group I belong to, or a new year.  I have been asking again and again over several years for the ability to create a new sub-folder WHILE one is moving an email from the inbox to a folder or sub-folder.  Having to 'go' to the folder first, make a new sub-subfolder, return to the inbox, and then move the email is an unnecessary waste of time.  </pre> <pre>   e) 'a picture says a thousand words' -- emojs are so useful in this way, especially when one is tired or can't think of the right words to say.  This feature was taken away years ago, and I wish that TB would bring it back.  The minimal 'yellow faces' are minimal useful. </pre> <pre>   I am not techy enough to really understand what you have written below - what is a 'message context menu' and 'mock-ups'.  However, it seems to me that the TB functons (at least the ones that I need) are getting less and less useful and increasing 'cognitive burden'. </pre> <pre>   Sorry to be so negative, but I do wonder who TB is trying to please/appease -- it is not this user. </pre> <pre>   Blessings </pre>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1635408;,quaternalmoon131

One is as a flexible protocol for moving mail between clients and servers. The other is as a rigid way to create a sort of view-port into a server, where it only shows messages that are on the server and treats the local copies as a temporary cache. The former approach is by far more appropriate for a public ISP server, while the latter is more suited to a corporate office where IT controls the mail and has legal obligations to manage it on a server.  </p><p>It appears to me that Thunderbird's IMAP is only the corporate kind -- it synchronizes with the server but does not keep mail that the server deletes. Hence in order to use it with persistent mail, you need a server that keeps all of your mail on it reliably and feeds it up.  </p><p>Enter Yahoo!, once upon a time a major SAAS player. Yahoo! has a webmail product. It also has POP and IMAP, sort of. But they're completely and totally enschyttified the IMAP. There are two HUGE things that make it no longer work with T'bird. One is that they've limited the IMAP to 10,000 messages. Older messages are still there on their web mail, but they are no longer accessible on IMAP. So unless you've used POP to download them into a separate mailbox, bye bye mail. This would not be a problem if T'bird allowed one-way sync, wherein it downloaded the messages from the IMAP server and KEPT THEM no matter what the server did. But I don't see how to do that.The only hack I know of is to filter them and have the filter copy to another folder. But in practice that is NOT reliable. Many messages did not get filtered, perhaps because the other folder is already saving messages in POP, the only workaround that works.  </p><p>The second enschyttification of Yahoo! is that its spam filtering is now utterly persistent. That is, you can go in on the web site or in IMAP and mark it not spam and move it to the INBOX, but within five minutes it WILL be put back in the spam folder. They think it's spam and nothing you tell them will change their mind! This happens so fast that POP may not even catch the message before its next cycle. So again, being able to move it to the IMAP inbox and have it STAY there is vital to making IMAP useful again. </p><p>Please don't tell me this violates the IMAP protocol spec. It doesn't - the protocol is a flexible tool. </p><p>Any chance this is possible in T'bird 102 or, less likely, 115? Or might it be a viable suggestion for some future version once it's stable or rebuilt again? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",fred37

Is there a way to change the density of the headers in individual emails?  Compact Density view gets the overall inbox back to how I want it, without wasting space and showing fewer email on the visible screen.  However, inside an individual email there seems to be a lot of wasted space between each line of the header (From, To, Reply To, and Subject).  If we had a ""compact"" view for the headers, it would allow us to see a little more of each email on the screen.   </p><p>Or maybe the real problem is the new tabbed email?  I can't remember exactly what my emails looked like before the upgrade, but I just know they look different now and the tab bars and menu bars above the individual email look odd.  Whether or not the new version affected the visible vertical area of individual emails, I think we need a way to view a single email in ""full screen,"" without all the menu bars.  Currently, if we right-click on the tab for an individual email and select ""move to new window,"" the entire program with tabs opens in a new window (Inbox tab, Tab with the email).  It doesn't change the single tab into a new window the way ""move to new window"" on an internet browser tab does. </p><p>So can you please look at doing something to allow us be able to see more of an email on the screen without having to zoom out and making the text too hard to read? </p><p>I am attaching a screenshot which shows the header with the wasted space and also the picture which cannot be viewed in full on my short-but-wide laptop screen.  Compacting the header would help some but not a lot.  Opening the email in it's own window without the tab bar would help more, and being able to make that window full-screen (without the menu bars showing in green on my picture) would help a LOT. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1607846;1607862;1607864;,ajp1228

Control-down does not scroll down smoothly any more to select a large number of highlighted messages for deletion. I have to do it in very small batches. I can manage this but it is time-consuming. When I have selected a block of messages, I press the delete button, and I get the cautionary warning that the deletions will be permanent. But there is no way to answer in the affirmative. Also the ""don't ask me again"" box does not respond to my mouse click, even though I don't really care whether I am asked again or not. There is no way to use that little interface to actually delete the files.

I have (or had) folders where I keep archives of all work-related emails for all of my clients.    I had one folder for each of my clients.  After I read emails in my inbox, I move them to the relevant client folder to archive them.  These folders have email archives going back for several years. </p><p>Just now I was reading emails in my inbox, then moving them to folders for archival, by dragging and dropping them into the relevant client folder.  I had just finished reading an email and was about to drag/drop it into a folder for archival, and the folders were gone.   There was a top-level folder called ""Active Projects"".  There were sub-folders within the ""Active Projects"" folder - one for each client.  </p><p>Not ALL folders have disappeared.  Only the Active Projects folder has disappeared. </p><p>But,...  I alt-clicked on an email in my inbox to get the pop-up window with a bunch of options for things to do with the email.  I could select Move To -&gt; Recent -&gt; and the nested window that shows recent folders pops up, and it shows the client folders and I can (apparently) move emails to the client folders.  But I can't see the folders. </p><p>Please help!  This is years of work history.  Any suggestions for how to get the Active Project folder and all of my client sub-folders to reappear? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1607897;,clintoconner2
