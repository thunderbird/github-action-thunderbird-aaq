(I found out when I tried to find the message in the history) I checked with the supplier <a href=""http://home.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">home.pl</a> and according to their technicians there is no problem on their side. According to <a href=""http://home.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">home.pl</a>, the problem lies with Thunderbird and probably with the program's internal settings. It is possible that emails are archived to a file every 30 days (<a href=""http://home.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">home.pl</a> opinion) However, I don't remember setting up Thunderbird this way. Please help me how to recover or possibly find a file containing e-mails that disappeared only from my inbox.

Thunderbird is supposed to be customizeable - but I cannot find a way of fixing this.  It seems that only the type of the emails themselves can be altered.

I just can't get them to show in TB, even with manually installing them in the .thunderbird folder. </p><p>I do not know what version I was using before Linux failed, but it was not too old - I was performing regular updates - but was also not 115. I have presently installed 109 Beta, but can change to whatever version will work. </p><p>Is there a way to get the Import to recognize this old profile (it has a .IETimport suffix) or alternately, manually transfer it so it can be found? </p><p>Let me know whatever other information is needed.
