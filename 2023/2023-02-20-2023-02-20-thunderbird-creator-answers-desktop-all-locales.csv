That means I've missed out on all the recent goodness of updated icons and UI with the default themes, and have a bunch of layout issues I'd like to fix.  </p><p>However the old folder structure of userchrome etc seems to have been deprecated - I can't find a trace of the old css files that I manually installed for that old theme I used. Which means I can't find the backup default userchrome folder, or delete the old theme files I manually installed. In fact I can't find any .css files in my Tbird user profile directory, which is weird. </p><p>So how can I reset all the UI CSS to default so visually I'm using the current default Tbird theme? I can see that this works fine when I create a new profile and try that - it looks great! But I don't want to lose my 12 mail accounts and other config options by deleting my main profile completely and reconfiguring from scratch.

Opening messages in new tabs just created blank tabs, and sometimes, the window got into a state where trying to size it from any border immediately crashed the window.  I installed TB on a new machine this morning, and at first, all worked.  But after a reboot, I started seeing the same problems on my new machine! </p><p>After dozens of crashes, changing profiles, safe mode, etc., I was just about to give up, but then I tried to start TB in ""Elevated Mode"".  Our company uses PowerBroker, and starting ""Run Elevated"" a program gives it higher levels of permissions (not admin but something between user and admin).  Voila.  All of a sudden, TB is working again as it used to years before.  There seems to be either a serious defect in PowerBroker, Windows or TB, but this defect is probably too rare that it'll get fixed. </p><p>So I hope anyone else using TB and PowerBroker can confirm a similar problem and my solution! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1567224;,alexanderamperez
