You may need to unselect and reselect unified toolbars. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0

Unfortunately my attempt didn't help. </p> <ul><li> I followed the steps and scrolled down to 'profile folder'  then click 'open folder' and a Mac Finder window opened with a single folder named ""k7815xkh.default"".   </li><li> I quit TB  </li><li> I renamed this folder changing one letter.   </li><li> I then re-opened TB and got an error message ""<em>Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible</em>"" (attached image) then TB quits without rebuilding/recreating the mailboxes, unfortunately. </li></ul> <p>I reverted the folder name back to the original and TB opened as normal with empty InBox and no ""Choose"" option in the properties.
