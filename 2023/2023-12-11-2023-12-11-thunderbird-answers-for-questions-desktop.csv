That's not a criticism, just acknowledging that complex software can never be fully tested because the combinations of steps would be in the thousands. Ver 115 gets better with each release and I feel comfortable with it and I like the new layout and features. There is much new code to replace a mess of overlapping and clumsy code that has amassed over two decades. If you're comfortable with 102, there is no rush, but at some point, you will need to make the jump. Before doing, be sure to do a full backup, if only to be safe.

I need more instruction and education on how to navigate this Thunderbird. Are there any learning videos? Your answer did not solve my problem. The account in the left sidebar has my gmail account which I want to use. I want to start from scratch to use my gmail account as my server and not mailfence.

If so, and if the main pane is only showing thunerbird, then click 'account settings' and scroll down the left side, which should show your gmail account and possibly remnants of the mailfence account. It may help if you post a screenshot of what you see on the 'account settings' pane. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I do not know how to do a screen shot on a laptop. What I am wanting is to set up Thunderbird from the start with my gmail account. Unfortunately I have set it up using a new email account with mailfence that has now expired, This has left me with Thunderbird set up with outgoing server mailfence and in Server Settings the server name is <a href=""http://imap.mailfence.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mailfence.com</a> I do not know what to change it to as I do not know gmail's server name. </p><p>I am concerned that the mailfence email is recorded in places that I do not know about and will miss if i try to manually edit all the boxes. </p><p>how can I start again using gmail?

The default is IMAP, but you can override that - I suggest NOT including password during the setup, even though prompted for it.  - Google should prompt for your id and password and then should show an 'allow' button. once clicked, it should then authorize the account.  - once you have the gmail account, you can delete the mailfence account. You can do that by  - highlighting the mailfence account on main pane, rightclick and select 'settings', and then scroll down left side to 'Account Actions' - click there and the 'remove account' option appears. click and you're done. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
