That's not a criticism, just acknowledging that complex software can never be fully tested because the combinations of steps would be in the thousands. Ver 115 gets better with each release and I feel comfortable with it and I like the new layout and features. There is much new code to replace a mess of overlapping and clumsy code that has amassed over two decades. If you're comfortable with 102, there is no rush, but at some point, you will need to make the jump. Before doing, be sure to do a full backup, if only to be safe. Ver 115 has some menu changes and that has annoyed some, but they're quickly learned. You're right; filters did NOT change a bit. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
