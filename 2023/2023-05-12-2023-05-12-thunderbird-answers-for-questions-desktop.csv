I suggest trying a text editor, such as the free notepad++ or whatever other you prefer. For example, Notepad++ has a simple Edit&gt;blank operations&gt;EOL to space that does it quickly.

This was the incoming “<a href=""http://pop.secureserver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.secureserver.net</a>” of the old email.  The outgoing was “<a href=""http://smtpout.secureserver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtpout.secureserver.net</a>”. I assume that mean it is POP server.  When provider change to Microsoft 365 over night my email quit working. I called and they made changes so I could keep using my email. Later they sent (caned) email saying I needed to make changes so I could get my email.  I though that I didn’t need to because I already talked to them.  After doing searches on Thunderbird support, I backed up my email (I hope), and removed one account. Then I added it back and it download “Owl for Exchange” and finished up.  At first it looked good so I did the rest of my accounts.  Later I discovered the problems.  I then copied the files back to the email folders.  They were there but very soon they were removed.  I still have the backups. When I right click on any of the items in the Folder Pane there is no option to Subscribe nor Refresh. I did not remove the Gmail account. I’m not sure but seems most of the Gmail maybe all are on the web, but the local Gmail is all gone. In the past all my email was in Thunderbird till I deleted them.  I move them into folders in Thunderbird and they were there till changes were made.  The old folder inside Thunderbird are all gone and replace with Archive, Bulk Mail, Conversation History, Email_Templates, Send_Later.  I think I did have Archive folder, but not sure.

As you originally had a POP account it would have stored all your emails automatically on your computer in mbox files and it was not necessary to remove it.

There is also no mbox file of same name which is odd. </p><p>Instead the 'ChickasawDust' folder has a load of files which looks like yet another pop account of unknown name.

It was like they didn't want to help at all.  And when they did reply, it was at least 5 minutes between every response.  I have been working for hours on my problem (some of that wasted time with GoDaddy).  I was doing password changes across all my internet accounts; one of them being my email address associated with GoDaddy.  This account appeared to be fine BUT I can access this account from within TB or on my iphone.  I generally look on my iphone and delete unimportant stuff and only download to my computer via TB when there is something that I truly need to deal with, so I can't say for sure that I have tried a download on TB since May 12th.  I tried following the instructions in the link provided above by rnicholas.  When I get to the end of the instructions and click ""Done"", the dialogue box ""Set Up Your Existing Email Address"" has a grey(er) box in the middle of this dialogue box which says ""Checking password..."".  Next to it is a spinning blue partial circle.  It was spinning for quite a while so I left it to have supper.  Unfortunately, it is still spinning.  Clicking the ""Done"" button also created a GoDaddy screen with the very top bar saying:  Enter credentials for &lt;email address&gt; on <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>  At this point, the only option is to click ""cancel"" and be unsuccessful in configuring my GoDaddy email as per <a href=""https://uit.stanford.edu/service/office365/configure/thunderbird-oauth2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://uit.stanford.edu/service/office365/configure/thunderbird-oauth2</a>  Anybody have any idea what is going on?  </blockquote> <p>What version of Thunderbird are you on? </p>",stancestans,false,1,0

It's TB's inbuilt/embedded web browser, but it borrows heavily from the Firefox project. It's not tied to or dependent on your Firefox installation in any way. In fact, the pop up will still open if you don't have Firefox installed. Just a note to remember that your Firefox installation is completely separate from that pop up and to regard them as such, because I've seen people trying to fix TB problems by tinkering with Firefox, while they don't even use Firefox as their browser! The newest Firefox is 116.0.3 BTW. </p> <em><p>don162 <a href=""#answer-1599816"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>I am at a loss what to try next.  My Firefox and TB are up to date.

Don </blockquote> <p>I don't have a GoDaddy account, so I haven't encountered the exact same thing, but I have had my fair share of Microsoft (Office) 365 OAuth2 problems with personal Outlook accounts. This was mostly due to Microsoft 365 not supporting OAuth2 for personal Outlook accounts, but after coming back to this thread a few days ago, I tried again on TB v115 just to see if things had changed, and they have indeed. Implementing OAuth2 for MS 365 on TB has been a work in progress and my recent findings confirm that things are getting better. I was using an app password with Normal Password authentication all along, which was less ideal, but I'm happy to report that's not the case any more. I had to remove the Outlook accounts and add them afresh on Thunderbird, because simply changing them to OAuth2 in Account Settings didn't work. I also noticed the url for the OAuth2 pop up was different for the existing account versus adding the accounts afresh. I will do some more investigations into MS 365 Oauth2 in TB 102 vs 115, for future responses to similar threads, but for now, I highly recommend you upgrade to TB 115.
