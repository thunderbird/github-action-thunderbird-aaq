I have set TB to ask me whether to compact when 100 MB would be saved.  This has worked fine for years.  Since December, I receive a pop-up advising that 237 MB or slightly more can be saved.  After compacting, the message repeats every hour or two.   </p><p>Compacting is actually, working except for the 237 MB chunk of data that either can't be compacted or doesn't really exist and fools TB into thinking compaction is needed.  For example, if I set the compaction threshold to 500 MB then the mailbox will grow and I will eventually receive a reminder to compact when more than 500 MB can be saved.  Compacting at that point does indeed shrink the mailbox.  But, immediately thereafter, if I set the threshold back to 100 MB I get a message that 237 MB can be saved by compacting.

Not captured by sent folder.,"<p>Third party application(NAPA Tracs) changed their email method to send using their own email send via IMAP using Microsoft 365 servers. Email goes to the targeted recipient, and a copy goes to sent mail folder in Microsoft 365 web based email sent folder.  Thunderbird no longer retrieves/receives a copy of that sent mail to place it in it's sent mail folder.   That third party switched its logic with the latest release in Feb 2023 to stop sending using Thunderbird directly and send to the 365 IMAP server.  Until that time all email sent by third party were captured in the Thunderbird sent folder. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1568271;1568347;1568394;1568399;1569324;1570223;1570227;1570378;1570641;,DonInfoSys
