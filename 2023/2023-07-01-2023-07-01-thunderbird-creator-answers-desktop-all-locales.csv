I am reaching out to seek assistance with two recurring problems I have been experiencing while using Thunderbird as my email client.

In the `Thunderbird Add-ons Manager`, there is no metion of them on the `Dictionaries` section. The only Dictionaries there are ones I installed recently using the [usual page](<a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/language-tools/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/language-tools/</a>), such as `Spell checker for es-ES`.  - While I can find the English variants I want to get rid of listed in said page, it only gives me the option to install dictionaries and language packages, not remove them.  - In the `Languages` section of the `Thunderbird Add-ons Manager`, there are a bunch of language packs installed that I do not need, including Afrikaans, Arabic, etc. I have no recollection of why I have them or how or when I got them. </p><p><br> I'm using Fedora release 37 (Thirty Seven), Kernel version `6.3.8-100.fc37.x86_64` </p><p>According to `dnf info` my current version of Thunderbird is: </p><p>``` Name        &nbsp;: thunderbird Version     &nbsp;: 102.12.0 Release     &nbsp;: 1.fc37 Architecture&nbsp;: x86_64 Size        &nbsp;: 276 M Source      &nbsp;: thunderbird-102.12.0-1.fc37.src.rpm Repository  &nbsp;: @System From repo   &nbsp;: updates Packager    &nbsp;: Fedora Project Installed by&nbsp;: User &lt;user&gt; ``` As for `localectl status`, it returns  </p><p>```  </p><pre>  System Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8                  LC_NUMERIC=sv_SE.UTF-8                  LC_TIME=sv_SE.UTF-8                  LC_MONETARY=sv_SE.UTF-8                  LC_PAPER=sv_SE.UTF-8                  LC_MEASUREMENT=sv_SE.UTF-8       VC Keymap: es      X11 Layout: es </pre> <p>``` </p><p>Which is exactly as I want it, for my own reasons. </p><p>- Mozzilla's support website has [a page ostensibly explaining how to uninstall add-ons](<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/policies-extensions-locked"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/policies-extensions-locked</a>) if [the usual way](<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_how-do-i-uninstall-an-add-on"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions#w_how-do-i-uninstall-an-add-on</a>) doesn't work. I followed it as best I could, going to the `Help` menu, entering `Troubleshoot mode...`, pressed `Restart`, and went to `Troubleshooting information`, and found out the following: </p><pre>   - The binaries are stored in `/usr/lib64/thunderbird/thunderbird`    - The profile folder is stored in `~/.thunderbird/i0olk7xh.default-release/`    - The add-ons listed do not include the excessive English variant dictionaries as `dictionary`. They do, however, list all those unnecessary locales, under the `Type` `locale` and the `version` `102.12.0buildid20230604.001933`, currently with the `Enabled` flag set to `false`.     - However, the extension names they are listed as, such as `langpack-af@thunderbird.mozilla.org` for Afrikaans or `langpack-br@thunderbird.mozilla.org`, are not present in the folder `/.thunderbird/i0olk7xh.default-release/extensions/`, where they should normally be, and where the other extensions I did install myself are. Instead, there is an extension archive named {139a120b-c2ea-41d2-bf70-542d9f063dfd}.xpi which contains the following file structure: </pre> <p>``` background.js   common.js  _locales       manual.html       preferences.js changelog.html  icons      manifest.json  preferences.html </p><p>``` </p><p>In turn, `_locales` contains  </p><p>``` bg     da     es_ES  fr     it     nl     pt_PT  sr     uk_UA ca_AD  de     fa_IR  hr_HR  ja_JP  pl     ru_RU  sv_SE  zh_CN cs_CZ  en_US  fi     hu_HU  ko_KR  pt_BR  sk_SK  tr     zh_TW ``` </p><p>I tried deleting those and restarting Tunderbird. In fact, I even accidentally deleted the whole `.xpi` archive. _There was no discernable effect._ Even though the locales are deactivated, when I try to write a new message, the same problem persists: an overwhelming number of English variants in the spellcheck menu. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",fen.giroux

Quando però, vado a scrivere l'account richiesto sulla finestra, questo non viene accettato e continua a richiederlo, senza una logica. Quindi immagino che sia un errore del sistema. Ho fatto tutta la pulizia possibile sul computer e poi l'ho riavviato, ma non è servito a nulla.
