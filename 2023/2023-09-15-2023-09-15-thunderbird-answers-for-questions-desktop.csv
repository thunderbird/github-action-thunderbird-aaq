Sometimes people need to modify the font or increase spacing or simply have lost a toolbar and want it back.  Ask about anything no matter what it is. Sometimes people feel they should know something, but until someone shows you, how are you supposed to know. Many changes can occur  because security has to keep up to date or some server demand alterations to allow third parties access to severs. Sometimes things change because a lot of people are demanding the changes. Sometimes the code has been mofified for too many years and is now so untidy it's getting too many errors and it needs a complete rewrite, so better mechanisms are incorporatated.  Change is often necessary and important. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

A very simple easy to use program which got dropped because there were lots of security issues and it did not offer what people required.  It became too outdated in so many ways. </p><p>The option to not update has always been available. </p><p>You must first realise that you might have a Software Update program running on your computer and it might be forcing updates. Some Anti-Virus products also have the ability to check for updates and just install them. Over the uears I've had many people complaining about updates only to discover it was not Thunderbird who was doing the update. </p><p>In Thunderbird there are some settings you can check out: </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> scroll down to 'Updates' section </li><li> Select 'Check for updates, but let me choose whether to install them' </li></ul> <p>This means Thunderbird will check and let you know, but it will not install unless you say so. </p> <ul><li> Uncheck 'Use a background service to install updates' </li></ul> <p>Windows UAC control system normally will not allow any updates to the computer unless you have said it's OK.  If this option is selected then the Mozilla Maintenance Service gets permission from Windows to allow the update to be applied, without requiring you to click Yes in the Windows User Account Control (UAC) dialog.  So, uncheck this option and you will get Windows UAC pop up asking you to allow an update.

This is the new 'Supernova' design which has been available for a while, but has not been auto updating whist a few gremlins were being rules out. </p><p>I've been trying it out. At first it was a bit of a shock, but it's working out to be quite good and it's still being improved. </p><p>At the top of the Folder Pane there is a new 'Folder Pane Header' and it contains a blue 'New Message' button. Personally I detest it, but it is a 'Write' message button. </p><p>You can stop the display of that Blue 'New Message' button and the weird little cloud icon. click on the 3 dot icon and uncheck: </p> <ul><li> 'Show Get Messages' </li><li> 'Show new Messages' </li></ul> <p>There is an  option to hide that 'Folder Pane Header' to gain some space. Then you can use the New Unified Toolbar - right click on it and choose 'Customise', On the 'Mail' tab you can drag the 'Write' and the 'Get Messages' icons onto the toolbar so it now looks more familiar.  This is also a new Customise - to close it use either the 'Save' or 'Cancel' buttons - do not click on the top right X click I did by accident as it exits Thunderbird.  </p><p>Seriously, It's actually not too bad once you over the what the hell happened moment. I've managed to wangle a few modifications and got a much improved result which I'm finding works very well.  </p><p>You can also change the view of the Message List. I'm still using 'Table view' - I just prefer it, but there is now a 'Cards View' At the top of the Message List, above the column headers is a new toolbar. It has name of selected folder on the top left with total messages and 'Quick Filter' button, but to the right of that is the icon you can use to change between Table and Cards view. If you set up eg: Table view and then want to get rid of that toolbar, use the new icon and select 'Hide Message List Header' Then you can Customnise the Unified toolbar to have the <em>Quick Filter' button, it means you can enable and disable it easily to remove toolbar when not required. </em> </p><p>I decided to get the Titlebar back and enable the 'Menu Bar' because it mow works better the 3 line menu app button which now only displays items that effect all folders. So it's not as useful. I also wanted the Menu Bar above the Unified toolbar, but that option requires userChrome.css The address book has also got two types of view now. </p><p>Some useful links below. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1422908"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1422908</a> <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/115.0/whatsnew/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/115.0/whatsnew/</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unified-toolbar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/unified-toolbar</a> </p><p>Some images below showing some of my settings. </p><p>Yes, I did not like the + sign sign for new message (it's a generic pharmacy sign so seems wrong) , I like the pencil, so used 'userChrome.css' to modify it. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1

Further, the font body size for the most messages is HUGE, and using the zoom does not solve nothing because it appears that it only affects some messages but not others.

In the mean time the network saturation from streaming of video and sound makes timeout failures more and more common. </p><p>Fundamentally you need to keep the numbers of messages you move from one folder to another down,  perhaps set up archiving to move messages daily, or if the messages are on an IMAP server and you are moving them to another IMAP folder on the same server use server side scripting to move the messages rather than the very inefficient process that occurs using local IMAP folders where each message is identified verified with the server then moved to a cached location pending the ""move"" actually completing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Yes, it does make a difference.  Almost as much difference as if you  were over at Ford asking about warranty procedures for your Hyundai. </p> <blockquote> I apologise if I don't meet your standards to qualify as a donor. </blockquote> <p>This is the technical support forum for supporting Thunderbird.  By definition it is a peer support forum.  So no one here works for Mzla and no one here has any special information on how the corporate donation process works.  It has nothing to do with your ability or qualification as a donor and everything about which corporation you are asking about! </p><p>There is a frequently asked questions link on the donations page to <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/#faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/#faq</a> </p><p>This link includes the frequently asked question </p> <blockquote>Who can I email directly with questions about giving?  </blockquote> <p>Which includes in it's answer  </p> <blockquote> If you have a question about giving to Thunderbird, please contact us via this form</blockquote>with the form word linking to this page. <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/help/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/help/</a> <p>The donations page also has a link to the same page under ""contact us"" beside the frequently asked questions page. </p><p>Then we get to the specifics of your question.  You can not donate online with cash and any other form of donation is going to require you to identify yourself to the service sufficiently for the financial transaction to complete.  The legal requirements for various international financial transactions vary based on the place at which you are making the donation and the point at which the receiver is located.  Those donating from many countries in the world are required to leave sufficient information for their national financial tracking police to follow your every action.  Others like PayPal have additional requirement that they impose due to jurisdictional issues as well as them being satisfied you are who you say you are to undertake transaction on that account. </p><p>Why do you have to provide what ever information you were asked for,  I have no idea.  I do not even know what information you were asked for.  Discussing the specifics of what was requested in a public forum such as this appears to me to be counter to your stated aim of anonymity.  Perhaps take your query to an email basis which is clearly where any reply to the contact form will be directed so your privacy is not further eroded by a discussion that by it's very nature is going to become more intrusive, not less. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,1
