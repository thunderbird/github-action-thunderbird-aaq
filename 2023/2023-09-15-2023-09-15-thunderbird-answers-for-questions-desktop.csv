But there can be many causes of these silent failures.  Including the hard limits Yahoo places on connections to the server and other connections using phones and tablets that can further degrade the bandwidth made available for Thunderbird to use with the server. </p><p>Historically it was ""sort of"" considered that what you are doing should work for a few hundred massages,  but as email have become exponentially larger from some sources the numbers IMAP will reliably move like that gets less.  In the mean time the network saturation from streaming of video and sound makes timeout failures more and more common. </p><p>Fundamentally you need to keep the numbers of messages you move from one folder to another down,  perhaps set up archiving to move messages daily, or if the messages are on an IMAP server and you are moving them to another IMAP folder on the same server use server side scripting to move the messages rather than the very inefficient process that occurs using local IMAP folders where each message is identified verified with the server then moved to a cached location pending the ""move"" actually completing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

So where you see a folder called 'Inbox' in Folder Pane, the emails are not really stored in a folder called 'Inbox'. They are stored in mbox files - an mbox file called 'Inbox' with no extension.  Emails are appended to the relevant mbox file in the order downloaded. Basically it's like one single text document = Inbox and imagine each email is like a new paragraph. The oldest will be at the top and the newest at the bottom. </p><p>Whenever you move or delete an email, that email 'paragraph' gets a marked as deleted and hidden - imagine this as big red strike through the deleted or moved paragraph.  After a while, as more emails get moved into suitable folders for storage and others get deleted, you can imagine that mbox text file is getting a lot of 'paragraphs' with a red strike. It gets messy. </p><p>This is where 'compacting' does it's clean up job. A duplicate copy of file is created and then Thunderbird reads that file when it finds a good wanted email, it copies it to new file and it ignores all those marked as deleted emails (the red strike through paragraphs). Then it deletes the old messy file and saves the new file. </p><p>This has the effect of reducing the file size and seriously cleaning up the mbox file.  </p><p>Usually, the Inbox, Drafts and Junk get the most activity when it comes to moving or deleting emails. Maybe you have no Drafts in Drafts folder or you have emptied the 'Junk' but it still shows a size. This is because it still has all those old traces of moved/deleted emails. I have a quite a few emails each day that get moved or deleted, so as a habit, I compact the Inbox, Drafts and Junk folders at the end of each day. </p><p><strong>How to compact:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Right click on folder and select 'compact'. </li></ul> <p>More info on compacting: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Compacting_folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.mozillazine.org/Compacting_folders</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compacting-folders</a> </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Noticed the following: 'Local Folders' mail account which is a default mail account for storing emails outside of any pop or imap mail account is not shown in the Folder Pane. However, 'Outbox' is shown and that folder is specifically located in the 'Local Folders' mail account. </p><p>I believe you may have done the following but only you can tell me whether it is the case. </p><p>You created a POP mail account. You set up your email address/mail account as a deferred account more commonly called 'Global Inbox'. That means the pop mail account does not use it's own set of folders - it uses the 'Local Folders' mail account folders instead which explains why the 'Outbox' is visible. Then you changed the name of the 'Local Folders' mail account to say 'your email address'. All of the above would cause much confusion when looking at the image you provided if you do not tell people about your set up.  </p><p>This means in 'Account Settings' you will have a POP mail account for email address AND a 'Local Folders' mail account which you have renamed to be your email address.

So please do this: </p><p>In Account Settings: Left Pane. It should list your POP account with 'Server Settings', 'Copies &amp; Folders' etc Below that it should say 'Local Folders' with only  'Junk Settings' and 'Disc Space' But I think you have changed the 'Local Folders' name to be your email address - now I can see why you like that new name. You will know you are in the right location because when you select 'Local folders' mail account- top right it does not say it's a Pop account - it says 'The following is a special account.....' Please do this - Rename that 'Local Folders' account which currently has name of email address to say: <strong>LF-</strong>email address. </p><p>Now check the  Pop account </p> <ul><li> 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Copies &amp; Folders' for the pop mail account </li><li> Select 'Place a copy in' </li><li> Select 'Other' and choose 'Sent on LF-email address' </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I'm still using 'Table view' - I just prefer it, but there is now a 'Cards View' At the top of the Message List, above the column headers is a new toolbar. It has name of selected folder on the top left with total messages and 'Quick Filter' button, but to the right of that is the icon you can use to change between Table and Cards view.

Wayne, appreciate your willingness to help in trying to overcome issues using this latest Thunderbird Software  'Supernova'. However, I am 69 years old and been using Thunderbird Email for many, many years that has caused many issues with 'Updates' that have not been properly Tested before their 'Release' but at least were 'manageable'. This new 'Supernova' should be withdrawn and never provided as an 'indicated Update' to the previous version of Thunderbird. It is a completely different Product and should come with 'Health Warnings'. </p><p>I am really apprehensive in using the so called features with my 26,000+ emails on my laptop that survive following a big mistake thinking 'Compact' meant the same as 'Compress'. Thunderbird appears not to provide a Command 'Compress' for an Archive function but in my British English Education the word 'Compact' could be an alternative word to use for 'Compress'. Of course, the Mozilla Thunderbird usage of 'Compact' meant destroying the information as it was classified as 'rubbish'! Back to the Subject. Although you have indicated some work arounds to problems I still have no wish to continue using 'Supernova' and want to revert back. The latest thing I have have to cope with is the Spam Folder' which GMAIL allocates what it thinks is SPAM emails (not all are SPAM) which I regularly check by Deleting the actual individual SPAM Files and transferring the individual real emails to my Inbox. '<em><strong>Supernova no longer just Deletes the individual SPAM on my Command but allocates them back to my Inbox and All Mail Folders which I then have to the locate the same Spam files in these Folders and go through the Deletion process AGAIN!!!!!'</strong></em> I'm not sure if I have found all the relocated SPAM files.

You would not have even known what it removed because all of those 'marked as deleted' emails were auto hidden. If you lost emails then it's more likely your Anti-virus scanned a file and tried to fix it and in the process either deleted the entire file or caused the file to be corrupted so a compacting process could not read the file correctly. </p><p>Compacting does not delete any emails nor files.  It simply does not copy old marked as deleted and hidden email to the new file. Other examples: I've come across people who get upset about their Trash being emptied yet do not realise that the server is emptying the Trash automatically, but until 'Trash' is selected, it may not have synchronised with server.

Gmail removed the 'Spam' label and applied an 'Inbox' label. </p><p>Are you aware of the fact that gmail auto deletes/removes any emails that have been in the server  Spam folder for 30 days, so you do not have to do anything in order for them to get completely removed by gmail? If you want to clear whatever is left in Spam after moving some emails - you can kill all of them in go.  Right click on 'Spam' folder and select 'Empty Junk'. </p><p>To delete emails in gmail imap account, you have to set it up so anything you delete goes to the gmail trash folder and then Gmail will auto remove any emails that have been in the Trash for more than 30 days.  If you do not have 'deleted' emails going to the imap gmail Trash folder then as far as gmail is concerned you have not deleted them - you have said you want to just remove a label so email gets auto archived by gmail.

Lossless compression rebuilds and restores file data to its original state after decompression. </p><p>This has nothing to do with 'Compacting'. Compaction is a technique to collect all the free memory present in the form of fragments into one large chunk of free memory.  Example using an easy to imagine method. The 'Inbox' folder is really a single mbox text document file. Emails are written to it in the order downloaded, so oldest is at the top. </p><p>Imagine each email is like a paragraph and then imagine any email that is moved out of Inbox or deleted is like have a big red strikthrough the email/paragraph. After a while there are a lot of red strikethough paragraphs in that single text document. It looks messy and if left for a long time it's a lot easier to see how it could get corrupted. If you do not clear out the old traces of deleted emails then Anti-Virus may think a bad emails still exists and cause a problem with the file. Compacting now does this - it creates a copy of the file, then it looks for any parargraph that is good and does not have a red strikethrough - it copies that good wanted email to a new file and then works down through the document until all the good emails are copied. Then it gets rid of the old one and replaces with the new one. Now you have a cleaned up file - no red strikethoughs and easy to read. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I'm getting used to it, but there are many things I like and whilst very different they do work really well and other things which well let's use a good old fashioned british term 'could do better'.   I've decided to just mess about with various settings and alter code because certain things were really wrong. But that's just it - Thunderbird needs to revolve and it really is moving in a better direction, but sometimes it does not stick to the basics or do what it aims to achieve. </p><p>They want to try to get universal areas only using universal menus and otherwise put contextual menus in areas where people are working. One obvious fault here is putting a '+New Message' on the Folder Pane. It has nothing to do with operating in the Folder Pane area and is a universal menu item so should be automatically on the 'Unified' toolbar. Also the plus sign means 'add' not 'write' and does not work as well as the pencil icon. I've hidden it and enabled Write on the Unified toolbar. I think the big block of blue is unattractive.  </p><p>Yet there is no search for folders so you can type in a folder and click to jump to folder. You would have expected this in the Folder Pane header. </p><p>There is a lack of continuity of generic formatting. Some icons have no text mixed with icons with text. Some have a background button style when not a button and the 'cloud' icon has a drop down menu via right click when it's normal to show text with a drop down menu icon.  </p><p>So it's rudimentary at the moment and needs moulding into something better that actually fits in with all the rest of Thunderbird, but it's a work in progress and you can expect improvements as developers realise there are certain things that really need fixing.  </p><p>It's really quite exciting to see and experience how it morphs into a top notch product. </p><p>If you want to go back to another version: </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird </li><li> Make a backup before you do anything see image: </li></ul> <ul><li> Access profile name folder </li><li> delete the 'compatibilty.ini' file </li><li> Uninstall Thunderbird </li><li> Get new download from here: </li><li> <a href=""http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.15.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.15.1/</a> </li></ul> <ul><li> Choose OS eg&nbsp;: win64 </li><li> Choose language eg: en-GB for English British </li><li> Then click on the ' Thunderbird Setup 102.15.1.exe' to download. </li><li> Access that downloaded file and click on it to run the install. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,3,1

It seems you have not used these functions in the past  hence why you appear to have a complete lack of knowedge. Although I'm perplexed as to why you failed to understand the past comments fully explaining this to you. </p><p>So I'll reiterate................ 'View' &gt; 'Font size' deals with general UI font size so you can increase or decrease as required. This mean the entire font size will be increased or decreased depending upon what you click on. </p><p>'View' &gt; 'Zoom' &gt; increase/decrease is available for reading email content because senders may not be using the same size font which you have set up in the general UI. </p><p>This means 'Zoom' is designed to work on Email content - NOT on message lists or folder pane - just on opened email content.  </p><p>When an email is opened and has focus then the Zoom option is available. In your example - It is supposed to be disabled because you have not selected an email - there is no content to zoom.  </p><p>It's also just 'Ctrl +' or 'Ctrl -'  - no shift.  Regardless - it will not work if you do not open and get focus to show email content. </p><p>You will find that various items will be greyed out under specific conditions. Examples::  In Account Settings if a mail account is already set up as the default account then the 'Set as default' option will be greyed out. There is no need for it to be enabled becaue it is already set as default. That's how you know it is already set as default. Select an account which is NOT set as default and lo and behold, the option to 'Set as default' is enabled WHY&nbsp;? because the selected account is not set as default and the option allowes the user to choose to make changes. </p><p>View &gt; Calendar and its sub options might be greyed out ...WHY&nbsp;? Because you are not viewing the Calendar. First you need to open and be looking at the Calendar and then the Calendar options are available. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If you do not allow remote content - which by the way is the default setting inThunderbird then all remote content is blocked.  If you do not automatically use the settings 'Display Attachments inline' then it is safe. If you do not click on links until you have checked what you are linking to and are satisfied the links are accurate and good then it is safe. If you do not get so curious about wanting to open attachment which come from an unknown origin so you do not open them then you are safe. </p><p>Opening an email is not harmful to you nor your computer. You can open and read and email in either the Message Pane or in a tab - it makes no difference - the email is still opened. If you do not like or want email then delete it and compact folder to remove all traces of it. </p><p>So be clear, if Remote content is disabled then opening an email is not a problem. It is Safe.

I have no more time to waste on it now, but I hope to disentangle it in a month or two if I can find out why my reinstall of 102 makes it think I've installed 78 and then can't find my messages. Does that have anything to do with the hex codes in <strong>installs.ini</strong> and <strong>profiles.ini</strong>? And why can't anyone tell me what needs to be changed to get my old profile structure back? It seems that setup info is contained in text files, and anyone who's been programming as long as I have knows how to fix that stuff if he/she knows what to do. At this point I'm willing to hand edit to get back to where I need to be. </p><p>The upgrade to 115 made a mess of my profiles, lost important emails, and gave me an interface that lacked much of the functionality I'd learned to use productively.  </p><p>I don't know if anyone's in charge here, but if anyone is, he/she obviously doesn't have enough experience to be making decisions about software hundreds of thousands of people if not millions depend on.

What I have trouble doing is respecting programming that is sufficiently sloppy that simply rebooting a computer is taken as permission to upgrade when, especially when, the program was set to ""Ask"" mode on update. I consider the issue solved, I deleted everything except the mail folder I set up for archived messages on a different hard drive, and the profile files for the 13 email accounts, which I then copied to an external drive (as I trusted the uninstall as far as I can throw anyone's uninstall), ran Revo Uninstaller and stripped out everything and spent a good chunk of Sunday resetting all the email accounts. Yes, I lost email messages, it is to be hope nothing terribly critical and all of the calendar entries (fortunately, I rely on a paper calendar for most things). The important ones will send my reminders from the corporate server so that is likely to be irrelevant in the short term. And now I am exporting every single saved message one by one in EML format and will be moving to, god help me, Outlook or some other system. This new layout is a decided step backwards, at which point I might as well use stupid-Outlook as they now look and work the same. I cannot provide screen shots as by the time I found the secret to asking a question, there was nothing to show and the upgrade was done immediately upon rebooting the entire computer and restarting Thunderbird, no ifs, ands, or buts and certainly no prompt.

The next instruction ""double-click toolkit.xxxxx to Tru in Settings/General/Config. editor"" was tough for me to follow. Because I couldn't find or open Settings/General.   The simplest way to find it is actually Open TB (this is important as in previous instructions, it said to deliberately close it ) goto Tools goto Settings at the bottom goto General select Configuration Editor at the very bottom at the top, may need to select Show All and then follow the OPs instructions. You'll find toolkit.legacy.xxxxx in the middle of a massive list of settings, which should be alphabetical.   I searched for toolkit.legacy in the Search bar presented, and it came up immediately.   Click on the little icon representing a bi-directional arrow at the right hand side of the setting and it will change to TRUE.  nothing to save.

""david"" for the post at Bugzilla (I piled on as requested!); ""sfhowes"" for css code, link to video, and troubleshooting code;  ""tommcmackay"" for clarifying the instructions. After finding that Betterbird really wasn't, I jumped back into TB and (for me, bravely) tried the fix! It didn't work the first time after restarting. I then replaced the css code for the message pane minimization with the css code for the the grayed folder pane on the troubleshoot and that worked. So tried again: replacing the troubleshoot code with the original css code for the message pane minimization and it worked! Thanks again...my tiny laptop screen survived the harmful radiation of the Supernova. </p>",richard1310,false,0,0

Again, another bad coding design for those of us with small screens: Updated to 115.7.0 and can't read my address book info. Am stuck in ""wide"" in the View/Layout setting, and the address book pane to the left can't collapse any further, so half the pane is empty space, which forces the listings pane to the right which makes it barely viewable, and since it is not navigatable, longitudinally, with a slider, the info gets cut off and I have to zoom so small that I can barely read it and then only some of it. Any suggestions/help? </p>",richard1310,false,0,0
