Including the hard limits Yahoo places on connections to the server and other connections using phones and tablets that can further degrade the bandwidth made available for Thunderbird to use with the server. </p><p>Historically it was ""sort of"" considered that what you are doing should work for a few hundred massages,  but as email have become exponentially larger from some sources the numbers IMAP will reliably move like that gets less.  In the mean time the network saturation from streaming of video and sound makes timeout failures more and more common. </p><p>Fundamentally you need to keep the numbers of messages you move from one folder to another down,  perhaps set up archiving to move messages daily, or if the messages are on an IMAP server and you are moving them to another IMAP folder on the same server use server side scripting to move the messages rather than the very inefficient process that occurs using local IMAP folders where each message is identified verified with the server then moved to a cached location pending the ""move"" actually completing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Yes, it does make a difference.  Almost as much difference as if you  were over at Ford asking about warranty procedures for your Hyundai. </p> <blockquote> I apologise if I don't meet your standards to qualify as a donor. </blockquote> <p>This is the technical support forum for supporting Thunderbird.  By definition it is a peer support forum.  So no one here works for Mzla and no one here has any special information on how the corporate donation process works.  It has nothing to do with your ability or qualification as a donor and everything about which corporation you are asking about! </p><p>There is a frequently asked questions link on the donations page to <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/#faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/#faq</a> </p><p>This link includes the frequently asked question </p> <blockquote>Who can I email directly with questions about giving?  </blockquote> <p>Which includes in it's answer  </p> <blockquote> If you have a question about giving to Thunderbird, please contact us via this form</blockquote>with the form word linking to this page. <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/help/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/help/</a> <p>The donations page also has a link to the same page under ""contact us"" beside the frequently asked questions page. </p><p>Then we get to the specifics of your question.  You can not donate online with cash and any other form of donation is going to require you to identify yourself to the service sufficiently for the financial transaction to complete.  The legal requirements for various international financial transactions vary based on the place at which you are making the donation and the point at which the receiver is located.  Those donating from many countries in the world are required to leave sufficient information for their national financial tracking police to follow your every action.  Others like PayPal have additional requirement that they impose due to jurisdictional issues as well as them being satisfied you are who you say you are to undertake transaction on that account. </p><p>Why do you have to provide what ever information you were asked for,  I have no idea.  I do not even know what information you were asked for.  Discussing the specifics of what was requested in a public forum such as this appears to me to be counter to your stated aim of anonymity.  Perhaps take your query to an email basis which is clearly where any reply to the contact form will be directed so your privacy is not further eroded by a discussion that by it's very nature is going to become more intrusive, not less. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,1
