Needless to say, I have had to rebuild my software, one program at a time.  After setting up Thunderbird, I was able to import the mail from a second machine on my network.  However, that left me missing a large chunk of mail from earlier in 2023 and later 2022.  In looking through all the profiles, I find that the messages whose date matches my missing mail are in appdata/roaming/thunderbird/profiles/default.sja.  That directory contains two subdirectories, cache2 and mail.  Under cache2 I have directories called doomed, which is empty, and entries, which has all of the messages whose dates match those that I am missing.  My question is really simple -- how do I get those messages into my current user profile?  I've tried the import tool, but that fails.  I am at my wits end on this one.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1581570;,webmaster130

I used Thunderbird for many years and have just returned to it. When I use the inbuilt add-ons manager it goes to the en-gb extensions site ( not unexpectedly, but I'm slightly surprised there is more than one site.) If I specify my version of Thunderbird it supplies outdated and/or unsuitable extensions which will not work with my version of Thunderbird. After a Usenet discussion I tried getting them from the en-us version of the site and got at least one extension that worked OK. However, subsequently the same has happened from the en-us address, despite specifying the correct version of Thunderbird, extensions fail from there too. For example the ""Open Google Calendar"" extension sort of works but has random text overwriting parts of the the calendar. Others are similar. My questions therefore are:- </p><p>1) Are the en-us and en-gb sites really separate sites, or am I wasting my time specifying which site I use? 2) Is the extension system really as comprehensively broken as it seems to be? 3) Is anyone doing anything about it? I don't know where to contact the devs direct. 4) I not, what on earth is the problem? </p><p>Failing all else can anyone point me to any more help on the topic. I can't find anything on this support site. I haven't been to Bugzilla yet - past experience dictates that it takes forever to get answers there (if at all) and I'm hoping to cut out some of the wait the wait. I'm getting very old now and may not have that long&nbsp;:-)  </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Bob </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1581569;1581653;1581656;1581947;1581949;1581953;1581973;1581995;1582096;1582098;,robert.h.henson
