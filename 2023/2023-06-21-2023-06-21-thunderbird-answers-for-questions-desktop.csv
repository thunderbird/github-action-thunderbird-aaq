Or if you had a phone accessing via Imap and you deleted any emails then they get deleted off server. </p><p>Another problem is if you have another email client running in the background. I have come across a person who used to use Outlook. They thought they had removed the account from outlook. But upon further investigation they discovered much to their supprise that Outlook was working in the background. It was still downloading emails. The account was still live and kicking, but it was a pop account which downloaded and deleted emails off server or had other settings like delete after x days. The point being no one was aware of this.  You mention 'Outlook' so please check to see the account has been removed. </p><p><br> If emails are being deleted off the server and put into the server TRash then any IMAP account will get auto synchronised to match what is on the server.
