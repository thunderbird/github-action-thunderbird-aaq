Not complaining, just reporting. </p><p>Actually the biggest headache for me are some of the features that worked well prior to the new releases but are broken now. </p><p>I will only ask for help with one of them that is the biggest slow-down and bother for me. </p><p>I have TB set up to check accounts for new mail every 10 minutes. It gives an audio alert. Nice. </p><p>But I had TB also set up to highlight in a red color, the account that actually has the waiting message. I set this up many years ago. </p><p>That feature stopped working. </p><p>I have many email accounts, so when I hear the mail-waiting audio alert, I have to go to each one individually, Right Click and select Get Messages to see if it is that particular account that has message waiting to be retrieved from the email server. </p><p>Is this feature broken forever? Anyway to fix it in the recent releases? </p><p>Yes I know about the Get all messages possibility but that is not workable for me right now and it would be too much typing to explain it. haha. </p><p>Thanks everyone, jenny_abc </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",jenny_abc
