Not complaining, just reporting. </p><p>Actually the biggest headache for me are some of the features that worked well prior to the new releases but are broken now. </p><p>I will only ask for help with one of them that is the biggest slow-down and bother for me. </p><p>I have TB set up to check accounts for new mail every 10 minutes. It gives an audio alert. Nice. </p><p>But I had TB also set up to highlight in a red color, the account that actually has the waiting message. I set this up many years ago. </p><p>That feature stopped working. </p><p>I have many email accounts, so when I hear the mail-waiting audio alert, I have to go to each one individually, Right Click and select Get Messages to see if it is that particular account that has message waiting to be retrieved from the email server. </p><p>Is this feature broken forever? Anyway to fix it in the recent releases? </p><p>Yes I know about the Get all messages possibility but that is not workable for me right now and it would be too much typing to explain it. haha. </p><p>Thanks everyone, jenny_abc </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1625416;,jenny_abc

But despite the fact that neither of these folders is in anyway operational they are locked to my main email. And why do I need two? An image of the folder list is attached. I did ask this same question some time ago and got no replies, but perhaps by now someone has some sort of explanation/fix.

Last year, it suddenly stopped downloading e-mails with a message about sending password information to the server, but then does nothing.  I tried various privacy and server settings but nothing worked.  However, Thunderbird works fine on another laptop.  Now I've migrated to a new PC, was able to copy the profile over to the new PC but the problem persists.  At the same time, a different profile on the new PC works fine.  I read something online about a popstate file that might be causing the server to not respond, but even deleting that did nothing.  Another thought I've had is to move all the old email to the new profile, but everything I've read online talks about moving the entire profile which I have done but the problem remains the same.  Old profile has all the old e-mails but doesn't get any new ones, and the new profile downloads the new incoming e-mails but of course doesn't have the old e-mails. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",yjh9152
