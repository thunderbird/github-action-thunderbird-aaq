TONS or email addresses, folders and emails with attachments. </p><p>These might not be the prefect answers, but I'll tell you what I've done... </p><p>With the newest versions I've had weird things happen, so I created a NEW profile and set it up with all the email addresses I still use, and the folders I use. It's wicked fast now. But it was a lot of work.  I created some shortcuts to the Profile Manager, the NEW Profile as well as the OLD Profile, so I could still access my old stuff as I used the new, empty Profile. Just need to stop the OLD profile from automatically checking emails if you open it again. Especially if you have a POP account, where it could remove it from the server.  </p><p>If you want me to reply with a step-by-step howto, let me know.  </p><p>IF everything else seems to be working fine, you may want to create more LOCAL folders and more older documents to them.  For instance, I Created ""Archive 20xx"" Folders and moved OLDER stuff to them.  </p><p>Or, renaming current LOCAL folders to something else and re-creating your more used ones would have the same effect. Like Renaming  ""Personal"" to ""Personal072023"".   </p><p>My theory behind it is some folders with all the attachments get flagged to consolidate, so if you clean them out, or rename and replace it will stop Thunderbird from flagging them, and because the Re-Named folders are no longer very active, it's less likely Thunderbird will see THOSE as an issue.  </p><p>Just a Theory.... </p><p>But, Me making a 2nd Profile and still having access to the OLD one has been great. It took a few hours, but it's wicked cleaned up and fast. and I think since I did it I only had to go in the OLD Profile once to look up some old information. It was also a good way for me to clean up a HUGE address book.  </p><p>Good Luck!!! </p>",Chicks_Hate_Me,false,0,0

After a brief period of stabilization, the release level is marked to show an update is needed. So, in time, your 102 will show that an update is needed and that will proceed automatically or under your approval, whichever you have set. OR, if you want to update immediately, you can download the installation file and install over your current version. I do suggest doing a backup now, so that you are protected against any unanticipated problems. So far, the release is going smoothly. My suggestion is to wait.
