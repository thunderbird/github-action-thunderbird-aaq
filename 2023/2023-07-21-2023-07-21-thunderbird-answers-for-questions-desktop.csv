I created some shortcuts to the Profile Manager, the NEW Profile as well as the OLD Profile, so I could still access my old stuff as I used the new, empty Profile.

Like Renaming  ""Personal"" to ""Personal072023"".   </p><p>My theory behind it is some folders with all the attachments get flagged to consolidate, so if you clean them out, or rename and replace it will stop Thunderbird from flagging them, and because the Re-Named folders are no longer very active, it's less likely Thunderbird will see THOSE as an issue.  </p><p>Just a Theory.... </p><p>But, Me making a 2nd Profile and still having access to the OLD one has been great. It took a few hours, but it's wicked cleaned up and fast. and I think since I did it I only had to go in the OLD Profile once to look up some old information.
