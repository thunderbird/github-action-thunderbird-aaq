What i encounter is the following (I attach screenshots as well): 1. I have several mail accounts in the normal view available. I see the inbox properties on each of them as you described them for standard. 2. When I switch to gouped folder view I get a inbox folder on top of the account list and, that is strange, one of my accounts is now missing in the list (Vodafone mail account). 3. The properties shown on the ""new"" grouped inbox folder only shows the settings of a standard folder. </p><p>I hope that is understandable and that you have an explanation/solution for this. </p><p>Thanks, Oliver </p>",hirschow,false,0,0

In which case, if done correctly, you should not be seeing any of the Pop mail accounts as separate accounts with separate folders unique to each of those pop accounts in the Folder Pane because they use 'Local Folders' mail account instead. You should only see 'Local Folders' mail account. It would also mean you would not need to use Unified because they are already unified in the Local Folders mail account. </p><p>Other accounts not set as Global Inbox accounts would remain as independent mail accounts with own folders. </p><p>But if you did not get the process correct then it is possible to end up with an unusal view where you technically are using Global Inbox but still see the pop folders of separate accounts. </p><p>Hence why you are only seeing 'Local Folders' under 'Inbox' and why 'Unified' view does not display a Unified set of Inbox. </p><p>In 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Server Settings' click on 'Advanced' Did you originally or at some point set up to use 'Inbox for different account' and chose the 'Local Folders' mail account&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I have always thought that this step did a few simple things:   1)  verify that the address does not already exist and post a message if it does 2)  send the information to the named domain's email server and - possibly - validate that the referenced domain has an account with that name set up If unsuccessful in any particular a message is returned.  Is this what actually happens? Is the password used at all in this step? </p><p>After passing those validations, the next step is to choose mail protocols for inbound and outbound mail and connection validations for port numbers and security protocols.  After making those choices and clicking the Done icon, there is a further verification process.  During this process a message stating that the password is being validated is flashed.  I have always thought that in this step a message is sent to the named domain's server where the domain's software checks and validates the port number and security settings and the password and returns a message indicating success or failure which Thunderbird then interprets and displays an appropriate message.   </p><p>Is this what actually happens or do I need an education? </p><p>I keep getting an error at this step.  FWIW, I choose to use POP3 and accept the suggested port numbers and security options.  I've looked up Fastmail's settings information and found the suggested values to be those that Fastmail publishes. </p><p>Here, I think, is the rub.  From responses from Fastmail support, I think there are only ever 2 passwords used by Fastmail regardless of how many user email addresses are setup in Fastmail.  There is what they call an 'app password' which must be set up to allow Thunderbird to access Fastmail, and there is a single password that is set up with the mail Fastmail account/user email.  This second password is the only one Fastmail checks when processing email messages.  <strong>It is quite possible that I do not understand this correctly.</strong> </p><p>In any case, if my understanding as stated above is correct, then the question becomes, ""What password should be used when setting up Fastmail domain email addresses in Thunderbird?"" </p><p>I have tried using the app password without success.  I have tried using the 'master' email password without success.  I've tried using a password generated by Roboform without success, although this doesn't surprise me in the context of my understanding of the process because I cannot set up separate passwords for separate Fastmail email user addresses. </p><p>In every case I get the error message shown in the attached screenshot, regardless of password used.  The message doesn't say specifically that the error was a password validation failure or that the settings are wrong. </p><p>Finally, I CAN and HAVE successfully an account in Thunderbird for my Fastmail Account/User email address.  This addy works, as best I can tell. I would greatly appreciate someone correcting my misunderstanding or adding more insight into the process. </p>",rabbithutch1,false,0,0

If not create one now. </p><p>Try and configure your account using the app password as the password in the account setup. </p><p>Fundamentally the program attempts to log into the fastmail account at the point of verification and get various parameters from the server such as it's capabilities in the case of IMAP.  So you must be using the password that is allowed for Thunderbird that was created before you tried to create the account. </p><p>It is possible to manually connect to a mail server using a command line utility in the operating system and attempt to log in just as Thunderbird does.  You might also want to ensure that all references to the account have been removed before you try again.
