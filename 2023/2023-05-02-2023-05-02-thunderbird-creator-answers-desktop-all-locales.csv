A questo punto sono iniziati i problemi.  Appena cambiata la pw tutto funzionava regolarmente come inviare e ricevere e-mail, ma il giorno dopo non spediva ne riceveva più e-mail. Naturalmente senza toccare altre impostazioni. Anzi ho controllato altri account con lo stesso client che sono funzionanti, che avessero le stesse impostazioni. E così é, le impostazioni sono le stesse. Dopo diversi tentativi ho pensato che la pw fosse stata troppo lunga (18 caratteri), l'ho accorciata a 15 caratteri e da quì l'account ha ricominciato a ricevere la posta ma non a spedirla. Quando provo a spedire una e-mail Thunderbird mi chiede la pw e:  <em> ""Invio del messaggio non riuscito. </em> Autenticazione non riuscita col server di posta in uscita (SMTP) <a href=""http://mail.nailsworld.it"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.nailsworld.it</a>. Controllare la password e verificare il “Metodo di autenticazione” in “Impostazioni account | Server posta in uscita (SMTP)”<em>."" </em> Faccio presente che l'inserimento della pw ho provato sia a digitarla direttamente in tastiera che a incollarla dopo averla copiata da un file dove registro le pw.
