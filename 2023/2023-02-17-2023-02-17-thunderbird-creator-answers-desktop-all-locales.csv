However, when I use it, the quality of the reduced image is often very poor.  I can get a much higher quality resized image by dragging the lower right corner of the image upwards and towards the left.  However, this is a bit tedious, as I may have to do this 2-3 times to get the image to a smaller size, particularly if the original image is very large.  Anyone know any easier way to resize images without losing so much quality? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1566162;1566163;,queenmab100
