Some not so savvy people thought 'Print Preview' offered a more secure method of reading emails without opening them, not realising how you could see contents without opening them. The emails were opened in the background. </p><p>Then Firefox altered printing and so did Thunderbird as a certain amount of code is shared. The old opening in background ceased and now email must be selected and opened and have focus. </p><p>This then opens the 'Print Preview' window allowing you to make any necessary alterations. </p><p><strong>For multiple:</strong> IF you select top level email of a collapsed thread so it shows the X number of messages in Message Pane Then right click on highlighted item in list and select 'Print'.... </p><p>It does not open the 'Print Preview' window, but it should open the 'Print' window where you can select the name of printer. </p><p>I just tested this on an email which has 3 emails in thread (collapsed) and got the Print dialogue window.
