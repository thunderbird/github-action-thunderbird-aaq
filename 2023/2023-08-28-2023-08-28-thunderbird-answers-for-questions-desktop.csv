Helpful with multiple correspondents in the email chain. However, it has a column called ""between"" which referenced which correspondents were involved in each email within the conversation. Really very helpful, however, it seems it was this ""between"" column that was causing the printing issues. TB always wanted to restore this column even after removing it and a restart. In the the Thunderbird Conversations settings there is a check box that can override TB and completely remove the ""between"" column and then printing worked fine. Who would have guessed. Thanks for you help, as your idea of using the trouble shooting gave me the idea to trouble shoot the addons by turning them all off and then reactivating one by one. Bob </p>",hfsi,false,1,0

I tried your suggestion, and this is the result: When I go to my ""Sent"" folder of emails, I can click on an email, then click ""Move To"" and then select the subfolder I want to move it to.  It moves successfully, and it temporarily ""disappears"" from the ""Sent"" listing.  However, when I shut down Thunderbird, and then reopen it, the same email still appears in my ""Sent"" folder of emails.  So it ""moves"" but it doesn't disappear permanently from the ""Sent"" folder~~which I assumed was the intent of that function.   </p><p>So when I tried your suggestion tonight....instead of choosing the ""Move To"" task, I clicked on the ""Copy To"" command....then selected the subfolder I wanted the email to be copied to.  The email then appears in the new subfolder and apparently REMAINS GONE from the ""Sent"" folder.   I closed down Thunderbird and reopened it...and apparently, THIS works.  So I guess the difference is the ""Move To"" function as opposed to the ""Copy To"" function.....maybe it's me.  I just assumed that if I ""moved"" an email from one folder to another, the point was that it would disappear from the original folder and then remain housed in the new subfolder.  But apparently that is not the case when using the ""Move To"" command.   It only works with the ""Copy To"" function....which seems entirely backward to me....but guess I'll now use the ""Copy To"" command to perform this task from now on. </p><p>Thanks for your comment and response.  I truly assumed that ""Move To"" was the correct task for this....that it would literally move from one area to another.  But apparently that only works with the ""Copy To"" function.  Again, seems contradictory to me.....but will continue to try to work with this function in this ""new way."" </p><p>Thx again. </p>",jgamble2,false,0,0

But instead of this, because these folders are about 20GB, is there a way to import them through the PST I already have in my hands? Can I import these folders from the PST to the local folders? </blockquote> <p>Yes, load the PST into Outlook and then use the importer in Thunderbird to import from Outlook. Or just run the importer from the tools menu on your existing outlook installation. </p><p>What Thunderbird can do it talk to outlook,  it can not do anything at all with a PST file. </p> <blockquote>  And, if the answer is yes, how can I import anything to the local folders? </blockquote> <p>You are holding a proprietary formatted file.  While Microsoft have published a number of descriptions of the file formats used in various versions of the PST over the years,  Thunderbird has never been able to read any of those formats.  There has never been a commitment of sufficient resources to write import code for that file format as there is functional code for the import from Outlook.  This is even less important as most folk now use IMAP and the data is generally available from the web unless the person is already using a desktop mail client like outlook. </p><p>The internet is essentially full of converters to convert PST files into mbox files (google is your friend here) which Thunderbird uses natively.  They vary in cost and quality and as I am not at all involved with using any of them I can not offer advice as to one over another. </p><p>Once your data is in a non proprietary format you can either place the files in the local folders directory in Thunderbird profile (without a file extension) or use the import export tools add-on to import the mbox files for you.  <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>As sfhowes says mailstore home may read these files,  but it is not Thunderbird.
