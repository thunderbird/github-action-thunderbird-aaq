But instead of this, because these folders are about 20GB, is there a way to import them through the PST I already have in my hands? Can I import these folders from the PST to the local folders? </blockquote> <p>Yes, load the PST into Outlook and then use the importer in Thunderbird to import from Outlook. Or just run the importer from the tools menu on your existing outlook installation. </p><p>What Thunderbird can do it talk to outlook,  it can not do anything at all with a PST file. </p> <blockquote>  And, if the answer is yes, how can I import anything to the local folders? </blockquote> <p>You are holding a proprietary formatted file.  While Microsoft have published a number of descriptions of the file formats used in various versions of the PST over the years,  Thunderbird has never been able to read any of those formats.  There has never been a commitment of sufficient resources to write import code for that file format as there is functional code for the import from Outlook.  This is even less important as most folk now use IMAP and the data is generally available from the web unless the person is already using a desktop mail client like outlook. </p><p>The internet is essentially full of converters to convert PST files into mbox files (google is your friend here) which Thunderbird uses natively.  They vary in cost and quality and as I am not at all involved with using any of them I can not offer advice as to one over another. </p><p>Once your data is in a non proprietary format you can either place the files in the local folders directory in Thunderbird profile (without a file extension) or use the import export tools add-on to import the mbox files for you.  <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>As sfhowes says mailstore home may read these files,  but it is not Thunderbird.

Thank you, Matt! </p><p>Sorry for the delay in my reply, I don't know if you've heard of us here in central Greece, we had very difficult times the last week with very big floods, disasters, power outages and water outages for several days...

I created here a PST data file. Then I went to File -&gt; Open &amp; Export -&gt; Import/Export and I imported from here the contents from <strong>one folder only</strong> of my big PST file (folder “2015-2020” with 14.043 mails inside it). Outlook imported only 512 emails from PST and then gave me the Warning: <em>“Some items cannot be copied. They were either moved or deleted, or access was denied.”.</em> So, I searched Google, I run the SCANPST.EXE, it found some (strange) problems and it supposed that fixed them, but again the results are the same! </p><p>I’ve also changed the access permissions of my big PST file, I added “Everyone” with full access permissions, I’ve changed also the owner to “Everyone”, added principal “Everyone” with full control, I also added “Everyone” to Auditing with full control too, but the Warning remains with the importing. </p><p>Then I searched Google again for solutions and I found a Windows app called “Esofttools - Outlook PST Recovery” which promises that can fix the PST and, also, to convert it to MBOX file. But I have never heard about Esofttools, I don’t know if it is trustworthy or some kind of scam/malware. </p><p>Therefore!! </p><p>Before I continue with this way (please, if you have any tips about the import, the warning or the app, feel free to post them), I decided to try the david’s solution, to “create an IMAP account alongside the POP account, download the two folders with file&gt;offline&gt;sync, copy the two folders to local folders, and then remove the IMAP account.”. </p><p>Βut what concerns me with this way, is, are all my messages (with their attachments) going to be downloaded in full or not?! </p><p>Thanks!! </p>",GeorgeGR,false,0,0

I tried your suggestion, and this is the result: When I go to my ""Sent"" folder of emails, I can click on an email, then click ""Move To"" and then select the subfolder I want to move it to.  It moves successfully, and it temporarily ""disappears"" from the ""Sent"" listing.  However, when I shut down Thunderbird, and then reopen it, the same email still appears in my ""Sent"" folder of emails.  So it ""moves"" but it doesn't disappear permanently from the ""Sent"" folder~~which I assumed was the intent of that function.   </p><p>So when I tried your suggestion tonight....instead of choosing the ""Move To"" task, I clicked on the ""Copy To"" command....then selected the subfolder I wanted the email to be copied to.  The email then appears in the new subfolder and apparently REMAINS GONE from the ""Sent"" folder.   I closed down Thunderbird and reopened it...and apparently, THIS works.  So I guess the difference is the ""Move To"" function as opposed to the ""Copy To"" function.....maybe it's me.  I just assumed that if I ""moved"" an email from one folder to another, the point was that it would disappear from the original folder and then remain housed in the new subfolder.  But apparently that is not the case when using the ""Move To"" command.   It only works with the ""Copy To"" function....which seems entirely backward to me....but guess I'll now use the ""Copy To"" command to perform this task from now on. </p><p>Thanks for your comment and response.  I truly assumed that ""Move To"" was the correct task for this....that it would literally move from one area to another.  But apparently that only works with the ""Copy To"" function.

Really very helpful, however, it seems it was this ""between"" column that was causing the printing issues. TB always wanted to restore this column even after removing it and a restart. In the the Thunderbird Conversations settings there is a check box that can override TB and completely remove the ""between"" column and then printing worked fine. Who would have guessed.

It can display a 'Get Messages' button - cloud looking icon  and also a '+New Message' blue button style - this is really a 'Write' button and no one know why it's in a Folder Pane zone.  You can use the 3 dot icon to display or hide them and also choose to hide the entire 'Folder Pane header'. <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you hide this toolbar you can enable it again via 'View &gt; Folders &gt; select 'Folder Pane Header' </p><p><strong>How to customise the Unified toolbar:</strong> You can customise the 'Unified Toolbar'  to display a 'Write' icon/text and a 'Get Messages' icon/text. To make it look more familiar.  </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'Unified Toolbar' and select 'Customise' </li><li> Drag Write and Get Messages onto the toolbar.   </li><li> There is no | separator so use the &lt;-&gt; to create any space you require. </li><li> Click on 'Save' to apply choices. </li></ul> <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> This customise window now has tabs 'Mail', Address Book, Calendar etc. This allows you to set up the Unified Toolbar to display various buttons all from one Customise Toolbars area. </p><p><strong>Titlebar info:</strong> You can choose to show or hide the top titlebar via: </p> <ul><li> 'Settings' &gt; 'General' </li><li> scroll to 'Language &amp; Appearance' </li><li> Under 'Window Layout' </li><li> uncheck 'Hide system window titlebar' to see titlebar. </li></ul> <p><strong>How to get the Menu Bar back:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Menu icon &gt; View &gt; Toolbars </li><li> Select 'Menu Bar' to get the 'File, Edit, View etc </li></ul> <p>It will display above the tabs but below the Unified Toolbar. If you do not like this and want the Menu Bar above the Unified Toolbar, it is possible but requires using 'userChrome.css' - so let me know if this something you really would like in your Thunderbird. </p><p><strong>Info on 'Message List Header' toolbar.</strong> At the top of the 'Message List'/ Thread Pane is a new toolbar called 'Message List Header'. On the left it will say which folder is selected and total number of messages in folder.  On the right you will see a 'Quick Filter' button used to enable/disable the Quick Filter bar'  and on far right a new icon which offers some customisation of the Message List and the option to hide that toolbar. <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> if you choose to disable that toolbar - you can put 'Quick Filter' onto the 'Unified Toolbar'. You can enable this again via  'View' &gt; 'Layout' &gt; select 'Message List Header' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
