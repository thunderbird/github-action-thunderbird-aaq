When the ""X"" is clicked the main screen goes away and the Windows Task bar icon shows inactive. However, if you watch Windows task manager Thunderbird is using 15 to 25% of the CPU. This may go on for a minute or more after which it will fail with an error and the Thunderbird error screen is displayed. This has been going on for 8 or 10 months now and I have ignored it it because it didn't cause me any problems. I have submitted probably 100 error reports on this. I'm running 115.5.1 (64 bit) under Windows 11. </p><p>The only extension I'm running is BirdieSync but Thunderbird fails even with this disabled. I found an old incident related to BitDefender but I do not now and have never run that extension. </p><p>This has become a very high priority of late. One of my eMail accounts has changed their sever settings. I need to make changes to that account in Thunderbird.
