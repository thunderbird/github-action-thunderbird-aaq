I don’t see the point in getting a notification about a message more than once.  Obviously, TB does flag ‘newness’ as well as ‘unread’ so it would be best if notifications took ‘newness’ into account. </p><p>Even if notifications do rely on a message being ‘unread’, Google’s IMAP folder system makes sure that messages appear in more than one place, which seems to make Thunderbird give you more than one notification.  Is there any way to restricting what folders TB looks in for new messages to notify you about? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1589963;,seanos

But the old provider does not allow me to back up my emails and later re-import them at the new provider. I have been using IMAP for all my emails. So when I change the settings in Thunderbird to the new email provider's settings, I assume that in Thunderbird, all my older emails will be deleted (when Thunderbird synchs my account with the new email provider, and the old emails are not there, I assume all older emails will be deleted from Thunderbird?). How can  I avoid losing my old emails during the migration? I have already created subfolders to my Local Folders (Backup/email1, etc), and copied all my emails there. Is that enough? Those would not disappear during a switch of email providers, right? Also, I work with a laptop on the road, and a desktop from at home, and I have no access to the desktop machine at his time.
