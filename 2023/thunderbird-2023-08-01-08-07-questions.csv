1419877,2023-08-01 02:10:58 -0700,2023-08-02 01:12:44 -0700,Request for a web version of Thunderbird,"<p>Dear Thunderbird team, </p><p>I am a loyal user of Thunderbird, and I appreciate your efforts to provide a free, open source, and feature-rich email client. I am writing to request that you consider developing a web version of Thunderbird, as I believe it would offer many benefits to your users and enhance your competitiveness in the email market. </p><p>Some of the advantages of a web-based email client over a desktop client are: </p><p>- Accessibility: A web-based email client can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, without the need to install any software or configure any settings. This is especially convenient for users who travel frequently, use multiple devices, or work remotely. - Updates: A web-based email client can be updated automatically and frequently, without requiring any user intervention or downloading any files. This ensures that users always have the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches. - Backup: A web-based email client stores all the email data in the cloud, which means that users do not have to worry about losing their messages, contacts, or other information in case of a device failure, theft, or loss. Users can also access their email history from any device, without having to sync or transfer any files. - Customization: A web-based email client can offer more flexibility and options for customization than a desktop client. Users can choose from different themes, layouts, fonts, colors, and add-ons to suit their preferences and needs. Users can also switch between different web browsers and devices without losing their settings or preferences. </p><p>A web-based email client is not only convenient and efficient for users, but also important for the future of email communication. As more and more people use online services and platforms for their personal and professional needs, email is becoming an integral part of the web ecosystem. A web-based email client can integrate seamlessly with other web applications and services, such as calendars, contacts, social media, cloud storage, and productivity tools. This can enhance the user experience and functionality of email, as well as increase the security and privacy of email data. </p><p>Thunderbird is already a great email client that offers many features and benefits to its users. However, by developing a web version of Thunderbird, you can attract more users who prefer or need a web-based email solution. You can also leverage your existing strengths and reputation as an open source project that values user freedom, privacy, and security. A web version of Thunderbird would be a valuable addition to the web community and a powerful alternative to other webmail services. </p><p>I hope that you will consider my request and look into the possibility of creating a web version of Thunderbird. I am sure that many other Thunderbird users would appreciate and support this initiative as well. Thank you for your time and attention. </p><p>Sincerely, B. R.

Přestože štítky (opakovaně) vytvářím postupně, jejich číslování postupné není a v závěru jsou zpřeházené. Pro přiřazování štítků používám numerickou klávesnici a hodilo by se mi číslování přiřadit dle priority zprávy. Zároveň potřebuji nastavit na 2 počítačích stejné štítkování tak aby se mezi sebou pošta dle štítků synchronizovala Lze vytvořit i více než 9 štítků, případně používat pro přiřazení i jiný symbol než číslo?

I've been using Thunderbird for decades and always liked it until now. </p><p>1.  ""Get messages"" used to be prominent.

I am not a technical wizz by any means, but have deduced what I think might be the route cause. However I am not sure how to remedy it exactly. Its on Windows 11 22H2, if that helps. </p><p>Here is the situation as I understand it: </p><p>1. Until yesterday both of the apps on the laptop and desktop machines were running version 102.13.0 and working fine. </p><p>2. Last night, the laptop auto upgraded to 102.14.0, this did not happen on the desktop which remains on 102.13.0. Since then, no emails are being received into the laptop, and when I send a test email it goes through but gives me the pop up: </p><p>""Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors."" </p><p>The tests are not in the sent folder as a result. </p><pre>3. To be safe, I have switched off auto updates on the desktop machine to avoid the same thing happening there. </pre> <p>4. I have checked network/firewall settings to the best of my abilities, and the app is allowed on there. </p><p>5. I have checked the Server Settings and everything is as should be. I played with the SMTP and IMAP server settings switching between SSL/TLS and STARTTLS (and back again), to no avail. </p><p>6. I looked for an even later version to see if maybe that would work, and found 115.1.0. So I updated again but still in issue persists. </p><p>7. My next step would be to try and revert it back to 102.13.0. However I am uncomfortable with the thought of uninstalling the app altogether and redownloading the old version. I am also unsure how to do this/where to find that old download. </p><p><br> Help would be very much appreciated! </p><p>Luke </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1594950;1596070;,lukew100

Who can I contact to get/build the new libnspr4-0d and libnss3-1d libraries which would allow to continue using TB2 without the need to decrease their parent packages libnspr4 and libnss3 to old versions (mentioned above)? Alternatively, I'm ready to get involved into making fork of TB2, to apply there all the missing improvements, but to allow having the old good interface which I like and would like to continue using. Or maybe there already is such a fork - then please let me know, where to find it and how to contact the responsible Developer/s. If needed I can describe in detail the whole procedure of my manual installation of TB2 @ Debian 12.
