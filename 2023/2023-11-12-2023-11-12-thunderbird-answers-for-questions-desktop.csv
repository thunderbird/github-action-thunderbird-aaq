I have in the past seen all sorts of weird substitution issues occurring as reported in this forum over the years.  Usually related to antivirus issues in the system temp folder, or outright corruption of that folders contents.  Have you undertaken any action to clear the folder (windows does an appalling job of it.  You would think it would have become better since widows V3 in 1985.  Not not really.  Manual intervention is still required frequently to clear house)  Have you checked the integrity of the disk and the sanity of it's data structures (chkdsk)  Sure you are seeing issues after an update.  But there is nothing indicating they are linked and I would expect lots of others in this forum with the same issue if it was a defect in the released software. </p> <blockquote> There is other weird and annoying behaviour following this upgrade that I don't feel I needed, that I can't be bothered to document, which has me starting to wonder about moving apps. </blockquote> <p>And they may all be linked to a common issue.
