My Email account is using POP Mail Server, with SMTP Outgoing Server </p><p>See attached photos, from the top of the Email left hand side pane downwards.  So the red ‘local Folders’ used to house all yellow folders and their sub folders. #2 shows that what used to be at the top of the pane (from ‘Draft’s to ‘Trash’) has moved to the middle, and how ‘Trash’ now contains folders that belong in #1, but no individual Emails, as used to be the case after deletion. I’ve tried dragging this middle section to where it used to be without success.  #3 shows the second ‘Local Folders’. What you can see in this at the top of this picture is the tail end of what’s in ‘Trash’.  All this happened after TBird loaded immediately following the update, so it’s hard to see that the update didn’t cause the problems.   </p><p>Best, DAW </p>",daw.hush,false,0,0
