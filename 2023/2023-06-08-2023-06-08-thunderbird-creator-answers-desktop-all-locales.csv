For two of these (ultimately the same host but two different email addresses) I have a problem with certificates. Every so often I notice that nothing is being picked up from those accounts. If I explicitly click ""Get messages"" for those accounts I get a certificate exception, tell Thunderbird to accept the exception and then it will pull mail from those accounts for the next several days/weeks. I assume at some point the exception times out or something changes with the email host after a while and Thunderbird stops pulling in mail for those accounts again. It's frustrating that I have to notice there is no mail coming from those accounts so I can do the ""Get messages"" bit to deal with the exception. </p><p>I would like to either find a set up where accepting the exception lasts for ever once I've said it's fine; </p><p>OR  </p><p>I would like to have the certificate error message come up if Thunderbird has a problem with those accounts during normal daily start-up it when I start up.
