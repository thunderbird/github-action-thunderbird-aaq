I know you're all volunteers and you don't deserve these headaches. </p><p>I used Thunderbird happily for years.  Then the old Thunderbird started have problems.  I raised the problems here and got a lot of help until it was just so unusable, I quit.   </p><p>I tried a number of mail programs that was on my linux computer.  It just boggles the mind how many different ways people can think of to handle things that need simplicity. </p><p>I want a left side column that has all my email accounts visible all the time.  I want an email screen that I can close without automatically going to the next email.  Right now, If I call up an email to read, I lose my email account list.  There are two ways to get back to the email account list.  One is to press the ""&lt;"" to move the top line of whatever to the right and the arrow to the left until ""INBOX"" appears.  The other way is the hit in ""inbox"" box, which gets you nothing.  I hit the next box below and I get my Address books.  Being curious, after I got the Address books, I hit the Inbox button again - and now I get the Inbox (list of all email accounts).  Why can't they make the top button work the first time? </p><p>In the overall settings, I indicated that I wanted the print to be 26 pixels, picas, whatever, and it does nothing! I'm 84 and I can read the small print.  Why doesn't the settings work? </p><p>When I switched to 115, I gave a donation because I thought that they fixed things.  I'm not donating anything again until they not only fix things but they don't design what they think is an oversmart application.  There's this new thing - what - SuperNova.  I'm not going anywhere near that. </p><p>I'm not trying to upset volunteers, you don't deserve that.  What I want is this passed on to the company so they know just how frustrating it is to work with their software. Volunteers, please don't take this personally.  You work too hard to help people out. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1626528;1626568;1626579;,bdjim

I have uninstalled thunderbird, reinstalled it, and still get the same message.  I deleted the profiles in local and roaming, and reinstalled, and no profiles were created. How do I get the installation program to re-create the profiles like a new install? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1626504;,patnsandy

1434971,2023-12-26 08:05:56 -0800,2023-12-26 08:05:56 -0800,TB does not download mails from one of my accounts,"<p>Hi all. My configuration: MacOS Ventura 13.6.1 TB 116.3.1 I have 2 providers, <a href=""http://Orange.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">Orange.fr</a> and <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>, with one mail account on each. I had for a while issues with TB telling me there was an error with my password. I would enter the password in the message box and the message would come back again and again, while TB was sometimes downloading the mails anyway. I eventually found the solution: in my providers account I choose to change my password and entered the same again. And TB found it was just fine and stopped requesting the password! Just 5 minutes ago, after a long time, I had the same message while at the same time it was downloading mails from my first provider. Totally whimsical! Today's issue is with my account with the second provider, gmail. Since a week or two it doesn't download mails at all and displays the message ""No mails to download."" whereas the Inbox of this account has a bunch of mails. I thought TB had the same password issue so I decided to enter it again… but couldn't find how. I looked in the Accounts Settings but there is nothing. <strong>How the heck can one manage one's provider's account parameters in TB?</strong> Do I have to create a new account in TB? TIA.
