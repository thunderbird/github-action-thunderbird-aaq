However, each time I start that, it says I need to reboot to complete a previous upgrade. I've done that three times now but got no further.  FYI in the middle of this I did a Windows update which may account for the problem (2023-02 Cumulative Update for Windows 11 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems (KB5022913)). Suggestions welcome.
