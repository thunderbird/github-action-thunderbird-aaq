When I look at my account settings in TB, I have two POP3 accounts, and one SMTP account - all for my email provider.

I do not use these passwords to access my email on my desktop on a day-to-day basis, so I am not sure what they are for.  TB does not ask me for a password when I start the app. </p><p>When I set up my IMAP account (using the ""File/New/Existing Email Account"" feature) I will have to configure the IMAP account manually - no issue with this - I have the IMAP and SMTP account settings from my email provider.  However, when configuring the IMAP and SMTP accounts manually (may not have to do the SMTP account, since it already exists), it asks to create a password.  This is what I am not sure about - is it the same password within TB for the POP3 and SMTP accounts described above, or is it a separate password that has to be generated?  Does it make any difference what password I use?   Thanks, Doug </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1560049;1560052;,douggd
