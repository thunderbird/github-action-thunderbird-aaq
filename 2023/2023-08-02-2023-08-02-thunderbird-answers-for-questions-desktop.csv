The irony is that I CAN open my e-mail accounts with NO problem using their native screen on THIS WIN 7 PC.  So, the problem seems to be some 'secret' file in the WIN 10 PC that is NOT properly set.

I added my (existing) gmail account to Thunderbird, and it immediately started downloading mail. All good so far. The problem is that it placed the mail in precisely the *wrong* local folder, which means that I now have ""legacy"" email sitting in one local folder, and newer mail (as of today) sitting in a different local folder. I can, of course, change the local folder setting in TB - but, and here's what went wrong, only AFTER I start up TB. At that point, it's already downloading messages to the new local folder. If that folder location was in prefs.js before I started TB, I didn't see it. </p><p>So, the problem now is: how do I merge the mail from the new folder with the mail in the legacy folder such that all my mail is in a single folder? </p><p>Or, perhaps solving the problem differently, any idea how I tell GMail (via a web interface) that the mail should be re-downloaded again after I've changed the local folder setting in prefs.js? </p>",drbeach4,false,0,0
