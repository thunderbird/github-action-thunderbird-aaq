That can definitely be frustrating. Here's what you can try: First, make sure all your add-ons are up-to-date. Sometimes an outdated add-on can cause this. Also, try starting Thunderbird in Safe Mode (you can do this by holding down the Shift key while starting Thunderbird) to see if the issue still happens. If it doesn't, it might be related to an add-on. Lastly, you could try creating a new Thunderbird profile to see if the problem persists there. Give these a shot. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

No worries, we can definitely get this sorted out! It seems like your emails are showing the wrong sender address, right? To fix that, follow these steps: In Thunderbird, go to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Account Settings."" Then select the email account you're having trouble with. Check the ""Outgoing Server (SMTP)"" settings. Make sure the server name and authentication details match your correct email address: AMERTEL@PIPELINE.COM. Once you've updated these settings, try sending an email again. That should do the trick!

Even though you haven't changed anything, sometimes these things happen. Let's try a simple fix first. Go to Thunderbird's menu, then click on ""Offline Mode"" to turn it off. If that doesn't work, try restarting Thunderbird. If the problem persists, you might want to check your email account settings. Make sure the server configurations are correct and that your email account is set up properly. If you're still facing issues, you could try removing and re-adding your email account in Thunderbird. Also, check if there are any updates for Thunderbird and your antivirus software. Sometimes updates can fix compatibility problems.

Succinctly states, it failed once again.  I followed your instructions; was able to copy the ...\Thunderbird folder from the 7 PC to an 8GB drive.  When I got to the 10 PC, I could not find the folder tree .... doing a Explorer search I found it. I copied the thumb drive to the ...\Thunderbird folder. It is about 5.5GB ... did it in less than 10 mins.  Then, I opened Thunderbird on the 10.  The first screen that appeared was the Google 'Gmail' screen, showing my main e-mail address.  When I typed in my password, I kept getting an error message.  Certainly I know my password.  Also, since I have 4 different e-mail identities, on the Win 7 PC, they all appear on the left column of Thunderbird.  On the 10 PC, only my main e-mail identity appears.  So, it's obvious that the copying of the files has not completed properly, and now I still can't gain access to my e-mails on the 10 PC, since Google/Gmail is interfering with this connection. </pre> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++ Also, since I'm still using the Win 7 PC, when I attempted to open this THUNDERBIRD help session, I clicked on the directive, ""This does not solve my problem"", to which it opened FIREFOX.  When FIREFOX fully loaded, it started to open this MOZILLA Support page, but then I got the (very frequent error message, ""GAH!, Your Tab just crashed"".  I pressed the restore button and the error message reappeared at least 4 times.  So, in desperation, I chose the other option, close. Then went back to the original page, ""This does not solve my problem"", clicked on this sentence and FIREFOX reloaded, and now I was able to enter this reply and additional comments. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ </p><pre> Finally, it seems that the folder where Thunderbird is residing is in a hidden folder tree.  On my version of Win 10, there doesn't seem to be any direct access to the c:\users\&lt;ownerid&gt;\appdata\roaming\ .....  I had to type in this chain into the Explorer window to access it.  So, this was a frustration in itself .... I know it's NOT your problem, but I just wanted to mention it.  The inner workings of WINDOWS is a BIG enigma to me, and has been since 1984, when it was first released!!!!  At this point, I don't know how to solve this file transfer problem, since other local technical people that I've talked to about this situation have told me that they can't help, and have suggested that using Thunderbird is NOT a wise choice, which bothers me since according to other sources, Thunderbird IS THE MOST POPULAR e-mail software in circulation.  So, this must be some personal negative bias, but it still doesn't solve my problems. </pre> <p>THANK YOU. k.t. P.S.  I'm located in a suburb of Tampa, FL. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0

It sounds like there might be a synchronization issue causing your emails to be deleted when you open them.

It's essential to ensure your emails are still present on the Gmail server before trying to fix Thunderbird. To address this, you might want to reach out to Gmail support for assistance.
