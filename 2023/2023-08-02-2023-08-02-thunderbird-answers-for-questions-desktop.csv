Checked 'Attach this image...'.  Saved as a File (html) and added it as a signature in Account Settings.  Sent a test message, and the signature appeared in the message composer and the received message.  The html source of the file shows the correct path.  Tested on TB 115/W11.  Maybe there is some difference in OS X about permissions. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I guess that is better it is just that I would of preferred the ability to continue to edit a saved draft on my phone in the mail app on the phone if I am away from my desktop.
