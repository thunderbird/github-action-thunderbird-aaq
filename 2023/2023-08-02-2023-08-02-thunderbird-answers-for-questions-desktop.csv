I'm almost certain that when I asked this same question a couple months ago, you replied with the same advice.  I wrote your advice onto a sheet of paper, did exactly what you outlined and it did not work.  I got an error code, got disgusted &amp; continued to receive my e-mails on this WIN 7 PC. However, in fairness to you, and with renewed hope, I will give it another try.  By the way, BOTH PCs have the latest releases of both T-BIRD and FIREFOX installed. </p><p>And, to make matters worse, since I use Gmail as my e-mail client, I can't even access my e-mail accounts from the Gmail native screens through FIREFOX.  Despite entering the EXACT same passwords into their box, I get error messages, alerting me that it's an incorrect password. This CANNOT be, and I have NO recourse to get a solution through Gmail.  The irony is that I CAN open my e-mail accounts with NO problem using their native screen on THIS WIN 7 PC.  So, the problem seems to be some 'secret' file in the WIN 10 PC that is NOT properly set. Again, THANK YOU! k.t. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0

Instead, here is my suggesition: - ideally, set both PCs to have same TB version. Not mandatory, but ideal - be sure TB is not running on old PC for the copy - copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to a USB stick - install TB on new computer if not already done.  - Be sure Thunderbird is NOT running on new computer during the copy - copy the USB thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming. That will overlay the default profile that was created, so you will be prompted for overwrites. Allow that. - start thunderbird and the profile should be active. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Then, start TB and add your accounts - or, you could allow the profile to be on C's default, add the accounts, and exit TB and copy accounts (e.g., Imapmail\account or Mail\account  to D, then restart TB and on server page, change the location of accounts to point to where you placed them on D. Exit and restart and if all is well, you can then delete the accounts from C to save space. That would leave you with profile on C and accounts on D. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
