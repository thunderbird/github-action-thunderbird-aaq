Thunderbird/Mozilla either needs to eliminate this (with appropriate warning notices, perhaps) or at least give us the ability to NOT link various messages. It's not only vastly annoying, it can cause severe real-world problems if anyone not in the CC or BCC fields is receiving these messages that were not intended for them.  I suppose for now, the only way to NOT link things that were never meant to be would be to change the Subject when discussing important topics.  Either that, or get a whole new mail service, which I'd prefer not to have to do. </blockquote> <p>I started out thinking.  This is simple.  Link to the appropriate support article which includes advice on how to turn off threading for existing and new folders. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#</a> </p><p>But then I got to;  </p> <blockquote>  It's not only vastly annoying, it can cause severe real-world problems if anyone not in the CC or BCC fields is receiving these messages that were not intended for them. </blockquote> <p>You do realize I hope that threading only shows mail already on your computer.  It does not send additional links to other emails to other folk,  unless you include them.  It will thread mail you send and mail someone you communicate with also sends them if the mail is from the same thread.  SO if you send an email to an employee saying ""good idea"" and then forward the original email to HR saying fire her and they use forward to send the person a dismissal notice and remove the visible parts of the email,  then it will thread the items together. </p> <blockquote>I suppose for now, the only way to NOT link things that were never meant to be would be to change the Subject when discussing important topics.</blockquote> <p>Threading uses the references header.  It has been an integral part of email for more than 20 years,  it is just more folk are being exposed to what it contains now that threading is on by default.  it is not something that can be turned off.  The display of threads can be changed and I linked to that article at the beginning. </p><p>Fundamentally if you do not want your next message threaded with the conversation,  use the Write button and write a new email, then address it and send it.  Do not use forward,  do not use reply, they retain the references header from the mail you fare forwarding or replying to.  You can use edit as new if you want to use a previous email as a base.  You can also quote a previous email by having it open in the Thunderbird application and  selecting quote message in the menu of the write window but those are not really threading,  just ways to get information into a new email. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So maybe it is best not to forward, instead write a new email and copy and paste if you only intend some of the message to go to someone else (other mine fields aside like bcc etc.). </p><p>That said, another email program ""unstacks"" or ungroups the threads if I choose to turn off threading. At least that's how I recall or seem to be used to.   </p><p>In Thunderbird I forwarded and edited a Christmas card boilerplate and thought I had embarrassed myself. </p>",sdoyle1,false,0,0

Where can I get a download of the previous Linux flatpack version of Thunderbird and Is there an automatic removal to go back to the previous version&nbsp;? </blockquote> <p>The Thunderbird team have no approved or official downgrade process.  I am loath to even suggest it as there is no way to undo any file data changes that come from the update,  so even when forced,  the profile can never be trusted to not be corrupted or missing data. </p><p>I suggest you look to the distribution point you got your flatpack from.  There are none in the Archive, only tarballs. </p><p>Perhaps you might like to actually participate in the process of trying to determine what the issue you are describing is.  While there are a lot of changes in 115.  It does not appear to have been more than skin deep in most parts.   So you say compacting folders removes mails?  Do you have a backup of the underlying files before and after that someone cal look at to see if they can see why what you say happened really did happen?  Over a very long time I have heard folk complaining that compacting removed mail.  I have only seen it in two instances; 1. The underlying file was corrupt. 2. The underlying file had at one point been removed and all mail prior to the date of removal was still shown in Thunderbird until the compact forces an alignment of the data with the user interface cache in the MSF file. </p><p>So which is it with you,  or have you actually encountered a brand new bug.  Without some real information no one can guess and if it is a bug,  no one will fix it,  because to the best of my knowledge there are one or two folk a month here alleging data loss from compacting and perhaps one a year that is unexplained. </p><p>You say deleting mail leaves it in folders.  I have seen some complaints of this,  only with unified folders and the issue is resolved post a restart and in some cases post changing folders. Something about the updates to the user interface not triggering as it should I think.  So there may be an issue there.  I have not seen it,  nor have I seen an actual bug filed for it.  So there is nothing for developers to fix, because there is no bug. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Generally if you click in the list where mail should be,  it will open,  it just has no headings to show. </p><p>This information is stored in the index database for the folder,  you might try right clicking the folder and selecting properties and then the repair.  It keeps bringing back the correspondents folder that I hate. Perhaps it will bring back your mail.  </p><p>Another common cause is the connection to the server has been lost for IMAP accounts.  They are fully synchronized and as the server is the canonical device a sync to a not there server simply deletes all the mail in the folder.  This is easily fixed by fixing the connection error as mail will sync again from the server once the problem is fixed.  This usually sees most folder in the account also disappear at thesame time.  So I don't think that fits your story. </p><p>Finally if you use the unified folders view the search folders it is based on can be corrupted.  I will not go there, unless I need to.

As you say you can not be sure all messages are downloaded use the import export tools addon to export the messages in the folder as EML.  You will need to preprovision the destination folder.  The tool will check the folder is up to date with the server and also check each message as it is exported. </p><p><a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>Note that you can re-import the EML files using the same addon to local folders,  and you  can even call it what you like.
