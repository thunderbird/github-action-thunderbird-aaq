Thunderbird/Mozilla either needs to eliminate this (with appropriate warning notices, perhaps) or at least give us the ability to NOT link various messages. It's not only vastly annoying, it can cause severe real-world problems if anyone not in the CC or BCC fields is receiving these messages that were not intended for them.  I suppose for now, the only way to NOT link things that were never meant to be would be to change the Subject when discussing important topics.  Either that, or get a whole new mail service, which I'd prefer not to have to do. </blockquote> <p>I started out thinking.  This is simple.  Link to the appropriate support article which includes advice on how to turn off threading for existing and new folders. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#</a> </p><p>But then I got to;  </p> <blockquote>  It's not only vastly annoying, it can cause severe real-world problems if anyone not in the CC or BCC fields is receiving these messages that were not intended for them. </blockquote> <p>You do realize I hope that threading only shows mail already on your computer.  It does not send additional links to other emails to other folk,  unless you include them.  It will thread mail you send and mail someone you communicate with also sends them if the mail is from the same thread.  SO if you send an email to an employee saying ""good idea"" and then forward the original email to HR saying fire her and they use forward to send the person a dismissal notice and remove the visible parts of the email,  then it will thread the items together. </p> <blockquote>I suppose for now, the only way to NOT link things that were never meant to be would be to change the Subject when discussing important topics.</blockquote> <p>Threading uses the references header.  It has been an integral part of email for more than 20 years,  it is just more folk are being exposed to what it contains now that threading is on by default.  it is not something that can be turned off.  The display of threads can be changed and I linked to that article at the beginning. </p><p>Fundamentally if you do not want your next message threaded with the conversation,  use the Write button and write a new email, then address it and send it.  Do not use forward,  do not use reply, they retain the references header from the mail you fare forwarding or replying to.  You can use edit as new if you want to use a previous email as a base.  You can also quote a previous email by having it open in the Thunderbird application and  selecting quote message in the menu of the write window but those are not really threading,  just ways to get information into a new email. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So I guess you might be able to find those menus now. </p><p>I do not think right clicking on the account ever actually fixed missing mail content.  But  there are some more common causes. </p><p>Thunderbird losses all the message headings except the menu widget. Like all of this but the last square entry. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-12-03-00-48-31-196a24.png""> </p><p>Unfortunately  that has been going on since at least 2012.  Generally if you click in the list where mail should be,  it will open,  it just has no headings to show. </p><p>This information is stored in the index database for the folder,  you might try right clicking the folder and selecting properties and then the repair.  It keeps bringing back the correspondents folder that I hate. Perhaps it will bring back your mail.  </p><p>Another common cause is the connection to the server has been lost for IMAP accounts.  They are fully synchronized and as the server is the canonical device a sync to a not there server simply deletes all the mail in the folder.  This is easily fixed by fixing the connection error as mail will sync again from the server once the problem is fixed.  This usually sees most folder in the account also disappear at thesame time.  So I don't think that fits your story. </p><p>Finally if you use the unified folders view the search folders it is based on can be corrupted.  I will not go there, unless I need to.

Are there others in the list that do not use oauth? </p><p>My understanding of the oauth process is if authentication fails the whole browser window authorization process re occurs,  not a prompt for a simple password, so my guess is your replies are not using the SMTP server you think they are.  Most likely using the ""default"" rather than the one for the account you expect. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
