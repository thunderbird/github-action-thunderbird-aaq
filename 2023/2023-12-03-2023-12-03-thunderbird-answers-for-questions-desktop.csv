There are a few other unhappy iinet users on the forum looking for answers at the moment.  I think it probably has something to sdo with encrypted connections,  but really I have seen nothing concrete.  I suggest you try iinets connections settings without SSL or TLS. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

So I guess you might be able to find those menus now. </p><p>I do not think right clicking on the account ever actually fixed missing mail content.  But  there are some more common causes. </p><p>Thunderbird losses all the message headings except the menu widget. Like all of this but the last square entry. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-12-03-00-48-31-196a24.png""> </p><p>Unfortunately  that has been going on since at least 2012.  Generally if you click in the list where mail should be,  it will open,  it just has no headings to show. </p><p>This information is stored in the index database for the folder,  you might try right clicking the folder and selecting properties and then the repair.  It keeps bringing back the correspondents folder that I hate. Perhaps it will bring back your mail.  </p><p>Another common cause is the connection to the server has been lost for IMAP accounts.  They are fully synchronized and as the server is the canonical device a sync to a not there server simply deletes all the mail in the folder.  This is easily fixed by fixing the connection error as mail will sync again from the server once the problem is fixed.  This usually sees most folder in the account also disappear at thesame time.  So I don't think that fits your story. </p><p>Finally if you use the unified folders view the search folders it is based on can be corrupted.  I will not go there, unless I need to.  Are you using the unified folders view? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
