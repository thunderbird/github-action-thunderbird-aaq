One desktop and one laptop.  Both are fully updated and utilizing Office software, specifically Outlook.  Not too long ago I happily discovered Thunderbird and like it soooo much better. QUESTION: Within Outlook, my calendar is displayed as iCloud Calendar which is ok for me.  The one thing that is keeping me from exclusively using Thunderbird is not being able to import my iCoud calendar into Thunderbird. Is that even possible and if so, how?  Please keep your response as simplistic as possible. Thank you for your time and consideration given to my inquiry. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1620131;,truckdriverdon

This means that once that project is archived all information pertaining to it is securely saved in one place. </p><p>I forgo Windows Internet Explorer sometime ago for Firefox and did not want to use the latest version of Outlook, therefore I am trialing Thunderbird. </p><p>To your knowledge is there an add-on for Thunderbird which will enable me to save messages out of the program and in my individual project directories. </p><p>Many thanks </p><p>Graham </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1620130;1620133;1620267;,graham3443
