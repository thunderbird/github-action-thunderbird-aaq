Na minulém PC mi šlo nastavit v Thunderbirdu stahování zpráv z obou účtů rovnou do ""Místní složka"", do ""Doručená pošta"". Postup nastavení byl následující: Nástroje - Nastavení účtu - Nastavení serveru - Úložiště zpráv, a tam byla ikona ""Rozšířené"", kde byl nějaký výběr a jedna z možností byla Místní složky. Po spuštění TB zmizely v levé části oba účty a zůstala tam jen Místní složky. Po instalaci stejné verze TB na nový PC ikona ""Rozšířené"" zmizela. Může mi, prosím, někdo poradit, jak to nastavit zpět (pokud to jde). Děkuji </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,cs,"",leosve

In the prior TB versions, I only saw the last 3 or 4 messages in the upper message list portion of the classic view layout. Now I'm seeing almost 10 messages in my messages list. Meanwhile, the actual current message viewing pane is now horizontally compressed so that the ratio of message list to message view is closer to 40% message list, 60% actual message text plus the header info. I have tried click and drag the upper border of the current message being viewed, towards the top of the screen, but it stops, and still shows me 10 most recent messages in my list, which is really useless. I only need to see the last 3 or 4. The rest of the viewing pane should be more of the text area of the current message being viewed. Is there a ""config editor"" tweak to reduce the messages list to 3 or 4 messages, and increase the actual current message viewing area? Or some other fix for this? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1620047;1620054;1620057;,MrSensible

QUESTION: Within Outlook, my calendar is displayed as iCloud Calendar which is ok for me.  The one thing that is keeping me from exclusively using Thunderbird is not being able to import my iCoud calendar into Thunderbird. Is that even possible and if so, how?  Please keep your response as simplistic as possible. Thank you for your time and consideration given to my inquiry. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",truckdriverdon
