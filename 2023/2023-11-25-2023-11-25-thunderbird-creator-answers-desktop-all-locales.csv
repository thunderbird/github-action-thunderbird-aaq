One desktop and one laptop.  Both are fully updated and utilizing Office software, specifically Outlook.  Not too long ago I happily discovered Thunderbird and like it soooo much better. QUESTION: Within Outlook, my calendar is displayed as iCloud Calendar which is ok for me.  The one thing that is keeping me from exclusively using Thunderbird is not being able to import my iCoud calendar into Thunderbird. Is that even possible and if so, how?  Please keep your response as simplistic as possible. Thank you for your time and consideration given to my inquiry. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1620131;,truckdriverdon
