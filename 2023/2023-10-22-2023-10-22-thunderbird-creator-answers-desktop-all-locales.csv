The numerical reminders of ""unread"" mails next to the folders are distracting, and the lines in the actual mail list are so close together that they practically overlap. I have low vision, and this is maddening. Most maddening of all: when I delete an e-mail, randomly and unpredictably the screen will hop to another part of my Inbox. I have no idea what function this feature is supposed to serve. How do I get the previous version of Thunderbird back? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",st.kate

A browser window pops up in Thunderbird advising me that I can't log in because my browser is set to block cookies. (See screenshots.) </p><p>I'm not sure which browser this is even referring to. It's true I have cookies disabled in Thunderbird and Firefox (as much as possible), but I don't think this is the cause of the problem. I have tried enabling cookies in Thunderbird and Firefox, but this has not helped. Also, I have always had cookies disabled in Thunderbird and Firefox, but I have never seen this problem until the update to 115.3.3. </p><p>Is there a way to fix this without rolling back to a previous version of Thunderbird? If not, how can I roll back to a previous version of Thunderbird? </p><p>Your help is appreciated. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",bartdaly

I have this problem with Thunderbird 115.3.1 from the official debian repository. My Thunderbird runs in the Linux environment (Bullseye) of a Chromebook with the latest stable ChromeOS version. Currently version 118.0.5993.86 (Official Build) (64-bit) I've had the problem since migrating from 102 to 115. Emails are almost impossible to delete from the trash. I have two accounts stored, both as imap. One of them is a smaller German provider and the other affected is a GMX account. However, I have had to hard shut down the Linux environment after a deletion process because Thunderbird no longer responds at all. When I delete in one of the accounts the trash files, so appears the content of them at the next start again but with the timestamp of the new from TB created files. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",aod7373

1428458,2023-10-22 04:03:01 -0700,2023-10-22 04:51:25 -0700,Font size of Thunderbird thread window,"<p>Hi, </p><p>I am a Mac user on Ventura 13.6. </p><p>I upgraded to Thunderbird 115.3.3 and all of a sudden I cannot comfortably use it anymore. The font size of the window that shows the messages in your inbox (I believe that is called the thread window) is so small it is hard to read for me. I scanned this forum and applied all the suggested tips, none of them work. And no I will not adjust my monitor resolution to 1920x1080 just for Thunderbird, all other applications are fine and readable. </p><p>What did I try: 1. <strong>Settings/Fonts&amp;Colours.</strong> This had no effect on any window that I could see. </p><p>2. <strong>Config editor </strong> Changed parameter for <em>layout.css.devPixelsPerPx</em> (set it to 1.2) This seemed to work, everything became readable. Unfortunately the side effect is that the font in Thunderbird alert pop-ups is also increased which makes the action buttons fall outside of the pop-up window. (E.g. you close a draft message window, a pop-up appears, but you cannot select any of the options, see below). This makes this way of increasing font-size completely unusable. </p><p>3. <strong>CSS </strong> In the config editor I set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to 'true' I then quit Thunderbird and edited userChrome.css in the chrome folder (in the profile folder) and added the following: /* Threads Pane font and background*/ </p><pre>#threadTree &gt; treechildren {  font-size: 24pt&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/* Folder Pane font and background*/ </p><pre>#folderTree &gt; treechildren {  font-size: 24pt&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>I tried different sizes, none had any effect on Thunderbird font sizes when I restarted it. Then I added  /* </p><pre>* Make all the default font sizes 20 pt: */ * { font-size: 20pt&nbsp;!important  }  </pre> <p>This had the effect on Thunderbird that the fonts of the top and bottom bar increased. However not the thread window. However it showed that the CSS is loaded and has effect. </p><p>So I now ran out of solutions to increase the font of the threads window and am looking for help. </p><p>Thanks Erik </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",e.huizer
