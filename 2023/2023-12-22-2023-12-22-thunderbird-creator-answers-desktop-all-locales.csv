(It turned out to be on the ISP's end.)  Tonight I briefly opened two copies of Thunderbird, one with the old/original profile and one with the new profile, to make sure the download would work.  I was able to download my new mail to the original profile, so I moved last night's mail from the new inbox to my original inbox in the new profile, and then deleted the new profile since I don't need it.  But now the past six months' worth of mail is missing from both my inbox and my sent folder!  They both jump from June 13 to yesterday.  I noticed it when I had the two copies open next to each other (those messages were missing in both copies), but thought maybe it was a merge problem and hoped they would be restored when I deleted the second profile.  But they weren't.  I absolutely did not delete all those messages and many of them are really important.  Where did they go and how can I get them back?  Help!!! </p><p>p.s. Sadly I haven't backed up in a while...&nbsp;:-( </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",elkatd
