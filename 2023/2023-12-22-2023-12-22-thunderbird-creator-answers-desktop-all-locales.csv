(It turned out to be on the ISP's end.)  Tonight I briefly opened two copies of Thunderbird, one with the old/original profile and one with the new profile, to make sure the download would work.  I was able to download my new mail to the original profile, so I moved last night's mail from the new inbox to my original inbox in the new profile, and then deleted the new profile since I don't need it.  But now the past six months' worth of mail is missing from both my inbox and my sent folder!  They both jump from June 13 to yesterday.  I noticed it when I had the two copies open next to each other (those messages were missing in both copies), but thought maybe it was a merge problem and hoped they would be restored when I deleted the second profile.  But they weren't.  I absolutely did not delete all those messages and many of them are really important.  Where did they go and how can I get them back?  Help!!! </p><p>p.s. Sadly I haven't backed up in a while...&nbsp;:-( </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1625846;,elkatd

There is a blue line at the bottom showing it is trying to do something, but it never finishes.  I close every running program, reboot, and it works fine until I mistakingly shut it down again.  I have several accounts and get hundreds of emails every day.  I try to keep deleting them, empty trash, and compact folders.  My Imap folders in my profile are huge. Many gigabytes.  I plan to migrate to a new computer and don't want to move whatever is wrong to the new computer. This means I will have to start fresh, set up the accounts, fix the signature files, etc.  Then I can export the address book and import them to the new computer.  This will be very time consuming. Is there some way I can delete the saved emails from the profile file and copy the rest of the profile over? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1625839;,patnsandy
