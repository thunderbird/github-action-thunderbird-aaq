(It turned out to be on the ISP's end.)  Tonight I briefly opened two copies of Thunderbird, one with the old/original profile and one with the new profile, to make sure the download would work.  I was able to download my new mail to the original profile, so I moved last night's mail from the new inbox to my original inbox in the new profile, and then deleted the new profile since I don't need it.  But now the past six months' worth of mail is missing from both my inbox and my sent folder!  They both jump from June 13 to yesterday.  I noticed it when I had the two copies open next to each other (those messages were missing in both copies), but thought maybe it was a merge problem and hoped they would be restored when I deleted the second profile.  But they weren't.  I absolutely did not delete all those messages and many of them are really important.  Where did they go and how can I get them back?  Help!!! </p><p>p.s.

I have a hard time understanding why they don't add an option to Thunderbird's settings to prevent automatic updates from creating shortcut icons on the desktop. You don't understand that Mozilla's Firefox and Thunderbird are no longer popular because it is still common knowledge that they are not user friendly.
