The Catch-22 is that when all of the sudden the screen layout looks very unfamiliar (as happened to me this morning),  it's hard to figure out what parameter will fix it.  For example, I assume that the F8 you recommended is a short-cut for some combination of View parameters.  I'm not sure exactly WHY it solved my problem and got my screen looking ""normal"" again, but it certainly did. </p><p>Sometimes even the smallest change can be an annoying time wasters.  A while ago, Thunderbird changed the text on the thingie you click on when you want to write a new message.  It used to say (I think) just ""Write"";  now it says ""New Message"".  I guess SOMEBODY thought this was clearer, but for a few weeks every time I saw it my brain would hesitate and wonder if it was announcing a new INPUT message just received.  If a change had to be made, imho ""Write message"" would have been less ambiguous than ""New Message""  -- but that's probably just a quirk of a crotchety old lady who still misses user manuals.
