I'm not familiar with version 60, but if the setup is the same, look in c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles  This will have one or more profile folders. Look in each for a file named abook.sqlite. If in more than one profile, the larger one or recently updated one would be it. If you find it, it doesn't work with version 60. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
