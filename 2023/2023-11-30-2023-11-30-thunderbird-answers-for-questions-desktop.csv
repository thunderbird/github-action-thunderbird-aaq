Are you sure it is not enabled when you say you don't use one? </li></ul> <p><strong>Other issues</strong> Have you ever successfully use any mail client to connect to a mail server using this hardware?  Sad as it may seem,  we are living with a group of so called professionals that assume we only do web pages on the internet.  It is entirely possible you have some sort of internet modem/router that actually blocks mail ports. (it would not be the first time.  Years ago Comcast issued new routers to their customers that blocked access to their own mail servers. </p><p>Mail servers almost universally only work well with IPV4 addresses.  Networks with IP6 addressing can mess all this up and it can be messed up in the DNS part of the process.  Disabling IPV6 is an option to try to see if you are caught in this mess.  Use the <a href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=config+editor"" class=""new"" title=""Page does not exist."" rel=""nofollow"">config editor</a> to change the setting network.dns.disableIPv6 to True and restart Thunderbird. </p><p>BitDefender uses self signed certificates for it's man in the middle hacking to scan your mail.  Thunderbird does not recognize these self signed certificates.  At one point they actually changed the way Thunderbird stored certificate so it used the windows store rather than it's own because the windows store can be manipulated from code, Thunderbird's can not.  Try disabling it's ScanSSL (that was what they called it in 2016) as well as mail scanning while you try and set up the account. </p><p><strong>Finally</strong> </p><p>You can always log the process. First you need to change some hidden preferences in Thunderbird to get a complete log.  So go to the <a href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=config+editor"" class=""new"" title=""Page does not exist."" rel=""nofollow"">config editor</a> and make the following preference changes. mail.wizard.logging.dump to all mail.wizard.logging.console to all Now access the error console (ctrl+Shift+J) or via the developer tools on the tool menu and clear it by clicking the trash bin icon Run the setup and check the log.
