Per tutti gli altri account l'aggiornamento è andato bene, mentre per questo account ha cominciato ad apparire il popup che ho indicato. Infatti da allora ho dovuto impostare in gmail il reindirizzamento della posta su un secondo account. Però tutte le volte che chiedo di scaricare i messaggi su tutti gli account, questo popup appare e non posso fare altro che chiuderlo, senza poter scaricare i messaggi, così come non posso utilizzare l'account per inviare messaggi tramite Thunderbird. Quello che mi sembra strano è quello che accade quando premo il pulsante Consenti o Rifiuta nel popup. Dopo la pressione del tasto, entrambi i tasti vengono disabilitati, ma poi non accade più nulla. Ho provato anche ad aspettare qualche ora, ma il popup rimane aperto; se lo chiudo, lo scaricamento dei messaggi prosegue dall'account successivo. </p>",poliplead,false,0,0

I've attached two screen shots: </p><p>_01:  The way my Thunderbird inbox appears. _02:  The way the text of your message appears when I  right-click on its header, then click on ""View in new Tab"", and then click on that tab. </p><p>FYI, previously when I received Emails about responses to Mozilla support requests like this, I seem to recall that the message would contain something I could click on to get back to the web page contain the thread of replies.  This time, if there was such an icon in your message, I couldn't find it.  I had to search the Firefox history to find the page where I posted my question so that I could reply. </p><p>I am running Windows 11 Pro with the latest version of Firefox.  This change has made reading and responding to my Emails very slow and difficult.   I appreciate any help you can offer. </p><p>......mandy </p>",MandyWh,false,0,0
