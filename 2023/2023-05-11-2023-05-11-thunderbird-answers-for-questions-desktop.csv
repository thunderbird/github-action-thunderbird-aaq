Those that have a firewall functionality often apply policies depending on the network you're connected to. They treat public wifi as untrusted, unless you configure them to handle things differently. A quick test, would be to disable your firewall and see if Thunderbird still has problems. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

Are you certain you have the individual calendars disabled in Thunderbird? </blockquote> <p>I don't want to hide it. Let me summarize the problem. </p><p>Many customers and suppliers schedule appointments sending the invitation by email. Invite to calls, meetings, videocalls, etc. are sent with a email message. You confirm those scheduled events and add to your calendar by using integrations between those email messages and your calendar app/service. </p><p>TB now forces us to use its own calendar.  You no longer can integrate TB with another calendar app like before. </p><p>So I setup lightning, as I have no other option.  But every 2 months the integrations to other calendar apps stops. Sometimes it just don't sync, sometimes it's a security problem like now (password don't match). Each time I have to remove all integrations and redo the setup of lightning again from scratch. This time it didn't work....so I'm pissed off. </p><p>I do not know if the problem is from Mozilla side or from the calendars apps (Apple, Outlook, Google, etc.) I just want to avoid using TB calendar and go back to the old setup (TB directly linked to a calendar app) </p><p>And, I said, for no reason I will drop email integration to calendar services. I'd stop using TB and migrate to another email client that can manage invitation from different calendar services. </p><p>Thank you Wayne Mery for your message and support. </p>",gianluca7,false,0,0

Freezing, unfreezing, freezing again, etc. Sometimes it locks up Windows, but mostly it just locks up Thunderbird and renders it inaccessible until it unfreezes.  </p><p>I have searched and scanned this forum for answers countless times, and have searched the internet for answers. I have now exhausted my ability to try to fix this thing. I have used TB for many years and love its simple interface, but I cannot sit and wait every 90 seconds for it to unfreeze, only to freeze up again and again. Here is what I have done so far. If this post is inappropriate here, I'm happy to post a new one somewhere else. Thanks:  </p><p>I have several email accounts, but have disabled all but two, in order to troubleshoot. All my accounts (including Gmail POP accounts) are now IMAP. I keep all messages together in folders under my ""Local Folders"". This works well when TB is not freezing. So, it will retrieve and store messages okay. I've turned off ""Check for New"" on all but one, and that one is set for 60 minutes. I've also turned off Check for Msgs at Startup on all but one, so it's not checking all the email accounts until I ask it to. It freezes anyway.  </p><p>Thunderbird version 102.11.2 (64-bit) Windows 10 (up to date); Desktop computer; 16GB RAM, 3TB HD, plus two 3TB backup drives </p><p>Started Windows in Safe Mode  Started TB: disable all add-ons Started TB: Reset Toolbars &amp; controls  Started TB: continue in Troubleshoot Mode  Backed up Profile, then created new one  Reinstalled TB, using both old and new profiles  Turned off Windows Defender and all antivirus programs  Added Exclusion for TB in Windows Virus &amp; Threat Protection Turned off Windows Indexing  Turned off TB's option to allow Windows to search emails  Disabled Global Search &amp; Indexer in TB Options  Checked all email accounts for correct settings turned off all but one email account  Reinstalled Windows 10  </p><p>None of these has worked. This might not be a complete list, as I have probably forgotten a few things that I have tried. I'm afraid I cannot be a beta tester any longer. I'm happy to help the community, but I really do need a reliable email client and sadly, Thunderbird is no longer it. I'm hoping for a miracle here, but not holding my breath. Thanks in advance for any tips, and I'm still happy to try new ideas.  </p><p>best,  --john </p>",johnegenes,false,0,0
