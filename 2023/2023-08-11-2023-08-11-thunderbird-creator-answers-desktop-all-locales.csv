1420866,2023-08-10 19:46:28 -0700,2023-08-10 19:46:28 -0700,problems with outgoing server user names,"<p>I have 4 <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> email accounts that I use on Thunderbird. I have found that <a href=""http://smtp-mail.outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp-mail.outlook.com</a> works best for me. When I change the user name for email1@outlook.com the username for email2@outlook.com changes to match email1. I was using Thunderbird 102.xx.x everything was working well, when I upgraded to 115.1.0 Thunderbird forgot all of my passwords and this issue with the outgoing server name appeared.  Any help to fix this problem will be appreciated. Thanks, Rob </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rob.1947
