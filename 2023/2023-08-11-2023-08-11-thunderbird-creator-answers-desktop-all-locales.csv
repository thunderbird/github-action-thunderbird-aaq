Currently, upon inspecting the local directory, I've noticed the presence of 200 mail files and 200 POP mail files, as indicated in an image. I've already replaced the prefs file with the largest one from before the crash. Additionally, I attempted to import accounts; however, I excluded message import due to the substantial volume (thousands of messages spread across three accounts). While one user was automatically added, I manually added the other account. My primary concern is whether it's possible to rectify the paths for all these files. The situation involves both large folders (approximately 4GB) and smaller ones, all containing a mixture of mail accounts. I'm uncertain if Thunderbird's repair system can handle this intricate scenario. Is there a method to recover and ensure that all messages are correctly attributed to their respective accounts? Any assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1597064;1597083;1597084;1597103;1597111;1597117;,phil_pp
