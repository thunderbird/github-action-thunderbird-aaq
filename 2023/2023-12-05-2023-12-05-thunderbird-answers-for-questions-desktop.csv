Suggestions:  - to import eudora files, see this link:  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1228297"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1228297</a>  - for other accounts, such as yahoo, gmail, etc. do them one at a time. Each has its own setup process.  - if you have POP accounts (other than in Eudora), you need to focus on each individually to be sure you are preserving the messages.  - periodically, do a full backup. You will be building accounts at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird so copy that folder to a safe place routinely to ensure that if you make a mistake at any time you can safely restore what you have.  - I believe we can assist you here, but please focus on ONE issue at a time to get resolved. Our support is this forum, not phone or email, and the forum is most effective when looking at ONE issue at a time. Thank you.  And, yes, you can mix POP and IMAP accounts. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
