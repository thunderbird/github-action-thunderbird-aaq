Each has its own setup process.  - if you have POP accounts (other than in Eudora), you need to focus on each individually to be sure you are preserving the messages.  - periodically, do a full backup. You will be building accounts at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird so copy that folder to a safe place routinely to ensure that if you make a mistake at any time you can safely restore what you have.  - I believe we can assist you here, but please focus on ONE issue at a time to get resolved.
