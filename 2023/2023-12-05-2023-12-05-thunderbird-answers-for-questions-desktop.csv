Then - create your two IMAP accounts as before  - there should be a local folders showing and you can then exit TB and copy the mail files (e.g., inbox, inbox.msf) to the Mail\Local Folders folder  - you can import your old addressbook with tools&gt;import&gt;import from a file and select sqlite format and then point to abook.sqlite on you old profile.   </p><p>OR ....
