I did a web search and a local search for a file location and turned up the directory /var/snap/firefox but failed to find anything that looked like an executable. IAC, it seems like a bug in Thunderbird that it fails to respect both the system settings and those in Firefox.  Should I report it as such?  If so, where?

I'm not happy with the idea of modifying system variables like ""$XDG_DATA_HOME"" to make this work as it should, much less going through all of the other steps that <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/RedBearAK/"" rel=""nofollow"">RedBearAK</a>  describes. The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/mmbjmj/cant_set_thunderbird_or_firefox_snaps_as_default/"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit thread</a>  did help me to find what appears to be the firefox snap executable: </p><pre>/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/firefox_firefox.desktop </pre> <p>so I tried making this the target of Thunderbird's ""Files &amp; Attachments"" action for https, which Thunderbird had recreated pointing to Chromium. This was a challenge, because the ""Select Helper Application"" dialog insists that you navigate the entire directory tree to find an application instead of allowing you to paste a directory path somewhere.  The result was no action at all when clicking on a link in an e-mail.  Since I had placed a link to Firefox on my desktop and the ""Select Helper Application"" dialog helpfully offers ""Desktop"" in its left-hand common locations"" pane, I also tried selecting Firefox there, but the results were the same.  If I change the action to ""Always ask"", the results are still the same. Clicking on an HTTPS link in an e-mail does *not* produce a prompt asking what application to use. Other than this integration, I haven't experienced any of the complaints i have  read about Firefox as a snap.  In particular i find that it loads quickly enough, even though I am running Ubuntu Studio 22.04 LTS on an antique desktop PC and my favorite third-party add-ons, uMatrix and OneTab are working fine. The idea of using Firefox as a snap seems good to me.  I like the automatic updates and the idea of running it in a fenced-off environment. Nonetheless, it appears that I will have to uninstall the snap version and install Firefox natively (as suggested in your last link) in order to get a maintainable system that works as intended. I have posted <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1823158"" rel=""nofollow"">a bug</a> and will first await a response to that before proceeding. </p>",rsbrux,false,0,0

This allowed me to find ""Use Firefox Web Browser (default)"" in the actions list for http and https. Selecting these achieves the desired result, but the setting does not persist for https.  The next time I open Thunderbird, the action entry for https is empty. </p><p>P.S. Even though the action for https remains empty, clicking on an https link in an e-mail *does* now in fact open it in Firefox. </p>",rsbrux,false,1,0

If the ""whole idea"" is, as you say, to leave things up to the OS, why does Thunderbird under Ubuntu (at least as of 102.8.0) include these settings which were overriding my system preferences?  Any ""playing around with hidden preferences"" I have done was an attempt to remedy the problem and was recommended by other posters. </p>",rsbrux,false,0,0
