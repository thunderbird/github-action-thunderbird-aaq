Already added confirm and delivery notices to it, but this seems to do nothing. When I add my own e-mail to this e-mail message, this one will arrive fast.

One suggested deleting 'folderCache.json', 'session.json', and 'xulstore.json' files from my thunderbird profile folder and restarting. I tried and it had no noticeable effect. </p><p>I can't be sure whether it was there before but after the problem update, I notice I have 2 instances of my gmail address showing under the 'Sent' tray/group. Under sent it lists 2 x my <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> account and my other account. Again, the other account's sent mails can be viewed just fine as before but the first '...@gmail.com' account list most (perhaps all) of my sent emails, but opening any of them just brings up a totally blank new tab again. </p><p>Interestingly, however, the other (new?) duplicate '...@gmail.com' under the Sent group also shows a big list of sent emails and this one does correctly show all messages when viewing any in a new tab. The properties of both of these identical-looking 'sent' mailboxes ('x'-ing out my email) are - 1st - Location: imap://xxxxxxxxx%<a href=""http://40gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">40gmail.com</a>@imap.gmail.com/Sent 	Showing 267 sent messages 	Doesn't work. Viewing any of the messages just shows a blank tab. 2nd - Location: imap://xxxxxxxxx%<a href=""http://40gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">40gmail.com</a>@imap.gmail.com/%5BGmail%5D/Sent%20Mail 	Showing 283 sent messages 	Works.  Viewing any of these opens a tab that correctly shows the message. To my knowledge, I've not added the second almost identical 'sent' gmail account. </p><p>The location of the newly broken @gmail.com Inbox is - Location:  imap://xxxxxxxxxx%<a href=""http://40gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">40gmail.com</a>@imap.gmail.com/INBOX </p><p>The fact that one of the <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> sent lists/view works and the other doesn't suggests something might be wrong with the 1st 'location' format.  I've not touched either for as long as I can remember.  Could the upgrade have diddled the 'location' in such a way as to cause this behaviour or also duplicated a subtly different <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> 'Sent' folder? </p><p>The main Tools &gt; Account Settings does not appear to have a field that directly specified any of the 'Inbox' or 'Sent' Location fields that I can see;  it just list my 2 email accounts, with my now broken <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> one listed first, with server settings - - Type: IMAP mail server - Server Name:  <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> - User Name: xxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com - Port:  993 - Connection security:  SSL/TLS - Authentication method:  OAuth2 </p><p>Can anyone explain where the subtly different 'Sent' gmail entries might have come from and whether either of the 'Location' fields look invalid? Also, since my gmail Inbox 'Location' looks to have a similar format of that of the broken 'Sent' item/folder, does anyone know whether it is invalid and can be fixed with a different location field? </p>",download-and-install_1;tb115;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1608167;,Ernie_Gurney

There were sub-folders within the ""Active Projects"" folder - one for each client.  </p><p>Not ALL folders have disappeared.  Only the Active Projects folder has disappeared. </p><p>But,...

I use the portable version available on Portable Apps and I keep the program updated regularly to the latest version. My habit is to keep six months of trash stored on my hard drive. Each month, I delete the earliest month from the trash folder, then I compact the folder to recover the space. This used to be easy, but after the recent changes in the interface it has become much more difficult.  </p><p>Nowadays, it has become very difficult to select several hundred early trash messages at a time. Control-down does not scroll down smoothly any more to select a large number of highlighted messages for deletion. I have to do it in very small batches. I can manage this but it is time-consuming. When I have selected a block of messages, I press the delete button, and I get the cautionary warning that the deletions will be permanent. But there is no way to answer in the affirmative. Also the ""don't ask me again"" box does not respond to my mouse click, even though I don't really care whether I am asked again or not. There is no way to use that little interface to actually delete the files. It's a dead end. </p><p>After some experimentation, I discovered that I can use the ""move to"" on the right click menu to select ""move to trash"" even though I really want to delete them from the trash. Then I can compact the trash folder and recover the space. So I can still accomplish the deletion in a roundabout time-consuming way.  </p><p>It would be nice if TB could make that feature easier to  use, or if I am doing it wrong, at least inform me of an easier way to use it. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pjmorton
