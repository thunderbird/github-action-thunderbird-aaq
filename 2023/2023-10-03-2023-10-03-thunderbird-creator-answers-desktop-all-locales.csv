I use a large DPI setting on my laptop in order to make all Windows fonts large enough to see.  Previously when I made a new calendar entry, the event window was correct at the top of my screen and I could scroll down and add more details if needed.  However, in this new version, the event window seems to center on the screen and it's cut off at the top.  I can't enter my event title until I click around and get the window to move down.  Can you please fix this so the event window isn't cut off at the top and bottom of the screen and instead has a scroll bar if we need to add the information at the bottom?  I'm attaching a screenshot showing how the event window opens when I first click inside the calendar to create a new event.  (The last time I added a screenshot in this forum, the picture was much larger than the actual view on my laptop screen, so if this turns out the same way, please note that I do not have my DPI set THAT large...LOL) </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",ajp1228

I don't have time to google for hours trying to fix Thunderbird. I am in the middle of repairing my fence because the dogs keep getting out and the fence was destroyed by hurricane Ian's eye a year ago. I am so tired of fixing everything. I have been using Thunderbird since 2006. Why do the updates keep getting more bizarre? Waterfox did a similar thing yesterday just not as big, and from what I could gather it has something to do with fricking Microsoft, the super bullies of the tech world and the way the screen size is programed in Windows 10, wish Windows 7 would come back. Windows 10 screen sizing has always been a royal pain. 100% is not big enough so I have it at 125% and various websites are always screwed up, this never happened in Windows 7 and now it looks like it will screw up Waterfox which I went back to 5G.1.13 instead of the new 6G until I have a couple of days to screw around and endlessly google to find the perfect answer and figure out if its about:config or some CSS file or whatever needs to be fixed. I don't understand why these errors are not fixed before the updates are released. Especially when the update destroys the program making it nonfunctional.  Thunder bird is all distorted and I can't use it. I am screwed, I have packages coming, and a food truck from Oregon I have to meet and the delivery schedule keeps changing and texts are not coming through fricking Tmobile. I hate technology it is a royal time consuming pain in the ass.

The subfolders for my three accounts now make no sense. Inbox - has my three accounts, as expected. Drafts - has my three accounts, as expected. Sent  - has my three accounts, as expected. Trash - folder now empty. Used to have my three accounts. Now they are under each account's folder Junk - has only two of my three accounts. The third junk folder is labeled 'spam' and is under my Gmail account. </p><p>2) When I got a couple of messages just now, they were duplicated (only in Thunderbird, not on any other of my clients). Deleting one of the duplicates wound up deleting both of them and replacing them with a null message dated January 1, 1970. I moved the deleted message from the Trash folder back to the Inbox, resulting in the correct single message. </p><p>3) My 2020 Archive folder is no longer under Archives &gt; Local Folders. It is now under the Local Folders account. All the other Archive folders are where they used to be. </p><p>4) When I switch to Inbox - sometimes it scrolls to the top, not to where I was, and not to bottom where the most recent messages are. I cannot figure out how to reproduce this. </p><p>5) The default density for viewing emails does not correspond to what I used to have. It is unfortunate to not keep the previous default. </p><p>I don't dare reverting to the prior release because I have no confidence that doing so will restore my folder configuration.

(I'm on Win 10) </p><p>After this, none of the emails in my <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> mail account are viewable:  My 'Inbox' shows 2 email accounts underneath and selecting the gmail one shows a big list of messages but opening (double-clicking) any of them just opens a new tab that remains entirely empty. </p><p>Emails for the other Inbox account do correctly show messages in a new tab when opening, as things were previously. </p><p>The Tools &gt; Developer Tools &gt; Error Console shows the following errors (after having first cleared the log and then restarted Tb) - NotFoundError: No such JSWindowActor 'DevToolsFrame' Assert failed: Calendar manager initialised calendars before loadCalendarComponent ran on the first 3pane window. This should not happen. </p><pre>calUtils.jsm:127:15 </pre> <p>NotFoundError: No such JSWindowActor 'DevToolsFrame' </p><p>I found recent posts for <em>similar</em> sounding issues (but not quite the same).  One suggested deleting 'folderCache.json', 'session.json', and 'xulstore.json' files from my thunderbird profile folder and restarting. I tried and it had no noticeable effect. </p><p>I can't be sure whether it was there before but after the problem update, I notice I have 2 instances of my gmail address showing under the 'Sent' tray/group. Under sent it lists 2 x my <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> account and my other account. Again, the other account's sent mails can be viewed just fine as before but the first '...@gmail.com' account list most (perhaps all) of my sent emails, but opening any of them just brings up a totally blank new tab again. </p><p>Interestingly, however, the other (new?) duplicate '...@gmail.com' under the Sent group also shows a big list of sent emails and this one does correctly show all messages when viewing any in a new tab. The properties of both of these identical-looking 'sent' mailboxes ('x'-ing out my email) are - 1st - Location: imap://xxxxxxxxx%<a href=""http://40gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">40gmail.com</a>@imap.gmail.com/Sent 	Showing 267 sent messages 	Doesn't work. Viewing any of the messages just shows a blank tab. 2nd - Location: imap://xxxxxxxxx%<a href=""http://40gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">40gmail.com</a>@imap.gmail.com/%5BGmail%5D/Sent%20Mail 	Showing 283 sent messages 	Works.  Viewing any of these opens a tab that correctly shows the message. To my knowledge, I've not added the second almost identical 'sent' gmail account. </p><p>The location of the newly broken @gmail.com Inbox is - Location:  imap://xxxxxxxxxx%<a href=""http://40gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">40gmail.com</a>@imap.gmail.com/INBOX </p><p>The fact that one of the <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> sent lists/view works and the other doesn't suggests something might be wrong with the 1st 'location' format.  I've not touched either for as long as I can remember.  Could the upgrade have diddled the 'location' in such a way as to cause this behaviour or also duplicated a subtly different <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> 'Sent' folder? </p><p>The main Tools &gt; Account Settings does not appear to have a field that directly specified any of the 'Inbox' or 'Sent' Location fields that I can see;  it just list my 2 email accounts, with my now broken <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> one listed first, with server settings - - Type: IMAP mail server - Server Name:  <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> - User Name: xxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com - Port:  993 - Connection security:  SSL/TLS - Authentication method:  OAuth2 </p><p>Can anyone explain where the subtly different 'Sent' gmail entries might have come from and whether either of the 'Location' fields look invalid? Also, since my gmail Inbox 'Location' looks to have a similar format of that of the broken 'Sent' item/folder, does anyone know whether it is invalid and can be fixed with a different location field? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1608167;1608199;,Ernie_Gurney

[was Supernova menus - a bit of a mess],"<p>I've been using Thunderbird as my default mail client since it first came out. It's always been rock solid, and does what I expect of a mail program, manage my home email accounts and nothing more. The design has always been simple and well layed out. I have my folder list on the left, the folder preview/summary on top right, and actual highlighted email on botton right. </p><p>The new new menu layout is a bit of a mess. It now sits on the top of the Thunderbird window, above the file/edit/view menu, and can't be moved to below the file/edit/view menu. Every other program follows a defacto standard of default menu ontop, and custom menu's below file/edit/view. </p><p>It would be nicer still if I could move this new menu, to sit along side the (Inbox - Local Folders tab), there's all this dead space sitting there. (Where the new tabs sit, when I double click on a email.) </p><p>To be honest, where the menu originally sat, (above the message list) was more intuitive, as it applied to task you can apply to messages. </p><p>There's also the new ""+New Message"" button sitting at the top of the Folder Pane, yet the new menu uses ""Write"" instead of New Message, meaning no consistency. Is it Write or New Message. Also the ""New Message"" button looks out-of-place sitting there, and both buttons have different text pop-ups. ""New Message"" has Compose a new message, and ""Write"" has Create a new message. Again no consistency. </p><p>What would make more sense is instead of the ""New Message"" button sitting at the top of Folder pane, the ""Get Messsages"" button was there instead, as that has more relevance to the mail folders. (I just noticed that there is a small cloud icon sitting there that is the ""Get Messages"" button, but as it has no text I've never paid any attention to it, perhaps add some text to it, so that both buttons look like buttons, or both look like Icons. or an option to select text/icon/both.) </p><p>Further comment on the New Messages button area (at the top of the Folder pane). The space where that button sits, would be great to add other buttons/icons, ie: Address book, or better still combine the Spaces toolbar into this area, with on/off options for each icon. The spaces toolbar is pointless, a bar that runs the full height of the window for 5 icons. </p><p>Trevor.. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,"",mozilla457
