Apparently it is very important to have huge tool bars at the top?  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.

Why did Thunderbird update without my permission? I am a seventy plus year old senior, and I am used to the way of the Thunderbird I have been using. No I did not accidentally click on settings, and update. I want my old Thunderbird restored, immediately yet I do not have any backups. I really hate this new structure, and look, can you help? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lenwenzel.lw

Can someone advise on how exactly to do make your signature not appear grey?

After a lot of reading I discovered that there is a hard 4Gbyte limit on each account. Started moving e-mails to folders under Local Folders but the problem remained; apparently the contents of Local Folders count toward the limit. Some suggested going to the 64 bit version, alleging that it had no such hard limit, which I did, but it shows the same behavior. </p><p>This the error message that repeatedly comes up: </p><pre>""Unable to write the email to the mailbox. Make sure the file system allows you write privileges, and you have enough disk space to copy the mailbox."" </pre> <p>This a single user 64 machine running Windows 10 Pro 22H2 (OS Build 19045.3448). The file system allows me to do just about anything to it, and there are currently 592 GBytes free. That's after I made a 7.1Gbyte copy of my profile folder.  </p><p>Currently the offending account is a gmail account. Google says there is about 10Gbyte available. Is this something that can be fixed easily, without abandoning my admittedly large backlog of e-mail? Is there possibly some flag set in my profile that invokes the 4GByte limit? </p><p>Thanks for any insight you can provide. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",david.kassover

I use the portable version available on Portable Apps and I keep the program updated regularly to the latest version. My habit is to keep six months of trash stored on my hard drive. Each month, I delete the earliest month from the trash folder, then I compact the folder to recover the space. This used to be easy, but after the recent changes in the interface it has become much more difficult.  </p><p>Nowadays, it has become very difficult to select several hundred early trash messages at a time. Control-down does not scroll down smoothly any more to select a large number of highlighted messages for deletion. I have to do it in very small batches. I can manage this but it is time-consuming. When I have selected a block of messages, I press the delete button, and I get the cautionary warning that the deletions will be permanent. But there is no way to answer in the affirmative. Also the ""don't ask me again"" box does not respond to my mouse click, even though I don't really care whether I am asked again or not. There is no way to use that little interface to actually delete the files. It's a dead end. </p><p>After some experimentation, I discovered that I can use the ""move to"" on the right click menu to select ""move to trash"" even though I really want to delete them from the trash. Then I can compact the trash folder and recover the space. So I can still accomplish the deletion in a roundabout time-consuming way.  </p><p>It would be nice if TB could make that feature easier to  use, or if I am doing it wrong, at least inform me of an easier way to use it. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pjmorton
