Each month, I delete the earliest month from the trash folder, then I compact the folder to recover the space.

Control-down does not scroll down smoothly any more to select a large number of highlighted messages for deletion. I have to do it in very small batches. I can manage this but it is time-consuming. When I have selected a block of messages, I press the delete button, and I get the cautionary warning that the deletions will be permanent. But there is no way to answer in the affirmative. Also the ""don't ask me again"" box does not respond to my mouse click, even though I don't really care whether I am asked again or not. There is no way to use that little interface to actually delete the files. It's a dead end. </p><p>After some experimentation, I discovered that I can use the ""move to"" on the right click menu to select ""move to trash"" even though I really want to delete them from the trash. Then I can compact the trash folder and recover the space.
