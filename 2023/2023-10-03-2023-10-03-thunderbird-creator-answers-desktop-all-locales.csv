The subfolders for my three accounts now make no sense. Inbox - has my three accounts, as expected. Drafts - has my three accounts, as expected. Sent  - has my three accounts, as expected. Trash - folder now empty. Used to have my three accounts. Now they are under each account's folder Junk - has only two of my three accounts. The third junk folder is labeled 'spam' and is under my Gmail account. </p><p>2) When I got a couple of messages just now, they were duplicated (only in Thunderbird, not on any other of my clients). Deleting one of the duplicates wound up deleting both of them and replacing them with a null message dated January 1, 1970. I moved the deleted message from the Trash folder back to the Inbox, resulting in the correct single message. </p><p>3) My 2020 Archive folder is no longer under Archives &gt; Local Folders. It is now under the Local Folders account. All the other Archive folders are where they used to be. </p><p>4) When I switch to Inbox - sometimes it scrolls to the top, not to where I was, and not to bottom where the most recent messages are. I cannot figure out how to reproduce this. </p><p>5) The default density for viewing emails does not correspond to what I used to have. It is unfortunate to not keep the previous default. </p><p>I don't dare reverting to the prior release because I have no confidence that doing so will restore my folder configuration. I fear I might even lose data. I know you worked hard on this release, but this user is not happy with the folder bugs and user interface changes. </p><p>Tim </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",tim263

I don't have time to google for hours trying to fix Thunderbird. I am in the middle of repairing my fence because the dogs keep getting out and the fence was destroyed by hurricane Ian's eye a year ago. I am so tired of fixing everything. I have been using Thunderbird since 2006. Why do the updates keep getting more bizarre? Waterfox did a similar thing yesterday just not as big, and from what I could gather it has something to do with fricking Microsoft, the super bullies of the tech world and the way the screen size is programed in Windows 10, wish Windows 7 would come back. Windows 10 screen sizing has always been a royal pain. 100% is not big enough so I have it at 125% and various websites are always screwed up, this never happened in Windows 7 and now it looks like it will screw up Waterfox which I went back to 5G.1.13 instead of the new 6G until I have a couple of days to screw around and endlessly google to find the perfect answer and figure out if its about:config or some CSS file or whatever needs to be fixed. I don't understand why these errors are not fixed before the updates are released. Especially when the update destroys the program making it nonfunctional.  Thunder bird is all distorted and I can't use it. I am screwed, I have packages coming, and a food truck from Oregon I have to meet and the delivery schedule keeps changing and texts are not coming through fricking Tmobile. I hate technology it is a royal time consuming pain in the ass. What ever happened to phone calls and not having to write  a novel to communicate.

Control-down does not scroll down smoothly any more to select a large number of highlighted messages for deletion. I have to do it in very small batches. I can manage this but it is time-consuming. When I have selected a block of messages, I press the delete button, and I get the cautionary warning that the deletions will be permanent. But there is no way to answer in the affirmative. Also the ""don't ask me again"" box does not respond to my mouse click, even though I don't really care whether I am asked again or not. There is no way to use that little interface to actually delete the files. It's a dead end. </p><p>After some experimentation, I discovered that I can use the ""move to"" on the right click menu to select ""move to trash"" even though I really want to delete them from the trash. Then I can compact the trash folder and recover the space. So I can still accomplish the deletion in a roundabout time-consuming way.  </p><p>It would be nice if TB could make that feature easier to  use, or if I am doing it wrong, at least inform me of an easier way to use it. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pjmorton
