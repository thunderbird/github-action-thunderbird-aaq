More recently, I have learned to use Juno's POP and SMTP servers, however in recent years some issue developed between Juno and Mozilla/Thunderbird, wherein TB will not place a message sent through Juno in the Sent or Drafts folder (as applicable) on the Juno server(s), forcing TB to use separate local folders instead. For incoming mail, I use server <a href=""http://pop.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.juno.com</a> on port 995 with SSL/TLS security and encrypted-password authentication. For outgoing mail, I use server <a href=""http://smtp.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.juno.com</a> on port 465. Every time I send mail, the following messages appear: <em>There is not enough disk space to download new messages. Try deleting old mail, emptying the Trash folder, and compacting your mail folders, and then try again.</em> which is inaccurate, given I have a considerable-sized hard drive (500 GB), plus multiple USB drives with much more space... then comes: <em>Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. </em> You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent-bob.in.jersey@juno.com.<em> </em> with the choice of buttons Retry, Save, or Don't Save. <em>Please do something about this, or tell me what I need to do to ensure that the messages go to where they're supposed to go. Thanks.</em> </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1619785;,Dale_Latimer

I tried simply moving the inbox folder back to where it should be but it will not move. I checked the inbox folder properties and the path is directing it to trash. I tried editing that path to delete the /trash element but I can not change that path.   mailbox:///home/barbara/.thunderbird/jzlrnnn0.default-release/Mail/<a href=""http://pop.gmail-2.com/Trash.sbd/Inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail-2.com/Trash.sbd/Inbox</a> See also screen shot attached I checked the mozilla/thunderbird help pages for any info about this problem and found nothing specifically addressing moving a folder from trash back to its rightful place. How do I fix this and get my inbox back to where it should be. As a sub-question, what happened and why, and how to stop that ever happening again? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",barbara_hodgkinson

Now that all my recipients addresses go into the one field, as soon as there are more than 2-3 addresses the To: (or CC or BCC) box expands downwards, pushing everything else down. I often write to up to 20 people at once, and the box becomes huge, the subject line is at the bottom of the screen, and there is only a small space showing where the message can be written. </p><p>In previous versions, a long list of recipients scrolled up and down, and therefore kept a static size, and everything else stayed in their places. </p><p>How can I stop the To: box becoming enormous? </p><p>Using a mailmerge addon is not an option. I do use groups of addresses (in the address book) for some things, but not always, and it is not appropriate for many emails. My preference would be to find some hidden option that allows the box to scroll on 1-2 lines. </p><p>I can use chromecss, if the code is provided for me to copy (I don't understand the syntax in general to write my own). I did have a working file going when I upgraded, so it may have something in it that is causing problems, but I am not savvy enough to find it. </p><p>I have looked quite thoroughly, and can't find anyone else who has mentioned this as a problem.
