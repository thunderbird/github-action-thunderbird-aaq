More recently, I have learned to use Juno's POP and SMTP servers, however in recent years some issue developed between Juno and Mozilla/Thunderbird, wherein TB will not place a message sent through Juno in the Sent or Drafts folder (as applicable) on the Juno server(s), forcing TB to use separate local folders instead. For incoming mail, I use server <a href=""http://pop.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.juno.com</a> on port 995 with SSL/TLS security and encrypted-password authentication. For outgoing mail, I use server <a href=""http://smtp.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.juno.com</a> on port 465. Every time I send mail, the following messages appear: <em>There is not enough disk space to download new messages. Try deleting old mail, emptying the Trash folder, and compacting your mail folders, and then try again.</em> which is inaccurate, given I have a considerable-sized hard drive (500 GB), plus multiple USB drives with much more space... then comes: <em>Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. </em> You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent-bob.in.jersey@juno.com.<em> </em> with the choice of buttons Retry, Save, or Don't Save. <em>Please do something about this, or tell me what I need to do to ensure that the messages go to where they're supposed to go.
