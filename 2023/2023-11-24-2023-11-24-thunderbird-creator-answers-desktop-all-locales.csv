More recently, I have learned to use Juno's POP and SMTP servers, however in recent years some issue developed between Juno and Mozilla/Thunderbird, wherein TB will not place a message sent through Juno in the Sent or Drafts folder (as applicable) on the Juno server(s), forcing TB to use separate local folders instead. For incoming mail, I use server <a href=""http://pop.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.juno.com</a> on port 995 with SSL/TLS security and encrypted-password authentication. For outgoing mail, I use server <a href=""http://smtp.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.juno.com</a> on port 465. Every time I send mail, the following messages appear: <em>There is not enough disk space to download new messages. Try deleting old mail, emptying the Trash folder, and compacting your mail folders, and then try again.</em> which is inaccurate, given I have a considerable-sized hard drive (500 GB), plus multiple USB drives with much more space... then comes: <em>Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. </em> You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent-bob.in.jersey@juno.com.<em> </em> with the choice of buttons Retry, Save, or Don't Save. <em>Please do something about this, or tell me what I need to do to ensure that the messages go to where they're supposed to go.

Since upgrade several weeks ago, my Thunderbird became slower, and, also started to work not as before. Now it is, after few minor updates up today, 115.5.0 (32-bit) version. The main issue, beside slower speed in showing messages, is it does not mark some messages as read when selected. When I scroll selecting unread messages to read/show them, some of them are marked read as before it did, but some of them stay unmarked in spite of multiple times selecting them and holding them selected. This happens regardless of setting “Automatically mark message as read” options Immediately on display, or After displaying for 1 second. In most cases it happens with last received unread message. Last time I remember such erratic behavior was decades ago. I tried to switch off  and back on that option, then restarting program, but nothing changes in it’s behavior. Please advise.
