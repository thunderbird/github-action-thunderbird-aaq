More recently, I have learned to use Juno's POP and SMTP servers, however in recent years some issue developed between Juno and Mozilla/Thunderbird, wherein TB will not place a message sent through Juno in the Sent or Drafts folder (as applicable) on the Juno server(s), forcing TB to use separate local folders instead. For incoming mail, I use server <a href=""http://pop.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.juno.com</a> on port 995 with SSL/TLS security and encrypted-password authentication. For outgoing mail, I use server <a href=""http://smtp.juno.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.juno.com</a> on port 465. Every time I send mail, the following messages appear: <em>There is not enough disk space to download new messages. Try deleting old mail, emptying the Trash folder, and compacting your mail folders, and then try again.</em> which is inaccurate, given I have a considerable-sized hard drive (500 GB), plus multiple USB drives with much more space... then comes: <em>Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent) due to network or file access errors. </em> You can retry or save the message locally to Local Folders/Sent-bob.in.jersey@juno.com.<em> </em> with the choice of buttons Retry, Save, or Don't Save. <em>Please do something about this, or tell me what I need to do to ensure that the messages go to where they're supposed to go. Thanks.</em> </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1619785;,Dale_Latimer

I tried simply moving the inbox folder back to where it should be but it will not move. I checked the inbox folder properties and the path is directing it to trash. I tried editing that path to delete the /trash element but I can not change that path.   mailbox:///home/barbara/.thunderbird/jzlrnnn0.default-release/Mail/<a href=""http://pop.gmail-2.com/Trash.sbd/Inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail-2.com/Trash.sbd/Inbox</a> See also screen shot attached I checked the mozilla/thunderbird help pages for any info about this problem and found nothing specifically addressing moving a folder from trash back to its rightful place. How do I fix this and get my inbox back to where it should be. As a sub-question, what happened and why, and how to stop that ever happening again? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",barbara_hodgkinson
