Is there any setting to turn this off?  I find this most annoying and it seems to be something my phone does too, so I guess it's come from that, as people are getting lazy and instead of typing the full stop at the end of a sentence, they simply tap the space bar twice and it adds the full stop for them.  However, I don't like it on my phone, and I don't want this action in Thunderbird.  I want my text exactly as I type it, not how someone else things I want it.  Yes, I'm old fashioned and want my English exactly as I was taught, not this latest 'text' speak short hand stuff.  So is there a setting somewhere, where I can turn this feature off.

The main issue, beside slower speed in showing messages, is it does not mark some messages as read when selected. When I scroll selecting unread messages to read/show them, some of them are marked read as before it did, but some of them stay unmarked in spite of multiple times selecting them and holding them selected. This happens regardless of setting “Automatically mark message as read” options Immediately on display, or After displaying for 1 second. In most cases it happens with last received unread message. Last time I remember such erratic behavior was decades ago. I tried to switch off  and back on that option, then restarting program, but nothing changes in it’s behavior. Please advise.

I have a relatively fast (deskside) system, lots of memory/disc, GB ethernet, and would like all graphics to be processed when the email is first downloaded instead of waiting.

In the prior TB versions, I only saw the last 3 or 4 messages in the upper message list portion of the classic view layout. Now I'm seeing almost 10 messages in my messages list. Meanwhile, the actual current message viewing pane is now horizontally compressed so that the ratio of message list to message view is closer to 40% message list, 60% actual message text plus the header info. I have tried click and drag the upper border of the current message being viewed, towards the top of the screen, but it stops, and still shows me 10 most recent messages in my list, which is really useless. I only need to see the last 3 or 4. The rest of the viewing pane should be more of the text area of the current message being viewed. Is there a ""config editor"" tweak to reduce the messages list to 3 or 4 messages, and increase the actual current message viewing area?
