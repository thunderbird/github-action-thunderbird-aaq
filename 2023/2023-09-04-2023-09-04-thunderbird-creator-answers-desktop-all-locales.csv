If I then remove and re-add the addressbook the contact is lost.  </p><p>When I used Zoho previously, this worked using CardBook (I haven't used this recently) - before carddav was added natively to Thunderbird. </p><p>I can access Zoho's addressbook via DAVx5 which synchronizes and works as expected. </p><p>Any thoughts on how to make this work? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Alan </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",alan116

A Windows rep recently made me reset my computer, and I should have known that would break things. I had two email archives on Thunderbird: I switched to a new email server and had an IMAP account since April, but before that, all of my emails were POP3 and stored locally on my computer and then deleted off the server. I had 9 years of emails archived on my computer and loaded into a folder on Thunderbird. When I re-dowloaded Thunderbird, it no longer shows my old emails, only the new IMAP ones. I found the old profile on Windows.old, but it refuses to import no matter what I do. When I try importing the full old profile, it just says unexpected error. When I try importing just folders within the old profile, they come through blank.  </p><p>Please help.

This has been working for some time. </p><p>I just installed Thunderbird on a second PC, and used published instructions on copying my profile to the new system.  Most of this worked, the account was set up, local folders were copied, etc.  For some unknown reason my account information did not actually connect, even though everything in Account Settings looked exactly like my first system: so I deleted the account and set it up again and everything is working EXCEPT the filters.  Both PCs are running versions of Windows 7, I'm running the same version of Thunderbird, and I set up the account by entering my <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> address and password and took the defaults. </p><p>I have looked at instructions for moving filters from one system to another, which involves moving the msgFilterRules.dat file, but I see a problem that nobody else appears to have reported.  Even though my first system has 44 filters defined, they are &gt;&gt;&gt; NOT &lt;&lt;&lt; stored in the msgFilterRules.dat file, which only has the 'version=""9"" logging=""no""' header.  I have looked everywhere, in every file I can find in my profile and in the full config page, and I can not find any of my filters defined anywhere.  But when I pull down ""Tools"", ""Message Filters"" they definitively exist and work. </p><p>There is one surprising difference between the two PCs. </p><p>In the first one, the server setting is for POP. I was also connected to <a href=""http://copper.net"" rel=""nofollow"">copper.net</a> for a while which might account for this, or it might have been my choice: I did this some time ago.  It's working just fine, but there is no Imap folder within my folder, which is where other articles say the filters are stored. </p><p>The newer installation uses Imap, and there are msgFilterRules.dat files in the Imap folder and in the local folders folder, but they don't contain any filters because I haven't manually defined any there. </p><p>So my question appears to be: if you're using POP instead of IMAP, <em> WHERE are the filters stored?  As I said, I very definitely have filters in Thunderbird in my first system which uses POP, but they are not where any article says they should be, and I can't find any article here or anywhere else that says how to copy message filters in this configuration.</em> </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1601764;1601835;1601942;1601999;,bartzlederman
