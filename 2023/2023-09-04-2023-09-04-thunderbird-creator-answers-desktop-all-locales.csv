The same emails are affected every time, though I cannot identify any characteristics in common they have that may cause this. I have a linux PC with an identical configuration and it does not suffer from this issue, so I suspect it is MacOS-specific. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",robots

In this example the attendee list is so large I cannot even resize it to see the description. There needs to be a way to scroll the event window as a whole when the content doesn't all fit, or alternatively a way of collapsing the attendee list. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",thoma4sl

How can I do that? </p><p>It makes sense to me to have that. When I'm sifting through my messages, I'm doing so by keyboard. Sifting through messages involves deleting some messages, and archiving others. It makes sense to have both delete and archive accessible by keyboard. Currently I have to switch between keyboard and mouse, which is unneccesarily tedious. Breaks my flow and whatall. </p><p>NB: this is literally the only thing I like about Outlook, the fact that the archive function is accessible by the Backspace key. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",thany

This has been working for some time. </p><p>I just installed Thunderbird on a second PC, and used published instructions on copying my profile to the new system.  Most of this worked, the account was set up, local folders were copied, etc.  For some unknown reason my account information did not actually connect, even though everything in Account Settings looked exactly like my first system: so I deleted the account and set it up again and everything is working EXCEPT the filters.  Both PCs are running versions of Windows 7, I'm running the same version of Thunderbird, and I set up the account by entering my <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> address and password and took the defaults. </p><p>I have looked at instructions for moving filters from one system to another, which involves moving the msgFilterRules.dat file, but I see a problem that nobody else appears to have reported.  Even though my first system has 44 filters defined, they are &gt;&gt;&gt; NOT &lt;&lt;&lt; stored in the msgFilterRules.dat file, which only has the 'version=""9"" logging=""no""' header.  I have looked everywhere, in every file I can find in my profile and in the full config page, and I can not find any of my filters defined anywhere.  But when I pull down ""Tools"", ""Message Filters"" they definitively exist and work. </p><p>There is one surprising difference between the two PCs. </p><p>In the first one, the server setting is for POP. I was also connected to <a href=""http://copper.net"" rel=""nofollow"">copper.net</a> for a while which might account for this, or it might have been my choice: I did this some time ago.  It's working just fine, but there is no Imap folder within my folder, which is where other articles say the filters are stored. </p><p>The newer installation uses Imap, and there are msgFilterRules.dat files in the Imap folder and in the local folders folder, but they don't contain any filters because I haven't manually defined any there. </p><p>So my question appears to be: if you're using POP instead of IMAP, <em> WHERE are the filters stored?  As I said, I very definitely have filters in Thunderbird in my first system which uses POP, but they are not where any article says they should be, and I can't find any article here or anywhere else that says how to copy message filters in this configuration.</em> </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",bartzlederman

When I opened the supernova application on my windows 10 desktop, I could not see folders, nor address book, nor inbox messages for any of my 5 emails that TB manages.  It was an empty page with menu and taskbar only. </p><p>I actually was able to pull my old profile while under 102.15 from a cloud backup of idrive.  I uninstalled supernova, saved and then deleted my thunder profile from ""app data"" (that supernova created),  reinstalled 102.15, let it populate a new profile, copied the items IN my old profile (102.15) that was from idrive and pasted them in the new .default-release folder.  Its running again.  BUT..... I am now afraid what will happen when I HAVE TO update to supernova....what wouldn't my 102.15 profile just transfer over to 115 supernova????? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1601643;,angellea

However I noticed the saved passwords in TB were not correct. The email addressed work fine, so would seem I have the correct passwords. But the dates its shows updated is wrong and password is wrong. This is a GMAIL and Gmail will not allow a wrong password. </p><p>So something in TB is off.  So recap: Email works fine.  Saved passwords are not correct. Brings up a whole thing of how is it checking email with wrong passwords saved. </p><p>This has been and issue for awhile was hopeful a update would fix the bug. And yes, the PC has been restarted and cache removed.  But the old passwords remain. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1601686;,douglascounty
