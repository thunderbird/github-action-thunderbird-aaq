When I opened the supernova application on my windows 10 desktop, I could not see folders, nor address book, nor inbox messages for any of my 5 emails that TB manages.  It was an empty page with menu and taskbar only. </p><p>I actually was able to pull my old profile while under 102.15 from a cloud backup of idrive.  I uninstalled supernova, saved and then deleted my thunder profile from ""app data"" (that supernova created),  reinstalled 102.15, let it populate a new profile, copied the items IN my old profile (102.15) that was from idrive and pasted them in the new .default-release folder.  Its running again.  BUT..... I am now afraid what will happen when I HAVE TO update to supernova....what wouldn't my 102.15 profile just transfer over to 115 supernova????? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1601643;,angellea

However I noticed the saved passwords in TB were not correct. The email addressed work fine, so would seem I have the correct passwords. But the dates its shows updated is wrong and password is wrong. This is a GMAIL and Gmail will not allow a wrong password. </p><p>So something in TB is off.  So recap: Email works fine.  Saved passwords are not correct. Brings up a whole thing of how is it checking email with wrong passwords saved. </p><p>This has been and issue for awhile was hopeful a update would fix the bug. And yes, the PC has been restarted and cache removed.  But the old passwords remain. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",douglascounty
