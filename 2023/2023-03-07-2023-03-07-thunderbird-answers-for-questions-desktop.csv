You have selected to open the entire group - not a single email. This is by design and has been like this for eons. It is not a fault nor a bug. It's a function to facilate opening a group of threaded emails. </p><p>You would need to 'expand' the thread by clicking on the <strong>&gt;</strong> chevron so it displays all the various conversation threads contains therein. Then you can click on them individually, you are then opening only the one you selected. </p><p>If you do not want the emails to be threaded and shown as a group then you need to change the settings: </p> <ul><li> 'View' &gt; 'Sort by' &gt; select 'unthreaded' </li></ul> <p>If you use 'unthreaded' but you want to see that particular email conversation as a group then you can always choose the following: </p> <ul><li> Right click on email and select 'Open Message in Conversation' </li></ul> <p>This will open in a tab, showing all the received and sent emails for that conversation in one search style tab. </p><p>Hope this information is useful and helps you make informed choices. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,2,0
