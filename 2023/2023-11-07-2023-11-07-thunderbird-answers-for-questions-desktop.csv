I use add-on ImportExportTools NG in Thunderbird. This add-on can create e-mails in EML format, which I want as a backup of all e-mails located in different local folders. As it is now, I can only mark one folder at a time. It's always been super easy as I hold down Ctrl and just start selecting the number of folders I wanted. It takes a very long time to backup this way as it is now. Before Thunderbird was updated, there were no problems and has worked fine for many years. There are several people who write about it, see <strong>jason141</strong> who has also written posts for you. Really hope this feature comes back. Hope I have explained it well enough.

We get a lot of digital invoices from our suppliers by mail (envelop mail + pdf attachment) every day.  To maintain some kind of transparency we sort all these emails in different subfolders (named after suppliers) within the accounting departments mailaccout. As german tax legislation forces us to archive these documents (envelop mail and pdf) to an unchangeable media the easiest way to fullfill this requirement is the export of all these subfolders with the Thunderbird add-on ImportExportTools NG to html-format with the whole structure index and attachments to a filesystem share and burn them on a read only CD periodically. Before version 115 with multible folder selection the export from Thunderbird was a matter of a handful clicks and several seconds.  Now this is a job of at least an hour or more because you have to export every subfolder one by one. The risk of errors or forgetting a subfolder is also increased a lot.

And please understand that I rolled back this far because I didn't need (yet) any of the Supernova features. From other threads, I gather that some of the Supernova builds have kept the multiple folder marking intact. The link in sfhowes post above suggests it began with build 111. </p><p>To disable automatic updates, go to  the Tools tab in Thunderbird and click on Settings. (Not Account Settings.) Make sure you're on the General section and scroll down to the Updates option. Switch it from Automatic to ""Check for updates, but let me choose whether to install them."" You'll be notified about new builds but can decline them with a click. </p><p>Then go to the Thunderbird releases page for 102.15.1 at this location: </p><p><a href=""https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.15.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/102.15.1/</a> </p><p>Click on your operating system, then on your language and download the .exe file.  </p><p>Run the .exe file and follow the install prompts. This will overwrite your current build but will keep all your settings and data (mail). </p><p>I have never had a problem with installing over an old build, either manually or through automatic updates. But if you are worried about losing anything and you don't already have a back-up strategy, you can back up data and settings like this: </p><p>In Thunderbird, go to the Help tab and click on More Troubleshooting Information and scroll down to the section called Profile Folder. To the right should be a button labelled Open Folder. This is the fastest way to get to your profile folder. Back out to the parent folder (which should be called Thunderbird.) The name of the profile folder you just left will be a mishmash of letters followed by the extension "".default"". Copy that to a safe place. I suggest the root directory of your boot drive, especially if that is an SSD. This folder can be particularly large (several GB) if you have a lot of stored mail and haven't cleaned up for a while. Copying to an SSD won't take long. </p><p>If everything looks fine with your rollback, delete the copy you made. If you need to restore everything, just drag this copy back into the Thunderbird folder you got it from (in the restored build) and overwrite the one that's there. Again, I have never lost data or settings by just installing over another Thunderbird, but this is an option if you're paranoid about data loss.  </p><p>If you decide to try another build beside 102.15.1, got to the master Thunderbird releases page and follow the instructions above with the build you choose: </p><p><a href=""https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/</a> </p><p>Again, I invite any member with more skills than me to vet my advice.
