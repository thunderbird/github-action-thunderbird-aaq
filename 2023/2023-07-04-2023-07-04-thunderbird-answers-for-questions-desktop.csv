Con respecto a los archivos borrados cuando los encuentras con una aplicación de recuperación debes recuperar los archivos en el momento porque al borrar un archivo este ""se marca"" como borrado permitiendo que su espacio pueda ser utilizado por otros archivos,  por lo tanto solo esta un tiempo limitado marcado como borrado, cuanto mas uses la PC mas probable que el archivo se pierda definitivamente. También es recomendable utilizar cuentas IMAP ya que permite que los correos sean almacenados en el servidor y ademas hacer frecuentes respaldo de las carpetas de perfil del TB.

If Send is not there, right-click just beside any buttons that DO show up, and choose Customize. That will open a panel with a bunch of icons in it. Look around until you find Send, then click on it, hold your mouse button down, and drag that Send icon to the line of other buttons already there. A ""No Entry"" icon will show up as you drag the Send icon, and when you get to a place where it can be dropped, that red signal will disappear, and you can drop the Send icon at that point. </p><p>Please come back and tell us whether you succeeded at this. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,1

Look for a ""Sign In"" or ""Login"" option on their website and click on it. On the sign-in page, look for a ""Forgot Password,"" ""Reset Password,"" or similar option. Click on it. You might be asked to provide your email address or username associated with the account. Enter the required information. Depending on your email provider, you'll receive password reset instructions via an alternative email address, a mobile phone number, or you might be prompted to answer security questions. Follow the instructions provided by your email provider to reset your password. Once you've reset your password, open Thunderbird and update the password for your email account in Thunderbird's account settings. To do this, go to ""Tools"" (or ""Options"") &gt; ""Account Settings"" &gt; select your email account &gt; update the password field. Save the changes, and Thunderbird should now use your new password to access your email account. </p><p>Regards, TG </p>",techguy150,false,0,0

Far from creating a new Profiles directory, Thunderbird instead threw an error: ""Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible"" with an OK button (see attached screenshot). Clicking that caused the message to go away.

Here are some troubleshooting steps to try: </p><p>Check for a hidden window: Sometimes, Thunderbird may open but be positioned off-screen or minimized. Look for Thunderbird in the taskbar or system tray, right-click on it, and select ""Maximize"" or ""Restore"" to bring the window back into view. </p><p>Restart Thunderbird: Close Thunderbird completely and then relaunch it. Sometimes, a temporary glitch can cause the window to appear empty, and restarting the application can resolve the issue. </p><p>Disable hardware acceleration: Thunderbird uses hardware acceleration to enhance its performance, but it can sometimes cause display issues. To disable hardware acceleration, go to ""Tools"" (or ""Options"") &gt; ""Options"" &gt; ""Advanced"" &gt; ""General"" &gt; ""Config Editor."" Search for the preference ""gfx.direct2d.disabled"" and set it to ""true."" Restart Thunderbird and check if the window appears correctly. </p><p>Clear Thunderbird profile cache: The Thunderbird profile cache can sometimes become corrupted and cause display problems. To clear the cache, close Thunderbird completely, press ""Win + R"" to open the Run dialog, type ""%appdata%"" (without quotes), and press Enter. Locate the Thunderbird folder, open it, and find the ""Profiles"" folder. Rename the ""Profiles"" folder to ""Profiles.old"" to create a backup. Then, relaunch Thunderbird, and it will create a new profile. Check if the window is no longer empty. </p>",techguy150,false,0,0
