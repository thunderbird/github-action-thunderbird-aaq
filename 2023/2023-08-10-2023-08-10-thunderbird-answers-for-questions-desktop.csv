Spectrum is about as customer-friendly as nearly all the large corporate outfits these days, which means mind-numbing conversations with ""Bob"" in Bangalore, whose name actually is Ajish and whose English is not idiomatic, whose ""tech support"" abilities are exceedingly limited, and with whom it takes forever to make virtually no progress. </p><p>Temporarily, I'm using my Gmail account, run through Thunderbird, to send emails and adding ""reply-to"" to the messages, with my primary email address listed there, the one that suddenly stopped sending using the <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> server. </p><p>As an aside, I don't like Spectrum much at all, but I wound up liking AT&amp;T even less when I was using it, finally having reached my limit.
