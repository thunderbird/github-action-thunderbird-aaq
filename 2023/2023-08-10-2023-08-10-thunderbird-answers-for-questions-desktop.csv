That might be a way to avoid having to do a changeover like a 10-alarm fire, all in a heated rush. </p><p>One thing: Maybe it is clear on the gmail webmail settings, but does a sender know about the reroute, or does he/she think it is still the way it always was, and when someone receives an email sent this way, does it still have the original email address showing? </p>",Arvidd,false,0,1

My first suggestion is to  - review each SMTP server name description to ensure each has a different name  - then, go through each account pane to verify that each uses its own SMTP server. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
