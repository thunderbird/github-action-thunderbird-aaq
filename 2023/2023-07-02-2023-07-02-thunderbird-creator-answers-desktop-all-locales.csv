So, I've decided to use Thunderbird again after years of stop using it. I download the installer, install it, run it, and try to login to my Google account. But, I get an error (refer the image attached). I'm sure I already enable IMAP in my Gmail settings, and very sure that I enter the correct password. </p><p>Also, I already Google this problem. Some of the solutions offered was to change the Authentication Method to be OAuth2. When I check, by default, OAuth2 is selected as the Authentication Method. </p><p>How can I fix this? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1588186;,ikmal.workspace

At my office, I've had TB on for over a decade after I moved from another email client. I can keep emails that are literally, 10 years old. But, at home, my emails are automatically deleted after about 30, sometimes less if I get a lot of emails. I've played with every setting in TB and with no success.  I really need my emails to stay on TB for at least a year. Am I doing something wrong, or is it a email server issue. I have Charter (Spectrum) on all my computers. </p><p>Thanks, Dave </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1588208;1588218;1588223;1588261;1588279;,dwilson49

Moving Thunderbird data to new computer failed!,"<p>Migrating my Thunderbird emails from my source computer to a destination computer failed. Both are Windows machines. Here's what I did: 1.

On my destination computer, I installed TB version 102.12.0. I launched the TB application and then closed it. This created the profile folder AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\2uvjpn58.default on my destination computer. (It also created \q971efhp.default-release there too.) 3. I then copied the contents of my backed up profile folder a1kie4bp.default into the new profile folder 2uvjpn58.default.
