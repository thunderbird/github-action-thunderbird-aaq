Since my original post, I located the Activity Manager, and it shows what appears to be what I would describe as a ""lock up"" (don't know exactly what to call it).  It shows a line for ""Indexing messages"".  The green ""thermometer"" bar is all the way to the right, and underneath it says ""indexing 201 of 407 messages in Sent (49% complete)"".  It seems to be stuck there.  There is other stuff below that related to my AOL account, but the tasks seem to be completed.  The Thunderbird app on my laptop is having the same email issue and shows a similar message.  When I was reading through some of the online solutions yesterday, I recall something about an email ""clogging"" up the system.  I will check the other settings as suggested in the link you provided, but before I go changing something and screwing things up more, is there anything to this ""indexing messages"" situation and might it be related? </p>",hasmort,false,0,0

If stability is paramount for you, then staying with 102 for now may work best, but if you want to enjoy the new system (which I encourage), then you should consider the upgrade. I encourage a full profile backup so, if you are dissatisfied, you can reinstall 102. If you are nervous on upgrading, then I suggest you try the portable version at <a href=""https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable</a>, which can be used in parallel with your 102 version (but you would need to copy the profile to the portable version after installation). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

But if you're uneasy about it, the best way to do this is to go to the link below and click the Download link(s) and install Thunderbird 115 to a different folder (not the same one as your 102 files are in). Then you can set up and try 115 to your heart's content, and if you are happy with it, you can uninstall 102 without affecting your 115 installation. If you're not happy, you can uninstall 115, and 102 will still be there waiting for you. </p><p><a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/07/our-fastest-most-beautiful-release-ever-thunderbird-115-supernova-is-here/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/07/our-fastest-most-beautiful-release-ever-thunderbird-115-supernova-is-here/</a> </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

A double-click will give you a message window that's the full size of your Thunderbird window. I think you might have to open View &gt; Layout and uncheck Message window first. I use Vertical layout; no message window, Cards view of the message list, and my messages open full-window in a new tab with an X on the top right for when I'm finished with that message, or I can just click the Inbox tab and the message list will appear, without closing the previous message.
