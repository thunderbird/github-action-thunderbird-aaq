But if you're uneasy about it, the best way to do this is to go to the link below and click the Download link(s) and install Thunderbird 115 to a different folder (not the same one as your 102 files are in). Then you can set up and try 115 to your heart's content, and if you are happy with it, you can uninstall 102 without affecting your 115 installation. If you're not happy, you can uninstall 115, and 102 will still be there waiting for you. </p><p><a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/07/our-fastest-most-beautiful-release-ever-thunderbird-115-supernova-is-here/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/07/our-fastest-most-beautiful-release-ever-thunderbird-115-supernova-is-here/</a> </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

A double-click will give you a message window that's the full size of your Thunderbird window. I think you might have to open View &gt; Layout and uncheck Message window first. I use Vertical layout; no message window, Cards view of the message list, and my messages open full-window in a new tab with an X on the top right for when I'm finished with that message, or I can just click the Inbox tab and the message list will appear, without closing the previous message. Works beautifully. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0
