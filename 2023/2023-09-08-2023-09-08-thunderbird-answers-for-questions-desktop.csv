There is the ""Server Settings"" Menu but this only deals with the IMAP Settings (Incoming). The SMTP Settings (Outgoing) are under the ""Account Settings"" menu at the end of that page.  IMHO it should be listed on the ""Server Settings"" Menu. There is also a ""Manage Identity"" button in the ""Account Settings"" which also has the SMTP Server Settings.

Then you can set up and try 115 to your heart's content, and if you are happy with it, you can uninstall 102 without affecting your 115 installation.

If stability is paramount for you, then staying with 102 for now may work best, but if you want to enjoy the new system (which I encourage), then you should consider the upgrade. I encourage a full profile backup so, if you are dissatisfied, you can reinstall 102.

Az ""Új üzenet"" mellett nincs 3 pont és nem is tudom úgy testreszabni, hogy megjelenjen, a ""letöltés"" jobb egérre meg csak a ""testreszabás"" jelenik meg. Mellékeltem képernyőképet. Mi a véleményed? </p><p>Előre is köszönöm. </p><p>Üdv: Honti György </p>",honti,false,0,0

Alapértelmezés szerint ahhoz hasonlóan néz ki a Thunderbird, ahogy a mellékelt képen szerepel, a bal felső sarokban lévő gombokról beszélek. Ha nálad nem található a bal oldalon található ablaktábla, akkor a <em>Nézet -&gt; Elrendezés -&gt; Mappa ablaktábla</em> lehet kikapcsolva, ha ezután sem látszanak azok a gombok, akkor a <em>Nézet -&gt; Mappák -&gt; Mappa ablaktábla fejléce</em> beállítást kell visszakapcsolni. </p><p>Ha ezek egyike sem segít, akkor pedig szedd már nekem össze, hogy pontosan mi van be- és kikapcsolva a <em>Nézet</em> menüpont <em>Eszköztárak</em>, <em>Elrendezés</em> és <em>Mappák</em> almenüjeiben. </p><p>Üdv, Balázs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0
