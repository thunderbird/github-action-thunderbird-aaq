I've tried that a number of times today and in the past but it does not bring back the choice banner and there seems to be no way to do that.  sometimes the remote content may be from other associated domains and so whitelisting the email source does not solve the problem.  It is very puzzling and annoying that there is no way to change one's mind after clicking the wrong choice by mistake. </p>,allendick,false,0,0

It's probably easier to just delete all entries from Exceptions and force the Options banner to appear for all new messages.  Short of trying to figure out which domains to block or unblock, I don't know of any other way to reset. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
