Just be aware that the developers and the paid employees tend not to appear here at all.  You get peers in a peer support forum.  Certainly not paid developers. </p><p>There is a feedback link on the Thunderbird help menu,  along with the link to this forum. </p> <blockquote> - multiple folders can't be selected in the same time </blockquote> <p>Why would you want to select multiple folders at the same time?  I honestly can not think of a single reason to select more than one folder at a time.  Given drag and drop and most functions ignored any folder after the first anyway and yet others simply messed up I am rather glad multiple selections are missing.  Folk thought the folder pane should work like windows file explorer,  and it never did. </p> <blockquote> - Customized icon function also has been removed </blockquote> <p>Customized icon how? Application?  Folder?  I do not recall being able to modify folder icons ever.  But please expand on this so I can understand. </p> <blockquote> - TB always makes folders' file corrupted, folders always must be repaired time to time </blockquote> <p>No idea what you are talking about.  I have had folder corruption maybe a dozen times in as many years and never since I got rid of Third party antivirus products and bought an SSD drive.  But it would underline your complaints about correspondents and threads as the rebuild/reindex process does not have regard to those personalizations. </p> <blockquote> - TB time to time gets stuck during email sending and when I restart TB it removes the email from the Draft so I lose my already written email </blockquote> <p>Stuck how.  Either the mail sends via the server or it reports an error is my experience over the past decade or so.  It does not just hang there like a lost child at a fair.  But as I said I don't have third party antivirus which appears to contribute quite a bit to that sort of issue. Bringing all sorts of issues, including self signed encryption certificates to the table that sometime simply prevent a stable connection.  You could log the issue to determine exactly what the delay is.  <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging</a> </p> <blockquote> - TB always turns on f*cking Threads view on all news folder but Thread view is disabled </blockquote> <p>Disabled how?  Did you follow the instructions here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#w_changing-default-threading-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#w_changing-default-threading-mode</a>  I find the threading, like the correspondents column  tend to reset if the actual default is not changed. Especially in folder repairs. </p> <blockquote> - TB always uses Correspondents column instead of ""From"", ""Recipient"" and ""Size"", I can't set a customized default view. </blockquote> <p>That is truly painful,  but it has been going on ever since they invented the correspondent column.  Periodically I will notice my inbox has no column for sender.  But it is hardly something that can be parked at the door of supernova.  The inability to resize the filters dialog.  That appear to be a supernova issue. </p><p>My understanding is using the <a href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=config+editor"" class=""new"" title=""Page does not exist."" rel=""nofollow"">config editor</a> to set mailnews.ui.upgrade.correspondents set to false. will prevent the insertion of the column the first time you select the folder.  But that was 8 years ago,  so it might not work that way now. <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1152706#c40"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1152706#c40</a>  But it does reinforce my point that the issue is not new. </p> <blockquote> - I always have to restart the TB after a few days because it becomes very slow </blockquote> <p>Have you undertaken any investigation of the issue? See <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems</a>  The discussion is memory problems,  but it sounds like that is what you are talking about as slowing down is almost always related to memory.  Fundamentally the diagnostic steps are mostly the same whatever issue you are trying to diagnose,  outside of the logging steps. </p> <blockquote> Since Supernova has been released we almost each day got calls from our clients and complain about TB why it is getting more useless day by day. So it is a sad story but true.  Thanks, Zsolt </blockquote> <p>Actually blanket it sucks stories have little or no interest to me.  I am always looking for specifics and I know when filing a bug developers live on facts and steps to reproduce.
