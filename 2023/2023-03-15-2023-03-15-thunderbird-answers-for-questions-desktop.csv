Sería una función complementaria a los filtros: </p><p>1. - El filtro automático aplica las etiquetas al mail atendiendo a los parámetros de filtrado. 2. - A mayores, añado etiquetas de manera manual para afinar el etiquetado. 3.- Cuando llega un mail nuevo a esa conversación, el filtro automático añade sus etiquetas, pero yo tengo que volver a añadir las etiquetas manuales. </p><p>Si se pudiese copiar las etiquetas de un mail previo de la misma conversación (etiquetado ya automática y manualmente), y pegarlas en el nuevo mail, se ahorraría muchísimo tiempo a la hora de clasificar el correo. </p><p>Espero haberme explicado con claridad. </p><p>Muchas gracias de antemano. </p>",morube,false,0,0

Instead of showing my regular mail folders, I got the same old ""Set Up Your Existing Email Address"" screen.  This time it accepted my E-mail address, asked for a couple of passwords, and then immediately downloaded the 600 messages that have been collecting in my POP Inbox from the two weeks when I have been unable to use Thunderbird.  These messages were placed in a new Inbox folder, and none of my previous mail folders are visible.  I had an elaborate system of filters with those folders that allowed me to manage the volume of the E-mail that I receive. </p><p>My C: drive is a new disk with data that was from a backup a couple of months ago.  It works exactly I would expect, with the exception of these Thunderbird problems.  My Thunderbird user data was recovered with no apparent errors from the hard drive that failed a couple of weeks ago.  Browsing those files with File Explorer, everything looks fine, but I won't know for sure if any data was lost until I can open them in Thunderbird.  Could there be an error in the user data that would cause Thunderbird to ignore ALL of the folders and data it contains?  I suppose that it is also conceivable that I could have made some unintended change to the Thunderbird program itself in my many attempts to get the Profiles.ini file to work properly.  </p><p>I hope someone can help.

By following the steps to create a new email address, you created a new profile. My suggested steps let Thunderbird manage the profiles.ini, which was the safer route. Having profiles on other than C drive is a common occurrence. If you follow the steps and are still prompted for an email address, I would look to see if the addressbook is there. That would indicate the old profile is active, but that the accounts are corrupt. If your current profile is working, you could copy addressbook, if needed, from old profile. Once your profile stable, and if you want it on drive D, you have two choices:  1. Move just the accounts (which are the primary user of disk space) to drive d   OR  2. Move the entire profile to drive D.   Both accomplish to goal of reducing disk usage on C. </p><p>Let me know which approach you want, if any, and I'll respond. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It's also advised to use fonts that are more likely to be installed on other computers as not everyone has the same fonts installed and that can also vary between OS. </p><p>In Settings &gt; Composition &gt; HTML Style It is recommended you use Font Size&nbsp;: Medium </p><p>so anything which is Medium on your view will also be a Medium on the recipients computer.

The increase or decrease would go up/down a level based on that option.
