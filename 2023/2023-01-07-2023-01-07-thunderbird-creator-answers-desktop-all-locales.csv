I have three email acounts with Thunderbird. Recently, I cannot accurately remember the details, I have been unable to send from my default email. It receives mail and the other two accounts send and receive normally. The failed send prompts an error message about SMTP password. I usually use Mozilla prompted passwords but recently manually changed passwords in my BT account whilst trying to resolve the issue. Mail sent from within the MyBT webpage is delivered properly. The settings information for SMTP merely states the password as ""the normal password"" and I have no idea what it is using. I tried the approach suggested by one respondent of creating a duplicate default address and re-entering the password manually but this was not allowed by the system. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing Thunderbird in the hope that it would update to the correct password but without success. I don't want to delete my default adress for fear of ending up with loss of information. Is there a way of finding what password SMTP is accessing and changing it? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1558154;1558159;,NorJean
