I want to move all my e-mails, address files, account settings, etc. to my new W/10 PC.  I clicked on the Tools/Export tab.  The next screen mentions if the Profile file is bigger than 2Gb to make a backup manually. There is also a spot to Open the Profile Folder.  I did that .... there are many folders, then many files. I clicked on the line that says ""export documentation - support forum"" It opened in FIREFOX. Now, it suggests that I look for a file with a name similar to: ""abc12def ......"". There is NO such folder or file name in the long list. I have many hundreds of stored e-mails, a fairly large address list, and 4 separate Gmail e-mail accounts. How do I get this info onto a thumb drive to bring to the W/10 PC? Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1579766;1579893;1579968;,KARL_TAUSCHEN

I click the text color icon which opens the Text Color box.  The last-picked color is always there and saved.

I also notice that on the Color Box that shows Basic colors on the left and the multicolor square on the right, that the Add to Custom Colors box is functional (but as I said above only saves for that session), but the Define Custom Colors box is greyed out. </p><p>I am wondering if this is a bug or something wrong with my installation.

For many Events, but not all, it is just <strong>impossible to directly duplicate them</strong>.
