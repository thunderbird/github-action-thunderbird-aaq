Do those emails even make it into the server-side Inbox? I would first took into your server-side setup. Those emails could be getting intercepted (as suspicious) and placed in a special server-side folder awaiting your review before they end up in the Inbox, while they don't outright end up in the Junk folder. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

Then I need to access some other shared mailboxes, that I did configure in TB as shared@domain.com username, changing the validating login in Oauth2 authentication. I need to tell to O365 that I'm me@doman.com and I want to access the mailbox shared@domain.com. I'm delegate to do this in remote server, of course, and I need to perform this kind of process that is ok.

I'm surprised it even worked before, because the OAuth2 sign in pop up should be specific to an account that's been setup in Thunderbird. It should not allow changing accounts on the fly in the middle of the OAuth2 authentication process, thus bypassing the underlying account for which Thunderbird initiated the OAuth2 sign in process. I expect you to have setup your me@domain.com account in Thunderbird, <strong>separate</strong> from the shared@domain.com account, so that each account exists and authenticates separately in Thunderbird. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

You can manually create and rename folders, or you can set up an archiving folder structure that creates the folders for you. See <a href=""/en-US/kb/archived-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">Archived Messages</a> for details. </p><p>(2) From the little reading that I have done, I've learnt that Eudora uses the same mbox format for its boxes, which is the same format that Thunderbird also uses, but Eudora's implementation of that format is slightly different and not the standard mbox format. This means you cannot simply point Thunderbird to the Eudora boxes. However, there are options for importing those boxes to Thunderbird, which is what I highly recommend you do. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-thunderbird#w_importing-from-outlook-and-eudora"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-thunderbird#w_importing-from-outlook-and-eudora</a> for details. </p><p>(3) Import the csv into Thunderbird, re-map the fields if need be, and see how it goes. </p><p>(4) It is possible to tweak font sizes. Get past the 3 issues above and we can look into customizing Thunderbird. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

If you have thousands of messages, don't copy all of them at once. There is a general consensus to not select more than 2000 messages for copying at a time, to prevent Thunderbird from freezing/hanging when trying to process too many messages. I don't know if this is still a problem with the latest release v115 because I haven't had to do this in a long while. Copy them in smaller batches until all messages have been copied over and none is left in the original location.  </p><p><strong>Option 2: Use a Global Inbox</strong> Thunderbird offers the option to configure POP accounts to deliver messages into one Inbox folder. For example, you can change your account's settings so that it delivers messages into the Local Folders Inbox instead of its own Inbox folder. The messages that already exist in the Local Folders Inbox will not be affected in any way.
