That said, I believe the 111,000 emails in Gmails trash are what are showing up as such number in TB's ""All Mail"" category, as the 3000 remaining in my current In Box would not take 12 GB (apparently is listed as 1.9GB); and there are no messages in my TB Trash. Do you concur that if I empty my Gmail server's trash of the 111,000 messages, I will likely gain back some 10GB or so? </p><p>Many thanks again for your consideration, </p><p>Tony </p>",ajgarcia2,false,0,0

You can manually create and rename folders, or you can set up an archiving folder structure that creates the folders for you. See <a href=""/en-US/kb/archived-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">Archived Messages</a> for details. </p><p>(2) From the little reading that I have done, I've learnt that Eudora uses the same mbox format for its boxes, which is the same format that Thunderbird also uses, but Eudora's implementation of that format is slightly different and not the standard mbox format. This means you cannot simply point Thunderbird to the Eudora boxes. However, there are options for importing those boxes to Thunderbird, which is what I highly recommend you do. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-thunderbird#w_importing-from-outlook-and-eudora"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-thunderbird#w_importing-from-outlook-and-eudora</a> for details. </p><p>(3) Import the csv into Thunderbird, re-map the fields if need be, and see how it goes. </p><p>(4) It is possible to tweak font sizes.

If you have thousands of messages, don't copy all of them at once. There is a general consensus to not select more than 2000 messages for copying at a time, to prevent Thunderbird from freezing/hanging when trying to process too many messages. I don't know if this is still a problem with the latest release v115 because I haven't had to do this in a long while. Copy them in smaller batches until all messages have been copied over and none is left in the original location.  </p><p><strong>Option 2: Use a Global Inbox</strong> Thunderbird offers the option to configure POP accounts to deliver messages into one Inbox folder. For example, you can change your account's settings so that it delivers messages into the Local Folders Inbox instead of its own Inbox folder. The messages that already exist in the Local Folders Inbox will not be affected in any way.
