I tried a few easy things and decided to really go through ESET virus program with a magnifying glass. </p><p>I believe my problem is two fold: (1) ESET exclusions for Thunderbird were set to Thunderbird v90 but Thunderbird v102 upgrade installed folders in different locations, so the exclusions set to the original v90 folder were ineffective, and (2) one of the ESET upgrades did not retain the previously set v90 exclusions, so there were no Thunderbird exclusions at all. </p><p>I reassigned ESET exclusions to the v102 Thunderbird folders and also in ESET disabled both IMAP Protocol Checking and IMAPS Checking. That made a big improvement in Thunderbird. I can send/receive email now. </p><p>However, in Thunderbird, if I pull down TOOLS &gt; activity manager, and clear the list, there is still an ""Indexing Messages"" thermometer stuck at full with a message ""determining which messages to index."" If I turn Thunderbird off and back on, I'll have some activity in the activity manager and the indexing thermometer will stay at full. I thought when I open Thunderbird and it brings current all the IMAP sends/receives/deletes/moves, etc. there should be no thermometer and no message in the activity manager dialog box. That thermometer is stuck at full and never goes away. But like I say, I can at least send/receive now. </p><p>Should I rebuild the index, and if so is that computer specific or will it affect all 3 of my IMAP devices? I'd rather not mess with it if it's going to alter all 3 devices.
