Today I finally left while TB was supposedly running and working on saving an email message to the local sent folder.   It had already informed me it wasn't able to connect or do whatever it needed to do to save the email to the host or whatever it's called, I was using a gmail address.     I was away form the machine for well over an hour and when I move the cursor over the list of folders in TB, that circle that shows it's ""working"" still circling.    There is STILL no copy of the email in the sent folder.   My internet connection is functioning, I opened up task manager the last time this happened (a week or so ago) and while a fair amount of the CPU was being used, it wasn't overloaded because no other tasks were taking up more then a very small amount of the CPU. </p><p>I haven't changed anything recently.  Not updated TB, not changed anything else.   It's a sporadic problem, sometimes I can send 20 emails &amp; this issue doesn't recur.  I would it to not happen anymore--I am particularly unhappy about this email as it was a work email and I need to have a copy of it. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1560813;1560827;1560842;,azure7
