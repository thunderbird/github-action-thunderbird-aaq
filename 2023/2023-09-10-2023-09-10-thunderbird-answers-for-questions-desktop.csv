If I goto another folder and go back to that folder it does not remember the state of any groups on whether they've been collapsed or not. Whenever you go back to a grouped by sort folder, it ignores whether you've collapsed everything and loads the folder with everything expanded. I've also tried collapsing all  with ""\"", the closing and reopening Thunderbird. It again proceeds to auto expand all of the groups. Hope this bug will get fixed soon, as I may have to just stick with 102.15.0 for the foreseeable future until it is fixed.  </p><p>Well at least I can run 2 versions at the same time for now. </p>",murixbob,false,0,0
