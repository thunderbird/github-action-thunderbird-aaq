The 'import from a file' works with profiles, but only if zipped. If you exported the profile itself, then you should use the tools&gt;import&gt;import from another Thunderbird installation. A screenshot of what you backed up may help clarify what you are wanting to import. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
