Where is it?&nbsp;:) </p><p>Two screenshots attached: One shows my current Thunderbird title bar, second shows how native title bars on my system look. </p><p>In particular: - I would like to the buttons from the symbol bar below the title bar (I need to be able to drag the window at arbitrary points in the title bar) - I would like to have an application icon on the very left of the title bar that allows me to close the window on double click. - I would like to have my additional title bar buttons (see attached screenshot) - I would like Thunderbird to respect the font choices for the titlebars of my desktop enviroment  </p><p>Thunderbird really is the only application on my computer that does not support these three things. I get that the new toolbar looks nice on Gnome, but on KDE, it is the odd one out... </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",daniel-r.schmidt

The same 2 emails kept downloading repeatedly. I googled the issue and removed the popstate.dat from the profile in question. 1 of each have downloaded since. 2. I got the new MBA on 8.8.23 and migrated the same settings (via icloud) from my old MacBook Pro. I have checked, the Thunderbird settings appear to be the same in both MacBooks. The second issue is that no emails downloaded since, although the bottom notification said 'Downloading 3 of 49' then almost immediately 'No messages to download'. NB. Just checked T'bird again: deleted the 2 emails, quit TB, deleted popstate.dat &gt; notification, reopened TB &gt; 'Downloading 3 of 53', those 2 emails came back &gt; 'No messages to download' Any help appreciated.
