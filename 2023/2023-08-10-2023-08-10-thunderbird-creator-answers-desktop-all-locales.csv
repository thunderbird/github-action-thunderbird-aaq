Only having a problem with my Hotmail account inbox. I'm unable to see any messages in the inbox. The messages are there, but they don't show. If I click an area in the inbox, the message displays. The other folders in this account display. Only having a problem with the inbox. Hope this makes sense to someone that can help me me able to see inbox messages. I tried a PC restart, but that was no help. Compacted that folder too. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",illroute66

Suddenly I could not access it except via webmail. Is this a problem with Thunderbird or Telstra please?   It is so frustrating trying to speak to someone to sort out these issues but maybe you can advise me who to call if this is not in your domain.  Thanks, Graham </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",graham.kruck
