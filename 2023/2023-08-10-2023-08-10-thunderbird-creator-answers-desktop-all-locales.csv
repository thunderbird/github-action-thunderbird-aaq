Suddenly I could not access it except via webmail. Is this a problem with Thunderbird or Telstra please?   It is so frustrating trying to speak to someone to sort out these issues but maybe you can advise me who to call if this is not in your domain.  Thanks, Graham </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",graham.kruck
