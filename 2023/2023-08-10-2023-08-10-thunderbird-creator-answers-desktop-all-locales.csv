After a couple years of messing around with Eudora replacements, I've decided to give TB another try.  I've also been working with the Betterbird people a little (in case that matters). </p><p>I have thousands of emails still on my Eudora system, categorized by folders (2010 outbox, 2011 outbox...2022 outbox, 2022 inbox etc) and know where each of the mbx files are located. </p><p>In reading about converting, i've seen two suggestions: </p><p>1.) Use the IMPORTEXPORT add on - I tried this.  It did not convert the emails into anything usable.  It also looks like all attachments have been left behind.  The emails ARE readable however...but not much more than that. </p><p>2.) Use an earlier version of TB to convert the old Eudora files - I had tried this a couple years ago.  Using V15, I was able to convert many of the old files into usable TB files.  But there are a few thousand that were NOT converted. </p><p>Here are my questions:  </p><p>1.) <strong>using an earlier version of TB</strong> - how do i do this now, since I already have TB running?  The instructions on how to do that are not clear.  Can i load up the V15 version (again) while my current version is still running.  It seems like this is a recipe for confusion. </p><p>2.) <strong>Is there any 3rd party software that makes this easier?</strong> -  I've seen Corbell and one other software system advertised.  I'm more interested in getting this done quickly than spending $50.  This problem is holding up my final coversion from my present system (mailbird). </p><p>Thanks in advance for any insight on how to accomplish this. </p><p>Dean Calvert </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1596726;,dmcalvert

We have no direct internet connection at all. We use a Microsoft Exchange mail server to handle inbound and outbound emails. </p><p>When our user got a new computer last week and first signed in to Thunderbird, her folder structure was correct, but something went wrong because her inbox and sent folders were completely empty.  She would get a notification whenever someone sent her an email, but when she clicked on it, it would just show her an empty Thunderbird inbox (she should have thousands of messages). </p><p>I, and others, have verified her email server settings are correct and the same as on other systems not experiencing this issue. </p><p>Her calendar events, contacts, and email certificates are all where they should be. It's just her messages that are missing. </p><p>Now here's where it gets weirder. Having created a backup of her original Thunderbird profiles directory and profiles.ini file, I exited Thunderbird and removed those profile files/folder from her  ""C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird"" directory. Upon restarting Thunderbird, it asked for her to log in. She used the address and username I verified were in the Exchange server, and upon signing in,  her mail client synced all her messages correctly. However, as expected, her calendar and certificate info was still missing since those don't come from the Exchange server. So, when I close Thunderbird and put  her original profiles back into the AppData\Roaming directory (adding, not replacing the new ones since that also doesn't work) and start Thunderbird, we're back at square one where she's got certificates, calendar events, and addresses, but no emails in the inbox or sent folders. </p><p>Has anyone seen this before? </p><p>P.S.: Sorry there are no photos. I can't post screenshots from any of our computers. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mp956

The other folders in this account display. Only having a problem with the inbox. Hope this makes sense to someone that can help me me able to see inbox messages.
