In the setup, I have a single address to be blocked, lets name it address1. I am having trouble adding additional addresses, address2, to my Blocked list.  In the instructions, ""you can add the person's address into the top of the filter by clicking on + button"". Here is where I am having trouble, the exact steps to do that. I am interpreting the ""you can add..."" instruction to mean:  open the new unwanted email, highlight and right click.  The only filtering option is ""Create Filter Form"".  Clicking on it opens the ""Filter Rules"".  The targeted address, Address2, is in the first line of the ""Match..."" section, the ""Filter name"" is blank. At this point, if I input my ""Blocked"" in the ""Block list"" line, it responds ""The filter name already exists..."".  If I click on a + as the instructions indicate, it just adds address2 into the second line, duplicating the first line.  If I just click OK it creates another block list under the name of the targeted address, address2. Could you clarify what the procedure is to add addresses to a block list? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1601704;1602136;1602282;,jpfreem
