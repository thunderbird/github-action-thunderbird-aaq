Please... how can this be fixed? Or can it? </p><p>Whenever I write an email (doesn't matter if I'm replying to someone else's email, or starting a New Message), whenever I hit the ENTER key, TB leaves a DOUBLE SPACE between the lines. </p><p>So instead of looking like this (as every other program that has typing does): </p><p>Line 1 &lt;Hit Enter&gt; Line 2 &lt;Hit Enter&gt; Line 3 &lt;Hit Enter&gt; </p><p>It looks like this: </p><p>Line 1 &lt;Hit Enter&gt; </p><p>Line 2 &lt;Hit Enter&gt; </p><p>Line 3 &lt;Hit Enter&gt; </p><p>If I'm typing a long letter and DON'T hit ENTER, it'll do a word-wrap and continue the next line down, but if I hit ENTER, instead of going to the NEXT line, it'll go TWO lines down (leaving a blank line in between). Which makes it look terrible anytime I want to start a new line. </p> <h6 id=""w_"">=====</h6> <p>On All OTHER programs (including this webpage as I'm typing this!) if &lt;ENTER&gt; I hit the ENTER key then &lt;ENTER&gt; it looks like this. </p> <h6 id=""w__2"">=====</h6> <p>But when writing an email on TB it looks like this: </p> <h6 id=""w__3"">=====</h6> <p>On All OTHER programs (including this webpage here as I'm typing this!) if &lt;ENTER&gt; </p><p>I hit the ENTER key then &lt;ENTER&gt; </p><p>it looks like this. </p> <h6 id=""w__4"">======</h6> <p>Is there a way to make TB just go down to the next line (like every other program I've ever used does) when hitting &lt;ENTER&gt; instead of always going down TWO lines? </p><p>Please help if you can. It's about my only complaint with TB, but it's a major one. My composed emails look terrible like this with TB.
