They really miss the bit about the server being considered the canonical reference, so if the server has a 14 day retention policy,  that is how long the mail remains in the account.  Regardless of Thunderbird settings. </p><p>The image you posted does not give much in the way of information as to your account in question being IMAP or POP.  But you would have had to make some significant changes to Thunderbird defaults for a POP mail account to actually delete a message from the local store without your input based on account setting (I am not even aware of any such settings),  so I am assuming your archive folders are included in an IMAP mail account.  In which case the retention policy of the mail server will rule for all email retention, regardless of any setting you may have in Thunderbird. </p><p>So I think you need to revisit the whole ""archive"" thing because I think you have modified the visual appearance of the store and changed nothing in practical terms about retention. </p><p>Placing the archive location in Local Folders will remove the messages from the account and place them in local storage and remove the dependency on the mail being retained on the server.

The retention policy of the server doesn't factor in - I have ""leave messages on server"" UN-checked, so they are deleted when downloaded and persist on my local machine until deleted manually or automatically per the (Thunderbird/folder) retention policy.
