They really miss the bit about the server being considered the canonical reference, so if the server has a 14 day retention policy,  that is how long the mail remains in the account.  Regardless of Thunderbird settings. </p><p>The image you posted does not give much in the way of information as to your account in question being IMAP or POP.  But you would have had to make some significant changes to Thunderbird defaults for a POP mail account to actually delete a message from the local store without your input based on account setting (I am not even aware of any such settings),  so I am assuming your archive folders are included in an IMAP mail account.  In which case the retention policy of the mail server will rule for all email retention, regardless of any setting you may have in Thunderbird. </p><p>So I think you need to revisit the whole ""archive"" thing because I think you have modified the visual appearance of the store and changed nothing in practical terms about retention. </p><p>Placing the archive location in Local Folders will remove the messages from the account and place them in local storage and remove the dependency on the mail being retained on the server.  It does however restrict the data to your local machine and it is up to you to transfer it to your next machine. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The retention policy of the server doesn't factor in - I have ""leave messages on server"" UN-checked, so they are deleted when downloaded and persist on my local machine until deleted manually or automatically per the (Thunderbird/folder) retention policy.

Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have 105 in Windows 10.  The first instruction says to press the icon up at the top .... the 3 horiz. bars. I did that.  A box opens, I clicked on View.  In this box, there are 3 options: Toolbars, Layouts &amp; Folders.  Clicking on each major header in order, when the new box opens, there is not one item that refers to Threading or Unthreading.  By the way, in the Folders box, the 'Classic View is checked. </li></ol> <p>I tried to follow your directions, but it got too confusing, and I couldn't find some of the items that you indicated. I did not bother to run the video, since I knew beforehand that I would get even more confused. What I don't understand is why MOZILLA feels the need to change a user's settings such as this, when new updates are sent out.  This makes no sense to me whatsoever.  In the Release notes, it seems to me that an item should be included in the list that now a user has the option of doing 'this or that'. Then a person can make a decision to stay the course or to try the new item. Unfortunately this seems to be the frequent situation, and I've had to deal with the results all too often.  So, I don't know where to go from here, sorry to say. At any thank you for your continued attempts to help. robert herold </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0
