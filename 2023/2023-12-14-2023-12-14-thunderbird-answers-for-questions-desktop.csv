In the case of POP mail accounts the antivirus silently drops into a coma when it encounters a malformed email and you get the same one,  or even half a dozen emails that the server offers before it gets to the one that makes the A/V and the connection die.  Next time you get the same ones,  because the connection just died without completing the download of emails for the account and the cycle repeats ad nauseam. </p><p>The advice is usually given to delete the oldest email in the spam folder,  or if you delete your mail the oldest,  because folks for some reason do not react well to being told their antivirus is dodgy.

Not all IMAP servers are created equal and while there is a <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9051/"" rel=""nofollow"">standard</a>,  not all servers comply.   Unfortunately this is nowhere more apparent than in the reporting of used quota.  Some servers get the thing correct, others just get it a bit wrong,  some outright lie.  Unfortunately it can be the biggest players that get it the most wrong.  At this time I am not aware of any particular culprits,  but Google do report drive quota,  not your IMAP quota as to them it is the same thing,  space used on their servers. </p><p>From a user perspective though,  a few small mails do not compare to a life time of happy snaps synced in the same allocated cloud space quota. </p><p>Now unlike David, I do think move works,  but like so many things,  in works for relatively small numbers of mail (in the hundreds, not the thousands) and it does not work on folders.  You can not select a folder and move it. Part of the limitations are based in the IMAP protocol,  part of it comes from the speed of your internet connections and a big part comes to the updates being done in the background and silently failing, without any error reporting or restart options.  Sort of reminds me of downloading files from the internet about 1990 in Mosaic. </p><p>When you move a mail from an imap account to a local folders account. I use those terms carefully as accounts in Thunderbird can not begin to sync anything with another account,  only copy and move.  Under the hood the mail is deleted from the imap account when moved and added to the storage file in local folders.  This comes with the same caveats that I mentioned about moving generally.  Operate on a few hundred mails at a time, it is not a file system where you can copy thousands of file reliable and quickly.  IMAP is a text based command line hidden behind a graphical user interface and everything about it is clunky (because it is a text based exchange) and requires interpretation for the program to act on it.  It sure works better if there is not antivirus scanning email or encrypted connections,  but that is a story for another day. </p><p>Now we come to the next big thing.  Most folks have a Gmail account and what it does in relation to IMAP is make things up.  Gmail is a single huge database of mails with labels attached to them which Google offers to IMAP clients like Thunderbird as folders.  There are no folders at google, so even when you delete the message from all known folders, important, inbox etc that email will still be living in all mail and occupying space. (archived in Google terms) </p><p>So you delete it from there, and using Thunderbird's default setting of placing it in the deleted/trash folder it goes there,  and an IMAP sync adds the thing back to Google because well there is no longer a copy in all mail to add the tag to. (Shift delete bypasses the normal move to and just blows the mail away with no possibility of undo) </p><p>I hope this clears some of the issues,  but as I tend to ramble at times it might not. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have always tried to keep things simple for myself by NOT letting others ""sync"" my computerized files among devices.  My Gmail account is not accessed by Thunderbird - only my ISP provided e-mail account is accessed through Thunderbird from only one computer. So, what I am trying to do is find out how to get info from my ISP provider on what is in their IMAP files for this account.  My ISP provider is currently called ""Breezeline"", but was ""Atlantic Broad Band"" when I opened the account.  They are not easy to deal with, but do provide fast Internet service. It would be nice if Thunderbird would actually provide the information that I need, so as to have no ""loss in translation"" between the meanings of what is tabulated in one place by one  group being compared to what is being tabulated in another place by a different group. What  I need to see is how the IMAP storage total changes as I move, copy and delete files from various ""Inbox"" and ""Local folders"" locations on my computer screen. Part of my problem is that I do not want to start looking at the IMAP files from multiple devices with multiple e-mail accounts, because that gets me into some of the ""sync"" quagmire that you described.  So, I am trying to access the ISP account info through a browser from this computer. This is going to take me a while to really figure out.  I am proceeding carefully to avoid creating more new problems for myself than I am solving. IF I can't get the info I need through my ISP account, then I will be stuck with doing move/copy/delete tests with 40 MB test files, so I can see the effects in the warning of ""% used"" coming from Thunderbird (I think).  First, I will need to push the total back above 75% to see anything.  Then I will need to make &gt;1% changes in the total with single actions.  SO, the test files will need to be &gt; 1% of 3 GB = &gt;30MB.  I may do that with a large jpg of a complicated picture, or I may need a small group of such jpgs per e-mail.  (I noticed that one Christmas Card e-mail to me has used 24 MB of my IMAP space!) Any thoughts about how I can do my testing most efficiently would be appreciated.  What I really NEED to determine BY ACTUAL DEMONSTRATION is that I can get e-mails off the IMAP server while keeping them in local storage THAT IS STILL ACCESSIBLE TO THUNDERBIRD for searching, etc.  I am still thinking that is SUPPOSED to be possible with files in the ""Local Folders"", but am seeing conflicting info about how those files need to get to the local folders in order for them to (1) REALLY be removed from the IMAP server storage AND (2) NOT get ""synced"" out of my ""Local Folders"" by Thunderbird. Programs that are intended to ""make life simple for the user"" by making their processes opaque to their users instead really make life tough for their users when things don't go exactly as the developers imagined - which should be entirely expected by anybody with any experience in providing commercial software. </p>",steve.long4,false,0,0

Those should not have been touched by any software between backups, including TB (I avoided using any folder names with identifying metadata). These subset-of-examples (the majority of changed folders as similar in the application) are strictly local and not shared with IMAP or other SW. All archiving is done locally and manually. Only active mail is left on the server. For example: </p><p>""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\Mail\Local Folders\PEOPLE.sbd\_History"" ""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\Mail\Local Folders\PEOPLE.sbd\_History.msf"" ""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\Mail\Local Folders\PEOPLE.sbd\Inbox"" ""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\Mail\Local Folders\PEOPLE.sbd\Inbox.msf"" ""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\Mail\Local Folders\PERSONAL.sbd\Finance.sbd\Bank of America"" ""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\Mail\Local Folders\PERSONAL.sbd\Automotive.sbd\4runner"" </p><p>Sync'd folders/files also changed, but I can't be assured that they weren't touched by the mail server. These change frequently and constantly. There are less than 20 of these folders. Example: </p><p>""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\ImapMail\<a href=""http://hostxxxx.hostmonster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hostxxxx.hostmonster.com</a>\INBOX"" ""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\ImapMail\<a href=""http://hostxxxxx.hostmonster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hostxxxxx.hostmonster.com</a>\INBOX.msf"" ...Sent &amp; Temp &amp; Draft &amp; Spam &amp; Trash &amp; Archive.... </p><p>As a side thought: I'm used to various programs like music players leaving crumbs within files after opening them. But, I've never seen this done in TB before. I might convince myself that MS might do the same when indexing, but those indexes shouldn't be changing -- they never have before.  Similarly, I suppose BitDefender could be making changes when scrubbing the system. But, again, why?  In the end, the close time association between the prior TB version upgrade and the change in the timestamps of the files makes it look like TB might have been messing about.  Or, I picked up some malware about the same time. Or,&nbsp;??? </p>",jonathan67,false,0,0

Sorry.    </p><p>It is possible that 10's of folders, both sync'd and local-only, were due to adds/deletes/moves (or maybe even access to the contents thereof?). B U T, we are talking about many 100's of folders (well over 1000 files in the profile folder) the vast majority of which have not been touched by me nor should have been touched by any synchronization/archiving/optimization process in years (archived files).  </p><p>While I would not put it past MS Windows to do something like this, I would not expect MS Windows to do it only to the TB files. Similarly, I can't think why any software on my machine would target only those files (most don't even have access). </p><p>Regarding ""history"" files, let's make sure that your are referring to the ""Mail\Local Folders\PEOPLE.sbd\<strong>_History</strong>"" files I showed in the prior example list (probably a poor choice to put in the example list). That folder is my folder within my ""people"" folder and archives emails related to a human history project that has nothing to do with TB. I note that the last new email added to that folder was in July 2021 (see attachment; I note that the ""Local Folders"" directory shown in the attachment is not synchronized anywhere; it is 7.5 GB is size). There is no reason to believe any changes should have been made to it since then. </p><p>Regarding the prior, mentioned attachment, that simply shows the timestamps of the last changes on a variety of folders=files within the aforementioned directory. If we were to scan through that directory, we would see that all the 1000+ files in question were changed within seconds of each other, further indicating that this was not done by directly or indirectly by me. That would literally impossible for me to do. </p><p>So, the original question remains. Before I go though the painstaking process of restoring everything back to the state prior to the TB Version 115.5.1, <strong>how can I know if TB did some kind of housekeeping (indexing, metadata update, restructuring, whatever) that changed and increased the size of 1000+ files in the profile?</strong> </p>",jonathan67,false,0,0

Generally this does not affect folders that only grow, and compacting is about rewriting the files that have deleted massages stored in them.  But having said that I have never checked post compact if it is every file or just the new ones that have changed attributes (compact writes new files so they get new attributes and deletes the old) </p><p>The update to 115 will almost certainly have touched all the MSF files as the new UI will have seen additional information stored in them.  They are a MORK formatted file and one of the objectives of the development team is to remove all instances of MORK files from the code base.  As they are a self describing file format, adding stuff is almost always backward compatible.  It is removing stuff or changing it that causes issues.  The MBOX files,  I can see no reason for them to change size other than adds or deletes, the underlying mbox format has remained unchanged for decades.  Having said that I am aware that a lot of work is going on in the storage space to try and untangle 20+ years of patches and modification that have become so intertwined that change is often closely linked to regressions. </p><p>Fundamentally you will not get a concrete answer about what if anything Thunderbird actually did. Update logging is turned off by default, so you can not even check the logs.   Personally I really do not understand what you are talking about restoring files for.  All you will do is blow up your backup tool again if it was a result of the update, and it probably was.  All I can say is looking in the IMAP mail folders of my profile I have files and folders with years old file dates. </p><p>If you have backups as you say you do,  compare one file and see what has changed in it.
