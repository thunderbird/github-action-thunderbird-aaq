In the case of POP mail accounts the antivirus silently drops into a coma when it encounters a malformed email and you get the same one,  or even half a dozen emails that the server offers before it gets to the one that makes the A/V and the connection die.  Next time you get the same ones,  because the connection just died without completing the download of emails for the account and the cycle repeats ad nauseam. </p><p>The advice is usually given to delete the oldest email in the spam folder,  or if you delete your mail the oldest,  because folks for some reason do not react well to being told their antivirus is dodgy.  You can also disable the antivirus and just get the mail.  Either works as well as the other. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The reality is old versions are inherently less secure and Thunderbird profile per install makes going back quite difficult, it is not a simple or reliable process.
