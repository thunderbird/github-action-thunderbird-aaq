In the case of POP mail accounts the antivirus silently drops into a coma when it encounters a malformed email and you get the same one,  or even half a dozen emails that the server offers before it gets to the one that makes the A/V and the connection die.  Next time you get the same ones,  because the connection just died without completing the download of emails for the account and the cycle repeats ad nauseam. </p><p>The advice is usually given to delete the oldest email in the spam folder,  or if you delete your mail the oldest,  because folks for some reason do not react well to being told their antivirus is dodgy.  You can also disable the antivirus and just get the mail.  Either works as well as the other. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I found so many pages that describe how to make sure it stays unthreaded and tried all of them. But every now and then Thunderbird starts again with threaded. I cannot find a pattern: i can restart Thunderbird 100 times and most times it will restart unthreaded but every now and then it will decide to start threaded. I lost hope to solve this issue so i am now simply looking for an old version of Thunderbird that does NOT have the threaded feature. </p>,scaruffi,false,0,0

Not all IMAP servers are created equal and while there is a <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9051/"" rel=""nofollow"">standard</a>,  not all servers comply.   Unfortunately this is nowhere more apparent than in the reporting of used quota.  Some servers get the thing correct, others just get it a bit wrong,  some outright lie.  Unfortunately it can be the biggest players that get it the most wrong.  At this time I am not aware of any particular culprits,  but Google do report drive quota,  not your IMAP quota as to them it is the same thing,  space used on their servers. </p><p>From a user perspective though,  a few small mails do not compare to a life time of happy snaps synced in the same allocated cloud space quota. </p><p>Now unlike David, I do think move works,  but like so many things,  in works for relatively small numbers of mail (in the hundreds, not the thousands) and it does not work on folders.  You can not select a folder and move it. Part of the limitations are based in the IMAP protocol,  part of it comes from the speed of your internet connections and a big part comes to the updates being done in the background and silently failing, without any error reporting or restart options.  Sort of reminds me of downloading files from the internet about 1990 in Mosaic. </p><p>When you move a mail from an imap account to a local folders account. I use those terms carefully as accounts in Thunderbird can not begin to sync anything with another account,  only copy and move.  Under the hood the mail is deleted from the imap account when moved and added to the storage file in local folders.  This comes with the same caveats that I mentioned about moving generally.  Operate on a few hundred mails at a time, it is not a file system where you can copy thousands of file reliable and quickly.  IMAP is a text based command line hidden behind a graphical user interface and everything about it is clunky (because it is a text based exchange) and requires interpretation for the program to act on it.  It sure works better if there is not antivirus scanning email or encrypted connections,  but that is a story for another day. </p><p>Now we come to the next big thing.  Most folks have a Gmail account and what it does in relation to IMAP is make things up.  Gmail is a single huge database of mails with labels attached to them which Google offers to IMAP clients like Thunderbird as folders.  There are no folders at google, so even when you delete the message from all known folders, important, inbox etc that email will still be living in all mail and occupying space. (archived in Google terms) </p><p>So you delete it from there, and using Thunderbird's default setting of placing it in the deleted/trash folder it goes there,  and an IMAP sync adds the thing back to Google because well there is no longer a copy in all mail to add the tag to. (Shift delete bypasses the normal move to and just blows the mail away with no possibility of undo) </p><p>I hope this clears some of the issues,  but as I tend to ramble at times it might not. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Those should not have been touched by any software between backups, including TB (I avoided using any folder names with identifying metadata). These subset of examples (the majority of folders in the application) are strictly local and not shared with IMAP or other SW. All archiving is done locally and manually. Only active mail is left on the server.

These change frequently and constantly. There are less than 20 of these folders. Example: </p><p>""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\ImapMail\<a href=""http://host2142.hostmonster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">host2142.hostmonster.com</a>\INBOX"" ""C:\Users\***me***\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\b51any78.default-release\ImapMail\<a href=""http://host2142.hostmonster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">host2142.hostmonster.com</a>\INBOX.msf"" ...Sent &amp; Temp &amp; Draft &amp; Spam &amp; Trash &amp; Archive.... </p><pre>As a side note: I'm used to various programs like music players leaving crumbs within files after opening them. But, I've never seen this done in TB before. I might convince myself that MS might do the same when indexing, but those indexes shouldn't be changing -- they never have before. Similarly, I suppose BitDefender could be making changes when scrubbing the system. But, again, why? In the end, the close time association between the prior TB version upgrade and the change in the timestamps of the files makes it look like TB might have been messing about. Or, I picked up some malware about the same time. Or,&nbsp;??? </pre>",jonathan67,false,0,0
