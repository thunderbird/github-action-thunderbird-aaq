Installing the ""OPEN THUNDERBIRD""   add-on fixed the issue. </p><p>Ahh  systematic checking helps doesn't it? </p>",jimboyle,false,0,0

They tend to encode the attachments to email is a random binary file.  This works for mail clients that ignore the internet standards for the interchange of file data using mime encoding (Microsoft products mostly) but it does not work at all in standards compliant products. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
