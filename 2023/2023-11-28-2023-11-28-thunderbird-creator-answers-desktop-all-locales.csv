When I choose one to move to a separate folder to keep, the inbox contents flips to some point that I don't require, and I then have to scroll through to the point where I took the email I was storing again, often hard to determine. It is random , and if the email I want to shift is on the current day, it seems to behave, but when I choose to move one from a few days ago, it is hopeless. It is time consuming, and annoying, and I can't see the point of it. Why is this happening, and how can I fix it please? It usually flips back to a point earlier than the date I am working on. Weird, and has only done this since one of your last updates, and always stable in the past....For a new addition to the program it is so inefficient.
