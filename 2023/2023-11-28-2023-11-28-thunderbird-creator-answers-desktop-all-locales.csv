I'm using Thunderbird 115.5.0 (upgrading when it asks), on Windows 10 64-bit. I'm using gmail (<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>). To keep gmail and my profile inbox (on my system SSD) manageable in size, I've been moving a month of mail at a time to a local folder on a hard drive. Sometimes that fails, and sometimes it takes a while (like an hour) to move the month of mail (typically 5000 messages) from All Mail to the local folder (e.g. Local Folders / 2022 / November .)  Once they all look to be moved I've deleted that month's mail from All Mail and compacted it. Sometimes that takes a while (a couple of days.) Sometimes the move stops, and I start over. I wanted to reference an email from last year. (Black Friday offer from a particular vendor.) The local folder shows a lot of messages with no subject, correspondents is blank (dash) and the date is when I did the move. I found the messages I wanted with Filter. Some are good, some appear blank, or to have random pieces of other mail. When I looked at the mbox folder things were still corrupt. I moved 2 of the blank messages to a new subfolder. In an editor I could make out something, and Thunderbird still showed the original subject. I removed the .msf folder and that didn't help. I did Properties | Repair Folder and the mailbox became 0 size.  </p><p>As an experiment I copied a random message to the subfolder.
