I can see them in my email provider's webmail and they worked fine in Outlook but they aren't appearing in Thunderbird.  I have tried adding the sender's email to my address book and telling Thunderbird not to block messages if the sender is in my address book but that hasn't helped.  The two types that I have noticed are: i) messages from a <a href=""http://groups.io"" rel=""nofollow"">groups.io</a> mailing list that I'm a member of and ii) the daily digest from Nextdoor (a local social media website).  However, if I search for the subject or sender then the email can be found by the search in Thunderbird so it seems to be there but just not visible.

I'm using Thunderbird 115.5.0 (upgrading when it asks), on Windows 10 64-bit. I'm using gmail (<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>). To keep gmail and my profile inbox (on my system SSD) manageable in size, I've been moving a month of mail at a time to a local folder on a hard drive. Sometimes that fails, and sometimes it takes a while (like an hour) to move the month of mail (typically 5000 messages) from All Mail to the local folder (e.g. Local Folders / 2022 / November .)  Once they all look to be moved I've deleted that month's mail from All Mail and compacted it. Sometimes that takes a while (a couple of days.) Sometimes the move stops, and I start over. I wanted to reference an email from last year. (Black Friday offer from a particular vendor.) The local folder shows a lot of messages with no subject, correspondents is blank (dash) and the date is when I did the move. I found the messages I wanted with Filter. Some are good, some appear blank, or to have random pieces of other mail. When I looked at the mbox folder things were still corrupt. I moved 2 of the blank messages to a new subfolder. In an editor I could make out something, and Thunderbird still showed the original subject. I removed the .msf folder and that didn't help. I did Properties | Repair Folder and the mailbox became 0 size.  </p><p>As an experiment I copied a random message to the subfolder.
