It ended up inserting the new tag in the position of the deleted tag (ie. the new tag shows up in place 4, where the deleted tag was, don't know if that's relevant).  </p><p>The new tag does not work. Whenever I use that tag it shows up and then disappears. Any ideas how I can fix this? Would deleting all the tags and starting again help or make things worse? I've seen similar threads here but they've been archived so I'm starting a new one. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",ruthe1

When I choose one to move to a separate folder to keep, the inbox contents flips to some point that I don't require, and I then have to scroll through to the point where I took the email I was storing again, often hard to determine. It is random , and if the email I want to shift is on the current day, it seems to behave, but when I choose to move one from a few days ago, it is hopeless. It is time consuming, and annoying, and I can't see the point of it. Why is this happening, and how can I fix it please? It usually flips back to a point earlier than the date I am working on. Weird, and has only done this since one of your last updates, and always stable in the past....For a new addition to the program it is so inefficient. Thank you </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",Greencon

The backed up files are now back on my PC.  I looked at the support guide and can find the files on my new hard drive using the Profile folder in the troubleshooting information but I don't know how to get Thunderbird to use them. I now have Windows 11 if that matters. Thanks for your assistance. Kathy </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",kathylubbers1

E' stato un grande errore perchè non solo ho mancato il trasferimento, ma ho perso tutti i contenuti delle cartelle o forse sono finite da qualche parte e non riesco più a trovarle. Chiedo pertanto un grosso aiuto per ritrovarle visto che sono un grosso archivio dei miei lavori.Grazie </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,it,"",merlarati.elson
