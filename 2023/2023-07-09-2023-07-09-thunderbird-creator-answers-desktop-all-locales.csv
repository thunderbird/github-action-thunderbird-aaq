This is my first message, because I can't find a solution to a weird interface size problem with Thunderbird. </p><p>But let's begin&nbsp;: </p><p>I had a laptop with a 1600x900 screen resolution. On this laptop the screen scale in windows screen parameters was set to 100%. I also have a second screen connected via HDMI to the laptop with a 1920x1200 resolution.

On this one the screen scale in windows screen parameters is set to 250% so 99% of my apps (including firefox) show up with a correct font size. I installed thunderbird on the new laptop, and transfered my appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder from the old to the new laptop. All mail folders are here and sending or receiving mail work just fine as before. But on the new laptop's screen thunderbird appeared with very small fonts (not only the mail, the whole interface was ""shrinked"", as if thunderbird don't understand it has to rezise by 250% like said in windows parameters). After googling a little I found the ""layout.css.devPixels.PerPX"" parameter and modified the value from 1.2 to 2.6 So now on the laptop's screen with 3840x2160 pixels the size of the thunderbird interface is just OK. But when I open thunderbird on the second screen with 1920x1200 pixels the interface size is juste way too huge&nbsp;! </p><p>In comparison, with firefox, the interface adapts to each screen automatically, and the font size is OK on both screens. </p><p>I don't know what to do to have the same behaviour than with firefox, if somebody has an idea, I will be thankfull&nbsp;! </p><p>Best regards, Roland </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",rolmat

From what I've read so far, it's not possible to modify the ""path"" variable to work with additional arguments. </p><p>I've also edited the registry settings for ""BraveHTML\shell\open\command"" to include the same arguments. </p><p>Via the TB UI, http and https point to Brave (I've tried ""default"" and explicit).  Running MS Process Monitor, I can see TB open that registry key and then ignore it and just launch brave.exe with no arguments. </p><p>I also tried setting the target to a .bat file which has the desired command line.  Process Monitor shows TB opens that file.  Brave is launched but does not honor the command line arguments.

I have it working now, but one of the steps I took to get it to work was to edit the Thunderbird configuration. I changed security.tls.version.min from 3 to 1. I have changed it back to 3 now and my email account is continuing to work. TO me this suggests that security.tls.version.min is setting another variable somewhere that is not listed in the config. I am also confused why TLS would have a min version value of 3 by default. The latest version of TLS is 1.3 (at time of writing this). Is the tls.version.min also being used for SSL - which does in fact have a version 3.0? I just thought I should bring this to your attention because there seems to be a lot of talk in other forums about changing the tls.version.min to 1 to fix issues, and that doesn't work for all other issues and reducing the min version can create new issues - especially if my suspicion is correct, that it is also being used for SSL - ie security certificates. If this is the case, as a feature update, should SSL and TLS be given their own version config parameters in Thunderbird? Cheers, Ben </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1589683;,ben155
