This is my first message, because I can't find a solution to a weird interface size problem with Thunderbird. </p><p>But let's begin&nbsp;: </p><p>I had a laptop with a 1600x900 screen resolution. On this laptop the screen scale in windows screen parameters was set to 100%. I also have a second screen connected via HDMI to the laptop with a 1920x1200 resolution. No problem with this configuration and thunderbird, regardles on wich of both screens thunderbird was running. </p><p>I juste replaced my laptop, and the new one has a screen with 3840x2160 resolution. On this one the screen scale in windows screen parameters is set to 250% so 99% of my apps (including firefox) show up with a correct font size. I installed thunderbird on the new laptop, and transfered my appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder from the old to the new laptop. All mail folders are here and sending or receiving mail work just fine as before. But on the new laptop's screen thunderbird appeared with very small fonts (not only the mail, the whole interface was ""shrinked"", as if thunderbird don't understand it has to rezise by 250% like said in windows parameters). After googling a little I found the ""layout.css.devPixels.PerPX"" parameter and modified the value from 1.2 to 2.6 So now on the laptop's screen with 3840x2160 pixels the size of the thunderbird interface is just OK. But when I open thunderbird on the second screen with 1920x1200 pixels the interface size is juste way too huge&nbsp;! </p><p>In comparison, with firefox, the interface adapts to each screen automatically, and the font size is OK on both screens. </p><p>I don't know what to do to have the same behaviour than with firefox, if somebody has an idea, I will be thankfull&nbsp;! </p><p>Best regards, Roland </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rolmat
