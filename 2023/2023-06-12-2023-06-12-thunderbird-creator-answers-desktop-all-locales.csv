Il filtro spostava nella cartella X la posta con certi mittenti e/o oggetti (non ricordo). Volevo cancellare la cartella, l'ho fatto, ma ovviamente al successivo invio di posta la cartella si è ricreata. Ho cercato nei filtri, ho cancellato tutti i filtri associati alla posta che avevo deciso dovesse andare in X.  Al successivo invio di posta, la cartella si è ricreata; controllo il mittente e l'oggetto e non trovo alcun parte del filtro dove si ordina di ricreare la cartella X. La cartella tutt'oggi si ricrea. Vorrei eliminarla definitivamente senza che questa riappaia. </p><p>Controllo l'interfaccia del server nativo dell'indirizzo di posta elettronica che thunderbird gestisce. Non c'è traccia di filtri o impostazioni che possano essere responsabili della ricreazione della cartella. </p><p>Ricordo di aver già anche disinstallato thunderbird e reinstallato.

I found that one of the two ""APP"" names I had entered, so that AOL could create two associated passwords, for that email address had disappeared.  The password that I used for incoming mail (associated with <a href=""http://pop.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.verizon.net</a>) was present, and I could still receive email from that xxxx@verizon.net address with Thunderbird, Version 102.12.0 (32bit).  But the one that I used for outgoing mail (associated with <a href=""http://smpt.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smpt.verizon.net</a>) had disappeared from the AOL list.  I attempted to add the lost APP (and associated password, even if AOL created a new one), but AOL responded with a red message:  ""Sorry, this feature is not available right now!""  I searched AOL help messages and found no reference to this problem.  So, I decided to try using the one surviving APP (and its associated password that I had created for incoming mail) for outgoing mail also, and it worked!  The details follow. </p><p>To make this fix, no change was made in AOL, only in Thunderbird.  I opened Thunderbird and chose Tools/Settings/Privacy and Security/Passwords, and clicked on ""Saved Passwords"".  Under ""Provider"" I selected (highlighted) the outgoing (smpt) server, and hit ""Remove"" to remove just it (and its associated password), and then hit ""Close"".  Then I wrote a test message using this email address and attempted to send that message.  Thunderbird immediately requested a password.  I entered the one password that had survived in AOL, with the SAVE feature activated to assure that the password would be remembered by Thunderbird.  I then attempted to ""Send"" the message, and Thunderbird could not complete the send.  I closed Thunderbird and reopened it, and pressed ""Send"" again on the same message, and it was sent promptly.  From then on, both incoming and outgoing features of Thunderbird worked on this email address. </p><p>I assume that it was necessary to close and reopen Thunderbird to get Thunderbird to read the password change on reopening. </p><p>SPECULATION:  Just this one email address, out of several that I have, was affected by AOL's loss of my outgoing password for that email account.  Perhaps this occurred because AOL either has an error in its records, or it is upgrading the particular server which serves that particular one email address.  So it seems possible that other email addresses may soon be affected and that I may need to use this method again. </p><p>QUESTION:  If you know of any adverse effects from the change that I made above, please let me know. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Ron4
