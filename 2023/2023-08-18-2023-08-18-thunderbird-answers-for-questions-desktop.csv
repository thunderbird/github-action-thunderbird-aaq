They create folders in their web interface on the fly basing everything on labels on an individual email in the All Mail database, but those emails become several emails once they are turned into IMAP which has no concept of labels and a central mail database and labels.  </p><p>Note: As far as Google is concerned, unless you change setting on their web site.  Once all labels are removed from an email is remains in all mail as an archive.  That also means that the mail can not appear in the trash as that is just another label to Google. </p><p>Thunderbird defaults to moving deleted mail to the trash folder,  when you empty the trash then Google will remove the trash label, and through use of web based setting Google can be convinced to remove mail after it is deleted and expunged from the trash. </p><p>I do not know of a way to have say the important label removed if you choose to use that inbox system Google has.  Personally I just turned it off. </p><p>If you were to use a real IMAP implementation,  not a ""sort of"" implementation as Google has you would do better,  but that would require you to change mail providers to someone who has true IMAP,  like GMX.  The one offered by Micrisift is also not a true IMAP with other deficiencies other than those I discuss about Google. </p><p>Fundamentally email is a complex creature and how may expect it to work is far from the reality of what actually happens. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Apple products consume 100% of the available IMAP connection and offer no way to limit that.

Imap accounts synchronise all folders with server, so they can only display whatever is on the server - aka whatever you see when you logon to webmail account via a browser. So folders exist on server - you subscribe to see folders in the imap account, although by default certain folders do get auto subscribed. You can choose to download full copies or headers on a per folder basis. Please do not ever consider imap account folders as independent copy on your computer.  When you delete emails via webmail, they will disappear from the imap account and vis versa. Both imap and server/webmail folders and emails should be considered as one and the same. </p><p>Pop is entirely different - Pop can only access server Inbox and download to pop account.

Should have triggered an alarm, but i went ahead. Gave the parameters for setting up my Gmail address and ticked POP3 because i store a lot of mail in a batch of appropriate folders. That's why i use tbird; don't have to continually log in to Gmail. </p><p>The sad thing now is that i have lost all that information, an inbox with 3 messages is all i have left. All other folders gone, gone, gone. Years of carefully filed data that i shall never be able to recover, even though it exists in the Gmail profile online. </p><p>Just as an aside. My truth as it actually happened here where i am sitting. Reinstalling Windows was a bad idea. They automatically updated a BIOS file which affects bluetooth and some other audio stuff. I contacted them and ASUS, who informed me that the latest 411 version will not work on my old device and suggested reinstalling using their 408 version. But Microsoft will not allow me to do that. So now i have to execute a special installation app from 2015 to fix bluetooth, and here's the kicker, every time i switch on my computer. If it sleeps or otherwise Windows reverts to the 411 BIOS. Microsoft is yet to respond. So i am stuck. Probably have to buy a new computer. </p><p>And then i instal the latest Thunderbird and sit here trying to figure out what all the changes are about. </p><p>But thanks anyway to Toad-Hall; at least the window provides more reading room. </p><p><br> Matt's comments were decidedly rude, impolite and nothing like what one would expect in a forum like this. Sad business. I am not a tech expert as he is, so a little patience with an old man would have been comforting. There can only logically be one truth and i go with 'mine'. He was not sitting here in this chair when all this unfolded. </p>",johnc48,false,0,0

The developers have increased the minimum. If you want to alter it then you need to follow the instructions in my previous comment, which I went to some lengths to get for you. You have to create the userChrome.css file. </p><p>It is very easy to do because my instructions are step by step and I've helped loads of people of all ages and abilities to set up a 'userChrome.css' file, so I know it is very doable.
