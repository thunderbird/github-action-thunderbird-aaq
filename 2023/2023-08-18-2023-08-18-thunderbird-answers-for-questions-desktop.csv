My truth as it actually happened here where i am sitting. Reinstalling Windows was a bad idea. They automatically updated a BIOS file which affects bluetooth and some other audio stuff. I contacted them and ASUS, who informed me that the latest 411 version will not work on my old device and suggested reinstalling using their 408 version. But Microsoft will not allow me to do that. So now i have to execute a special installation app from 2015 to fix bluetooth, and here's the kicker, every time i switch on my computer. If it sleeps or otherwise Windows reverts to the 411 BIOS. Microsoft is yet to respond. So i am stuck.

The folders are not my own, but new ones from Tbird. Looks different in IMAP to POP3.</em> </p><p>This makes me think you are unsure of how an imap account works. Imap accounts synchronise all folders with server, so they can only display whatever is on the server - aka whatever you see when you logon to webmail account via a browser. So folders exist on server - you subscribe to see folders in the imap account, although by default certain folders do get auto subscribed. You can choose to download full copies or headers on a per folder basis. Please do not ever consider imap account folders as independent copy on your computer.  When you delete emails via webmail, they will disappear from the imap account and vis versa. Both imap and server/webmail folders and emails should be considered as one and the same. </p><p>Pop is entirely different - Pop can only access server Inbox and download to pop account. There is no synchronsing with server. The copy you have on your computer is completely independent of server. The folders you create in a Pop account are only on your computer. </p><p>Do you want to get the pop account back&nbsp;? Please note, you have removed the pop account, but it's likely the original files containing emails are still in the profile and this means you can create a new pop account and then point it to look at and use the old pop account folders.

That also means that the mail can not appear in the trash as that is just another label to Google. </p><p>Thunderbird defaults to moving deleted mail to the trash folder,  when you empty the trash then Google will remove the trash label, and through use of web based setting Google can be convinced to remove mail after it is deleted and expunged from the trash. </p><p>I do not know of a way to have say the important label removed if you choose to use that inbox system Google has.
