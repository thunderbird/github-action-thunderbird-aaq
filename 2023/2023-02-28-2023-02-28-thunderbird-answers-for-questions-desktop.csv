Also, the Mail Toolbar can be extensively customized on the production release. For example on my screenshot, you saw that I could delete, reply, forward or redirect without having even read the message. That is a small customization. My suggestion: install the standard version. It can run alongside the daily, if desired, or you can uninstall the daily if desired. Once you are using the standard release, check via view&gt;toolbars to be sure the Mail Toolbar is running, and right click on it and you can drag all the desired commands to it that you wish.
