If I open the e-mail I wrote in another e-mail reader or I turn off the quote colors extension the changes it made to the e-mail aren't kept! Even when setting the ""Use quote level colors"" in compose options. More specifically they behave exactly as if quote colors weren't involved at all. </p><p>In short, please disregard anything mentioning quote colors below, as it did not work. The signature was fixed by setting HTML colors. However I still have the issue with the quotes all turning green to fix.  </p><p>So in summary, now all I need is a way to change my writing color to green and a way to keep the quotes the same color as originally. I only manage to do one or the other, but never both at once. </p><p>I'll leave the unedited version below to document what I've said. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>END OF EDIT** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p><br> TL;DR Hello! Setting the default to green does work to turn my message green! However it turns many other things green too! So I tried to fix it with your earlier suggestion and with quote colors. However that did not work because the green messages from me in my reply turn to the color of quote colors instead of keeping their green. This doesn't happen If I manually change the color to something else than the default color from the settings. </p><p>When I set the default color to green in Thunderbird, it changes what I start typing from now on, all of my signatures and the quotes (from other e-mails I'm replying to) to the color green. Trying out your suggestion and asking Thunderbird to set my signature color to black manually before saving it seems to have worked! (Thanks!) However the quotes still turn green instead of keeping their original color. </p><p>I tried adding the extension and setting the color to black, however this still has issues. Notably If I write an e-mail and send it, it gets sent green (Good!), however when I reply to that e-mail every green part of that e-mail turns black. However if I reply my old outlook e-mails, they still come out green instead of black! </p><p>So the issue is that if I reply to myself or have myself in one of those quotes my color is forcefully changed to whatever quote colors asked instead of keeping the green if that message has been written in Thunderbird and set using the [Composition &gt; HTML Style] section. However if this message has been written in Outlook or if I manually change the color to something other than the standard color of the HTML Style then it is not overwritten to the black I set in quote colors. </p><p>This is just wild speculation, but maybe Thunderbird has a way to set a color as the ""Default color"" for the e-mail and that ""Default color"" can be overwritten similarly to the message in the signature before I manually put them black. What I want is for it to set the green color without that ""Default color"" flag automatically when I write the message. </p>",kael10,false,0,0

(That isn't green) Third, Notice that all of the quotes (from that e-mail and that e-mail) are now green as well.  </p><p>Yes, this turns my text to green as I want, but it also forces everything else to green, which I don't want! </p>",kael10,false,0,0

Probably,  but not certainly a print driver issue. </p><p>A point is generally thought to be 1/12"".  But what a pixel is, is not really defined.  From the perspective of CSS authors it is gerrally assumed to be some factor of 1⁄96.  The reality however is pixels are almost always scalled these days,  or stuff would be these little things in the corner of the screen.  So even though 12 pixels as  is described you would assume 12⁄96"" the reality of the rendering engine will be scaling that to some factor,  usually between 1 and 3 to actually fill the screen and this is where the problems arise.  Another scaling factor needs to be applied to fit the paper in the printer, based on the dots per inch resolution of the printer. In steps the printer driver.  Historically printers used either PCL or postscript languages to describe a page and these were fairly generic,  but also patented technologies.  Along came cheap inkjet printer.  You can't sell that for $20 if the PCL or PostScript vendor wants a $20 license for the use of their language,  so most of these cheap printers use something called GDI.  This works by trying to use the window graphic device interface to make each page into a graphic and pint it like you would a picture of the kids. </p><p>So all this to say printing a can of worms.  If it is funky,  it is almost always the printer driver being used in conjunction with the windows system screen resolution and video driver not playing well together. </p><p>There are some common things that do need checking;  </p> <ul><li> Check the printer is actually the correct one.  Thunderbird has a habit of hanging on to old printers and messing up which is your default. </li><li> Check the paper size is actually correctly set in the printer drive in Windows.  Historically only those in the USA get anything like the correct pape4r size by default as they are the only ones in the world to use letter sized paper.  But with most software being written in what used to be the third world, along with the device manufacture.  Some drives are now defaulting to the international standard A4.  So this always has to be checked. </li><li> The next thing is look at the fit to page settings in the preview.  There is usually a fit to page and a fit to page width option. Setting the fit to width is a very good choice of HTML. </li><li> Turn off hardware acceleration in the options of Thunderbird.  Remember the video driver is important in windows printing.  This setting really has no ""correct"" setting.  Personally I find most compatible is off,  but the developers disagree.  They also spend no time in support! </li></ul> <p>Make sure the printer drivers are the latest from the printer manufacturer and the same for video drivers.  Folk tend to leave that to windows update.  But the reality is most driver releases are never pushed out through windows update. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The first bar is being stretched 1px × 86.0361243349202 and it takes up 1¾ pages. The second bar is being stretched 1px × 215.00000000000003 and takes up 4¼ pages. </p><p>So maybe Thunderbird's print render is stretching the images proportionally in both axis instead of only by width as when displayed in reading mode. 20px × 86.0361243349202 is 1721px, maybe that equates to the 1¾ page print render. Similarly, 4300px is 4¼ pages? </p>",compass_drg,false,0,0

This script relies heavily on how folders look and behave. My folders used to have a different color when there are unread messages in it. But it's no longer the case.</em> </p><p>But your image clearly shows the <strong>Commands (1)</strong> folder and folder name is a different colour when it receives new mail. </p><p>Now you say&nbsp;: <em>The borders of the folder picture were made fatter when it contained at least one unread email.</em> This has never been the case, the folder icon has never got thicker outline, but the folder name text is fatter - it becomes bold. </p><p>You say: <em>The subfolder ""HODL"" and the subfolder ""Interac"" look identical, though one of them contains unread emails (4) and the other one does not.</em> </p><p><strong>By default:</strong> New mail in a folder since you last accessed folder in this session, will turn folder a blue colour. It will also display a gold/yellow star icon on the folder icon. The folder name font changes to blue text in Bold eg: <strong>Commands (1)</strong> If you selected that 'Commands' folder, the new unread email will also display a gold star at start of Subject. </p><p>Your image confirms that works as expected on the Commands folder. </p><p>If folder has unread mail, but not new mail this session or since you last accessed the folder. Folder icon will be the default colour or whatever colour you have set the folder to use. Folder name will be bold font, the text colour is Black indicating no new unread mail, only unread mail. This is shown in your image, I can see that the 'Hodl' folder name is using <strong>Bold</strong> text, so I instantly know it has unread mail and it has brackets with a number <strong>(4)</strong> which tells me how many unread emails are in that particular folder.  </p><p>The 'Interac' folder is not Blue, so no new unread mail. Folder name is not bold regardless of colour, so it has no unread mail. </p><p>All your folders appear to be easily understood as to what has new unread or old unread or no unread emails. Nothing appears to be amiss. </p><p><br> <strong>Running a test in Light mode</strong> </p><p>A folder with newly downloaded unread mail this session but not accessed since last download will be coloured Blue - it will display a small gold star on folder icon and it will have the folder name text coloured blue, it will also be bold and display number of unread mail.  </p><p>When you open that folder, the 'sort by read' column will display all unread mail with a green dot and any that are new that session will also have a gold star icon at the start of Subject.  This means you can instantly see what is previously downloaded mail and what is the newly downloaded mail this session since you last selected the folder. </p><p>As you select to open and read previously download unread mail, the number in the folder () brackets will decrease. If you select the new email with star icon, then the star icon on folder will disappear and the folder name itself will change from Blue to  Black and if there are still some unread messages, the font will remain bold. </p><p>If folder has no unread mail then the folder name font is not bold - it's normal font coloured black. There are no () brackets, indicting no unread mail. </p><p>All exactly the same as your image. </p><p><strong>However:</strong> The only issue which I am able to create is when I have new mail filtered to a particular folder. Folder font turns bold and I get brackets showing an unread mail, which is good. BUT, folder icon is not Blue, the folder name font is Black (not Blue as expected) and there is no gold star icon - not on folder and not in list of new mail. So, at this point I have no idea whether the unread mail is old or new. </p><p>Noticed the filter was performing 'filter after junk classification'. This particular quirk may not be intended and therefore a bug, so I'll report that in Bugzilla.  </p><p>FIX: edited filter - changed to 'filter <strong>before</strong> junk classification' and then all new mail is properly identified - folder turns blue, foldername is Blue and Bold and gold star visible on folder icon and on new mail. </p><p><strong>So if you are saying that you have a problem which is this:</strong> The 'Hodl' folder really does have a new unread mail auto filtered into that 'Hodl' folder since you last selected that folder. But it's is not turning Blue etc when it gets new mail, - it just looks like you have only old unread mail. </p><p>Please check the Message Filter as it may have a setting 'Filter after junk classification' which needs to be set as 'filter before junk classification'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
