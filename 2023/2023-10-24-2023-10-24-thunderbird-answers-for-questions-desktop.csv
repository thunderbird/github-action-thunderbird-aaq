Maybe I wasn't clear but I don't see how anything ZIP can address my issue. </p><p>I need to restore a profile into Thunderbird. The only copy of the profile I wish to restore was made by Mozbackup and is a .pcv file.  </p><p>Running Restore within Mozbackup seems to run but the profile does not appear in AppData/Local/Thunderbird where it should. The Restore using Mozbackup runs but does nothing.  </p><p>If this can be accomplished using 7-Zip I don't see how. Would you please show me the steps if that's the case?
