I have poked around some with limited and possibly-obsolete knowledge and online tips, looking for hidden folders; opening the notepad version of the Drafts folder within my TBird profile folder, etc.  I also got deleted messages recovered from 1and1 which hosts our email, but that didn't help anything-- hardly anything there cuz I hadn't actually emptied trash in a while.

A version of my draft exists, but dated May 28, rather than June 23 when the crash happened.  My sense is that correlates to the last time I closed the ""write"" window and truly saved the current version of the draft; auto-save doesn't seem to update the earlier version of the draft that's in the Drafts folder.  (Like if I opened my email in a different app, the draft I have open woudln't be available on the other device, even tho it is supposedly auto-saving.  It wouldn't be available on the Drafts folder on other devices until I close the write window on the 1st device and say ""yes, save the draft"") </p>",heymali,false,0,0

Maybe  duplicate messages deletion works only on incoming messages. And why are there triplicate and quadruplicate and sometimes 12-15 identical messages? Thanks. Ron </blockquote> <p>The why is complex and generally related to outside influences and incomplete downloads,  either through connection loss, antivirus activity, network congestion causing timeouts or just slamming the lid shut at the end of the day. </p><p>They generally duplication only occur if you leave mail on the server as it is the management of the local mail Vs the retention status on the server that results in duplication because the POP protocol is not well suited to  that when many years of mail are involved.  IT was a concept rooted in a time when having a couple of hundred email over a period of years was to have a lot and for those with ""a lot""  the server only allocated around 5mb of disk space to the account filled and forced deleting fairly quickly anyway.  The situation being that unless Thunderbird knows exactly were to start, the sever serves the lot when asked. </p><p>One thing I did not mention in the causes is actual physic issues on the disk that make the program unable to read the files in question.  That is a matter to address with operating system disk integrity checking tools. </p><p>I would also like to take you definition of crash to task here.  A crash results in the program ceasing to appear on the screen and by default is followed by the popping up the the Mozilla crash reporter so you can describe when you were doing when the program crashed and include that in the crash report. </p><p>Hanging is when he program simply ceases to respond and is sometime involved a message from the operating system the the program is not responding.  I will go out on a limb and guess this is what you had happen,  not a crash, as it is something I would expect to happen if processing a huge folder of files and sorting the duplicates out with that add-on.
