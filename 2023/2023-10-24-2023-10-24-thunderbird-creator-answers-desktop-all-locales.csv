Something else that needs to be removed / fixed / done  to get 102 to open what 102 opened less than a week ago,  before I downloaded 115 and SHTF.  </p><p>Since 115 _instantly_ opened the profile from 102, I know there was NO extensive conversion, no migrating all the content to some new paradigm. It was instant, and all 24 GB was there.  </p><p>So I want to un-instant whatever 115 did and go back to 102.  How do I do that? </p><p>Do I need to text-edit some data file with a version number so that 102 accepts all 24 GB of data as it did before? I'm happy to do it.

When writing an email, and then click on Insert. The drop down list has an item ""Link"". The process that I am used to is that I hit ""Link"" and a dialog box appears giving me a field to enter the url and other details. Since the thunderbird changes, I do not see that dialog box, but I do see a line at the very extreme right of the screen as if Thunderbird has placed the dialog box off the screen. When this happens, any attempt to take any action just gives rise to a ""bell"" sound. The only way that I can find is &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Delete&gt; and then close Thunderbird at the Task manager. I am using Windows 7. </p><p>Richard Schurmann </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1613367;,firefox1295
