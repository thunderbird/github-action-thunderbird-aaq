Over time the person in this position has changed. Even though I have edited the contact to show the new person's name any incoming email still shows as from the old person. </p><p>For example  Joe Blogs contact has email director@abc.com We receive lots of email in Thunderbird from Joe. The contact changes so that now  Martha Jenkins now uses director@abc.com Now we receive emails from Martha but they still show as coming from Joe Blogs. There does not appear to be anything in the header that refers to Joe Blogs. The header only includes director@abc.com and Thunderbird somehow looks up old email and shows it as coming from Joe Blogs even though this is no longer true. </p><p>It is really annoying. </p><p>I hope I have explained this well enough. </p><p>Regards Drew </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",web.admin2

When writing an email, and then click on Insert. The drop down list has an item ""Link"". The process that I am used to is that I hit ""Link"" and a dialog box appears giving me a field to enter the url and other details. Since the thunderbird changes, I do not see that dialog box, but I do see a line at the very extreme right of the screen as if Thunderbird has placed the dialog box off the screen. When this happens, any attempt to take any action just gives rise to a ""bell"" sound. The only way that I can find is &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Delete&gt; and then close Thunderbird at the Task manager. I am using Windows 7. </p><p>Richard Schurmann </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",firefox1295
