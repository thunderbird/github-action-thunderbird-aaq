Nothing but WHITE SCREEN!!","<p>Hello, I've been a happy Thunderbird user for over twenty years.  But recently SOMETHING HAPPENED.  If I open Thunderbird it says, SORRY, emails are being processed, so it won't open.    If I try to send an email, IT REFUSES TO SEND AND I have to copy THE MESSAGE and send it in WEBMAIL.  Now today, ALL BOXES are BLANK.  Nothing but a WHITE SCREEN.  THE INBOX, the SENT BOX, and ALL FILES of ALL my customers are nothing but a BLANK, WHITE SCREEN.  iT SAYS THERE ARE hundreds of emails there, but I can't SEE or ACCESS any of them!!   I've done several restarts.  Everything is GONE, even my Address BOOK.  All my customers pay with online INTERACT, and now all my FINANCIAL records for my business are GONE.   EVERYTHING IS A BLANK WHITE SCREEN!!   PLEASE HELP,  I'M DESPERATE!!   THANK YOU.  SKIPPY MARDON.  skippym@eastlink.ca </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",skippygm2010
