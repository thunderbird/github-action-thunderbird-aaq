Over time the person in this position has changed. Even though I have edited the contact to show the new person's name any incoming email still shows as from the old person. </p><p>For example  Joe Blogs contact has email director@abc.com We receive lots of email in Thunderbird from Joe. The contact changes so that now  Martha Jenkins now uses director@abc.com Now we receive emails from Martha but they still show as coming from Joe Blogs. There does not appear to be anything in the header that refers to Joe Blogs. The header only includes director@abc.com and Thunderbird somehow looks up old email and shows it as coming from Joe Blogs even though this is no longer true. </p><p>It is really annoying. </p><p>I hope I have explained this well enough. </p><p>Regards Drew </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",web.admin2

Emptied Trash. (mac)  I only use Thunderbird for mail, no plugins, nothing fancy.  I re-downloaded 102.15 (not beta).  </p><p>I followed the instructions on this web page to use ""about:profiles"" set my 24 GB folder as default. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles</a> </p><p>&gt; Set as default profile This option allows you to switch profiles.  &gt; Click this to make Thunderbird use this profile by default at startup. </p><p>Then I used Terminal as described to select the same profile to launch at startup.  </p><p>&gt; In the Terminal application, enter the following: &gt; /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird-bin -P </p><p>I launch Thunderbird 102.15 (not beta) and I always get the alert - ""You have launched an older version of Thunderbird."" The only option is to create a new, empty, profile, or Quit.  </p><p>So there's something else I need to get rid of.  Something else that needs to be removed / fixed / done  to get 102 to open what 102 opened less than a week ago,  before I downloaded 115 and SHTF.  </p><p>Since 115 _instantly_ opened the profile from 102, I know there was NO extensive conversion, no migrating all the content to some new paradigm. It was instant, and all 24 GB was there.  </p><p>So I want to un-instant whatever 115 did and go back to 102.  How do I do that? </p><p>Do I need to text-edit some data file with a version number so that 102 accepts all 24 GB of data as it did before? I'm happy to do it. Just tell me what to do. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1613218;,VidPro

When writing an email, and then click on Insert. The drop down list has an item ""Link"". The process that I am used to is that I hit ""Link"" and a dialog box appears giving me a field to enter the url and other details. Since the thunderbird changes, I do not see that dialog box, but I do see a line at the very extreme right of the screen as if Thunderbird has placed the dialog box off the screen. When this happens, any attempt to take any action just gives rise to a ""bell"" sound. The only way that I can find is &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Delete&gt; and then close Thunderbird at the Task manager. I am using Windows 7. </p><p>Richard Schurmann </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",firefox1295

If I open Thunderbird it says, SORRY, emails are being processed, so it won't open.    If I try to send an email, IT REFUSES TO SEND AND I have to copy THE MESSAGE and send it in WEBMAIL.  Now today, ALL BOXES are BLANK.  Nothing but a WHITE SCREEN.  THE INBOX, the SENT BOX, and ALL FILES of ALL my customers are nothing but a BLANK, WHITE SCREEN.  iT SAYS THERE ARE hundreds of emails there, but I can't SEE or ACCESS any of them!!   I've done several restarts.  Everything is GONE, even my Address BOOK.  All my customers pay with online INTERACT, and now all my FINANCIAL records for my business are GONE.
