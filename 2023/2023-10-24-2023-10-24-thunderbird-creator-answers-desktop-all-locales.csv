I am a Thunderbird user since it was first introduced way back when... I just migrated all my info from my trusty Windows 7 to a new Windows 10 machine and installed the latest version of Tbird. I have several accounts in my Tbird list.  <strong>None of them are set to automatically download emails from the server.</strong> In my previous Tbird version, I used to be able to click on the name of an account and then (at the top of the screen) ""Get messages"" and it would only get messages for that particular account. Now it downloads the emails for all my accounts which I do not want. How can I change it to only get messages for the account I have clicked on in the accounts list&nbsp;? </p><p>My second question concerns the font and size of the messages in the right hand pane. i.e. when I click on a particular account's ""Inbox"" on the left, I see a list of the emails received on the right, but the font is too small and is not the font I used to have on my Windows 7 (Arial).  I have played around with the Windows settings but it has not changed anything in Tbird. So how do I change the display font and size in Tbird&nbsp;? (NOT the font used to write emails) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",Helvetica
