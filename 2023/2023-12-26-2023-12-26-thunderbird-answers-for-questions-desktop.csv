Donations are what fuels new development, and also the resources to revisit and correct/enhance reported issues. Without the kind support of persons such as yourself, development/maintenance suffers. I agree that SuperNova has had many ups and downs, but what we have is a new code base for a better long-term experience.  </p><p>Many complaints have surfaced on screenspace in the classic view and I believe some of those are being addressed. My suggestion for now is to try the vertical layout, as that lets  you click any message and read and reply without opening new message when through with current message. You mentioned wanting larger font for printing. Did you mean viewing on screen? If so, let me know and I can give you the instructions on how to set viewable font size of messages to whatever you prefer.  And, thank you for your understanding of our volunteer role. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

And then reinstall. Do you have the old profile? Is the old computer still available? The cleanest install would be to  - do fresh install of thunderbird and exit - on old computer, with Thunderbird not running, copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to USB stick  - on new computer, copy that thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming, and allow the overwrites.  - start thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
