Donations are what fuels new development, and also the resources to revisit and correct/enhance reported issues. Without the kind support of persons such as yourself, development/maintenance suffers. I agree that SuperNova has had many ups and downs, but what we have is a new code base for a better long-term experience.  </p><p>Many complaints have surfaced on screenspace in the classic view and I believe some of those are being addressed. My suggestion for now is to try the vertical layout, as that lets  you click any message and read and reply without opening new message when through with current message. You mentioned wanting larger font for printing. Did you mean viewing on screen? If so, let me know and I can give you the instructions on how to set viewable font size of messages to whatever you prefer.  And, thank you for your understanding of our volunteer role. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

My outgoing emails are fine as far as size of type.  It is the incoming emails that I have trouble reading.  The type is so small that I have to use Cntl + over and over again to get the type large enough for me to see.  And now Cntl + is not working. So if you can tell me how to actually get the incoming font size larger that will help a lot. </p><p>I did not know that there is a vertical format and it sounds better than the current layout.  How do I change to that? </p><p>In trying out the various email programs on my computer, I landed on Betterbird and was fairly pleased with it until they decided that the user didn't need to see the sender's heading when you opened an email.  Want to know a reason why you need to see the sender's header?  I get barraged  with political emails.  One of the things various PACs and campaigns do is completely misuse the header.  And you don't see all of the abuses in the unopened email.  You must open the email in order to see their full abuse of email standards.   I respond to these emails telling them what they're doing is an abuse.   As I understand it, this new supernova is doing the same thing - bad idea. </p><p>Ok, final problem.  I use Local Folders a lot.  How can I link the local folders from Betterbird to my 115 local folders?  So far, I have not been able to find the local folders in my file cabinet. </p><p>Bless you, David  you are a shining light. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

Anyway, the vertical view is at View&gt;Layout&gt;vertical view. If you don't have menu bar active, press the Alt key and then it should appear. Or press the hamburger menu (three lines) in upper right and select View.   You may need to drag the separator lines between folder pane and message list panes for your optimal viewing. I like this view because I can click down the message list pane and the accompanying message appears to the right.  </p><p>For font size, there are a few steps:  - click settings&gt;general and click the advanced button on font section. There, click the minimum font size to what you think is desirable. My suggestion is to set higher than you think is needed. I suggest 22 for a start. If too big, you can always reset it. I also suggest changing all the font size options that are visible there to that size for consistency. Then, look at top of that pane. It probably shows 'latin'. Click it and then select 'Other writing systems' and repeat EXACTLY on than pane the settings you did on the Latin pane. Exactly. I included two screenshots to demonstrate. My setting is 14, but you need a higher number. Now, click OK.  </p><p>Next, click settings&gt;composition and verify that the HTML font is 'Variable width' and 'Medium'. This guarantees that, no matter how big you have the font for your viewing, that message you send do NOT include font size, as that allows recipient to set font size as they prefer.   </p><p>The Betterbird question is easy, but I may need more info. If you used Betterbird with a different profile, you need to copy from that profile to the Thunderbird profile. My inference is you created some local folders in Betterbird that you want to save. Right? Is Betterbird still installed? Let me know and we can take it from there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I tried Classic View and Wide View and didn't see any real difference, so I went back to Vertical View.( I did however move the menu bar permanently above the window.  I know that will make things a lot easier. I did get the font fixed.  Thank you. </p><p>Another critique of the design.  It's very hard to find the tabs of the various options (Address Book, Settings, etc.,) when the bar that holds these items also hold tabs for the various messages are also up there.  I have found that by right-clicking on the tab I can close the tab, but why does it have to be up there?   In giving people ""options"" (that they don't know they have or need, they make the whole thing more complicated than it has to be. </p><p>Ok, ask the questions you need to ask about Betterbird.  I still have Betterbird active.  There's a button to click to find the Local Files, but what it comes up with makes no sense. </p><p>Hopefully we'll finally get this all settled. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

By having a tab for each open item, a user can easily switch between the two. Works for some, not for all. To capture your local folder items and move to thunderbird requires use of windows file explorer. If you're comfortable working within the file explorer, the steps are simple: - locate the Mail\Local Folders folder in the Betterbird profile and copy the paired items (such as filename and filename.msf) to the Mail\Local Folders folder in the Thunderbird profile. If not sure where they are, the way to do that (in both Betterbird and Thunderbird) is to click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open profile' and then note the name of the folder so you could find it again. Do that first for Betterbird, click the Mail and LocalFolders folder and copy the desired pairs to a separate folder. Then, repeat the process for Thunderbird and when you open its profile folder, exit Thunderbird and then copy the previously copied pairs to the Mail\Local Folders folder and restart thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Now a little background up until when I found a way to avoid this MS dialog that doesn't work  because a ""code"" cannot be sent. <strong>I must have asked this question 5+ times in different variations such as</strong>: 1) Why does this account work with ALL OTHER Email Clients with the one exception of the TB Email Client? 2) Why does this same account have no problems in all other Email Clients, yet uniquely does have a problem with ONLY TB? (and since TB is the ONLY Email Client w/ the problem then isn't it reasonable to ask why?) 3) The question is - 'why does this issue occur in TB and does not occur anywhere else?'  etc etc.... </p><p>And I asked all of this as well: '<em><strong>So since this dialog applies ONLY to TB - I'm assuming there is some relationship between TB and the MS email account(s) that have this kind of issue. </strong></em> </p><p>Perhaps the question to ask is why does this happen In TB (when I have no problem using the approach of logging into the respective accounts on the web to access new messages)? </p><p>Something specific to TB that needs to have a ""code"" sent (of which several of my other accounts in TB successfully navigated) respective to the account in the attached screen-shot. </p><p>In other words, if the only problem I have checking this account for ""new"" messages has to do with TB is the reason I'm asking the question. </p><p>To explain further (I have no problem with any of these other apps accessing this specific email accounts Inbox): 1) MS email - no problem 2) Claws Mail - no problem 3) POP Peeper - no problem 4) TB - has this problem'<em><strong> </strong></em> </p><p><strong>So what I've found is in the case of TB - if I use the Oauth2 protocol for my TB Server settings - I will get this dialog prompt (that doesn't work) from MS.</strong> </p><p>However <strong>if I change my TB Server setting (at least for the account that has the issue) to ""Password"" then I do     not get the ""broken"" MS dialog. </strong> </p><p>This is exactly what I was asking for.<strong> </strong> </p><p>I work with a multiple App developer (as an advisor and global moderator) on the website - when we have questions in our forum we do not get all ""defensive"" and send them off to find the answer somewhere else and be sure to divert any ""blame"" of any kind off of our apps.  Instead we try to help find an answer to the issue even if it involves something other than our app in question. </p><p>That said, in this case - <strong>there was something I could do that had to do with TB directly in order to resolve my issue with TB</strong> and that was to switch  the accounts Server setting from the ""Oauth2"" protocol to the ""Password' protocol (thus bypassing the issue that I'm getting from MS that in this case cannot be easily resolved).  Other Email Clients do not get this (MS ""code"") issue when using the ""Oauth2"" protocol however - why this is, I'm not certain (but I continually pointed out that <strong>there was something unique to TB that was causing this MS dialog prompt that I needed to avoid that wasn't the case with any other Email apps</strong> - and I found <strong>what is unique to TB that addressed my issue directly</strong>, through no help from anyone here that appear to instead exhibit a preference to ridicule and focus on diverting questions away from TB).  Our attitude on our website forum is to always see what we can do to ""HELP"" whenever we can and certainly not be concerned about ""protecting"" our apps by deferring ""blame"" onto something else other than our apps (which clearly doesn't provide any service to users that need help). </p><p>The bottom line is that the answer to my dilemma (involving a dialog prompt from MS, albeit - that cannot be successfully navigated due MS issues with sending a ""code"") is something I was <strong>able to resolve specific to TB</strong> (which is what I was hoping I could get from this forum but was unfortunately not the case). </p>",firefox_browser,false,0,0

What I did: </p><p>&gt; Based on information from Windows Defender, it appeared that the offending file in my Thunderbird profile cache corresponded to an email received on 12/21/2023 at 6:45 am. There were a fair number of such file entries in the cache, but only one was identified as a threat. The cache file names kept changing, but the date and time of the threat file remained the same since Defender alerted me to the threat. </p><p>&gt; Clearing the Thunderbird cache was the right idea, but that command didn't seem to permanently clear it. That is, I could ""Clear the startup cache..."" from Thunderbird's Troubleshooting Information page, and restart Thunderbird, but all the prior cache entries re-appeared in the cache directory after restart, including all the entries for 12/21/23, 6:45 am. </p><p>&gt; I next deleted all cache entries for 12/21, 6:45 am from the profile cache directory. </p><p>&gt; I then renamed the original cache directory (to set it aside) and replaced it with an empty one with the name of the original. </p><p>&gt; Upon restarting Thunderbird, there were only cache entries for the current day created, so the offending threat cache file entry was not re-created. By watching the profile directory, I could see that Thunderbird was creating a transitory ""startup incomplete"" file entry in that directory, but that file would then disappear. </p><p>&gt; Meanwhile, everything in Thunderbird seems to be operating as usual. I was also successful in creating a System Image backup without Windows Defender complaining that it couldn't be completed because it contained a threat (how I stumbled upon the original Phishing threat problem). </p><p>I will be monitoring this for a time until it's clear the problem is permanently gone (I have to run Backup and create system image backups in order for Defender to identify a threat in Thunderbird profile files). </p><p>In the mean time, someone from the Thunderbird team should review the behavior of the ""Clear the startup cache..."" troubleshooting button and consider if it's as helpful as it should be. The current behavior suggests that it simply clears the existing cache and enables it to be re-populated on the next startup. That didn't prove helpful in this case since the offending cache entry would just be restored to the cache on the next startup. </p>",fhanzel,false,1,0

Right now dealing with two laptops, same problem, I've unplugged the SanDisk SSD backup drives from them, on the theory that backup to them failed because they were infected. Ran full scan and offline scan on the MECH-17 (WIN 10), and it's clean at this time. I will wait for the scans to finish on the Compal NBLB3 (WIN 7). If that's also clean, I'll format the SSDs to sterilize, and see if I can do Backup to them without getting the error report again. I'm struggling here, beyond my limits of competence.

From the Windows Defender reporting, I would see that the problem file was part of a ""volume shadow copy"" which was being made/used to produce the System Image File during backup. One could also see that the threat file originated in Thunderbird's profile area.

A couple of things in our favor: 1. We're not twiddling with Windows (the OS), rather just an app (Thunderbird). 2. What's the worst that could happen? a. Thunderbird won't start (ok: reverse the changes and resume) b. Fallback: uninstall and re-install Thunderbird [I began down this path, but didn't like the prospect of having to configure a completely fresh profile -- I've been using T-bird for more than 10 years!] c. The Trojan threat file keeps showing up (I was in this plight for days, and did not like being stuck either). </p><p>As for techniques: &gt; Navigate to the corresponding Profile location in your file tree using File Explorer. &gt; If you right-click on items in the Profile directory, most likely you don't have the option to Delete or Rename them; these are available in the right-click menu under Show More Options, however &gt; Be conservative; preserve the entire existing Cache2 folder by simply changing its name (I renamed mine Cache2-ORIG). You can always reverse the re-name. After doing this I simple created a new folder with the name Cache2. Of course, I was making these changes while Thunderbird was not running. </p><p>It occurred to me in retrospect that I could have been more surgical/precise than I was, and that I might have done something to preserve the threat file causing my problems in case some researcher wanted to inspect it. &gt; Precision: use the file names showing up in your Defender notifications to locate the specific threat file in the cache2 directory. Note its date and time stamps, and compare to other entries in the cache (easier if you click the Date Modified column in Explorer to sort entries by date rather than Name); in my case, there were numerous entries that had the same time and date stamps, so I deleted all of them to ensure I nailed the threat file. This might have been overkill. &gt; Preserve: If you want to preserve a version of the threat file, try copying that specific file to a different location before deleting the original in the cache location. If you choose not to mess with it, just delete the original. </p><p>In my case, restarting Thunderbird worked fine, seemed to preserve all my settings, and did no harm. </p>",fhanzel,false,1,0
