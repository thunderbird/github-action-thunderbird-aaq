Donations are what fuels new development, and also the resources to revisit and correct/enhance reported issues. Without the kind support of persons such as yourself, development/maintenance suffers. I agree that SuperNova has had many ups and downs, but what we have is a new code base for a better long-term experience.  </p><p>Many complaints have surfaced on screenspace in the classic view and I believe some of those are being addressed. My suggestion for now is to try the vertical layout, as that lets  you click any message and read and reply without opening new message when through with current message. You mentioned wanting larger font for printing. Did you mean viewing on screen? If so, let me know and I can give you the instructions on how to set viewable font size of messages to whatever you prefer.  And, thank you for your understanding of our volunteer role. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

My outgoing emails are fine as far as size of type.  It is the incoming emails that I have trouble reading.  The type is so small that I have to use Cntl + over and over again to get the type large enough for me to see.  And now Cntl + is not working. So if you can tell me how to actually get the incoming font size larger that will help a lot. </p><p>I did not know that there is a vertical format and it sounds better than the current layout.  How do I change to that? </p><p>In trying out the various email programs on my computer, I landed on Betterbird and was fairly pleased with it until they decided that the user didn't need to see the sender's heading when you opened an email.  Want to know a reason why you need to see the sender's header?  I get barraged  with political emails.  One of the things various PACs and campaigns do is completely misuse the header.  And you don't see all of the abuses in the unopened email.  You must open the email in order to see their full abuse of email standards.   I respond to these emails telling them what they're doing is an abuse.   As I understand it, this new supernova is doing the same thing - bad idea. </p><p>Ok, final problem.  I use Local Folders a lot.  How can I link the local folders from Betterbird to my 115 local folders?  So far, I have not been able to find the local folders in my file cabinet. </p><p>Bless you, David  you are a shining light. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

And then reinstall. Do you have the old profile? Is the old computer still available? The cleanest install would be to  - do fresh install of thunderbird and exit - on old computer, with Thunderbird not running, copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to USB stick  - on new computer, copy that thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming, and allow the overwrites.  - start thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
