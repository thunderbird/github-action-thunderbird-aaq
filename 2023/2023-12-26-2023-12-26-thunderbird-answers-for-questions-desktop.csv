Donations are what fuels new development, and also the resources to revisit and correct/enhance reported issues. Without the kind support of persons such as yourself, development/maintenance suffers. I agree that SuperNova has had many ups and downs, but what we have is a new code base for a better long-term experience.  </p><p>Many complaints have surfaced on screenspace in the classic view and I believe some of those are being addressed. My suggestion for now is to try the vertical layout, as that lets  you click any message and read and reply without opening new message when through with current message. You mentioned wanting larger font for printing. Did you mean viewing on screen? If so, let me know and I can give you the instructions on how to set viewable font size of messages to whatever you prefer.  And, thank you for your understanding of our volunteer role. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

My outgoing emails are fine as far as size of type.  It is the incoming emails that I have trouble reading.  The type is so small that I have to use Cntl + over and over again to get the type large enough for me to see.  And now Cntl + is not working. So if you can tell me how to actually get the incoming font size larger that will help a lot. </p><p>I did not know that there is a vertical format and it sounds better than the current layout.  How do I change to that? </p><p>In trying out the various email programs on my computer, I landed on Betterbird and was fairly pleased with it until they decided that the user didn't need to see the sender's heading when you opened an email.  Want to know a reason why you need to see the sender's header?  I get barraged  with political emails.  One of the things various PACs and campaigns do is completely misuse the header.  And you don't see all of the abuses in the unopened email.  You must open the email in order to see their full abuse of email standards.   I respond to these emails telling them what they're doing is an abuse.   As I understand it, this new supernova is doing the same thing - bad idea. </p><p>Ok, final problem.  I use Local Folders a lot.  How can I link the local folders from Betterbird to my 115 local folders?  So far, I have not been able to find the local folders in my file cabinet. </p><p>Bless you, David  you are a shining light. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

Anyway, the vertical view is at View&gt;Layout&gt;vertical view. If you don't have menu bar active, press the Alt key and then it should appear. Or press the hamburger menu (three lines) in upper right and select View.   You may need to drag the separator lines between folder pane and message list panes for your optimal viewing. I like this view because I can click down the message list pane and the accompanying message appears to the right.  </p><p>For font size, there are a few steps:  - click settings&gt;general and click the advanced button on font section. There, click the minimum font size to what you think is desirable. My suggestion is to set higher than you think is needed. I suggest 22 for a start. If too big, you can always reset it. I also suggest changing all the font size options that are visible there to that size for consistency. Then, look at top of that pane. It probably shows 'latin'. Click it and then select 'Other writing systems' and repeat EXACTLY on than pane the settings you did on the Latin pane. Exactly. I included two screenshots to demonstrate. My setting is 14, but you need a higher number. Now, click OK.  </p><p>Next, click settings&gt;composition and verify that the HTML font is 'Variable width' and 'Medium'. This guarantees that, no matter how big you have the font for your viewing, that message you send do NOT include font size, as that allows recipient to set font size as they prefer.   </p><p>The Betterbird question is easy, but I may need more info. If you used Betterbird with a different profile, you need to copy from that profile to the Thunderbird profile. My inference is you created some local folders in Betterbird that you want to save. Right? Is Betterbird still installed? Let me know and we can take it from there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I tried Classic View and Wide View and didn't see any real difference, so I went back to Vertical View.( I did however move the menu bar permanently above the window.  I know that will make things a lot easier. I did get the font fixed.  Thank you. </p><p>Another critique of the design.  It's very hard to find the tabs of the various options (Address Book, Settings, etc.,) when the bar that holds these items also hold tabs for the various messages are also up there.  I have found that by right-clicking on the tab I can close the tab, but why does it have to be up there?   In giving people ""options"" (that they don't know they have or need, they make the whole thing more complicated than it has to be. </p><p>Ok, ask the questions you need to ask about Betterbird.  I still have Betterbird active.  There's a button to click to find the Local Files, but what it comes up with makes no sense. </p><p>Hopefully we'll finally get this all settled. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

Since it was lost in an update, it may be in an older profile. You can investigate that by  - clicking help&gt;troubleshootinginformation - scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open profile'  - exit thunderbird  - you are now in the profile. If there is an abook.sqlite file showing, it is not up-to-date.  - click the back arrow in WIndows file explorer to position yourself at the Profiles folder.  - click that to see if there are multiple profiles (i.e., more than one) - if so, your missing addressbook may be there. All I can do is suggest comparing what any abook files are there with the files in your active profile. The abook setup may have multiple files with slight variations of the name. Together, they form the addressbook. If you locate a collection of files with abook prefix, you may have found your missing addresses.  To save them,  </p><pre> - first, in active profile (the one you started in), rename all abook files in case they are needed later - copy all of the abook-prefixed files from the older profile to the active profile  </pre> <p>- restart thunderbird and check addressbook. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
