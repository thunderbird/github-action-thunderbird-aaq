And then reinstall. Do you have the old profile? Is the old computer still available? The cleanest install would be to  - do fresh install of thunderbird and exit - on old computer, with Thunderbird not running, copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to USB stick  - on new computer, copy that thunderbird folder to c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming, and allow the overwrites.  - start thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
