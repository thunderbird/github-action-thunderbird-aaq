Donations are what fuels new development, and also the resources to revisit and correct/enhance reported issues. Without the kind support of persons such as yourself, development/maintenance suffers. I agree that SuperNova has had many ups and downs, but what we have is a new code base for a better long-term experience.  </p><p>Many complaints have surfaced on screenspace in the classic view and I believe some of those are being addressed. My suggestion for now is to try the vertical layout, as that lets  you click any message and read and reply without opening new message when through with current message. You mentioned wanting larger font for printing. Did you mean viewing on screen? If so, let me know and I can give you the instructions on how to set viewable font size of messages to whatever you prefer.  And, thank you for your understanding of our volunteer role. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

My outgoing emails are fine as far as size of type.  It is the incoming emails that I have trouble reading.  The type is so small that I have to use Cntl + over and over again to get the type large enough for me to see.  And now Cntl + is not working. So if you can tell me how to actually get the incoming font size larger that will help a lot. </p><p>I did not know that there is a vertical format and it sounds better than the current layout.  How do I change to that? </p><p>In trying out the various email programs on my computer, I landed on Betterbird and was fairly pleased with it until they decided that the user didn't need to see the sender's heading when you opened an email.  Want to know a reason why you need to see the sender's header?  I get barraged  with political emails.  One of the things various PACs and campaigns do is completely misuse the header.  And you don't see all of the abuses in the unopened email.  You must open the email in order to see their full abuse of email standards.   I respond to these emails telling them what they're doing is an abuse.   As I understand it, this new supernova is doing the same thing - bad idea. </p><p>Ok, final problem.  I use Local Folders a lot.  How can I link the local folders from Betterbird to my 115 local folders?  So far, I have not been able to find the local folders in my file cabinet. </p><p>Bless you, David  you are a shining light. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

Anyway, the vertical view is at View&gt;Layout&gt;vertical view. If you don't have menu bar active, press the Alt key and then it should appear. Or press the hamburger menu (three lines) in upper right and select View.   You may need to drag the separator lines between folder pane and message list panes for your optimal viewing. I like this view because I can click down the message list pane and the accompanying message appears to the right.  </p><p>For font size, there are a few steps:  - click settings&gt;general and click the advanced button on font section. There, click the minimum font size to what you think is desirable. My suggestion is to set higher than you think is needed. I suggest 22 for a start. If too big, you can always reset it. I also suggest changing all the font size options that are visible there to that size for consistency. Then, look at top of that pane. It probably shows 'latin'. Click it and then select 'Other writing systems' and repeat EXACTLY on than pane the settings you did on the Latin pane. Exactly. I included two screenshots to demonstrate. My setting is 14, but you need a higher number. Now, click OK.  </p><p>Next, click settings&gt;composition and verify that the HTML font is 'Variable width' and 'Medium'. This guarantees that, no matter how big you have the font for your viewing, that message you send do NOT include font size, as that allows recipient to set font size as they prefer.   </p><p>The Betterbird question is easy, but I may need more info. If you used Betterbird with a different profile, you need to copy from that profile to the Thunderbird profile. My inference is you created some local folders in Betterbird that you want to save. Right? Is Betterbird still installed? Let me know and we can take it from there. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I tried Classic View and Wide View and didn't see any real difference, so I went back to Vertical View.( I did however move the menu bar permanently above the window.  I know that will make things a lot easier. I did get the font fixed.  Thank you. </p><p>Another critique of the design.  It's very hard to find the tabs of the various options (Address Book, Settings, etc.,) when the bar that holds these items also hold tabs for the various messages are also up there.  I have found that by right-clicking on the tab I can close the tab, but why does it have to be up there?   In giving people ""options"" (that they don't know they have or need, they make the whole thing more complicated than it has to be. </p><p>Ok, ask the questions you need to ask about Betterbird.  I still have Betterbird active.  There's a button to click to find the Local Files, but what it comes up with makes no sense. </p><p>Hopefully we'll finally get this all settled. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

By having a tab for each open item, a user can easily switch between the two. Works for some, not for all. To capture your local folder items and move to thunderbird requires use of windows file explorer. If you're comfortable working within the file explorer, the steps are simple: - locate the Mail\Local Folders folder in the Betterbird profile and copy the paired items (such as filename and filename.msf) to the Mail\Local Folders folder in the Thunderbird profile. If not sure where they are, the way to do that (in both Betterbird and Thunderbird) is to click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder', click 'open profile' and then note the name of the folder so you could find it again. Do that first for Betterbird, click the Mail and LocalFolders folder and copy the desired pairs to a separate folder. Then, repeat the process for Thunderbird and when you open its profile folder, exit Thunderbird and then copy the previously copied pairs to the Mail\Local Folders folder and restart thunderbird. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The actual link that Betterbird gave me is /home/barbaradj/.thunderbird/yhb3oj6n.default-default/Mail/Local Folders. The individual files mean nothing  to me, but you may be able to tell me what to do about them.  I'm sorry that it took me so long, but with complications of the holidays, I got kind of overloaded. If we can nail this, it will be great.  My one remaining issue is transferring my email accounts.  I transferred all my email addresses to a docx file, but they're also still in Betterbird. </p><p>Thanks to your last post, I have found my working method.  Now that I know that that there is a tab opened when I open an email, I just close the tab.  This way I'm not automatically passed on to the next message(which is often spam) and I like to handle my spam from the list of emails.  There is one problem, alas, that that is the spam button is not working.  In Betterbird when I clicked on the spam button, it sent the email to the spam folder.  In my copy of Thunderbird 115, the spam button is not working, except the change from dark to light and vice versa.  But that is a very minor problem. </p>",bdjim,false,0,0

Your suggestion about switching the folders to c:\users sent me to my file cabinet(Linux version of Windows Explorer).  Everything seems to be messed up there.  Usually when I open the file cabinet it leads with Home/Barbaradj/.  Now it doesn't and I can't find the Betterbird string of folders that you suggested I transfer to a new folder. I love my switch to Linux.  One of the best things about it is increased privacy because the number Linux computers compared to Windows and Mac is so small that it isn't worth it for hackers to learn its intricacies.  But I see that something is wrong because it's not working quite as it should.  It's time for me to contact the computer's manufacturer to see if they can help me straigten this out. </p><p>I want to see what I can do manually.  I can manually add my addresses to Thunderbird, I hope.  Is there anything else I have to transfer to Thunderbird from Betterbird - and can I do it manually.

No I have not been able to add my address book automatically, but that's ok.  I have my email list and I've found out how to add the addresses manually. As to the Local folders - all the things I collected in there were newsletters I subscribed to.  I can get the past issues from substack any time I want to.  I do have the folders laid out as I want them, and hew newsletters arrive in my inbox I well set up the automatic move from my inbox to Local folders. </p><p>There are only 2 problems that I cannot fix - and I assume you cannot either. </p><p>Despite changing the font size in the account settings, the incoming print has not increased.  But my work around is to hit reply(whether I plan to reply or not).  When the incoming email opens up as a reply, the email's content is legible.  If I'm not replying, the all I have to do is not send it. </p><p>The other thing surprised me.  The junk mark shows up next to emails marked spam, but pressing the spam button does not send the email to spam.  Nor does The ""junk"" option that appears with other options when you open an email. </p><p>The other thing I have noticed - which is not your problem - the marks that used to appear at the top right corner of Firefox are gone - and I wonder why?  It was the best tool to manage screens and, without it, dealing with multiple screens is convoluted to say the least. </p><p>It seems to me that Mozilla has two sets of users.  Long-time users, like me, that have gotten used to a set of operating standards that have served us well.  The second set of users who are younger and connected to any number of digital outlets and whose minds have been conditioned to jump from one outlet to another and want tools that serve their needs.  The problem is that the two groups are not really compatible and trying to design one email program for both groups results in the kind of experience I've had with email. </p><p>I am going to donate to Thunderbird development but I'm also going to give them feedback, especially on the idea of serving different sets of users. </p><p>Thank you for all your help.

My guess is you need to fix the issue that is causing them first so you can actually save changes to the application. </p><p>Most of these come from antivirus program scanning in the profile folder while Thunderbird is trying to write to the files.  Thunderbird response to a non accessible file is write another copy with the number with it's changes.  This would be a good strategy,  but Thunderbird never looks for these numbered files ever again, when it starts up it reads the prefs.js file, because now it is available and the cycle repeats.  </p><p>So unless you have moved the profile folder,  or have in backed to the cloud using some sort of sync,  I would suggest you create an exception in your antivirus and prevent it from scanning in the Thunderbird prfile folders while Thunderbird is running and accessing files. </p><p>Then I suggest you move all of these numbered files out of the folder to another location (just as a backup if the next restart does not work.) while Thunderbird is not running,  leaving only the prefs.js file and see if they continue to be created every time you close down Thunderbird. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

A token is stored in the password manager to enable authentication with the provider. </p><p>I think you might want to look at your calendar or address book for the source of your password requests.  both can have remote objects (calendar address book) and as such will at time pop up a password request for access to those items. </p><p>Personally I think your issue will be an antivirus program.

(and since TB is the ONLY Email Client w/ the problem then isn't it reasonable to ask why?) 3) The question is - 'why does this issue occur in TB and does not occur anywhere else?'  etc etc.... </p><p>And I asked all of this as well: '<em><strong>So since this dialog applies ONLY to TB - I'm assuming there is some relationship between TB and the MS email account(s) that have this kind of issue. </strong></em> </p><p>Perhaps the question to ask is why does this happen In TB (when I have no problem using the approach of logging into the respective accounts on the web to access new messages)? </p><p>Something specific to TB that needs to have a ""code"" sent (of which several of my other accounts in TB successfully navigated) respective to the account in the attached screen-shot. </p><p>In other words, if the only problem I have checking this account for ""new"" messages has to do with TB is the reason I'm asking the question. </p><p>To explain further (I have no problem with any of these other apps accessing this specific email accounts Inbox): 1) MS email - no problem 2) Claws Mail - no problem 3) POP Peeper - no problem 4) TB - has this problem'<em><strong> </strong></em> </p><p><strong>So what I've found is in the case of TB - if I use the Oauth2 protocol for my TB Server settings - I will get this dialog prompt (that doesn't work) from MS.</strong> </p><p>However <strong>if I change my TB Server setting (at least for the account that has the issue) to ""Password"" then I do     not get the ""broken"" MS dialog. </strong> </p><p>This is exactly what I was asking for.<strong> </strong> </p><p>I work with a multiple App developer (as an advisor and global moderator) on the website - when we have questions in our forum we do not get all ""defensive"" and send them off to find the answer somewhere else and be sure to divert any ""blame"" of any kind off of our apps.  Instead we try to help find an answer to the issue even if it involves something other than our app in question. </p><p>That said, in this case - <strong>there was something I could do that had to do with TB directly in order to resolve my issue with TB</strong> and that was to switch  the accounts Server setting from the ""Oauth2"" protocol to the ""Password' protocol (thus bypassing the issue that I'm getting from MS that in this case cannot be easily resolved).  Other Email Clients do not get this (MS ""code"") issue when using the ""Oauth2"" protocol however - why this is, I'm not certain (but I continually pointed out that <strong>there was something unique to TB that was causing this MS dialog prompt that I needed to avoid that wasn't the case with any other Email apps</strong> - and I found <strong>what is unique to TB that addressed my issue directly</strong>, through no help from anyone here that appear to instead exhibit a preference to ridicule and focus on diverting questions away from TB).  Our attitude on our website forum is to always see what we can do to ""HELP"" whenever we can and certainly not be concerned about ""protecting"" our apps by deferring ""blame"" onto something else other than our apps (which clearly doesn't provide any service to users that need help). </p><p>The bottom line is that the answer to my dilemma (involving a dialog prompt from MS, albeit - that cannot be successfully navigated due MS issues with sending a ""code"") is something I was <strong>able to resolve specific to TB</strong> (which is what I was hoping I could get from this forum but was unfortunately not the case). </p>",firefox_browser,false,0,0

Ensure the entry in the list is the correct one.  Make sure to click the manage identity button to make sure there is only one identify for each account.

By watching the profile directory, I could see that Thunderbird was creating a transitory ""startup incomplete"" file entry in that directory, but that file would then disappear. </p><p>&gt; Meanwhile, everything in Thunderbird seems to be operating as usual.

The current behavior suggests that it simply clears the existing cache and enables it to be re-populated on the next startup.

A couple of things in our favor: 1. We're not twiddling with Windows (the OS), rather just an app (Thunderbird). 2. What's the worst that could happen? a. Thunderbird won't start (ok: reverse the changes and resume) b. Fallback: uninstall and re-install Thunderbird [I began down this path, but didn't like the prospect of having to configure a completely fresh profile -- I've been using T-bird for more than 10 years!] c. The Trojan threat file keeps showing up (I was in this plight for days, and did not like being stuck either). </p><p>As for techniques: &gt; Navigate to the corresponding Profile location in your file tree using File Explorer. &gt; If you right-click on items in the Profile directory, most likely you don't have the option to Delete or Rename them; these are available in the right-click menu under Show More Options, however &gt; Be conservative; preserve the entire existing Cache2 folder by simply changing its name (I renamed mine Cache2-ORIG). You can always reverse the re-name. After doing this I simple created a new folder with the name Cache2. Of course, I was making these changes while Thunderbird was not running. </p><p>It occurred to me in retrospect that I could have been more surgical/precise than I was, and that I might have done something to preserve the threat file causing my problems in case some researcher wanted to inspect it. &gt; Precision: use the file names showing up in your Defender notifications to locate the specific threat file in the cache2 directory. Note its date and time stamps, and compare to other entries in the cache (easier if you click the Date Modified column in Explorer to sort entries by date rather than Name); in my case, there were numerous entries that had the same time and date stamps, so I deleted all of them to ensure I nailed the threat file. This might have been overkill. &gt; Preserve: If you want to preserve a version of the threat file, try copying that specific file to a different location before deleting the original in the cache location.

Clearly the code defender is reacting to is in an email that keeps getting downloaded to the cache,  or your original clearing of the cache would have cured the error.  So by clearing the cache on shutdown you increase the use of bandwidth to fetch everything anew every time you start the application and you make it run slower by removing the cache whose sole purpose to to make local copies that can be accessed faster. It might clear the backup error,  something I would have ignored as not relevant to me because it is in a cache,  I would not even be backup such a thing up.  A complete waste of backup space. </p><p>Why are you wasting backup space and time backing up a cache?  By it's very definition it is not something that needs to be backed up.  You have spend a considerable amount of time here trying to fix a backup of something that seriously should not be backed up. </p><p>Clearly you have no concern with the fact the code is on your system as the solution you have found is to delete it so your backup runs without error.  Not identify the source and eliminate it from the server. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,0

Restart Thunderbird with the ""Clear cache on shutdown"" enabled. 2. Run your backup. a. If the Phish issue reappears, it's not a workaround rather than a complete solution (user must remember to shut down Thunderbird before running backup). b. If Backup runs successfully, you have a real solution. </p><p>It sounds like an effective workaround until there is a real solution found. </p>",fhanzel,false,1,0

Getting lots of feedback from this thread and much more from community@connect.mozilla.com. Spent some time last night upgrading the Compal from Win7 to Win10. Lots of fiddling left to be done there, so I'm going to leave this discussion to those of you who actually know what you're doing. Will monitor for more developments. Thanks for being here and for helping those of us who know just enough to get into trouble, but also when to yield the floor to the real experts. You folks are the best. </p><p>greg </p>",gregmoehl,false,1,0
