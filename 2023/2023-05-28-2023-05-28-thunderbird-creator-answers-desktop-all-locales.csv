Solved my cannot send problem,but the solution makes me nervous.","<p>Hello: Last time before today when I sent email was 23Oct 21!  What fixed it was setting the outgoing server settings to ""Authentication method: Password transmitted insecurely,and Connection security: none. I got a pop-up asking for my password,and my email was sent normally. My reason for posting this is to ask if this outgoing server setting is safe to use. I haven't tried this solution before,as I am very security conscious. I am attaching a pic of the settings.
