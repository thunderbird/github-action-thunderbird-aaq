Most other applications would let me drag and drop things like that, but I can't seem to do it with Thunderbird.

Folders I've created from emails that are very important to me. I've followed the instructions to Help-Application Basics-Profile Folder, and even ""about:profiles"" and nowhere am I finding the local folders. Recently my computer crashed, and in the course of bringing it back to life I've found that unbeknownst to me I had a second hard drive attached to the main hard drive underneath. Which I believe has data on it, however I've not been able to retrieve it. Nevertheless.....following the instructions I've seen so far for retrieving local folders have not worked and I'm finding nothing that I can open. Many of them are ""json"" files, that I believe have to do with Javascript and cannot be opened. </p><p>Can someone please talk to me like I'm a four year old.....and walk me through the procedure for locating my local folders. I'm not sure why I'm having such a hard time with this, as it should be relatively easy. I'm operating Windows 10 Pro, on an HP Elitedesk 800 and using Thunderbird as my email client. I did re-install Thunderbird and my emails came back up, however my contacts were missing along with my local folders. I'm happy to provide any information that would be helpful to those willing to help. You folks have always been great in helping me when I've had issues I couldn't conquer on my own. And like I stated before.....you may have to talk to me like I'm a four year old, as I'm having so much trouble! I added a screenshot of the folder (I'm seeing) on top of the ""Application Basics"" page. Don't know if that helps at all. </p><p>Thank you in advance for any help! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1575779;1575808;1575810;,MKS1
