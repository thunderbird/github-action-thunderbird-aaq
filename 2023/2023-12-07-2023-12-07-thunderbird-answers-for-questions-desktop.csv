I cannot seem too find any fonts available in the TB program There is no preview that I see; I cannot figure out  how to download or load bold font. I have trouble SEEING the text in incoming emails. Those incoming emails that had BOLD tgext within the message, I can easily read the bolded text. I need to make ALL text in the incoming  messages to BE BOLD. I cannot see well. It seems odd to me that Mizilla has not done anything to add ACCESSIBILITY options, add-ons, or extensions to its program. And there is n o PREVIEW of the text options avialable in the settings. Nothing is intuitive. That is all.
