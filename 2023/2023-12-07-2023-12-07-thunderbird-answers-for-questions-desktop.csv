I have been more or less hysterical in the last ten days or so.  I really appreciate your willingness to at least to engage in the problem.  If I really understood the problem, maybe I might be able to contribute more to solving it.  But I will try again. </p><p>I am have been running a Lenova laptop with a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H CPU @ x2.60 GHz  2.59 GHz for 2 years with Win10, and Thunderbird v115.5.1 for about 2 weeks since TB sneaked up on me with an upgrade.  I have been using Windows for decades and TB for 10 or 15 years.  I have liked TB but often found it difficult; for example being forced to learn to tinker a bit with the profile when I migrated my 10-year old HP laptop.  I still don't understand it extremely well. </p><p>When my TB 115.5.1 updated itself a couple of weeks ago, I had the (perhaps implausible) impression that it also collided at the same time when it collided with a Google upgrade. It seemed to lock the screen, but I finally managed to lose the 150% screen.  Maybe I was just about clumsy. </p><p>But when I could see and work again, I discovered that my Thunderbird was not acting correctly.  To show what that means, I should start by telling that my ISP is Spectrum, and I have three different mail servers, namely Comcast (5 active mailboxes [2 inert]), gMail (4 active mailboxes), and HostGator (3 stable, although incompletely configured).  I mainly used Comcast; even though I was forced to I was moved to another state 5 years ago, Comcast in the new state confirmed to me that I could I could continue to use those 5-6 mailbox indefinitely (I use them), and even gave me a 7th mailbox to tie to the local office (even though that mailbox appeared to have closed). </p><p>So, let me call my five TB Comcast mailboxes: <strong>BigKahuna@'<em>, </em></strong><em>Wifey@<strong>, </strong>Buddy@'</em><strong>, Garbage@</strong>, and <strong>Legal@ </strong>[.net].  Almost immediately BigKahuna, the main box I use, neither sends nor receives any messages; not only that, but the display is empty.  The adjunct folder ""Sent"" is there (1.1 G, but will not accept any passwords); similarly ""Junk"" and ""Drafts"".  Garbage seems to be functional; as does Wifey (but I am afraid of alienate her).  </p><p>Legal returns this: </p><pre>&gt;&gt; </pre> <p>Sending of the message failed: Unable to authenticate to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a>. Please check the password and verify the 'Authentication method' in 'Account Settings | Outgoing server (SMTP)'. &lt;&lt; </p><p>I finally found a way to connect to BigKahuna by going through what seems to be a bottom of shorts in the Xfinity client, which I had not used before this situation.  It receives messages and can forward them to Wifey.  (Her machine is in a different room, same WiFi.) </p><p>I keep trying to fix 'Authentication method'.  Much of my energy is frustratingly lost by my changing passwords, looking them up in the Mail Content  page in Thunderbird, or trying to replace the passwords in the exercise of File--&gt;New--&gt;Existing Mail.  They match in the Mail Content vault, but are not accepted. </p><p>And yes, I have seen messages for BigKahuna appearing to invoke it as ""black listing"".  It might seem to be hitting some sort of malware.  The repetitive refusable of passwords seems to function that way since it thinks the IMAP password and SMTP password don't match. </p><p>Well, at this point I had better lay the keyboard down, in the hope that you might find something useful for old BigKahuna, if your patience is not worn out. </p>",luckau,false,0,0
