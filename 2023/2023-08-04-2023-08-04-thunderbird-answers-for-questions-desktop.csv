It's possible that the update might have caused some temporary syncing issues. To try and retrieve your missing email, you can go to the ""View"" menu, select ""Folders,"" and then click on ""All."" This should show you all your email folders, including any that might not be currently visible. If you still can't find the missing email, you might want to check your email provider's webmail interface to ensure the email is there.

I understand the convenience of having a dynamic refresh for folders. Unfortunately, Thunderbird doesn't offer an automatic refresh feature for folder views like you're describing. However, you can manually achieve a refresh by pressing the 'F5' key or right-clicking on the folder and selecting 'Mark Folder Read' and then 'Mark Folder Unread'.

It can be disappointing when updates don't align with our expectations. To revert to an earlier version, you can follow these steps: First, make sure to back up your data and settings. Then, uninstall the current version of Thunderbird. Next, download the desired older version from the official Mozilla Thunderbird website. Install it and select ""Customize"" during installation to prevent automatic updates. Remember that using older versions might pose security risks, so it's crucial to keep your email client up to date. I hope this helps improve your Thunderbird experience! </p>",suram080,false,2,7

You say they are apparently somewhat coy about price, this may be because they really have not yet developed the product they want to sell you in a years time. However,  Thunderbird can not replace your server as you suggest. </p><p>Thunderbird is a mail client,  so will not act as a server,  nor does the project provide an email address directly for those seeking one.  There are commercial arrangements in place where you can get an email address via mailfence or ghandi but it will cost you.  That is not necessary in my personal opinion for the average person. Free mail accounts work well except for those in business,  and even then I still get invoices from Gmail accounts. </p><p>As a general mail user, which I am guessing you are.  You are probably going to the best served by one of the free mail providers or really a couple of providers, as you have to have a password recovery email address for most of them.  The obvious choices for Australians are <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, Gmail and Yahoo because they have heard of them.  Personally I have all three along with GMX and AOL, all of them deliver what they say they will.  But I like to include GMX in the mix because unlike the US based providers. I like their privacy statement.  GMX is a subsidiary of a German company and as such is subject to German privacy laws,  some of the most strict in the world. But as I found out today you have to hold the alt key when you select to create an account with them or the pop up blocker in the browser makes a mess of the process.  I do suggest you look at them as a provider.  Not so popular in Australia,  but in Europe they are fairly well known. </p><p>In you migration you will have to consider a couple of things;   </p> <ul><li> If you existing account is configured as IMAP you will need to export any mail you wish to save as once the account goes dark with the provider the mail will be lost as it is synchronized to the mail server.  If your account is POP then that is not a consideration. </li><li> If you want your correspondents to know of your changed address,  you will need to tell them.  But do not fall foul of the SPAM laws about unauthorized contacts. <a href=""https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam</a>  Remember that using CC sends the email addresses to everyone on the mail.

However most companies do not have a reply address for email.
