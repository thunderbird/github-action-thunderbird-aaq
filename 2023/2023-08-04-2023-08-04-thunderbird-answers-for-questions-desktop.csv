It can be disappointing when updates don't align with our expectations. To revert to an earlier version, you can follow these steps: First, make sure to back up your data and settings. Then, uninstall the current version of Thunderbird. Next, download the desired older version from the official Mozilla Thunderbird website. Install it and select ""Customize"" during installation to prevent automatic updates. Remember that using older versions might pose security risks, so it's crucial to keep your email client up to date. I hope this helps improve your Thunderbird experience! </p>",suram080,false,0,1

I understand the convenience of having a dynamic refresh for folders. Unfortunately, Thunderbird doesn't offer an automatic refresh feature for folder views like you're describing. However, you can manually achieve a refresh by pressing the 'F5' key or right-clicking on the folder and selecting 'Mark Folder Read' and then 'Mark Folder Unread'. While this isn't as automatic as you'd prefer, it's a simple way to update the view to display unread folders. Hopefully, this workaround helps enhance your experience with Folder Modes in Thunderbird. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

No worries, we'll get it sorted out for you! It looks like the button isn't responding as expected when you first open Thunderbird, but it starts working after you delete a row using your keyboard's delete key. To fix this, you might want to try a simple workaround. Go ahead and try clicking on any other message or row first (you can use your mouse), and then click the ""Delete Current Row"" button. This might help to 'wake up' the button and get it working consistently. Give it a shot, and hopefully, that'll do the trick for you.

This should show you all your email folders, including any that might not be currently visible. If you still can't find the missing email, you might want to check your email provider's webmail interface to ensure the email is there. Sometimes, a re-indexing of Thunderbird's mailbox might also help.

The change in meeting time after accepting the invite could be due to a time zone conversion problem. To fix this, let's try a couple of things. First, ensure that both your Thunderbird and Windows 10 time zone settings are accurate and match your Europe/Prague time zone. Also, check if the sender's time zone settings are correct. If the problem persists, you might want to check if any add-ons or extensions in Thunderbird are affecting time zone settings. You can try disabling them temporarily to see if it makes a difference. Lastly, ensure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. </p>",suram080,false,0,1

I'm sending in case this would be helpful to you in identifying the reason I'm not able to send outgoing emails since the newest version of TB came out this past week. I can receive emails fine.  </p><p>I'll also be sending the info about my settings that you requested in your last note to me. Thanks.  </p><p>How to Set Up Spectrum Email on Third-Party Clients </p><p>Dear Spectrum Customer, </p><p>It's our pleasure to assist you. Here's some follow-up information we think you'll find useful after our recent discussion.  </p><p>You can easily set up Spectrum Email on your cell phone, laptop or other mobile devices. </p><p>To get started, make sure you have the following settings: </p><pre>   Username: Your full Spectrum email address </pre> <pre>   Password: Your Spectrum email password </pre> <pre>   SSL: On </pre> <pre>   Protocol: IMAP </pre> <pre>   Incoming Server Port: 993 </pre> <pre>   Outgoing Server Port: 587 </pre> <pre>   Requires Authentication: Yes, or checked </pre> <p>You'll also need to enter your incoming email server and outgoing email server. The server that allows you to send mail is the outgoing or SMTP server. The server that lets you receive mail is referred to as an incoming, POP or Mail server. Those will vary based on your domain, which is the part of your email address that follows the @ symbol, such as <a href=""http://charter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">charter.net</a>. </p><p>Mary </p>",marywithaquestion,false,0,0

So I can speak with facts not guesses. We need to look at the outgoing servers (SMTP) in your account settings. </p><p>so;  go to the more troubleshooting information on the help menu.

Thank you for taking your time to contact me.  </p><p>I'm sending this message to you via Spectrum webmail which is working fine for both incoming and outgoing email. At least I have this webmail to use as a workaround until I can figure out the outgoing mail glitch.  </p><p>The outgoing TB email ""block"" started this past week out of the blue, I believe about the time the newest TB automatically downloaded to my computer.  I have a new HP desktop computer as of this past January. I also have Best Buy Geek Squad support and Spectrum phone tech support but neither so far has been able to figure out the outgoing email glitch.  </p><p>My Spectrum phone tech support is wonderful. I'm speculating that Spectrum may be weary of its labor time and cost re to third-party email programs and may want to ""encourage"" their millions of customers to adopt Spectrum webmail. I can understand that, but I am a diehard fan of TB and want to be able to use this beautifully designed, user-friendly program for as long as possible.   </p><p>Matt, per your request, below is the error message I keep getting when I try to send outgoing emails via TB:  </p><p>Sending of the message failed. An error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded: &lt;maryinfantino@rochester.rr.com&gt; sender rejected. The email address you are sending as must match the email address you used to auth. Please check your SMTP settings. AUP#Out-1500. Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again. </p><p>I have tried to figure out exactly what this error message means by checking and double-checking all my email address entries, SMTP settings, migrating from POP to IMAP, and many other methods, but none of these have worked. </p><p>Matt, I understand that programs and systems are continually changing and that it sometime takes a while to aggregate enough user-reported problems to identify trends and then to implement fixes. I've spent many hours trying to figure out this problem on my own with Geek Squad and Spectrum support but we have all exhausted available resources and have reached a brick wall. Now I'm thinking I should stop doing this and wait a few weeks for designers to figure this out and in the interim use Spectrum webmail. What do you think?  </p><p>Thanking you in advance for your time and knowledge.  </p><p>marywithaquestion </p>",marywithaquestion,false,0,0

To retrieve your lost Address Books and second email address, you can try a few steps. First, make sure Thunderbird is closed. Then, navigate to your Thunderbird profile folder. You can find this by going to ""Help"" &gt; ""Troubleshooting Information"" in Thunderbird and clicking on ""Show Folder"" next to ""Profile Directory."" In the profile folder, look for ""abook.mab"" for your Address Books and ""prefs.js"" for your email settings. You might need to replace these files with your backups if you have them. As for the 'side by side configuration' error, try reinstalling Thunderbird or repairing the installation. If your PC was indeed corrupted, you might want to consider running a system check or getting professional help. </p>",suram080,false,0,2
