Ensure your installed antivirus is not scanning in the Thunderbird mail profile.

The mail is added,  the filter executes and the file is not there to update.   A simple exclusion for the mail and IMAP mail folders in defender fixed that issue.

It does, however, have an ""Allow List"", and I was trying to ask if they (exemptions list/allow list) are one and the same.
