I don't see an option to Delete the question, so instead I'll put the solution here at the top, in case others in the future have the same problem. Thanks. </p><p>SOLUTION: If using POP3, you must log onto your google account, and, in the settings area for POP and IMAP and such, there's a place where you need to tick ""Enable POP for all mail (even mail that's already been downloaded)"". Doing so will have Google send ALL your mail on the server more than just one time if you, for instance, uninstall and reinstall a mail client program, etc. (This is for POP3 usage). </p> <h6 id=""w_"">========</h6> <p>At Gmail I have 500+ emails from the last 5 years saved on Gmail's server -- that I want to KEEP there even if I ""delete"" them from a local mail client. </p><p>(1) Installed Thunderbird for the 1st time last night for Gmail. On my Gmail account both IMAP and POP3 are enabled, but when installing Thunderbird for the 1st time I selected POP3 because I want the emails NOT to be deleted off the Google server if I delete them from Thunderbird. </p><p>(2) Everything worked okay at first -- this first time I installed Thunderbird, it fetched all 500+ emails from my Google account, new and old. </p><p>(3) Then this morning Thunderbird said that it needed to compact my emails. At that point everything went wrong. A LARGE portion of my emails were NO LONG VISIBLE in my inbox even though they were ""there"". How do I know they were ""there""? I did a search/find -- one recent email that no longer showed up had ""broccoli"" in the subject (was only a few days old). It (along with dozens more emails) no longer showed in the Inbox. But when I did ""search"" for ""broccoli"" it found the email. But no matter what I did, that email, and dozens more, did not ""show"" in the inbox. </p><p>(4) Searching for answers, I tried things to fix it (including ""repair folder"") but no luck. Dozens or hundreds of emails were still no longer visible in my Inbox after the compacting (even though they could be ""found"" if I did ""search"" for words inside the email body or title). </p><p>(5) Nothing seemed to help, so I decided to first delete the account from Thunderbird, then uninstalled Thunderbird completely. After uninstalling it, I also DELETED the entire ""THUNDERBIRD"" folder in the ""Users/XXX/AppData/Roaming"" so that everything Thunderbird would (should) be completely uninstalled/deleted. </p><p>(6) Then I installed it again (again selecting POP3) -- but THIS time -- and for each time now I try doing the same thing (uninstalling everything thunderbird, including the appdata folder) Thunderbird will only fetch brand NEW emails -- but none of the 500+ I have on Gmail's server that it fetched the very first time (and I made sure I selected the same options as the first time). </p><p>Why? Why isn't it fetching read emails off Google's server, but only unread emails? It fetched them (all of them) the very first time I installed Thunderbird, but not any time after that, no matter how many times I delete the account from Thunderbird, then uninstall Thunderbird, delete the AppData Thunderbird folder, and re-install it. </p><p>For an experiment, after uninstalling everything again (including deleting the AppData Thunderbird folder) I installed it again, and this time -- just as a test -- selected IMAP instead of POP3. Doing that had Thunderbird download all 500+ emails correctly -- but I don't want IMAP because there's no setting on either Google or Thunderbird to retain emails on Google's server if they're deleted on Thunderbird (only options as to when they get deleted). With POP3, I have it so I can delete them off Thunderbird but they will still be left on Google's server. </p><p>After it worked with IMAP, I then did the whole uninstall &amp; delete the Thunderbird AppData folder, and reinstall it again selecting POP3 -- but again, only 1 NEW email that had come in during that time got fetched by Thunderbird -- none of the 500+ old emails that Thunderbird fetched with POP3 only the very first time I installed it. </p><p>Thunderbird fetched ALL emails using POP3 the very first time I installed the program, but then on subsequent uninstall/delete the AppData Folder/reinstall tries, it only fetches a new email that might come in, none of the 500+ it did the first time. </p><p>I don't see any option on my Gmail account page that would cause this (to work right on the 1st install but not subsequent ones). </p><p>Why is this happening? If I'm going to stick with Thunderbird I'm going to NEED to see a good portion of those 500+ emails in my inbox locally but I want POP3 instead of IMAP because I want to be able to delete them from Thunderbird but not have them deleted from the Google server. It worked the very first install (before compacting caused emails to disappear) but no time after that. Please help! </p><p>Thank you!
