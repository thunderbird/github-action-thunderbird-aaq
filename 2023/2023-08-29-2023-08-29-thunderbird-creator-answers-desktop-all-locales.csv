When I hover over it it says something like ""4 unread messages"". In TB 102, after I read all the messages, the red dot would go away until a new message came in, then the dot would come back and hovering would get ""1 unread message"" Now the red dot is always there after I read all my messages, and as more messages come in, the number goes up, so if I get 3 more messages, and hover over it, it says ""7 unread message"". This can't be right, but I can't find a setting in Windows 11 or Thunderbird that addresses it. Please advise if you can.

I used to use it quite a lot, as it is waaaay easier to remember that something arrived via email than remembering or simply going where I saved it. Now it’s almost always blank, there is a rather useless “clear list” button (as it is almost always blank already), and I have to look in the file manager for files. Is there some fix for it? I cannot find any setting regarding it. Something in about:config, maybe? </p><p>The expected behavior should be having a persistent list, from session to session, as there is already in Firefox. </p><p>I really struggle to understand the logic behind deleting the list by default, why this got changed over time, and if it is for privacy surely there should be some setting for the user? </p><p>This is the Linux (ubuntu) version of Thunderbird, 102.13.0 (64-bit) </p><p>Thanks in advance, elstellino </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",elstellino1

I presume I use manual configuration and change to <a href=""http://aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">aol.com</a> to find my TB data?
