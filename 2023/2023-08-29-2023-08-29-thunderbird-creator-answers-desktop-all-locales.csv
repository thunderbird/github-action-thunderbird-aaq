My old laptop died, could someone kindly let me know how would I find out if I had POP3 or IMAP settings in my TB Version 102.14.0. I have saved the Mozilla Thunderbird Folder from the old computer and I am trying to move data to a new laptop.  I believe I need this to make sure I use the correct setting so I do not delete my old TB data files.  2. I see TB saved info settings shows <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a> as host. I presume I use manual configuration and change to <a href=""http://aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">aol.com</a> to find my TB data? Thank you. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1600402;,mjconquest

I have followed the instructions for updating the password multiple times, and also confirmed that the password is correct.  Yet any time I try to send/receive email on my account in Thunderbird, I get a notification that my password isn't working.  Is there a fix for this, beyond following the Help instructions over and over, ad infinitum? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1600403;,jumblejim
