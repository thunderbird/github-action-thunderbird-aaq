This makes it very hard to use Thunderbird as the focus is constantly changing from the list of messages to another unwanted tab. I have also started seeing this problem in Zotero, which uses the same underlying interface as Thunderbird, so I believe it is a general problem impacting all applications that use that (XUL?) interface. This is not a mouse problem as I have seen this on two different computers using two different mice, one of which is connected to the computer via a cable. I also have not noticed this problem in any of the other applications I use, so it is limited to Mozilla apps (but I have not seen this in Firefox for whatever reason - I believe firefox no longer uses XUL, right?). </p><p>Thanks, David </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1582791;,dmkaplan2000

How do I stop this without deleting the actual account? (because if I do, I delete the entire database of emails associated with the account.).

At the moment, I get the message: ""Log in to account ""..."" failed."" and then three buttons - Enter new password, Cancel, Retry - but it doesn't stay concelled.  It just keeps nagging me.
