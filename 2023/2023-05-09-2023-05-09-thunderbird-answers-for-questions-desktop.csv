The accounts migrated beautifully but the folders for the accounts, although some were created, the contents for those folders did not migrate.

My Local Folders were not migrated at all - not the folders or the contents. All of the folders and contents are on my old computer.  Thunderbird still runs perfectly on my old computer even though the computer itself is very old, extremely slow and cannot be upgraded beyond Windows 8.1. If I can copy the files from my old computer straight to my new one I will do that, but the first part of the name is different, i.e. combination of numbers and letters before the actual name of the file is different. If that doesn't matter, or if I need to alter that to make the migration work, it will be easy. Please let me know. I don't want to break what worked if I can help it.

While I found the folder 'Thunderbird' in my Windows 7 PC in the 'Program Files' folder, not in the 'Appdata' folder, I was able to copy it directly to a thumb drive.  The Thunderbird folder is about 5.5GB size.  Then I turned on the Windows 10 PC, and looked for a similar folder.  I could not find any folder named 'Appdata\Roaming' on the new PC.  While not the current (102. release) of Thunderbird was present, there is a recent release. I got a message to update to the latest version, which I did do. </pre> <p>So, following your instructions, I found two folders relating to Thunderbird.  One is named Mozilla 'Thunderbird', the other is named 'Thunderbird'.  Using the Windows drag function, I hit on the thumb drive folder, 'Thunderbird', then dragged it to both the Mozilla Thunderbird folder and then to the Thunderbird folder on the 10 PC.  After making the copies, I opened Thunderbird on the PC.  NOTHING was there ..... only the initial folders which appear on the left side of the screen. </p><pre> So, I went to the Tools menu, clicked on the Import option.  I followed the prompts .... one option is to transfer the files from an external source.  I clicked on it, located the thumb drive and selected it.  When it showed in the window, I clicked on the Thunberbird folder, then pressed the Next button, and that's when I got an error message at the top, stating that there is a problem:  ""Import operation failed unexpectedly.  More information may be available in the Error Console."" </pre> <p>So, now I am no further along than I was before I started. </p><p>Furthermore, the 10 PC has one of my e-mail addresses listed, but when I tried to open it (in the 10 PC), instead a Gmail window opens asking for the e-mail address and the password.  The e-mail address that appears in the box is correct .... I've checked it several times, but when I type in the password, Gmail sends back a message that it's an incorrect password.  This is IMPOSSIBLE since I'm using this same e-mail address to converse with you, and I use it every day to converse with others, and I can  go to the native Gmail e-mail app, and it works there also.  So, WHY it doesn't allow me to open the e-mail address in Thunderbird on the 10 PC is a total mystery!!!! Please help!  I need to move off this 7 PC before it dies completely &amp; I lose all the important data that is stored on this PC. Finally, I'm going to have the same situation with FIREFOX, since that is my primary internet access application also, and based on these problems, I'm very fearful that I will have the same problems porting over all the web links that are in FIREFOX on the 7 to the 10. Thank you. </p>",KARL_TAUSCHEN,false,0,0

In my last post i said... </p><p>&gt;old events still often fail silently to duplicate </p><p>...so i was wondering how to uncover the ""silence"". I closed TB, then relaunched it from terminal, so i could watch for any relevant transcript entries when the failure occurs.  </p><p>I observed that nothing changes in terminal when i Copy either ""good"" or ""bad"" events, nor Paste ""good"" events [which do then duplicate], <strong>but</strong>... when i try to paste the ""bad"" events, a blizzard of text populates the terminal transcript.

Yes, as per my previous posts.
