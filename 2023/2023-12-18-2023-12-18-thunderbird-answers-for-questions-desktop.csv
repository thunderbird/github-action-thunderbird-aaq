Under the first, let's call it first@aaa.net, I have several identities set up  which include several gmail account addresses, and first@aaa.net is clearly marked as the default. The other two accounts have no additional identities and neither is marked as the default.  </p><p>TB never chooses any of the email account addresses or any address of my identities, used by the sending author. It ALWAYS forces me via a pop up box to select an address to use in my responses. Actually, it does show in the top line, From:, the identity to which the original email was addressed, however, I must nonetheless select (""Please select an identity to proceed:"") the address I wish to use before I can even start composing my response. This annoying failure began maybe a few months ago; it ticks me off and wastes my time. If it would simply always use my default account/email address, first@aaa.net, I could survive. Then I would only occasionally have to select which address to use in my response. But to be forced to ALWAYS select a responding address wastes my time and I find extremely irritating. </p>",lolaiii,false,0,0
