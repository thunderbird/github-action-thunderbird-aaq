We asked for examples of the problem, which you never provided. All we knew was that you couldn't send email, which seems to be a recurring problem for you. To work toward solutions on a technical forum, one must 1) maintain a single thread so all supporters can readily follow and contribute, and 2) provide requested information so persons here will be able to offer assistance. I am pleased you were able to resolve your  issue, and working face-to-face may work best for you. Others have had issues where they could not respond via email, so they used their online accounts to do so. On you comment about Thunderbird changing settings, it does NOT do that. I have used Thunderbird for two decades and the only changes have been done by me. I do regret we were unable to assist. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
