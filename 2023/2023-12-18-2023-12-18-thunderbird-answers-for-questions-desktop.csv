We asked for examples of the problem, which you never provided. All we knew was that you couldn't send email, which seems to be a recurring problem for you. To work toward solutions on a technical forum, one must 1) maintain a single thread so all supporters can readily follow and contribute, and 2) provide requested information so persons here will be able to offer assistance. I am pleased you were able to resolve your  issue, and working face-to-face may work best for you. Others have had issues where they could not respond via email, so they used their online accounts to do so. On you comment about Thunderbird changing settings, it does NOT do that. I have used Thunderbird for two decades and the only changes have been done by me. I do regret we were unable to assist. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The addressbook name is abook.sqlite. If you had a POP account, the account's email messages will be in the folder named Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; in the profile folder. Message folders have two names, such as inbox and inbox.msf. Give all of this information to the tech assistance person and your files can be copied to your current profile using the same same path shown above.  For the FUTURE, I suggest periodically creating backups of your PC when Thunderbird is not running. You can do that by  - exiting Thunderbird  - copying c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to an external drive, such as a USB stick - then, if you ever have to reinstall, the steps are  </p><pre>  - install thunderbird and exit   - copy the saved backup folder to c:\users\&lt;userid&gt;\appdata\roaming . This will overwrite the default setup       so you will be prompted to allow the overwrite.   - restart thunderbird and your data should be there. </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0

Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.
