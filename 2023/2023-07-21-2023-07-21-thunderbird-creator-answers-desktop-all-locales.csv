But about a month ago, Thunderbird began failing to connect to the server at startup. It happens most of the time, but not 100% of the time. As soon as I see the failure message pop up, I can go to Thunderbird and click Get Messages, and it retrieves them with no problem. I can see that I’m already connected to the internet when Thunderbird starts, so what could be causing these connection failures at startup? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",gf1701
