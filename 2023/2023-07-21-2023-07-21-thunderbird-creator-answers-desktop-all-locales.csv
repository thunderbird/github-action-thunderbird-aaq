EMAILS,"<p>The email <em>luciana@smjadvocacia.com.br</em> had all the emails deleted, they were not moved to any other folder, I attest to this because I checked myself, no folder contains the received emails. The emails were not deleted by the user's will, they simply disappeared from the ""Inbox"" and after that they were not found anymore. What should I do? Can you help me recover these emails? I'm not sure if there was a backup system in place, manually I am sure there was not, but if the system has an automatic backup it might be saved. These are very important emails, I can't be without them. </p><p>I await your return, thank you! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,pt-BR,"",audiencia

I'm running the same (current) version of TB on both computers. </p><p>I can't get my emails to move from one computer to another. I know, this sounds dumb, but it isn't; my email provider uses a weird hybrid of POP3 and IMAP, and just ""connecting"" didn't do the trick; in fact, adding my account to TB under 11 ate most of my emails on the server because the default TB/POP3 setting kills all old emails after 14 days. </p><p>Fortunately, my old emails still live on the Windows 10 computer because it DOESN'T do that. </p><p>I have tried export/import, but that doesn't work because my account is very old, very large, and creates a 5GB file. I've tried just MOVING it, but TB isn't picking up the old stuff correctly. </p><p>I'm pretty sure this is a TB 10/11 incompatibility for one simple reason: when I export just my address book from the 10 installation the import fails on the new (11) machine, BUT when I export it from another machine that's already running 11 I can import it on the new machine.  </p><p>How do I export mail from TB on 10 and import on 11&nbsp;? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1591979;,jeff236

I use TB for some years now and updated to the latest version 115 the other day and the installation worked fine. All my accounts are still there and synchronize as before. But when I switch to the grouped folder view I do not see any mails there in the inbox. No content from any of my accounts at all. Also I can not find any swith in the grouped inboxfolder settings that allows me to check if the accounts are ""in"" there. I hope that you have some ideas for me, what is going wrong and how I can fix it. I attach two screenshots that hopefully describe the issue sufficiently. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your support! </p><p>Oliver </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1591964;,hirschow

Most messages show up with a white background. I've tried adjusting the colors under composition, which doesn't do anything for the inbox emails. The only thing that makes a difference is if I change General&gt;Fonts &amp; Colors&gt;Colors&gt;and change the override to ""Always"", the inbox messages do turn dark as intended, but at the same time it applies a high contrast theme to the client, which is not what I'm looking for (undoubtedly better than nothing). I've tried using Dark Reader, but whenever I click on an email, it flashes white before it turns dark. Any help is appreciated! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1591969;,cademellein
