Videos up to ten minutes long(232MB) work perfectly while 15 minute videos(346MB) fail to upload to Dropbox with an [""Unable to upload 'Graphics Meeting.mp4'] to Dropbox"" popup.  There's plenty of space available on Dropbox and if I copy a large video directly to the Dropbox directory it uploads flawlessly. If Filelink has a max file size, I have no idea where to find it or how to increase it. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",DJM

I have tried to move, copy and paste, drag and drop but they will not copy to local. I have tried to move emails from other accounts but cannot do this either but have done before, I am not sure if this is related to the deleted account or if there is another issue. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1592034;1592118;1592157;,AussieDenis
