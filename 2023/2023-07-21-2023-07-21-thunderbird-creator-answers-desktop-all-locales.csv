Also I can not find any swith in the grouped inboxfolder settings that allows me to check if the accounts are ""in"" there.

I had to go back, and, also, restore my profiles folder. One of my accounts has some 100 folders in its directory, and, some 200 filters. I built this up over more than 10 years, and, relied on it for saving my mails. Also, the last time I did a major upgrade, firefox interfered with the profiles and I needed to work around that also. So, can someone guarantee me that the upgrade will mean that I can simply inmstall it and run it exactly as i do now?

I'd like to have my mail marked as un-read even after preview (in the preview pane), but marked as read after double-click (open email), reply / reply-all or forward. </p><p>The motivation for this BP is that I know I read the email, but it's still on my ""to-do"" list. </p><p>As you know TB's options are to mark as read immediately or after a given time period (basically the same regarding my BP). </p><p>Couldn't find an add-on for that. </p><p>It's extremely frustrating to have to manually mark as read each email. </p><p>Any idea?
