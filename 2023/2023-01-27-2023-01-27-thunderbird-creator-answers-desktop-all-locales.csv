Windows MAIL also works fine. Thunderbird Error is attached.  As FYI, I also tried disabling 2 factor authentication in Microsoft, in case that is the issue, but that didn't work either.  I also tried deleting and re-adding my outlook account in Thunderbird in case there was some new configuration on Outlook side that was not being captured in Thunderbird.  That didn't work either.

I was unable to get a backup with Windows or 3rd party backup programs. I started copying what I could, just straight copy/paste, nothing fancy. Yes, there's the possibility of corrupted files at any point during this process, though chkdsk, etc. say otherwise. Supposedly, all the bad sectors have been detected and walled off. 2) Did a clean installation of Windows 10 on the new drive and started copying in the stuff I had gotten from the dying drive. This specifically included my Thunderbird profile. Thunderbird itself is a clean, current install (102.6.1...or at least that's what downloaded the other day--it's now asking if I want to get 102.7). 3) When I run Thunderbird, there are no addresses in my personal address book. It seems to have ""collected"" a couple from emails that I have looked at, but that's all. There's no abook.mab or history.mab to be found. There are abook.mab.bak and history.mab.bak files. </p><p>So, I need my addresses and... </p><p>What I've tried: 1) As I said above, I copied over the entire profile from the dying drive. Presumably that should have included both abook.mab and history.mab files. I am assuming that they were corrupted and were not available to copy. Looking at the bad drive, they do not show up; only the *.bak files. 2) I tried renaming abook/history.mab.bak as *.mab. Didn't work. 3) I tried copying the .mab files from a backup I took a while back into my current profile. Didn't work. 4) I tried renaming abook/history.sqlite and restarting Thunderbird, per <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1306681"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1306681</a>. Didn't work. I lost even the few addresses that I had collected (yes, they came back when I deleted *.sqlite and re-renamed *.sqlite back to their original file names). Note that Thunderbird did not create new *.bak files the way the answer in 1306681 said would happen. The old *.bak files are still there (assuming that you guys aren't playing tricks with the date stamp on the old files...can't fathom any reason why you would). 5) I tried a few other things from the Support here, but don't have specific notes. Suffice it to say that none worked. </p><p>I've spent hours on this and have gotten nowhere. I note that the answers that I'm seeing here all have dates from at least a couple of years ago (or more). Has Thunderbird changed sufficiently that those older responses are no longer valid? Am I so short on sleep that I'm making newb mistakes? Have aliens infested my computer?
