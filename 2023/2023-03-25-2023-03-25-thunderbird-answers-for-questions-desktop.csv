All contacts imported! </p><p>To respond to Matt, the versions are the same, as you can see. </p><p>A simple macro can make the changes for you if you have a larger contact list.

This seems to be the right track, but it's prompting me for the password for ""username"" on <a href=""http://imap.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.aol.com</a> (where my username is correct)  AND a currently unchecked box to ""Use Password Manager to remember this password"" I don't know if #1 to enter my original password used to sign in online... OR... a 1 time APP generated password by AOL, as was necessary to setup the original PoP3? #2 ASSUME to Check the Password Mangaer box (I can't find any AOL Faqs on this, only the opposite of changing a IMAP to POP3 &amp; its not very helpful &amp; probably outdated) Thanks for the help! </p>",soly4fun,false,0,0

Last night immediately after setup I pasted in the AOL generated password (unkown if the time had expired) which it rejected &amp; then tried my on-line password also rejected.

My fix: was to change Outgoing <a href=""http://SMTP.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">SMTP.verizon.net</a> to SMTP.<strong><a href=""http://aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">aol.com</a></strong>. This then brought up additional Authentication Methods that now includeds OAuth2, which I selected.  The 1st time I sent, I was prompted with a different AOL screen to enter password - the screen looking as though it was direct from AOL &amp; as if I was logging into to my AOL on-line acct. So logged in with on-line acct password (there was no place to request password be saved). My email then sent. I immediately received an eM from AOL ""Your AOL account soly4fun@verizon.net was just used to sign in on Thunderbird AOL. If you did this, you’re all set.""  I closed TB. Reopened a short while later &amp; sent another eM. No password request was received &amp; mail sent. I then shut down, rebooted, opened TB &amp; forwarded an email, again no password request &amp; mail sent. Not knowing a thing about OAuth2, is this method actually sending my mail to/through AOL online site? I do detect a slight delay in the send, but perhaps that is normal when using a 3rd party email?? Thanks once again for all your time &amp; Help. Apologies to all for the wordiness. </p>",soly4fun,false,0,0
