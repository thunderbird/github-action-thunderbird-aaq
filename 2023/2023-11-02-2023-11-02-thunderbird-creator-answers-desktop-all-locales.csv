Now it is on the right click menu of an email.  I recently transferred a large number of emails from 2022, ~5000, from my inbox to another box I created. I've done this every year for a long time.  </p><p>Problem is that for this recent group of emails from 2022, none of them have the ability to right click and choose ""Open Message in Conversation"". It's there for every other folder except this new one I created.  Any help would be appreciated. thanks, todd </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615537;,todd31

I just added another work email and it is now trapped at the bottom of my left-hand account list below my Local Folders and Blog Accounts. This is NOT going to work. As many times as I've seen this mentioned on forums everywhere, there HAS to be the ability to manually sort your email accounts to show up in the order you want them to by now. No?  </p><p>BTW, going to ""Account Settings"" and dragging and dropping an email account where I want it in the list does NOT work. It shows up as it is right now without change. Restarting the program directly after making this change with or without going back to the main accounts tab does not result in it showing up correctly either.  </p><p>Thank you! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",Ltechs
