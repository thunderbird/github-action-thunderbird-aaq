When I got back to my computer I discovered that this had chewed through a lot of my files and I had many empty files including some which were archived in Thunderbird so should have been saved on my computer. No problem I thought, I will undelete files using webmail but when I went into Gmail webmail I found that I didn't have many messages left. In my backup file which I checked in Thunderbird offline, I had about 24,000 messages but could only find about 4,000 on the webmail account. As soon as I went online with Thunderbird, the messages in my backup began deleting to match the online situation. So I have a number of questions. </p><p>How did deleting the All Mail file on my phone somehow affect my archived messages stored in Thunderbird in my local files? I suspect they are part of the same string that makes up All Mail but should somehow be separated. </p><p>Notwithstanding that issue, the main problem is how I can use my back up to repopulate the online Gmail string so I don't continually get the truncated Gmail which is revealed in my webmail. Is it possible to reverse ImapMail so that the web Gmail matches my backup rather than the usual reverse situation? In the meantime, I can use my account at the cost of losing messages every time I go online but I need to recover from this situation fast. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615650;1615793;1615859;1615969;,electric.cyclist

Shared email folder (and subfolders) between two different computers/profiles,"<p>G'day all, </p><p>I've search high and low but haven't been able to find anything that addressed this use case:  </p><p>""My spouse and I have different computers, different email addresses and different TB (v115) profiles. We would like to create a 'shared' folder (with subfolders) that we keep common stuff in. The shared folders would sync over the local network."" </p><p>Currently, at home, we have a NAS that is running an IMAP server and we can use that. But when we are away from home that doesn't work. Having a solution that syncs over the local network would be the best solution as that would work anywhere; even if we are both using a phone as a hotspot. </p><p>I know we could create a cloud based IMAP account but we don't want to keep this personal information in the cloud so that is not an option. </p><p>Are there any add-ons or other methods to do this?  </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615763;,4e2zh8x7

On one of them, something has gone wrong.  I accidentally clicked on a .themepack file and the theme didn't work correctly afterwards.  I eventually got to a point where I could access Personalize and go back to the previous theme.  The system appeared to be working after that, but as a precaution I went back to a system restore point from well before this event happened.  After that, everything on the system worked correctly EXCEPT Thunderbird.  When I start it I don't get any errors, but it's all blank.  The menu bar is visible, and the get message line, but the folders panel and the panel where there should be mail messages  are completely blank.  Pulling down ""Tools"" and selecting ""Settings"" does nothing.  Oddly, I can access ""Account Settings"", and they look o.k.  I can also pull down ""Help"" and get the Troubleshooting information, and it pointed to the correct profile. I don't see how changing themes could be the actual cause of the Thunderbird problem, as everything else on the system is working but I mention it because I had to do a shutdown and reboot and let the system force Thunderbird and other programs to stop. </p><p>I have tried all of the fixes I could find in other notes, and none of them worked.  Changing the name of global-messages-db.sqlite and restarting didn't help. I can start in troubleshooting mode and disable add-ons, but that doesn't help, and I don't have instructions on what to do once I'm in trouble shooting mode. I also tried starting it with -safe-mode, which also didn't help. </p><p>So I tried brute force.  I de-installed and reinstalled Thunderbird and convinced it to use the old profile, but that doesn't work.  I finally de-installed Thunderbird and used RevoUninstall to make sure everything in the directory and all folders and files were removed.  I then copied my profile from my other working system (both Local and Roaming), did a clean install of Thunderbird, used the profiles that should be good as they were from a system that is still working, but even that hasn't fixed the problem.  (I've copied the profiles between systems before at least twice and got them to work, so I'm reasonably sure I copied them correctly this time). </p><p>I can't imagine what else could possibly be keeping Thunderbird from starting correctly.  At this point I'll accept any suggestions or even wild guesses as to what I should to do next. I have a lot of my mail stored in folders, and I'd really hate to have to redo everything from scratch, especially as I should be able to copy profiles as I have done before. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1615697;1615700;1615703;1615721;1615785;1615789;1615791;1617159;,bartzlederman
