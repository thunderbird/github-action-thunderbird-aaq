When I got back to my computer I discovered that this had chewed through a lot of my files and I had many empty files including some which were archived in Thunderbird so should have been saved on my computer. No problem I thought, I will undelete files using webmail but when I went into Gmail webmail I found that I didn't have many messages left. In my backup file which I checked in Thunderbird offline, I had about 24,000 messages but could only find about 4,000 on the webmail account. As soon as I went online with Thunderbird, the messages in my backup began deleting to match the online situation. So I have a number of questions. </p><p>How did deleting the All Mail file on my phone somehow affect my archived messages stored in Thunderbird in my local files? I suspect they are part of the same string that makes up All Mail but should somehow be separated. </p><p>Notwithstanding that issue, the main problem is how I can use my back up to repopulate the online Gmail string so I don't continually get the truncated Gmail which is revealed in my webmail. Is it possible to reverse ImapMail so that the web Gmail matches my backup rather than the usual reverse situation? In the meantime, I can use my account at the cost of losing messages every time I go online but I need to recover from this situation fast. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",electric.cyclist
