On a top-level account folder, I have a folder called PURCHASE, under this, I have about 45 entries of sub-folders. The fact that the top folder shows 4 to read, they do not show. I've waited at least 30 minutes, they don't appear. I then have to open each sub-folder to find the one with a new email. This does not happen all the time. (just most). Any idea what can cause this? NOTE: If I switch on the 'Show total message count' it happens more often. </p><p>W10 Pro Fully updated. Regards Princy557 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1602210;,Princy557

The program locks up, I get the spinning beach ball, and I have to force quit to close it. Letting it sit for an extended time has no impact. </p><p>If I start Thunderbird without an internet connection it behaves normally. Once it goes online and attempts to download email, it locks up.  </p><p>If I start in Troubleshoot Mode it works normally. No problems at all. I don't appear to have any add-ons or extensions running, so I don't understand why this is fixing things. I have been running Troubleshoot Mode exclusively for the past year successfully. </p><p>- I had read a previous post about disabling Thunderbird's access to Contacts in System Preferences, I tried that, no luck. - No luck with changing ldap_2.servers.osx.dirType from 3 to -3 - Oddly if I change the theme from Dark to Light, or Light to Dark, Thunderbird will sometimes launch normally and function for several hours. The problem then returns. </p><p>I'd really like to get this functioning normally again, any help is appreciated. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1602216;,andrewnelles
