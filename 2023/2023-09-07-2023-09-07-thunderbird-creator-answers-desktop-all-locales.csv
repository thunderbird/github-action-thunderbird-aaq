Since the jump in versions was so dramatic, I did a quick search which revealed that an auto update to v115 wouldn't be available from v102 or prior - a manual download and install would be necessary.  However, when I check for the update manually and it shows it's available, clicking the update button begins the download and install process. Is this intended functionality?  I want and need a smooth upgrade/update process which won't result in loss of data or complications with my email. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",brothermoon

The font that continues to appear is a basic courier style.  </p><p>I've saved a pdf of various emails, with the first few being the current view I get and that recipients would see. The second last page is a copy from a previous ""sent"" email with my signature block, and the last page with a ""reply"" ready to go to that 2nd last page where the loss of formatting is very obvious. I would like to upload these but I'm not able to as it is not an 'image"" file. </p><p>Any help to try and work out what has happened and how to fix it would be very much appreciated. </p><p>Cheers. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",annesch1

Seemed to go fine. But when I send a test message to my other (gmail) account, it does not arrive there but arrived in my Thunderbird/Outlook account. Must be a setup problem, but where?
