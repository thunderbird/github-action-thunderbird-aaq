These folders are gone, and all of the emails in them as well. </p><p>I don't know what kind of folders they were. Probably, they were subfolders of 'Local Folders', maybe they were just filters. The 8 email accounts listed are partly POP, partly IMAP. </p><p>Some (5) extensions are installed, but all of them are disabled since long. </p><p>Is it possible get the folders back? Or at least the mails? And if it is possible, then how? </p><p>Thanks, </p><pre>Rainer </pre>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rgoellner

The program locks up, I get the spinning beach ball, and I have to force quit to close it. Letting it sit for an extended time has no impact. </p><p>If I start Thunderbird without an internet connection it behaves normally. Once it goes online and attempts to download email, it locks up.  </p><p>If I start in Troubleshoot Mode it works normally. No problems at all. I don't appear to have any add-ons or extensions running, so I don't understand why this is fixing things. I have been running Troubleshoot Mode exclusively for the past year successfully. </p><p>- I had read a previous post about disabling Thunderbird's access to Contacts in System Preferences, I tried that, no luck. - No luck with changing ldap_2.servers.osx.dirType from 3 to -3 - Oddly if I change the theme from Dark to Light, or Light to Dark, Thunderbird will sometimes launch normally and function for several hours. The problem then returns. </p><p>I'd really like to get this functioning normally again, any help is appreciated. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",andrewnelles

Since the jump in versions was so dramatic, I did a quick search which revealed that an auto update to v115 wouldn't be available from v102 or prior - a manual download and install would be necessary.  However, when I check for the update manually and it shows it's available, clicking the update button begins the download and install process. Is this intended functionality?  I want and need a smooth upgrade/update process which won't result in loss of data or complications with my email. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",brothermoon
