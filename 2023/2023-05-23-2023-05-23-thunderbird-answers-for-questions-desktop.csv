These are index files used by Thunderbird and they do NOT have any emails.  If you have an imap account and only see .msf files, (there are no mbox no extension files) it means you did not synchronise folders and do not have any copies of emails downloaded. You may aslo see some Folders with a.sbd extension. These are created when you create subfolders. These .sbd folders may also contain mbox files. </p><p>If you want to see those emails stored in the mbox no extension files then you need to get copies of them pasted into the 'Local Folders' mail account which is located in the 'Mail' folder. </p><p><strong>Info below on how to do this manually:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird </li><li> In Windows bottom search type: %Appdata% </li><li> Select the '%Appdata%' file folder </li><li> Select 'Roaming' </li><li> Select 'Thunderbird' folder  </li><li> Select 'Profiles' folder </li><li> Select 'profile name' folder </li><li> Select the 'Mail' folder </li><li> If you had previously used a pop account then maybe it has all those mbox files still intact, so right click on that pop account name folder and select to open in a new window - . </li></ul> <ul><li> Back in 'Mail' window </li><li> Select 'Local Folders' folder </li></ul> <p>Leave this window open on 'Local Folders' folder because this is where you need to paste copies of your mbox no extension files (and also copies of any .sbd folders). You cannot paste thes files into an imap mail account nor an exchange account. </p><p>If you did not open the pop account in another window, but want to use the backup you made: In a separate window - locate the backup copies of mbox no extension files. </p><p>Get copies of all mbox no extension files and also any .sbd folder and paste them into the 'Local Folders' folder.

My profile seems to have changed or corrupted - probably when I was compelled to update Import/Export Tools NG. I have Thunderbird set up as IMAP but also Windows Live Mail as POP. I have 6 individual email accounts.  Until now for years I have been able to copy messages into Local Folders on Thunderbird for storage but I have also been able to drag a copy directly into WLM from Inbox, Sent, Draft, Local Folders or wherever. Suddenly, although I can still copy into Local Folders on Thunderbird, I cannot drag or copy directly into WLM.  See question 1427638.  This is causing me problems. <em>(I use TB &amp; WLM because of the problems incurred when needing to frequently open, review &amp; amend attachments in TB which creates non-auto-deleting PID folders. I have many thousands of stored messages which I need to frequently review)</em> I attach screenshots of IMAPMail and Mail folders currently. I have compared these with the same folders in a copy of the profile I made in September (when I WAS able to perform direct copying to WLM) and they appear to have the same contents.  I also include screenshot of contents of one sub folder of IMAPMail (<a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>) to give an indication of the folders therein <em>(In addition to the profile folder indicated in my screenshots, I also have C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\r9gblr06.default but that only contains parent.lock and times.json)</em> All the stored copies in Local Folders are still present in TB. I can still copy new emails to Local Folders - AND to external media - but not directly to WLM as of very recently. I am uncertain whether replacing my existing profile with the older one I made in September (which is how I found this question &amp; response) will resolve the issue.  Also I don't know whether this would lose any mail I had copied to storage since I made the September profile copy. According to Settings I have everything synchronised. I don't fully understand whether I could or should try &amp; apply the method given in above Toad Hall response as my TB is IMAP to try &amp; get back the ability to copy directly from TB to WLM. I would very much appreciate help in providing a method which will restore my ability to copy directly from TB to WLM. </p>",joycembrett,false,0,0

Being reluctant to do an un-install and re-install I decided to wait for the upgrade, expecting an install would be required for what looks to be a major change..  As it turns out the upgrade will be done piecemeal over a period of time and possibly without the need to do a complete install.  I returned to searching for additional  suggestions for my problem.  One thing I have seen a number of times is the recommendation to not perform an un-install/re-install since that is most likely not going to resolve the issue.  That being the case, I assume the problem lies in the profile dataset.  Does anyone have suggestions as to what I might look for or where and how I should try to find something in my profile.

I went to take a look, something I haven't done in the past.   There were entries from as far back as 3 years.  As I was trying to get through the log, the system seemed to be bogging down.  It wasn't accepting any input.  I decided to clear the log but nothing seemed to happen.  I left the system thinking there might be a lot of clean up.  A half hour later nothing appeared to have changed - there were still the same entries on my screen.  I gave it another half hour and when it seemed like nothing changed I decided to shut TB down.  I re-started TB and went to the filter log.  It was empty/cleared.  TB still didn't accept input.  I checked task manager (TM) and found TB taking up more and more memory as well as CPU time.  I watched the numbers climb.  Decided to let it go to see what would happen.  I watched it for 5 minutes.  Memory use went from the usual 260MB to 1.15GB with CPU at as high as 47%.
