I am surprised you haven't gotten an email from the host saying you email account is near full.  </p><p>You may have to actually; </p><p>1. Log into the email servers account to delete all of the emails you thought you deleted through Thunderbird, and while at it check the other folders there. Sometimes there are folders on the email servers that aren't shown through Thunderbird. </p><p>2.  Control what happens when you delete an email through Thunderbird.  Go to <strong>ACCOUNT SETTINGS - SERVER SETTINGS</strong> under your email account in Thunderbird and look for <strong>When I delete a message:</strong>  I set this to ""Move it to this folder""  and set the folder to ""Trash on ~MyEmailsTrashFolder~.  But you will have to empty that from time to time.  </p><p>Have you emptied your folder called ""Deleted""? </p><p>3. You are keeping a lot of folders in your email account. That's good if you need to access them from anywhere and any system. I only need to access then from my Home computer after a while, so I create <strong>LOCAL</strong> folders for organization and drag them off the server and save them locally.  This reduces my need to get online.  </p><p>You seem better than me at limiting the # of folders too. Good Job haha. I JUST created a NEW Profile to clean up things... </p><p>Having everything saved locally, seems to make Thunderbird faster for me too, as I don't have to go online to see them.

Around the date you asked the question 123-reg were changing over their email servers, not just a server swap but a migration to a <strong>new email service</strong>.  My understanding is email accounts from the old service are being migrated to the new service.  Between old servers and new servers, server settings POP, IMAP, SMTP are changing (I am unsure if the change affected user passwords). </p><p>Using a browser, can you login to 123-reg webmail directly?  If so check which service you are using and check you have the correct settings for this service. </p><p>If you need to re-configure Thunderbird for a new service, you may need to re-post as a new queary, to correctly understand how to move your account, and Thunderbird settings, forward. </p>",firefox2355,false,0,1

However, on the phone with 123-reg, I was told to set up as generation one. (If that is the question). They have extensively tried to help me set up in TB. Yes, I can access emails on their webmail. This verifies that the password at least is correct and that the issue is within Thunderbird. </p>",robp100,false,0,0
