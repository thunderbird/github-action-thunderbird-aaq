The same success for both Inbox/Sent emails. </p><p>This week the snag has occured with both Inbox/Sent i.e. that drag &amp; drop removes an email but does not deliver it to the appointed file.  Similarly with right-click: the emails it does move do not stay in the files, they quickly go missing. </p><p>Hope this clarifies the snag. </p><p>Kind regards, Tim </p>",timsimpson320,false,0,0
