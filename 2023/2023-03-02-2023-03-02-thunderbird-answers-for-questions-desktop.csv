Sometimes it due to an email the server put into junk/Spam. </p> <ul><li> Logon to your webmail account via a browser. </li><li> Empty the server 'Junk/Spam' folder  </li><li> In Thunderbird, use 'Get Messages' to see if emails start coming in properly. </li><li> If still no joy...back in the webmail account look in the Inbox for the email that keeps repeatly being  downloaded to Thunderbird and delete it. </li><li> In Thunderbird, use 'Get Messages' to see if emails start coming in properly. </li></ul> <p><br> You say they can be late, but Thunderbird can only download if the emails have been received on the server.  If they are late getting to the server, then that is not a Thunderbird issue. The emails may been delayed at any point. To check out received times: Select email so you can read contents. Click on the 'More' button and select 'View Source' The 'Received: from' info will mention the various servers and the times received by each sever. The one at the top being the last server which has your account - the one nearer to the 'FROM, TO, Subject headers will be the oldest/first server which would tell you when it was first sent.  Please note if email is being passed around various continents then the times will be accurate for the location.  For example: I got an email from someone in Thailand Date: Sun, 5 Feb 2023 14:56:40 +0700 After sending the first server received&nbsp;: 04 Feb 2023 23:56:51 -0800 (PST) My server - the one at the top got email:  5 Feb 2023 07:56:51 +0000 Thunderbird converts the date/time based on my computer settings, so in Thunderbird Date header is:  5 Feb 2023 7:56AM </p><p>Although it was nearly 3pm in Thailand when it was sent, in the UK it was nearly 8am, so I actually got the email almost immediately after it was sent. But that email first went to the USA which time wise looked like it had somehow gone back in time to a previous day. Had I lived in the USA that might look weird getting emails before the day had been created&nbsp;:) So time and date is relative. It might look like a delay based on a Date, but it might not be in reality. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If you compare to a car, the domain name would be the license plate allowing access to the internet, and the car would be the email service provider. Thunderbird could then serve to provide the email access and maintenance from your PC. Okay, that analogy isn't perfect, but the best I could think of quickly. Once you have the email service provider, you can set it up with Thunderbird, which is free. What you would need would be the incoming server name, the outgoing server name, and basic setup info, such as port number and authentication protocol, which the email provider would give to you. In speaking with them, you would want to be assured that their service is accessible from an email client and not just via a web service. I don't know qualify of services of any email providers, but I did notice this URL offers cheap email hosting:  <a href=""https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/email/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/email/</a>   as does this one: <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/workplace/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zoho.com/workplace/</a>   or Google's product at  <a href=""https://workspace.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://workspace.google.com/</a>    </p><p>But you may wish to use a search engine and look for  ""email host"" as all I did was list a few examples. Neither this forum nor Mozilla takes any responsibility for what choices users make regarding domain registrars or email providers. Be aware, some sites will want to sign you up for a website host. You don't need that for just email. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

For Thunderbird to work, the profile must be the one that Thunderbird expects. After it starts with one that it knows, you can then import one of your choice. My guess is the profiles.ini is not pointing to the one you pasted in. There are ways to fix that, but I suggest you take the 'easy' way out and  - uninstall thunderbird - delete the thunderbird folder at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming - reinstall thunderbird - start thunderbird and press the ALT key to bring up the menu - click tools&gt;import&gt;import from another thunderbird installation - select the recovered profile </p><p>If this does not work, it means there is corruption within the profile, not uncommon since you experienced  problem during backup. (TIP: whenever doing backup with third-party software, be sure to NOT be running Thunderbird during the backup, as that virtually guarantees a corrupted profile.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

When I was recovering the Thunderbird files, I could see the different email folders I had created so I know that some of the information is still there. I decided to experiment with a myriad of combination of recovered files pasted into the ""Profile"" folder. I had a bit of success with one file and it brought up the names of all of my email addresses, but nothing else. I decided to try one last thing and I went through the recovered files and found the ""Profile"" folder with the largest files in it. I copied the contents of that folder and pasted it under the existing Profile folder (after deleting its contents). That brought more success in that my emails all were actively loading new emails and the calendar was working too. I still don't the emails that were already received before the back-up issue.  </p><pre>Do you know of a way that I can now transfer the emails previously received to the new installation?

As far as I can tell, any ""new"" email has downloaded. What I am hoping for  is that there is a folder I can copy and paste into the existing ""Profile"" folder so that I can have my old folders/existing emails back. When searching for the lost files, I could see the file names as they were being recovered (I could read the name of the different email folders I had created in Thunderbird). This leads me to believe that they are somewhere, but I am only guessing. I appreciate your help and I apologize for not using the correct terminology or explaining myself clearly. This computer stuff is not my forte. </pre> <p>Thanks again, Bob </p>",julytf2030,false,0,0

For some reason, the folders and emails saved in the Gmail account were all from 2 or 3 years ago, but nothing recently. There are no folders or emails from the last few years.  I decided to try one last thing to find the lost emails in Thunderbird. I don't like Microsoft Outlook, but I loaded it on my computer and tried to use it to recover the lost TB emails. I tried a few different imports and none of them worked. I surrendered and I entered all of my email addresses and passwords into Outlook and it loaded several thousand emails on the laptop. I will go through them and file them over the next few days.  </pre> <pre>Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate your willingness and availability to help.
