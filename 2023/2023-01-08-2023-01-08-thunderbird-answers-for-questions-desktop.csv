If you have been asking about the ""Internal Server Error"" that appears when you try to open an attachment, reply to an email or similar actions, please note: </p><p>This is a bug caused by an update that Microsoft rolled out over the weekend to some (but not all) of their Office365 servers. This is a server problem. However, we are working on it. Not all users are affected, and our test accounts work fine, which makes fixing the problem harder. </p><p>If you wish to help with the solution, you can 1. go to Thunderbird | Tools | Developer tools | Developer Toolbox | tab Network. 2. Then after, trigger the problem again. 3. You will see lines appearing in the Developer Toolbox. Select the line with status ""500"" 4. then right-click on that line, and in the context menu, select Copy | Copy all as HAR 5. Finally, paste the ""HAR"" into an email and send it as reply to your support message that you just sent us. </p><p>If you have any other pertinent information that might help us to isolate, narrow down, or fix the problem, we'd be grateful for any information that helps to fix the bug. Given that we do not see the bug on our system, we are dependent on your help. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help and your understanding! </p><p>Owl developer team </p>",jaswartz55,false,0,0

As a result your link doesn't learn me anything new, personally. Thanks anyway.   But when you say that removing and reinstalling Thunderbird in Windows won't help,  that's something I wasn't aware of.  Do I have to suppress manually some files or some profile somewhere?   Tell me please what I could do, in your view,  if I can, in order to get out of this situation and to use Thunderbird again on my desktop PC.  (I'm absolutely  NOT ""hijacking"" somebody else PC!)  I repeat that I don't have any problem about IDs/ passwords of my different emails.   I should have pay much more attention when typing my new password, no doubt.  BTW, guys, take much much care when modifying any password!  TB still works normally on my other PC, my laptop. Of course, I didn't do any mistake when modifying the Password on this PC.     I prefer TB to the web pages, though not for all my emails, it's simply a question of comfort. To tell you everything, I have an old glasses issue since a while, and that makes me do a lot of errors&nbsp;:( Thank you Matt. </p>",misterpascal,false,0,0

My laptop is in French. </p><p><strong>A small advice to people</strong>: When changing a password <strong>anywhere </strong>proceed only by copy-paste, don't type directly. Open, for example, ""Notepad"" and type the password in clear. You see what you are typing. You will avoid what happened to me.  And, by the way, when changing the ""master password"" in a password manager, in case of mistake you can lose completely the access to your vault and there's  no way out!
