I will assume you have a typical setup, either a laptop or reasonable size desktop. To get a feel for this, the basic settings are at settings&gt;general .  The default font may appear as 14 or 16 (not sure on this) but, whatever it is, increase it by 2, so that if it had be 14 it will now be 16. Then click the 'advance tab' and set all numbers shown to that number.  Next, look at top of pane and you will likely see 'Latin' or 'Other Writing Systems.' Click the menu and select whatever was the one not shown. On that screen, set the numbers to be IDENTICAL to the other. When done, the Latin pane and the Otherwritingsystems pane should look alike. Now view one of the messages. If the screensize increased, then we're on the right track. If still too small, just repeat the above with a higher number.

How do I find out how to change the font in the inbox, I'm retired and almost 80 years old and my eyes aren't as good as they used to be.  I live on a fixed income and I haven't donated much money to Mozilla but have continued to use Firefox &amp; Thunderbird even when I couldn't access some location because those locations didn't support it.   I stayed with Mozilla because I wanted to support the efforts of a young startup.    After reading your very helpful reply I can tell you one thing for sure.

This is a different version than the one I had, which I cannot tell you what version it was since I lost some of my app exe folder.  </p><p>When I click on Get Messages, I get the error msg attached and also this version does not allow you to get separate accts.   </p><p>OH WAIT, I see where you can right click on each server name and get messages.  It works for my comcast accts, which are IMAP, but this error msg is coming from my Gmail, which I DO use a POP and I think I read that it might now work in the new release. </p><p>Is the older version available? somewhere?  I am sorry, I looked and first I do not know what the latest version before this was and how to get it.  I looked it up.  IDK why the documentation is so confusing to me.  Please let me know.  I am almost done.  But just with this problem.  When you lose a drive that has been in use for 12 or more years and it is all not backed up, this ""can"" happen.  Is it V102?  I don't remember.  Thanks! </p><p>Sorry again...I found this one: mozilla-thunderbird-102.5.0-installer_9-lEZP1.exe.  I guess I will start all over.  Don't take any time at all. </p>",smsterling99,false,0,0

The only thing that happened is that I got an error msg (see pic) on the 2nd thru 4th change (includes the Storage, which I did not realize I had to do, but they were not there, and then I did that one too...LOL).  It does not seem to have hurt anything?   </p><p>Also it seems that I lost some of the display formatting of the email entries, but I know how to fix that.  This was only temp as my pc is still a mess, but at least I know how to do it now, which I will be doing when everything settles down with my pc. </p><p>THANKS SO MUCH AGAIN.  HAVE A GREAT DAY AND BE SAFE! </p>",smsterling99,false,0,0

Now, if you have the C backup, and if Thunderbird is already installed, copy this from the backup: the folder that was at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to that same location on the new C drive (do this when thunderbird is NOT running.) That should recall what you had prior to your recent delete.  Now, take the E backup and copy the account data folders to wherever. Now, start thunderbird, click the accountsetting page and on the 'server settings' page, click the 'Local Directory' link at bottom of pane and select the folder where you copied account folder from E backup. If I'm understanding your prior setup, the data folders should now appear. Repeat this for each account. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

The address book and the accounts are there, but there are NO email/storage folders showing.  Now I think I made it worse.  It told me to uninstall and delete the Thunderbird folder on C, and I did, and then NOTHING came up.  I do have the original ""system stuff"" on C backed up and I do have the Whole external (not on C) folder intact with the data and profiles. </p>",smsterling99,false,0,0
