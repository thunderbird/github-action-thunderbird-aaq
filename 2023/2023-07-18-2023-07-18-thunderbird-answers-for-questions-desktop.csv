If you saved all messages in SENT folder, and if you know a good tech expert, that individual might be able to scan/extract many of the email addresses from the file using regular expressions. But that's over my meager regex skills. Good luck, and I hope a better idea surfaces from another. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
