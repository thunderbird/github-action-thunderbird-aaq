I will assume you have a typical setup, either a laptop or reasonable size desktop. To get a feel for this, the basic settings are at settings&gt;general .  The default font may appear as 14 or 16 (not sure on this) but, whatever it is, increase it by 2, so that if it had be 14 it will now be 16. Then click the 'advance tab' and set all numbers shown to that number.  Next, look at top of pane and you will likely see 'Latin' or 'Other Writing Systems.' Click the menu and select whatever was the one not shown. On that screen, set the numbers to be IDENTICAL to the other. When done, the Latin pane and the Otherwritingsystems pane should look alike. Now view one of the messages. If the screensize increased, then we're on the right track. If still too small, just repeat the above with a higher number.
