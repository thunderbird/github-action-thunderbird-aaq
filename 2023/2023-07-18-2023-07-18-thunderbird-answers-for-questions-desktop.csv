Try that and see if TB connects to <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>.  For what it's worth, Hotmail works fine here with 115/W11.  Check also that cookies are accepted in TB Settings, so that the OAuth2 process can complete. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I tried to change it back to Normal Password - it started working.  I guess the settings got messed up during the upgrade. Thanks for the suggestion. </p>",arcadiev,false,0,0
