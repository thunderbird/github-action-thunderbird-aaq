Older people's eyes sometimes have trouble with smaller things, especially when they're just grey (the things, not the eyes). That may be why sfhowes added some orange to the script he gave to the QO. </blockquote> <p>Thanks for adding this context. </p>",elizabethmitchell,false,0,0

You have to create a folder (easy), create two text files -- userChrome and userContent (easy), copy and paste some text into one of the text files and some other text into the other text file (easy), make sure you save the text files with the correct extension (.css) (easy), place the two text files in the folder you created in your ""profile"" folder, which is easy to locate using  Help &gt; More Troubleshooting Information &gt; Profile Folder &gt; Open folder (which puts you in File Explorer, and you should then close Thunderbird before you proceed with the folder creation and the making of the two files), and you're laughing all the way to the bank.  The worst that can happen is that you make a mistake and so nothing at all changes when you re-open Thunderbird.  C'mon, give 'er a try. Maybe print out the sfhowes reply above and this reply and then follow them step-by-step.  [I'm only half serious here: if you don't want to try it, nobody can fault you for that.

Where is the More Troubleshooting option located in the Help menu?  Is it under Troubleshooting Mode or Troubleshooting Information?  Either way, I'm not seeing it. C.

Do these instructions apply to other operating systems besides Windows?  (Yes, Virginia, there are other operating systems, lol!) E.  Isn't the scrollbar width controllable by a Thunderbird setting?
