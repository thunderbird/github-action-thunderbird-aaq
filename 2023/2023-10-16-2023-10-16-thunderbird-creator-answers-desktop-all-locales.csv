About 7:15 PM while reading through my emails, Thunderbird disappeared and I got a blue screen message that an error had occurred, but before I could read further, my PC went blank.  The power light was still on, so I waited several minutes, but nothing was happening (no restart).  I did a manual shutdown and rebooted.  The system seemed to load normally.  I went back to Thunderbird to pick up where I left off on the emails.  The list of emails was there, but when I clicked on the next one in the queue, nothing happened.  A double click opened a blank page, not the email.  I checked a few others, and the same thing happened.  This was with my main email account from Optimum.  I checked my other accounts (AOL and gmail), and they appear unaffected; emails opened normally.  I sent an email to the Optimum account from both of the others, and they opened normally.  After some checking, this ""blank page"" situation seems to start with emails in the inbox from 9/21/2023 and continue to today (10/15/2023) at around 7:15 PM.  Older emails are still there.  I have many folders for old emails, and I checked several of them. The old emails are still there, including ones between 9/21 and 10/15.  All the blank emails from today seem to be OK when downloaded on Windows Mail.  I signed into my Optimum account online, and all the emails seem to be there.  This all seems very strange.  I would hope there is some way to repopulate these blank emails. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",hasmort
