By exploded, I mean that the size of the screen is larger than my computer screen (computer screen actual size: 1920 wide by 1080 high).  Worse still, the update has limited my scrolling so that I cannot scroll to reach parts of the program that are off-screen. (Please note that my descriptions are not technical, but how it appears to me as I am limited by whatever is wrong with the Thunderbird program update.) </p><p>On the version of Thunderbird I had before the update, I had set the size of the screen font to 20pts, picas, whatever (because I have aging vision).  After the update, I did find the setting for the size of print and put it at its lowest setting 9pts.  It reduced the size of the onscreen print somewhat, but not to 9pts.  When I look at 9 pts in my wordprocessor, the print is duly small.  </p><p>To compare what I see on the Thunderbird screen with what I see in my wordprocessor, Libre Write, I took a screenshot of an email title and pasted it in my wordprocessor and then repeated the title at 14pts (the size I use when I write) at 9pts (the size I changed in Thuderbird), and 20 Pts (my original font-size with Thunderbird).  Below you will find the screenshot so you can compare for youself. </p><p>So that's the first problem I have with this Thunderbird update.   </p><p>The second problem I have is that scrolling has become limited, so while in the column that shows the email accouonts, you can see ""Local Folders"", but you can't scroll past Local Folders.  This is a real problem for me because I subscribe to a number of newsletters and move them to folders I have created under Local folders.  I do this to keep my email accounts from being over loaded.   While I can transfer them automatically to the Local Folders, I can't access them because the program will not let me scroll past the Local Folders. </p><p>Because of the way this progam update works, I can't find/reach the Delete Account button that should be at the bottom of Account Settings, but since the scrolling stops at the Email Signature box and goes no further, I can't delete the account. </p><p>Why do I want to delete an account.  Trying to work things out by myself, I thought I would remove three of my minor email accounts to another Linux mail app, and that I might then be able to scroll to the folders under the Local Folders and, at least, have a bare minimum functioning of Thunderbird. </p><p>I went through this whole thing with David, a top 10 contributor and he recommended i put the whole shebang up on this support list.  But truthfully, I don't think this is something any user, no matter how expert, can help me with.  This is truly a Thunderbird problem and I don't know how to reach Thunderbird technicians. </p><p>Please let me know if you have any ideas on how to get Thunderbird's attention.

I've removed most messages from my Inbox, but the switch from unread-to-read status is still just as slow.  The status switch delays appear to be irrespective of message size, number of photos/graphics/links, etc.... I can scroll through and read entire messages as I'm waiting for the switch to read status to occur, so it's *NOT* waiting delaying due to downloading of message contents or display delays.

Saving these same jpg files to another folder outside of Thunderbird and then clicking on them bring up ""Sorry, Photos can't open this file because the format is currently unsupported, or the file is corrupted."" 8.

IF I copy this same email's photos to the same folder as before with the inbox jpgs, they now open immediately. 10.  It appears that the INBOX coding is not recording the jpgs in the proper format -- some bit is wrong and hence blocking it from opening. 11.  HOWEVER, as far as I know now, this only starts happens after I shut down my desktop computer for the night.  In the morning when I boot my computer and open Thunderbird and check my overnight security camera emails, none of the jpg pictures will display. The words in the email are correct.   12.  THEN at some point overnight, sometimes the date/time stamp shows up as 4:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. (or any minute therein) AND all the emails following that time display the jpgs as usual (until the next night)!  Go back to the earlier emails and they still do NOT display -- as though the jpg file is corrupted.  Again, delete that email and go to trash and it opens immediately! 13.  All other emails overnight behave normally -- advertisements from different companies come through as normal. 14.  What more can I say?

I changed my Thunderbird account info accordingly and all was working fine until a computer crash which ultimately resulted in that account reverting back to GoDaddy settings. As a result my latest downloaded email showing for this account is from July (of 2023). I've changed the settings again in Thunderbird, but the account is hardwired to POP3 (GoDaddy) instead of IMAP (Strikingly) and won't link to the server. I assume I will need to do a manual account configuration to change this. Before jumping in I just need to warm up my cold feet and make SURE that when I do this I won't be losing all of the folder organization for years and years of business emails which only exists in Thunderbird. Please, please reassure me! Thank you so much, M. Britz </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",guemeskid

The existing documentation doesn't seem to cover whatever problem I'm running into. </p><p>I'm not seeing error messages show up either so I'm not sure what to do at this point.
