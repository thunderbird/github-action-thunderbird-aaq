When I attempt to send an email, I get this error message, ""Login to server <a href=""http://smtp.googlemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.googlemail.com</a> with username (Redacted) failed.""

This problem started when I received an email from Google saying that I needed to validate my account for security reasons. When they asked me to enter my account's password, I failed to do it correctly because they would not allow me to paste it in and they would not show the characters which I was typing in as anything but dots. The result was that they indicated that they were invalidating my account because of too many failed attempts to log on to my Google account. I have since then been able to log on there, but they offer no help in recovering the operation of my email account on Thunderbird. Incidentally, this troubled email account works okay on the Google Email internet site, just not with Thunderbird. </p><p>Any help that you can provide will be much appreciated! </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",lee7326892

By exploded, I mean that the size of the screen is larger than my computer screen (computer screen actual size: 1920 wide by 1080 high).  Worse still, the update has limited my scrolling so that I cannot scroll to reach parts of the program that are off-screen. (Please note that my descriptions are not technical, but how it appears to me as I am limited by whatever is wrong with the Thunderbird program update.) </p><p>On the version of Thunderbird I had before the update, I had set the size of the screen font to 20pts, picas, whatever (because I have aging vision).  After the update, I did find the setting for the size of print and put it at its lowest setting 9pts.  It reduced the size of the onscreen print somewhat, but not to 9pts.  When I look at 9 pts in my wordprocessor, the print is duly small.  </p><p>To compare what I see on the Thunderbird screen with what I see in my wordprocessor, Libre Write, I took a screenshot of an email title and pasted it in my wordprocessor and then repeated the title at 14pts (the size I use when I write) at 9pts (the size I changed in Thuderbird), and 20 Pts (my original font-size with Thunderbird).  Below you will find the screenshot so you can compare for youself. </p><p>So that's the first problem I have with this Thunderbird update.   </p><p>The second problem I have is that scrolling has become limited, so while in the column that shows the email accouonts, you can see ""Local Folders"", but you can't scroll past Local Folders.  This is a real problem for me because I subscribe to a number of newsletters and move them to folders I have created under Local folders.  I do this to keep my email accounts from being over loaded.   While I can transfer them automatically to the Local Folders, I can't access them because the program will not let me scroll past the Local Folders. </p><p>Because of the way this progam update works, I can't find/reach the Delete Account button that should be at the bottom of Account Settings, but since the scrolling stops at the Email Signature box and goes no further, I can't delete the account. </p><p>Why do I want to delete an account.  Trying to work things out by myself, I thought I would remove three of my minor email accounts to another Linux mail app, and that I might then be able to scroll to the folders under the Local Folders and, at least, have a bare minimum functioning of Thunderbird. </p><p>I went through this whole thing with David, a top 10 contributor and he recommended i put the whole shebang up on this support list.  But truthfully, I don't think this is something any user, no matter how expert, can help me with.  This is truly a Thunderbird problem and I don't know how to reach Thunderbird technicians. </p><p>Please let me know if you have any ideas on how to get Thunderbird's attention.  Any help is appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",bdjim

Now with the new interface, it opens mutiple messages ""open in conversation"" and creates tabs for them. Opening in coversation used to only create a list of messages in the thread, and was n option, not a default behavior. How do I restore opening ONE message at a time? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jsallen

About 7:15 PM while reading through my emails, Thunderbird disappeared and I got a blue screen message that an error had occurred, but before I could read further, my PC went blank.  The power light was still on, so I waited several minutes, but nothing was happening (no restart).  I did a manual shutdown and rebooted.  The system seemed to load normally.  I went back to Thunderbird to pick up where I left off on the emails.  The list of emails was there, but when I clicked on the next one in the queue, nothing happened.  A double click opened a blank page, not the email.  I checked a few others, and the same thing happened.  This was with my main email account from Optimum.  I checked my other accounts (AOL and gmail), and they appear unaffected; emails opened normally.  I sent an email to the Optimum account from both of the others, and they opened normally.  After some checking, this ""blank page"" situation seems to start with emails in the inbox from 9/21/2023 and continue to today (10/15/2023) at around 7:15 PM.  Older emails are still there.  I have many folders for old emails, and I checked several of them. The old emails are still there, including ones between 9/21 and 10/15.  All the blank emails from today seem to be OK when downloaded on Windows Mail.  I signed into my Optimum account online, and all the emails seem to be there.  This all seems very strange.  I would hope there is some way to repopulate these blank emails. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",hasmort
