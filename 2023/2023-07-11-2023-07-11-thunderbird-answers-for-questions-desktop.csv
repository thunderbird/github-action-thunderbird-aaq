First, when I start Thunderbird (102.13.0), all accounts appear and work fine (send and received) except the one account I have that uses Exquilla.  That account (using Exquilla) does not appear in my Folders on the left side of Thunderbird.  I learned through hours of desperate fiddling around that if I send an email to that problem account, from another of my email accounts, with Thunderbird open during this process, then Thunderbird will pop up a window showing that I have new mail.  Clicking on that new mail notice causes Thunderbird to instantly update its Folders panel, now showing the Exquilla-related account that was previously not shown in the Folders panel.  My received emails are there, but I cannot send emails through that account (I can send through all other accounts).  When I look at the Error Console on the Exquilla Add-On panel's settings, I see many errors saying, """"invalid value for enumeration writeMode"" and pointing to a few specific lines in ""ewsUtils.jsm"".  See attached image of the error log.  I hope one of the Thunderbird or Exquilla programmers will simply look at their error logs because it seems to point directly to the offending code.  BTW, I wish to add here that I've emailed Exquilla Support twice in the past few months and never received a reply. </p>",dfcurry,false,0,0
