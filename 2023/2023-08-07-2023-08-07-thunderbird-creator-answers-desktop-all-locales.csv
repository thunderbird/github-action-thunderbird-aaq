All I did was delete a few hundred emails from folders in the vain hope that might help. Noted that the error console reported something wrong with server? Anyway, seems to have resolved with the passage of time perhaps? </p><p>Yesterday my Thunderbird's ability to download emails seemed to suddenly stop. It seems to 'see' that there are emails to download in that the menu bar at the bottom of the window will come up with 'Downloading message 1 of 31' but then it will sit there for a minute or so, then disappear. The activity manager records 'No messages to download'. I've been through the checklist of items to review when this happens and have tried deleting of the global messages thingy from Thunderbird library etc., but no change. </p><p>I can send messages.  </p><p>My internet provider webmail is working and I can see download my emails there so at least I have that ability. However, I prefer to have my Thunderbird app where I can organise and read messages offline and online.  </p><p>I have the latest version of Thunderbird (102.14.0 [64-bit]). I use a MacBook Air with OS Ventura 13.4.1. I have no anti-virus programs and no firewall. </p><p>Can anyone help? Thanks! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",thewordygecko
