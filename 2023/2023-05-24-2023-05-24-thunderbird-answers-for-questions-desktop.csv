For example, if you have three POP accounts and you want them to be IMAP, then you can create three  new IMAP accounts with the same email addresses as the POP accounts, leaving you with six accounts. Once you are comfortable with the IMAP accounts, you can delete the POP accounts. HOWEVER, before deleting the POP accounts, I encourage you to MOVE any messages to be saved to local folders. You can do this by highlighting Local Folders, right-click and select 'new folder'. Assign a name and you can then move messages to be saved. Otherwise, when you delete the POP account, the messages would be lost. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1
