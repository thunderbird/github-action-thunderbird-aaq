I'm here to ask that Thunderbird PLEASE be ported to Windows on ARM64 already. The x86-64 version runs PAINFULLY slowly on ARM64. The big problem appears to be the code that adds newly downloaded emails to the email database file; it can take up to a minute per email, and it makes Thunderbird excruciating to use on my Samsung Galaxy Book S. Firefox, being available in a native ARM64 binary, runs brilliantly, so I know it's possible for Mozilla to pull this off. Please do it already. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1598892;1598894;,deusexaethera
