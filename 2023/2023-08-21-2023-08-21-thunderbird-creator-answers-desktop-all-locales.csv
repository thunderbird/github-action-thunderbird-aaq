The message source show there is an attachment (see attached image #1) If open the webmail I can see the attachment (see attached image #2). Up to now it happened only with pdf file (see attached image #3). I found a thread named ""Thunderbird not showing attachments"", that report the same issue, but the proposed solution is neither solving nor applicable to my PC. If needed, I can forward the email, there are no privacy issues. Thank you very much!

As expected, it regularly checks the inbox in each of them and downloads the messages, this is fine. I would like it to do the same with ALL the folders, including the spam. How can this be done? </p><p>In the attached screenshots you can see my settings. For the sake of comfort, I have created a ""saved search"" that groups all the inboxes of each account, and I would like to find there all the spam folders as well (within the ""inbox all"" saved search), because still in 2023 the filters from the companies cannot be trusted, you end up missing a lot of important emails and even worse they cannot be deactivated, not even in premium corporate accounts. The thing is that each time I go to any of these saved searches they work fine, but for some reason they ignore the spam folders. If, within Thunderbird, I go to manually check each spam folder, then it downloads the messages and now they show up in the saved search. However, the process of Thunderbird connecting to the remote spam folder and downloading the messages is not automated when I go into the saved search. What am I missing? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",m.senger

I'm here to ask that Thunderbird PLEASE be ported to Windows on ARM64 already. The x86-64 version runs PAINFULLY slowly on ARM64. The big problem appears to be the code that adds newly downloaded emails to the email database file; it can take up to a minute per email, and it makes Thunderbird excruciating to use on my Samsung Galaxy Book S. Firefox, being available in a native ARM64 binary, runs brilliantly, so I know it's possible for Mozilla to pull this off. Please do it already. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1598892;1598894;,deusexaethera
