I constantly receive this message: </p><pre>   ""Sending of the message failed.  The message could not be sent because connecting to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtpauth.earthlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtpauth.earthlink.net</a> failed. The server may be unavailable or is refusing SMTP connections. Please verify that your Outgoing server (SMTP) settings are correct and try again.""    Earthlink says (at https://clean.email/blog/email-settings/earthlink-email-settings) that for:    SMTP (outgoing) the settings should be:  host=<a href=""http://smtpauth.earthlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtpauth.earthlink.net</a>, port=587, security=STARTTLS, username=full email address including domain (as 'name@domain.com'), password=normal password; BUT NOWHERE DOES EARTHLINK PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS ON AUTHENTICATION (whether 'no authentication' or 'normal password' or 'encrypted password' or 'Kerberos / GSSAPI' or 'NTLM') - I have tried ""no authentication' and 'normal password' and 'encrypted password' - NONE of these options allows me to SEND my email out from Thunderbird.  **EARTHLINK needs to change ALL its instructions to clarify what authentication method will work - NOWHERE do I find any such instruction.**    IMAP (incoming).  It was wonderful that after decades Earthlink FINALLY added IMAP (I've been with Earthlink since about 1985).  The above Earthlink website instructs to set Server IMAP settings to:  host=<a href=""http://imap.earthlink.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.earthlink.net</a>; port=143; SSL=none; username=full email address (as in 'name@domain.com'); password=email account password.  Earthlink instructions on incoming IMAP security are unusual - 'none' is the default, but TLS is optional (but only if you set outgoing SMTP security to 'None'???)   My IMAP connection security is at the default 'none'.  Earthlink is silent on which [Thunderbird] IMAP authentication method to use ('password transmitted insecurely' or 'encrypted password' or Kerberos / GSSAPI' or 'NTLM' or 'TLS certificate' or 'OAuth2').  My [Thunderbird] authentication method is set to 'password transmitted insecurely'.    BOTTOM LINE:   Despite my best efforts and Earthlink's muddy instructions, I cannot SEND email via Thunderbird to my Earthlink account servers and get the email delivered.  I always receive the error message above.    PLEASE:  MOZILLA - Contact Earthlink and get this fixed.  I have written them a similar request to reach out to you, but please take the initiative - I REALLY would like this to work, as it once did.    Thank you.                                                   5/3/2023 </pre>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1578692;,Bill_33
