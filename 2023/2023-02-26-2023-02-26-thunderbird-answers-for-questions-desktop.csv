Use the Thunderbird write window. </p><p>The second thing I observe immediately is the choice of a 10 pixel font.  Really tiny that. </p><p>The third and perhaps most important thing I am seeing is you are trying to control the font size in something that should be left alone in the vast majority of cases.   </p><p>Thunderbird uses the HTML font sizes from extra small to extra large because it is rare that two displays will share a scaling factor.  This is especially so as Apple and 4k monitors use a pixel doubling approach and present special issues for rendering HTML as a result. </p><p>So you specify the font as ""Normal"" and when it gets where it is going the receiving rendering engine scales the font to largely what is appropriate for the device.  The scaling being different on a 5"" phone screen to a 65"" television.   </p><p>Then we get things like Microsoft office and others that try and enforce rather silly things like points into email.  A point is a 1/64th of an inch, an absolute value on a non absolute render size. This generally means another lot of abstracts while some software tries to turn this absolute into something that scales without looking clownish. </p><p>So if you want everyone so see something similar get rid of all the font sizing in pixels.

I'm content to let HTML do its thing on  the respondent's receiving end. I'll assume that their scaling is sane and not of particular interest to me. </p><p>2. Most full HTML email I receive displays quite well. </p><p>3. On my end (the composition end) I'd like to adjust my composition display so I see a font size range (cruddly printed font size)  of, say, 9 to 16 points (convert to px, if you will), with with ""medium"" being 10 or 12 pts. </p><p>4. What I'm confused about: </p><p>a. Settings-&gt;Composition-&gt;HTML style: Does this setting only affect what I see in the composition window? Or does it affect the size of text the recipient sees, or both? </p><p>b. Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Language &amp; Appearance: </p><p>c. Would I use this setting to control what I see in incoming HTML email? Or does it only set the font size relative size I see in the composition window? </p><p>d. Just what exactly does each of the above two settings affect? </p><p>4. Other matters: </p><p>a. I preferreading plain-text message in Helvetica/Ariel font, _not_ monospace ,so I have Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Plain Text Messages set to ""Regular""; ""Regular."" The problem here for me is that when I move from a received HTML message to a received plain-text message, the plain-text message text is quite large, so I've been using the macOS &lt;""cmd"" + ""+""&gt; or &lt;""cmd"" + ""-"" to adjust the font size.  </p><p>5. Question: Is their a way to force the size of the variable-space font displaying the plain-text message? Comment: The above occurs whether the plain-text is between  and   or simply message body of plain-text. It also doesn't matter whether the message is plain old ascii or plain old ascii encoded in base64 with or wi/o HTML tags. </p><p>6. Finally, I note that T-bird resets whatever &lt;cmd+&gt; or &lt;cmd–&gt; controls.
