Te ne accorgeresti però anche navigando di problemi del genere. - Problemi al server: è di solito il motivo più comune: se il server è sovraccarico o tarda molto a rispondere alle richieste di Thunderbird (generando un errore di 'tempo scaduto') oppure chiude le connessioni che non riesce a gestire con l'errore di disconnessione che hai mostrato sopra. Purtroppo a poterti rispondere in merito è solo il tuo fornitore. </p><p>Questo tipo di problemi sono più frequenti con le connessioni IMAP in cui il client rimane costantemente collegato al server.

I understand that you are facing a situation where your current email hosting provider, FutureQuest, is going out of business, and you need to ensure that you don't lose your stored emails in Thunderbird. </p><p>To make sure you can retain your stored emails, you will need to update the server settings in Thunderbird to match the new hosting provider's configuration. Here's what you can do: </p><p>Gather the new server settings: Contact your new hosting provider and obtain the necessary information about the incoming and outgoing mail servers. They should provide you with details such as server addresses, port numbers, and authentication settings. </p><p>Open Thunderbird: Launch Thunderbird on your computer. </p><p>Access Account Settings: Go to the ""Tools"" menu and select ""Account Settings."" </p><p>Select the email account: In the Account Settings window, choose the email account associated with mark@wilkoff.com or linda@wilkoff.com. </p><p>Update server settings: Within the account settings, find the ""Server Settings"" section. Update the incoming and outgoing server addresses, port numbers, and authentication settings according to the information provided by your new hosting provider. </p><p>Test the connection: After updating the server settings, click on the ""Test"" button to ensure that Thunderbird can establish a connection with the new email servers. This will verify if the settings are correct and if Thunderbird can send and receive emails. </p><p>Verify email storage: Once the connection test is successful, Thunderbird should start downloading your emails from the new server. Check if all your previously stored emails are accessible within Thunderbird. </p><p>By following these steps, you should be able to retain your stored emails in Thunderbird while transitioning to the new hosting provider. If you encounter any difficulties or have further questions, feel free to ask for assistance in the Firefox Support Forum. </p><p>Best regards, Firefox Support Volunteer </p>",suram080,false,0,2

So if you can still get access to webmail account and change passwords then I doubt if your account has been hacked. </p><p>Maybe you got a mailor daemon email saying an email could not be delivered, but you never sent it. You got that email because the real sender pretended to be you and entered your email address so if the TO email address did not exist then you got the bounce back.  To be honest that was actually very helpful for you because it means you know someone was sending emails using your email address. So, it would be a good idea to let all your family and friends know what has been occuring just in case they also received an email reportedly from you containing something which could cause damage. Suggest you also state you are always going to use a specific signature, so recipients will know it really is from you.  In these cases, the abuser gets bored with your email address if it does not get the reponse they are looking for and stops abusing it. </p><p>Sometimes spammers are a real pain in the proverbial. They enter your name as the display name in the email address because it often gets around junk filters in email clients.  Sometimes they enter your email address so it looks like it was From you and the purpose is to avoid spam filters.  The spammers/hoaxers really are trying to get into your Inbox and then they usually try to trigger your curiousity with the content or attachment. Do not be conned into responding or clicking on anything in the email or trying to open any attachments.  </p><p>If you are really concerned if they have somehow got your 'password' which is not the same as abusing an email address, then do the following: </p><p>Exit all programs. Start computer in 'Safe Mode'  (not Safe mode with Networking) Run full scans. This scan will detect if there are any unwanted keylogger programs running which provide info about what keys you press on keyboard - eg: passwords. It should auto fix these issues if they are present. If anything comes back saying there is an issue in Thunderbird profile maybe an email, do not let it do an auto fix as it might cause a bigger problem deleting a load of emails. Just make a note of the problem file info. It's much better to locate and delete the email within Thunderbird and then compact the folder to really get rid all deleted data. </p><p>Once you know your computer is ok, I think you can assume you resetting a password is also ok. However, If something - virus - trojan - keylogger etc is detected and gets fixed. After it is fixed, restart Computer and immediately update password in webmail and then in Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I tried your suggestions and a few others, and none of them shed any light. But on inspection, the problem messages are the ones that were sent from the account (originals or replies).

For example all pop accounts will use the same set of folders for eg: Sent emails - the 'Sent' folder, but imap accounts may vary as some call the sent storage 'Sent Mail' or 'Sent Items' or 'Sent' etc, so it would need checking on a per account basis.  </p><p>The adaptive junk controls are enabled by default because most people want to sort junk. The adaptive junk controls need to be trained, so that Thunderbird knows what is Junk and what is not Junk. So it is advantageous to say what is not junk just as much as saying what is junk. There is only one set of training data, so if you decide to reset it then it does get applied to all accounts. </p><p>Helpful links. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a> <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls</a> </p><p>Imap accounts offer more configurations eg: full download or headers and this can be set up on a per folder basis and also the extent of sycnronisation, full or partial.  Thunderbird sets a basic default to enable full download on default server folders and allows the user to adapt as required. </p><p>composition and editing - most people choose to compose using HTML so it is set as default, but as ane xample, I do have one account which I've set plain text as default. Please note what ever you set as default, it can be altered on the fly by holding down 'Shift' key and pressing 'Write' button and whatever you have set as default the result will be the opposite. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Look for a ""Sign In"" or ""Login"" option on their website and click on it. On the sign-in page, look for a ""Forgot Password,"" ""Reset Password,"" or similar option. Click on it. You might be asked to provide your email address or username associated with the account. Enter the required information. Depending on your email provider, you'll receive password reset instructions via an alternative email address, a mobile phone number, or you might be prompted to answer security questions. Follow the instructions provided by your email provider to reset your password. Once you've reset your password, open Thunderbird and update the password for your email account in Thunderbird's account settings. To do this, go to ""Tools"" (or ""Options"") &gt; ""Account Settings"" &gt; select your email account &gt; update the password field. Save the changes, and Thunderbird should now use your new password to access your email account. </p><p>Regards, TG </p>",techguy150,false,0,0
