I have moved all saved emails to the new address, so there is nothing in the old one. I have made my new email address the default one. The delete button is available for the new one, but of course I don't want to delete it. In the account settings for the old account it is listed as ""a special account. There are no identities associated with it."" Is this significant. </p>",jsalford,false,0,0
