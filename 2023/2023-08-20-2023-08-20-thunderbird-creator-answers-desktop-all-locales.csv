Is there a way to set a default time that events start at, rather than always setting them to start at the nearest half-hour?  </p><p>Most of the events I'm creating start at a specific time that doesn't vary from event to event, and I'm very rarely creating them close to the time they're going to start. I've very nearly missed a couple of appointments because I didn't think to change the start time, and I've looked all over the Internet for a solution to this, to no avail (all of the results seem to be about setting a default appointment <em>duration</em>).

But when Thunderbird is installed or updates that process always requires Administrator access, which includes placing a Thunderbird shortcut on the user Desktop, which later on requires Administrator permission to remove the Desktop icon.  Since I run two instances of Thunderbird with different profiles the default Desktop icon is not useful and unwanted.   Please provide an option during the install of Thunderbird (and Firefox) to turn off the creation of the Desktop Thunderbird shortcut icon. </p><p>Second, I get a large number of emails, some of which may or may not be junk/spam.  I will not open these emails as ""Original HTML"" until I am satisfied that they are legitimate.  I do this by using the View/Message Source option, or the ""View Message Body As"" option.   But that option cannot be selected by right-clicking on the Inbox Subject line, but must be selected from the Menu bar.  (Also, the ""View Message Body As"" option does not apply to just the selected email, but also applies to any future opened email message, and must be undone for future emails.)  This seems to be a lot of unnecessary mousing about. It would more efficient to add the ability to Right-click on email Inbox (or other folder) Subject line to: </p><pre>View Message Body (just for that email message) as Simple HTML.

I had saved my Thunderbird profile. I completed this last Friday. Thunderbird will not allow me to download its software as my machine is now not compatible which I am struggling with as I was using Thunderbird all last week (See attachment).  As a sneeky fix....I took a older version from my wife's machine loaded that...all good. I assumed in time it would update  after I had loaded my profile. When I try and change my default profile to the migrated one in the software I see the message attached. I seem to be caught in a vicious circle as my Lap top is nolonger compatible with the Thunderbaird software available for download, though I have only changed the harddrive. If I use an older version of Thunderbird which is working fine on my wife's  Lenovo T510 (identical machines) I have a compatibility with the profile I want to use.  I also attach my lap top operating system and architecture(?)  Can anyone help?  In normal circumstances I would just start again but the profile has some very important emails relating to a personal legal case I am fighting (and winning) and I need access to them. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1598798;,jeremyjcole202

In order not to run down the battery in the UPS, I did a normal shutdown of my computer (Windows 11).  I did not manually close Thunderbird (115.1.1) before the Windows shutdown, relying on Windows shutdown to do it.  That apparently worked, as Windows did not complain that it couldn't shut down the program.  After the power was restored, I restarted the computer and it came up normally.  When I restarted Thunderbird, in the folder pane, e-mail folders were fine, but for my news server, it showed the server name, but it did not show the list of subscribed newsgroups, nor did it have a downward pointing arrow to the left of the server name.  So I can't access any existing (or presumably new) newsgroup posts.  As far as I remember, all the settings on the account page are correct.  While I can't say for sure, I think I never had this problem prior to 115. </p><p>As a side note, I have noticed a problem with newsgroups on Supernova, but I haven't reported it as it is intermittent, and I can't find any way to repeat it.  Usually, automatic downloading of new posts occurs fine.  But ""frequently"" (perhaps several times a day) I won't see any new newsgroup posts for a while.  If I click on the newsgroup name, or the news server name in the folder pane, no new posts come in.  But if I, immediately after that, normally terminate Thunderbird and restart it, as part of the restart, It downloads the ""backed up"" posts, with timestamps before the ""clicking"" attempts to download them.  If you people would like me to post it separately, I will, but I feel bad not being to provide a repeatable bug. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1598984;,s.fuld
