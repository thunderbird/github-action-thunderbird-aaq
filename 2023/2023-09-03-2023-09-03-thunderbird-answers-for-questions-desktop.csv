And let me expand on suzannethompson's comment ""<em>that some of us like things ""the way they were"" esp. visually</em>.""  We are not just a bunch of old fogies resistant to change.  This change also changes the design of the TB windows so it is different from the basic design used in most other linux applications, or as rockney85881 said, ""<em>extremely non-standard and dumb</em>"".  Sometimes historical perspective is of value.  If windows have been designed with a certain look and feel for a long time, maybe there is a reason for it.  Thta does not mean change is never called for but it does return us to, what were the ""substancial reasons"" for the change, other than some newbies (less than 40 year experience) personal inclination as to what they thought was pretty. </p><p>The standard design is based on a sound foundation organization.  The system title bar deals with the window. The more detailed menu bar deals with the more specific application wide commands.  Thje more specific tool bar deals with the more specific commands for the current functionality of the app (in this case, mail, calender, address book, etc). </p><p>I do not think anyone here even objects of adding the new design as an option (and in its initial introduction, such a change should not be the default option).   </p><p>I hope getting this corrected will not be impossible and KH's belief that ""<em>it's to do with developers coming up with a design and egos get hurt when people do not like it, so basically they say - get used to it.</em>""  Yes KH I found your instructions very easy to follow.  But most people do not read forums like this and even if they did, this is well above their tech capabilities. </p><p>If the problem is egos, please people, put them aside.  This is the kind of mistake any of us could have made, things like that sometimes happen.  The mistake is not the problem, but not recognizing the mistake and dealing with it, that would be a problem.  Hopefully the comments in this thread give a pretty good case this is not just a case of personal preference of what something looks like.  And it is not a request that the new design be abandoned or not made available.  And from what I see, fixing the problem is not a major task.  Please, make the  linux standard hierarchy the default (system title bar, menu bar, toolbar) and give users the option of unifying the system title and toolbars.  Please do the win/win correction. </p>",product,false,6,0

I had no way of knowing for sure who the people were on the other end.  They were asking me to reveal a piece of identifying information.  Now maybe not a really crucial one, but one none the less.  They could have just as easily been asking for my SS number.  It was bad on CVS's part not for this particular instance of what they were asking for but from the larger perspective that it was encouraging customers to act in a manner that was risky with respect to protecting ones identity.   </p><p>I do not want the average computer user going in and manipulating low-level configuration files.

I have another two bugs - SuperNova Thunderbird seems to have split my email xxxx@gmail.com into two columns as Unified Folders and All Folders. I know I can hide either one in the folders drop down menu, but the problem is I have a large number of sub folders and Thunderbird has decided to split them up and half of them are in Unified Folders under Archives and the other half of them are in All Folders under All Mail. All my sub folders used to be in the same Unified/Archives prior to this SuperNova.  Second bug is that the Quick Filters used to be expanded on the Open Space menu and so took up no more room. Now in SuperNova it can only be a button and if I want to leave it expanded its re-positioned at the top of my inbox column (I use vertical layout) and pushes the inbox message headers down the page more.

This means for the long distance future it's not going to change. Anything that has been modified will be staying that way. There will be more alterations to any code which has not as yet been updated and as new functionalities are added. So once people have adjusted the code, it should end up being in situ for a very long time.  It would have been better for the developers to have got it right in the first place and maybe the 'Menu Bar' will get incorporated into the Unified Toolbar at some point, so allowing it to be easily put at the top via an esy Customise option - but don't hold your breath as that would need the Unified toolbar to operate over more than one line and I'm not inclined to think the developers are loving that idea at the moment.

I also found a work-around that makes the problem less aggravating. </p><p>This is what I'm seeing: I select an item.  It displays in the preview pane.  I then click-drag that item to another folder.  The message list reshuffles and brings the next *read* message into view.  (The messages in my list were all unread.)  For me, though, Thunderbird isn't bringing the message to the top.  One time, it brought it up to three lines above the bottom of the list; another time, it brought it up to the middle of the list.  Each time, though, Thunderbird selected and displayed the message just below the one that I was viewing and moved, but it scrolled that message completely out of view.  I had to click the scrollbar up button 16 times to bring the selected message back into view in the message list.  I don't think it should automatically scroll a selected item out of view. </p><p>A work-around is to select the message that you want to see next, and release the mouse button so that it displays in the preview pane.  Then click-drag (without releasing the mouse button) the message you want to move, and move it to another folder.  When you do it this way, the message in the preview pane stays there, and in the message list, the messages below the moved item shift up by one. </p><p>The limitation of that work-around is that you can only move one item.  If you have selected multiple items, that selection is lost when you click on the message that you want to remain displayed after you move an item.  But if you only wanted to move one item, this at least prevents the next selected item from scrolling out of view off the top of the message list. </p>",drkaden,false,0,0

L'ipotesi che faccio è che la mail che non hai ricevuto su Thunderbird sia stata inviata senza data.

I then went into Thunderbird 115.3.3 (64 bit) and set up the mail accounts again using the website passwords for these email pop accounts.  When I restart TBird and look at the passwords for these accounts they were about 25 characters each and bore no resemblance whatsoever to what I set up on the mail websites  and entered when re-setting the accounts in Tbird - but they worked &nbsp;!!!  I can only assume TBird 115 (and maybe earlier versions) scramble the displayed passwords in TBird.  If so it's VERY confusing&nbsp;!  Strangely my Sky password in Tbird was exactly what I had set up with my Sky email account on their website. Anyone have an explanation&nbsp;? </p>,pjgreen1296,false,0,0

That happens because Google first verifies your account, and then sets  a unique password on your PC. That password is explicitly for the PC and nothing else, so it is the norm that the password on pc does not match the one used online. There are other email providers with similar approaches to ensure security of the account. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I wondered if that is the reason the passwords in Tbird appear to be ""scrambled"" to something completely different (to meet new oauth privacy requirements by these providers&nbsp;?).  Interesting that the provider link for Sky is not prefixed with ""oauth"".  The SMTP passwords for all three providers do not appear to be ""scrambled"" in this way. </p>",pjgreen1296,false,0,0
