It comes from our partnerships with Gandi and Mailfence for users to get new email addresses.</em>  </p><p>Thunderbird receives payments when users sign up for the email providers Gandi and Mailfence via Thunderbird. So if you already have a mailfence account and it's not been created via Thunderbird, then no non-donation revenue has occured. </p><p>So basically Thunderbird still relies on donations from users because after helping to provide an email address, the ongoing support, maintenance and anything else Thunderbird the product offers has nothing to do with partners. </p><p>Hope you find this info useful. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
