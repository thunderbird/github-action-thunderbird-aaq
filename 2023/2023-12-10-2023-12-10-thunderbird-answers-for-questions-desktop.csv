I managed to create a little more space by eliminating a couple elements, but the huge gap in the middle of the program (shown in the picture) remains.

Perhaps someone has already made an add-on that will do something like that.  Any ideas? </p><p>Let me point out that all of that wasted vertical space in this bar alone (as shown in the screen shot) is there despite my using the Dense mode.
