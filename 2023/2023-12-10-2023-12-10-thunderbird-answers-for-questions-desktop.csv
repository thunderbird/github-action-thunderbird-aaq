I hate having to familiarize myself with it all over again. </p><p>However, I decided to see if I could make this horrible version work.  I managed to create a little more space by eliminating a couple elements, but the huge gap in the middle of the program (shown in the picture) remains.  They could have made all that stuff smaller if they had tried, but they didn't.  Since I can access all those functions via the menu, I would like to  close up that space altogether. </p><p>I've discovered that I can eliminate the icons, but it is really the text which is taking up all the space.  Is there any setting I can change (in the profile files if necessary) that will keep the icons, and eliminate the text (which I can get from the email itself).  Perhaps someone has already made an add-on that will do something like that.  Any ideas? </p><p>Let me point out that all of that wasted vertical space in this bar alone (as shown in the screen shot) is there despite my using the Dense mode.

I also contacted the developer of the Compact Headers extension, and he updated the extension to make it work better -- that had the effect of reducing space in the mail headers area in the middle of the program.  In addition, I have ""density"" sex to maximum, which helps.  Consequently, I decided not to downgrade to version 102.  It still angers me, however, that the developers came up with with an upgrade with such a clunky interface. </p><p>I'd like to make a point, and that is that screen space is a precious thing.  On the newer monitors, which are wide, the vertical space is actually less than it was on the older, squarish monitors.

I have another Linux machine that runs straight off Debian I'll check it out. BTW I only have 1 addon (Owl for Exchange) and so I logged into TB in safe mode and the problem still persists. If I can't get any luck I'll downgrade to the previous version until I can get to the bottom of it. </p><p>thanks again Sam </p>",sam159,false,0,0
