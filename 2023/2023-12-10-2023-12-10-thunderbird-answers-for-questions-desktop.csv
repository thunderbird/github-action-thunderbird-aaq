You mentioned being the 'second user' and my thought is that you are logging into PC with your son's account and not yours. Managing multiple setups on Windows I have never done, but that seems a possibility.  </p><p>Question: Is Thunderbird now working with a new profile?

That will keep the messages together.   Since you made no changes, my guess is that Norton antivirus may be interfering. There are settings in Norton that let it not interfere with email settings. Since you have posted this problem in the past, this could be a part of that. I do not know what you mean by a Google antivirus, but two antivirus programs is one too  many.  Desirable screenshots (which may not be needed if the antivirus is the cause) are - click account settings, then server settings. That screenshot would show info on incoming server - click account settings, scroll down left side to 'Outgoing Server (SMTP) and click your outgoing server. That screenshot will provide info on how you are set up for sending. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

This (evidently) doesn't properly reflect the deleted status from Thunderbird (and perhaps from Gmail as well). </p>",spartanhooah,false,0,0
