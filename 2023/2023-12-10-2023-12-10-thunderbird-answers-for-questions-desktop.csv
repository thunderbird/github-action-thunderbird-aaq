That will keep the messages together.   Since you made no changes, my guess is that Norton antivirus may be interfering. There are settings in Norton that let it not interfere with email settings. Since you have posted this problem in the past, this could be a part of that. I do not know what you mean by a Google antivirus, but two antivirus programs is one too  many.  Desirable screenshots (which may not be needed if the antivirus is the cause) are - click account settings, then server settings. That screenshot would show info on incoming server - click account settings, scroll down left side to 'Outgoing Server (SMTP) and click your outgoing server. That screenshot will provide info on how you are set up for sending. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

On my setup, when a message is deleted, with 'just mark as deleted', it's shown with a strikethrough, and is made invisible at the next folder sync.  As mentioned in the kb article, if a message is in multiple folders, deleting it by just marking, does not delete it from the other folders.  This is a gmail-only property. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

I generally recommend not using it as it increases the disk space and causes extra overhead for Thunderbird to update.
