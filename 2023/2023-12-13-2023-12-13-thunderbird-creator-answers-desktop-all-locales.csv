If I do a global search for them using either “markys” or “emarkys” I get a drop-down window, image attached, that shows an option for support@emarkys.com.

If I click “Show results as list” I get a blank screen in a new tab.   </p><p>The emails are located in a local folder “__Purchases”  If I search for them using a quick search within the folder they are found just fine and open fine. </p><p>I have tried global searches for other emails in that folder and some work fine, but others do not, which is to say they fail like the markys search. </p><p>I did a right click on the Purchase folder and selected Repair.  The folder only has 147 emails so it completed very quickly.  But when it is done the folder appears to have no emails in it.  If I click to another local folder and then click back to __Purchases all the emails are there. </p><p>After the Repair the search problems persist.  I rebooted the PC and the problem persisted. </p><p>I tried repairing other local folders that also have name beginning with a double underscore and they repair fine and search fine. </p><p>NOW this is really odd.

I did the same search on that machine and it worked ok.  No problems.  Then just for the heck of it I did a repair on the Purchases folder.  Unlike the other machine, it appeared to repair fine and all the emails were there without me having to click on another folder.  However, when I did the search for Markys I now had the same problem as on the other machine.

For example, I have an email from “webbillpay.” If I search the entire word, it finds it.  But if I search “webbill” it does not.  I tried other examples and find the same results.  I would think that the CtrlK search should find items based on word parts, especially if they are the beginning of the string. </p><p>Using TB 115.5.2 Win10Pro 22H2 OS Build 19045.3693 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1624098;1624120;,eberger5
