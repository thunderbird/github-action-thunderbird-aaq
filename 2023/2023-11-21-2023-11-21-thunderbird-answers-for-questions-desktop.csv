Gmail's server sees the email address and the host server's address and probes the host server to see if it is really your email host. If not, it assumes spam and rejects the message. Your email host needs up adjust an SPF record on your account to legitimize the relationship.

I have found what I think are the missing messages, and after a lot of fiddling around, I found a list of previous versions. I tried restoring the latest previous version (created a couple of days ago) of one particular file, which seemed to work OK, but the particular email I wanted was not restored (in fact, I'm pretty sure no emails were actually restored). So I guessed the emails that I had lost were deleted earlier. I last looked at the email in September, so I went back to a version created before September, but when I try and restore that version, I  get an error ""The backup operation could not start due to an internal error: Windows Backup encountered an error. Please try again (0x81000036)."" The message actually came up twice. I have tried again several times, and for several previous versions, but without success (and always getting the same error message twice).

If an email client is asked to reference each as a folder, a copy appears because the email client must download the message to the PC in order to be processed. Since some of Gmail's labels are duplicates, such as 'all mail', 'important' and some others, I always recommend setting up Thunderbird to use only the folders needed, such as inbox, sent, trash to eliminate the need for Thunderbird to maintain duplicate copies. Another reason for my recommendation is to avoid confusion. For example, it is not uncommon for users to post that they deleted a message from inbox, hoping it was saved in Allmail, but since that is the same message, it is deleted from both. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

But it doesn't finally serve my goal. As I said, my GMail storage is about 12 GB / 15 GB. All my mail have labels, at least one to classify them in a primary category, and sometimes two or three to attach them to special contexts. For example, mails with my bank are classified with a main label, and the same messages also have labels to say they relate to my house or my car, and so on. Now I'd like to use the IMAP synchronization to clean some old mails and free part of the storage. And I need this classification to backup in local folders and remove mails depending of their age, first, but also according to their other labels. If labels are not available in TB, I must sort and classify all my mails from scratch&nbsp;: years of work&nbsp;:(&nbsp;!

Thunderbird downloads whatever it finds on server for whatever folder you have subscribed to see. Thunderbird stores each email in each folder as a separate copy. If you were to delete one of the copies stored from one of the folders and that email is correctly put into the gmail Trash folder, gmail reads this as delete main copy on server, so it deleted from the 'All Mail' folder and therefore all labels get deleted at same time. This means when you synchronise your folders you will discover all of your copies from all of your folders will get deleted.  If you were to delete one of the copies using 'Shift'+'Del' key, thus by-passing the gmail Trash then gmail reads this as remove a label.

Nothing virtual about the download - it's real. </p><p>Thunderbird does use 'virtual' folder displays.

Neither copy is virtual in Thunderbird because you cannot download virtual emails.

If I subsequently want 'virtual' copies in my own 'Important' folder then I create my own Search Messages filter for specific emails and save it as a Search Folder which I call 'Important'. Then I have a copy displayed in a folder and it's virtual. But because it is a search result folder it will not get put into gmail.  </p><p>You have to jump through hoops when dealing with Imap accounts and this means you have to understand that the server and imap folders are one and the same, it's just that in gmail it has virtual labels and in Thunderbird it is real files - otherwise you would never be able to backup something that does not exist. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

So when you set up an email address, Thunderbird will automatically take you that email address's log in screen. I was able to do that for the first email address, but when I did that for subsequent email addresses, Thunderbird still redirected me to the login for the first email address, if that makes sense.  Anyway, after I reached out, I was able to figure out what the problem was: cookies. Once I removed cookies prior to setting up each new email address, Thunderbird had no problems redirecting me to the correct log in for each email address. So it's all good now. Our emails are all set up and everybody is happy. It wasn't a Yahoo problem as I originally thought, it was just a cookie problem! </p>",vetboy,false,0,0
