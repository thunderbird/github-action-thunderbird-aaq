Instead select the account name itself.

You need to provide this information to your email provider, as the problem exists on their server. This is usually caused when sending from a private domain name (such as @julielodge.com) and the email host is <a href=""http://email.com"" rel=""nofollow"">email.com</a>. Gmail's server sees the email address and the host server's address and probes the host server to see if it is really your email host. If not, it assumes spam and rejects the message. Your email host needs up adjust an SPF record on your account to legitimize the relationship. On a non-technical example, it would be like telling your employer of an apartment building you live in and your employer wanting to ask the owner if you really have an apartment there. The intent is just to verify.  And I wrote too many words, didn't I? &nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
