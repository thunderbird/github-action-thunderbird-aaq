If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

I have found what I think are the missing messages, and after a lot of fiddling around, I found a list of previous versions. I tried restoring the latest previous version (created a couple of days ago) of one particular file, which seemed to work OK, but the particular email I wanted was not restored (in fact, I'm pretty sure no emails were actually restored). So I guessed the emails that I had lost were deleted earlier. I last looked at the email in September, so I went back to a version created before September, but when I try and restore that version, I  get an error ""The backup operation could not start due to an internal error: Windows Backup encountered an error. Please try again (0x81000036)."" The message actually came up twice. I have tried again several times, and for several previous versions, but without success (and always getting the same error message twice). I don't suppose it's the end of the world - I rarely look at old emails, except for this particular one (but the info I need, I will be able to get from the original sender, but it will take time getting them to respond); very occasionally, I do need to check up on other old emails, and I won't be able to do that in cases where I have archived to local folders (which I do to save space in my webmail).

If an email client is asked to reference each as a folder, a copy appears because the email client must download the message to the PC in order to be processed. Since some of Gmail's labels are duplicates, such as 'all mail', 'important' and some others, I always recommend setting up Thunderbird to use only the folders needed, such as inbox, sent, trash to eliminate the need for Thunderbird to maintain duplicate copies. Another reason for my recommendation is to avoid confusion. For example, it is not uncommon for users to post that they deleted a message from inbox, hoping it was saved in Allmail, but since that is the same message, it is deleted from both. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

But it doesn't finally serve my goal. As I said, my GMail storage is about 12 GB / 15 GB. All my mail have labels, at least one to classify them in a primary category, and sometimes two or three to attach them to special contexts. For example, mails with my bank are classified with a main label, and the same messages also have labels to say they relate to my house or my car, and so on. Now I'd like to use the IMAP synchronization to clean some old mails and free part of the storage. And I need this classification to backup in local folders and remove mails depending of their age, first, but also according to their other labels. If labels are not available in TB, I must sort and classify all my mails from scratch&nbsp;: years of work&nbsp;:(&nbsp;!

Thunderbird downloads whatever it finds on server for whatever folder you have subscribed to see. Thunderbird stores each email in each folder as a separate copy. If you were to delete one of the copies stored from one of the folders and that email is correctly put into the gmail Trash folder, gmail reads this as delete main copy on server, so it deleted from the 'All Mail' folder and therefore all labels get deleted at same time. This means when you synchronise your folders you will discover all of your copies from all of your folders will get deleted.  If you were to delete one of the copies using 'Shift'+'Del' key, thus by-passing the gmail Trash then gmail reads this as remove a label.
