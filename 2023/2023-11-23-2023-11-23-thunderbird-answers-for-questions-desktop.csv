I can't send an expanded screenshot since the stingy settings screen only allows one line at a time to show.   </p><p>As a test, I changed my unified DRAFTS folder settings to instead select the account's SENT folder, and it worked as expected by pulling in the contents of the account's SENT folder into the unified DRAFTS folder.  I next reversed the test by changing the unified SENT folder settings to instead select the account's DRAFTS folder, and that worked as expected since all the account's draft messages showed in the unified SENT folder.  The unified settings seem to work for other folders but not the correct ones!  This seems to show that the account and unified folder's themselves aren't the problem.   I'm thinking there's some sort of hinky technical bug at work here.  What do you think? </p>",James-A,false,0,0

This had the effect of filtering out all the messages without any indication that this was happening.  By simply removing this filter setting, I was able see all the messages in the unified SENT folder as expected.  The tests above worked since the DRAFTS messages were unread.  However, I noticed 3 messages in DRAFTS were 'read' and that's what clued me in to what was going on when I re-did the tests and noticed 3 draft messages were missing in the unified SENT folder.   So.......problem solved.  Thanks for your help. ps if you don't mind a personal comment, your account picture shows you're one smart canine. </p>",James-A,false,0,0

When thread expanded the new email itself will be white bold font and yellow new star, but any that are not new but are unread will be bold white font - no star. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> If you have collapsed thread which has no new mails then it will be: top level email white normal font - not bold and not underlined. </p><p>Additional: If a single email not threaded: If new - white bold font and yellow star If not new but unread - white bold font If read - normal white font. </p><p><br> Your situation seems to imply you are discussing number 2. In which case top level emails are underlined. So you look for the one which is underlined and expand it. </p><p>OR You could use the quick method: Use the 'Quick Filter'  if not enabled: Click on 'Quick Filter' button to see the 'Quick Filter Bar' click on the 'Show only unread messages' envelope icon.

This series of steps fixes that. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
