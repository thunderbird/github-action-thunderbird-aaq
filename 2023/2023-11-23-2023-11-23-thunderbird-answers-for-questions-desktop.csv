Please post info requested about Screen resolution and scale for both monitors. Thunderbird uses 'pixels' to determine Font size - not points.  The size of 'a pixel' is determined by the screen resolution in combination with the scale. In the same way if you change the screen resolution or scale you will find the view you see will alter because you have changed the given pixel size used by the monitor. The more pixels you fit into a given space means the pixel size is reduced.  </p><p>Thunderbird has no idea what everyone uses when it comes to screen resolution and scale, so it has the ability to be modified.  </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:p.s.: I tried to upload two pdf images but they were refused (why only accept jpg&nbsp;?)</em> Because pdf is not an image file it's in a portable document format.   The 'Add Images' means add an image file not a document file. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

To move your message folders else where, here are the steps:  - click 'account settings' and then click the 'server settings' pane. The bottom line shows the location of the message folders for the account. Note the location. - exit TB and locate the folder it will be at  c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles\&lt;profilename&gt;\Imapmail (or Mail if POP)  - COPY the folder and paste to the other drive  - restart tb, go to the same 'server settings' pane, click the 'browse' button and change the setting to point to the new location.  - exit and restart TB and verify that all is working ok. You can now delete the original folder - Now, at end of each year, you could copy the folder on the other drive and rename it </p><p>Side note: I encourage all users to periodically copy the c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder to external drive, such as a USB stick. This, because some antivirus software attempts to interfere with Thunderbird updates and can corrupt the profile. With a back, it's easy to just copy this backup back prior to starting TB. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

I am very far from being an expert in anything to do with computers, but anyway, here is how I fixed it. I took a guess that I might find something to do with file paths in the Thunderbird hidden folders, and I did.  I found a folder called   'jzlrnnn0.default-release' . Inside that one I found a file called   'folderTree.json'   and discovered I could open and read it in a plain text editor.  In that file I found the file path going to the inbox, and it was going via the trash folder    ....../Trash/Inbox  . So I made a copy of that file and then modified the path in the original file by simply deleting the   /Trash  portion and saved.    When I opened Thunderbird,  BINGO!  the Inbox was back where it used to be, with none of its contents disturbed.  Problem solved.  So I went back and deleted the copy of the file.  How it got messed up in the first place I do not know. </p>",barbara_hodgkinson,false,1,0
