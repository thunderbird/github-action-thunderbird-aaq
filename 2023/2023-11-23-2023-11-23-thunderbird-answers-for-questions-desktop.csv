Changes in Thunderbird 115 mean that setting it to anything but default is almost begging for display issues.  Very odd ones at that. </p><p>Once it is default if there is still an issue, at least a level playing ground has been established for moving forward with the new reality of supernova and it's modified interface. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

To move your message folders else where, here are the steps:  - click 'account settings' and then click the 'server settings' pane. The bottom line shows the location of the message folders for the account. Note the location. - exit TB and locate the folder it will be at  c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles\&lt;profilename&gt;\Imapmail (or Mail if POP)  - COPY the folder and paste to the other drive  - restart tb, go to the same 'server settings' pane, click the 'browse' button and change the setting to point to the new location.  - exit and restart TB and verify that all is working ok. You can now delete the original folder - Now, at end of each year, you could copy the folder on the other drive and rename it </p><p>Side note: I encourage all users to periodically copy the c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder to external drive, such as a USB stick. This, because some antivirus software attempts to interfere with Thunderbird updates and can corrupt the profile. With a back, it's easy to just copy this backup back prior to starting TB. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

This series of steps fixes that. And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
