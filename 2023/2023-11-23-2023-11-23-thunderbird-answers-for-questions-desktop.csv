When thread expanded the new email itself will be white bold font and yellow new star, but any that are not new but are unread will be bold white font - no star. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> If you have collapsed thread which has no new mails then it will be: top level email white normal font - not bold and not underlined. </p><p>Additional: If a single email not threaded: If new - white bold font and yellow star If not new but unread - white bold font If read - normal white font. </p><p><br> Your situation seems to imply you are discussing number 2.

To move your message folders else where, here are the steps:  - click 'account settings' and then click the 'server settings' pane.

Note the location. - exit TB and locate the folder it will be at  c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles\&lt;profilename&gt;\Imapmail (or Mail if POP)  - COPY the folder and paste to the other drive  - restart tb, go to the same 'server settings' pane, click the 'browse' button and change the setting to point to the new location.  - exit and restart TB and verify that all is working ok.
