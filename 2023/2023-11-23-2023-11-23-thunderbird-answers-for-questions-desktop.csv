To me, the screenshot indicates that the unified Sent folder includes one gmail account and that you have selected only one account. The screen shows you selected the Sent folder, yet on my PC, the sent folder for gmail is 'Sent Mail.'  Maybe a different screenshot will help. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I can't send an expanded screenshot since the stingy settings screen only allows one line at a time to show.   </p><p>As a test, I changed my unified DRAFTS folder settings to instead select the account's SENT folder, and it worked as expected by pulling in the contents of the account's SENT folder into the unified DRAFTS folder.  I next reversed the test by changing the unified SENT folder settings to instead select the account's DRAFTS folder, and that worked as expected since all the account's draft messages showed in the unified SENT folder.  The unified settings seem to work for other folders but not the correct ones!  This seems to show that the account and unified folder's themselves aren't the problem.   I'm thinking there's some sort of hinky technical bug at work here.  What do you think? </p>",James-A,false,0,0

This had the effect of filtering out all the messages without any indication that this was happening.  By simply removing this filter setting, I was able see all the messages in the unified SENT folder as expected.  The tests above worked since the DRAFTS messages were unread.  However, I noticed 3 messages in DRAFTS were 'read' and that's what clued me in to what was going on when I re-did the tests and noticed 3 draft messages were missing in the unified SENT folder.   So.......problem solved.  Thanks for your help. ps if you don't mind a personal comment, your account picture shows you're one smart canine. </p>",James-A,false,0,0
