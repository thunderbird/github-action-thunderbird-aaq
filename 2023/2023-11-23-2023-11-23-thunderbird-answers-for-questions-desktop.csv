To me, the screenshot indicates that the unified Sent folder includes one gmail account and that you have selected only one account. The screen shows you selected the Sent folder, yet on my PC, the sent folder for gmail is 'Sent Mail.'  Maybe a different screenshot will help. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I can't send an expanded screenshot since the stingy settings screen only allows one line at a time to show.   </p><p>As a test, I changed my unified DRAFTS folder settings to instead select the account's SENT folder, and it worked as expected by pulling in the contents of the account's SENT folder into the unified DRAFTS folder.  I next reversed the test by changing the unified SENT folder settings to instead select the account's DRAFTS folder, and that worked as expected since all the account's draft messages showed in the unified SENT folder.  The unified settings seem to work for other folders but not the correct ones!  This seems to show that the account and unified folder's themselves aren't the problem.   I'm thinking there's some sort of hinky technical bug at work here.  What do you think? </p>",James-A,false,0,0

This had the effect of filtering out all the messages without any indication that this was happening.  By simply removing this filter setting, I was able see all the messages in the unified SENT folder as expected.  The tests above worked since the DRAFTS messages were unread.  However, I noticed 3 messages in DRAFTS were 'read' and that's what clued me in to what was going on when I re-did the tests and noticed 3 draft messages were missing in the unified SENT folder.   So.......problem solved.  Thanks for your help. ps if you don't mind a personal comment, your account picture shows you're one smart canine. </p>",James-A,false,0,0

When thread expanded the new email itself will be white bold font and yellow new star, but any that are not new but are unread will be bold white font - no star. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> If you have collapsed thread which has no new mails then it will be: top level email white normal font - not bold and not underlined. </p><p>Additional: If a single email not threaded: If new - white bold font and yellow star If not new but unread - white bold font If read - normal white font. </p><p><br> Your situation seems to imply you are discussing number 2. In which case top level emails are underlined. So you look for the one which is underlined and expand it. </p><p>OR You could use the quick method: Use the 'Quick Filter'  if not enabled: Click on 'Quick Filter' button to see the 'Quick Filter Bar' click on the 'Show only unread messages' envelope icon. Click on same icon again to go back to normal. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Yes, if two IMAP accounts on the same PC are the same account, then it's safe to remove one account and lose no messages.  I suggest leave the old PC alone and start fresh. If she has an addressbook on the old machine, that can be copied to the new PC. That may not be important, so I won't delve into details unless asked. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Deletion locally will not affect the server data. </p><p>to clarify: "" I suggest leave the old PC alone and start fresh"" </p><p>when i download Thunderbird to the new machine and use the email address applicable to my BT server, only one set of local folders &amp; current messages will appear on the new machine/new Thunderbird app.... because the server is not interested if i have 2 or 10 named accounts with the same email address on the local machine. </p><p>We would very much welcome any guidance on migrating the address book. </p><p>David, thank you so much </p>",stepphen1,false,0,0
