Please post info requested about Screen resolution and scale for both monitors. Thunderbird uses 'pixels' to determine Font size - not points.  The size of 'a pixel' is determined by the screen resolution in combination with the scale. In the same way if you change the screen resolution or scale you will find the view you see will alter because you have changed the given pixel size used by the monitor. The more pixels you fit into a given space means the pixel size is reduced.  </p><p>Thunderbird has no idea what everyone uses when it comes to screen resolution and scale, so it has the ability to be modified.  </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:p.s.: I tried to upload two pdf images but they were refused (why only accept jpg&nbsp;?)</em> Because pdf is not an image file it's in a portable document format.

To move your message folders else where, here are the steps:  - click 'account settings' and then click the 'server settings' pane. The bottom line shows the location of the message folders for the account. Note the location. - exit TB and locate the folder it will be at  c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles\&lt;profilename&gt;\Imapmail (or Mail if POP)  - COPY the folder and paste to the other drive  - restart tb, go to the same 'server settings' pane, click the 'browse' button and change the setting to point to the new location.  - exit and restart TB and verify that all is working ok. You can now delete the original folder - Now, at end of each year, you could copy the folder on the other drive and rename it </p><p>Side note: I encourage all users to periodically copy the c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird folder to external drive, such as a USB stick.

I am very far from being an expert in anything to do with computers, but anyway, here is how I fixed it. I took a guess that I might find something to do with file paths in the Thunderbird hidden folders, and I did.  I found a folder called   'jzlrnnn0.default-release' . Inside that one I found a file called   'folderTree.json'   and discovered I could open and read it in a plain text editor.  In that file I found the file path going to the inbox, and it was going via the trash folder    ....../Trash/Inbox  . So I made a copy of that file and then modified the path in the original file by simply deleting the   /Trash  portion and saved.    When I opened Thunderbird,  BINGO!  the Inbox was back where it used to be, with none of its contents disturbed.  Problem solved.  So I went back and deleted the copy of the file.  How it got messed up in the first place I do not know. </p>",barbara_hodgkinson,false,1,0

Hover mouse cursor over the top edge of the composing area (or you could say it was the bottom edge of Formatting bar) and cursor should change to double arrow head icon - left click hold down and drag upwards. This means the 'TO' area gets compressed in size and forces a scroll bar to appear. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0

But the issue exists when I am using CC or BCC boxes as well, so that is not relevant. </p><p>I tested the suggestion you have made, and I can get to the point of having the double arrow head icon, but clicking and dragging upwards does nothing. The line that is meant to move upwards stays in the same place, and the To (or CC or BCC) area stays enlarged. I had actually already tried that, as that was the solution in all the previous versions of TB, so it was the first place I went to try to fix it. </p>",pandf,false,0,0

With your help I have solved it. </p><p>In troubleshoot mode, the address box worked as it does for you (as it should, I suppose). Yet, none of the Addons seemed to make a difference,  so I turned to the Userchrome. After much disabling and enabling, I had a result with the following code: </p><pre>/* 12. Whole Header Box with From &amp; To Subject Cc etc. b-ground &amp; text */ </pre> <ol><li>MsgHeadersToolbar  { </li></ol> <pre>   height:           min-content&nbsp;!important;  padding-block:    0px        &nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>}  </p><p>(adding it here for the benefit of anyone else looking at the same problem). </p><p>This came from a long thread on a site called ElevenForum, of which this was only a minor code amongst a set of about twelve to make the Write box in TB work more like it previously did, and I just added the whole lot together. When I used it, that part of the code was originally to change the background colour of the To box and the text to white. I didn't like that look, so I had deleted the background color and text color lines, leaving what is above. </p><p>After testing now, that residual code makes no difference to the appearance, but it does stop the double arrow line working properly, so I have just got rid of it. Therefore, problem solved! </p><p>I will mark your response as the solution, as it set me on the right track and hopefully anybody else who needs this information will read it all. </p>",pandf,false,0,0
