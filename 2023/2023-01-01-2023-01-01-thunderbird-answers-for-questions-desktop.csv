But I had so carefully tried to set it up as IMAP.   And I was able to repeat the problem.  I tried to set up a second account with the same mail server, being very careful that it was IMAP and repeatedly checking, only to find that it again changed to POP3 at the very last moment.  </p><p>On that second occasion, when I first tested a connection, with security autodetected, it set SMTP to ""no security.""  So I set SMTP to SSL/TLS and, having confirmed that incoming was still IMAP, checked again. When I confirmed the dialogue, Thunderbird started connecting and downloading mail as POP3 before I had the chance to stop it.  It never occurred to me that a client would silently make such a fundamental change. </p><p>But I decided to have one more go and this time it worked.  The only difference was that, having selected IMAP, I left the port numbers blank.  So it seems that it will set port 993 itself but somehow fails when I do it.  But it's worrying to find a POP3 account live, although thank goodness the default setting seems to be to leave messages on the server. </p>",TonyWoolf,false,0,0

And I do not apologize for using tools&gt;settings&gt;general, as I was responding to a Windows users. If people announce their OS when they first pose a question, I try to respond appropriately, but I also must assume that persons using other Os's can figure that out. People here who respond to questions are using their personal time to assist, and people posing questions need to be a bit more tolerant and more willing to do a modicum of research. Incidentally, Tools&gt;settings&gt;general is current for 102 and *does* exist, contrary to your assertion that it does not.  </p><p>On your questions, if you're wanting to send a large font to a recipient with poor eyesight, focus on changing font in compose window or in settings&gt;composition. If your concern is on font size for yourself and you send messages in plain text, then the settings are in settings&gt;general (fonts&amp;colors). Info on that is below, text I sent on a prior request:  </p><p>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. Your selected font in prior steps will show. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </p><p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML, none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. </p>",davidsk,false,4,0

It does NOT exist for any Windows OS user. I notice you have not mentioned what operating system you are using.  As the majority of users use a  Windows OS, you will find all comments will refer to a Windows OS unless the person with the issue specifies what OS they are using so comments can be tailored.  </p><p>Note&nbsp;: 'Settings' is also available in the 'Spaces Toolbar' - the vertical toolbar on the left side, look near the bottom for the gear wheel 'Settings' icon. </p><p>'Medium' font refers to use whatever the Thunderbird program is set up to use. It is not a specific point size and never has been. This means whatever is set up as Medium on your Thunderbird is not necessarilly set up as Medium for the recipient. </p><p>It is strongly advised you do not preset specific font sizes in emails you send because you have no idea what someone else's computer is set up to use.  eg: a MAC will have a monitor/screen that has more pixels per space than eg: a typical Window OS, so setting a pixel size will appear visually a smaller font size.  </p><p><br> </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Under 'Language &amp; appearance' </li><li> click on 'Advanced' to see 'Fonts &amp; Encodings' </li></ul> <p>This area is dealing with the display of Incoming emails. You should set up the 'Fonts for' for both 'Latin' and 'Other writing Systems' to be the same and also any other that you may be using. </p><p><em>re:When I set Fonts &amp; Colors to Default (DejaVu Sans), size 16 (what?), it reverts to sans-serif (is that the correct behavior?),</em> </p><p>If Proportional is set to use 'Sans Serif'  - that is the default and it uses whatever you choose as the 'Sans-Serif. If you choose the 'Sans-serif' to be 'DejaVu Sans', the it uses 'DejaVu Sans' as the  Propertional 'Sans-Serif' - so yes it is correct. </p><p>But it does depend upon whether you have also selected 'Allow messages to use other fonts' - that will effect what is displayed in received emails. </p><p>As all fonts vary, the size of what you deem as a good size will vary visually depending upon the acual font chosen.  Thunderbird font sizes are in pixels - (not points which you may be accustomed to if using Microsoft products like Word.) So 12pt = 16px This link may help explain more on this: <a href=""https://blog.gimm.io/difference-between-pixel-px-and-point-pt-font-sizes-in-email-signatures/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.gimm.io/difference-between-pixel-px-and-point-pt-font-sizes-in-email-signatures/</a>  </p><p>The size you choose will be deemed as 'Medium' for you. Please note this is talking about emails you receive and send.  So if the 'Proportional Sans Serif font is set at Size 16 then that is the 'Medium' font size and larger or smaller as chosen in the 'Write' composing window is based on 16 being the medium. </p><p>The Minimum font size will also effect anything you receive or the smallest size you can send. So if you set Miminum Font size as 12, then any incoming mail which has tried to use something smaller eg: 10, then that 10 will get displayed as a 12. </p><p><br> </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; Composition </li><li> Under 'HTML Style' section </li><li> Advise you use 'Variable Width' and 'Size: Medium </li></ul> <p>Then it does not dictate what your recipient is forced to see. They can set up their display to whatever font and font size they prefer. Remember, people use different screen resolutions and that effects the size of a pixel. In Thunderbird you can also dictate the pixel size of what is visually displayed. </p><p>Please note not everyone has the same fonts on their computer, so choose something that is generally usually available on most systems. </p><p>When email is sent it does not set a specific size, it just sends 'medium'. If you sent an email to me using 'Variable Width' and 'Size: Medium </p><p>Then I can tell you it would display using Arial font and Medium would be 14px because the email is allowing me that freedom to use what I set up in Thunderbird. </p><p>The point is this, you can choose what you want to see, but it is best to send email which allows the recipient to choose what they prefer to see. </p><p><br> </p><p>When it comes to printing then what gets printed also depends upon what scale you are using. This has always been the case no matter what you print and I'm not just talking about Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,2,0

Your concern of helping users appreciate and understand changes is a high priority, and this forum is part of that strategy. The beauty of open-source products is that they are more likely to continue evolving than proprietary products. One of the challenges of providing assistance is that many websites with no tie to Thunderbird have published their own tips on using Thunderbird, tips that are now many years out-of-date. This forum serves as a clearing house, although many questions do go unanswered.  Your donations are much appreciated. Donating is the best way to see Thunderbird continue to improve.

Thunderbird itself can be set up to minimise to Tray, but it does not control how other programs open.  The application/program which you use to view the mp4 files...eg: Windows Media Player, the VLC media player, QuickTime Player, etc.....is that program set up to run minimised to tray&nbsp;? </p><p>For whatever program you have set up to open mp4 files: </p> <ul><li>     Right-click on program's shortcut on your desktop or in File Explorer. </li><li>     Click on Properties.

There is no way I see to get to ""Properties"". It opens mp4 files that I have on my computer just fine. I have tried different default media players with the same result.  Also .jpg files open minimized if they are an attachment.  Is Thunderbird tied to Firefox in some way that there could be something in Firefox? </p>",ronmauer2,false,0,0
