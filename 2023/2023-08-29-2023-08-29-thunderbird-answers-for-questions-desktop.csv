Mi hai indicato di provare a utilizzare il protocollo CALDAV, ma riguarda il calendario e non i contatti o sbaglio? Non ho nessun problema con i calendari ma vorrei sincronizzare i contatti e non trovo la soluzione. La versione 115 permette di utilizzare tbsync e tb4sync? Nel caso posso tornare dalla versione 117.0b6 alla 115 conservando la configurazione? Grazie </p>",antonio.lisi,false,0,0
