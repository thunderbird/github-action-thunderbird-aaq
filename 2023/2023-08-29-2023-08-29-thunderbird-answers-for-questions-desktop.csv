Dopo averla inserita ho ho visto che tu parlavi della sincronizzazione dei contatti mentre ad una prima lettura io avevo capito ti riferissi alla sincronizzazione dei calendari. Da qui la mia risposta su CALDav. Che ovviamente non è pertinente al tuo caso. </p><p>Per il discorso delle versioni, non è un problema di stabilità. Il fatto è che la 117b non diventerà mai una versione stabile. La prossima versione stabile -salvo cambiamenti- sarà la 128 nella primavera del 2024. Fino ad allora ci saranno gli aggiornamenti della versione 115 ed una serie di alfa/beta con numeri progressivi.  </p><p>Gli sviluppatori di estensioni di solito si concentrano sulle sole versioni stabili per cui se gli autori di tbsync e tb4sync rimetteranno mano alle rispettive estensioni è facile pensare che supporteranno la 115 stabile, più improbabile che coprano anche le beta. Comunque per rispondere alla tua domanda, tbsync al momento non è è compatibile con Thunderbird 115; invece se per tb4sync intendi ""<strong>Google-4-TbSync</strong>"" (<a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/it/thunderbird/addon/google-4-tbsync/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/it/thunderbird/addon/google-4-tbsync/</a>) questa è stata già aggiornata per lavorare con Thunderbird 115. </p>",@next,false,0,0

Mi hai indicato di provare a utilizzare il protocollo CALDAV, ma riguarda il calendario e non i contatti o sbaglio? Non ho nessun problema con i calendari ma vorrei sincronizzare i contatti e non trovo la soluzione. La versione 115 permette di utilizzare tbsync e tb4sync? Nel caso posso tornare dalla versione 117.0b6 alla 115 conservando la configurazione? Grazie </p>",antonio.lisi,false,0,0
