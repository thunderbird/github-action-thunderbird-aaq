I am tired of checking all my spam every day, to be sure that a wanted email is placed there. I want my T-BIrd to receive all spam, and use T-BIrd's rules to then firmly isolate, or even delete, specific spam that I receive. </p><p>I've set up four email accounts, using a Global Inbox, so everything is together. While I had been using IMAP with Outlook, I understand I need to use Pop3 for this to work with Thunderbird, so I did that. But.... </p><p>I am getting some emails with Thunderbird, but not all, even those addressed to me. Will leaving Outlook open during this transition period prevent T-Bird from working properly? Likewise, can <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> be open when trying to debug messages? I just sent myself a gmail message, which was received in Outlook, but not in T-Bird (and I couldn't find it in Gmail either, which is /really/ confusing). </p><p>Oh, shoot, I tried sending mail using my Gmail account from Thunderbird, and it failed. I went to look up Server settings for Gmail with T-Bird, and the article said I'd have to use IMAP, which I cannot use if I want to have the Global Inbox. So, is use of T-Bird dead for me, if I require/desire a Global inbox? </p><p>Of the emails I've received so far, only one is marked by T-Bird as Junk, which I can identify by the red color, and when I click on it, I have a ""Not Junk"" button. But there is no Junk folder, which is where I thought it would be. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1614797;1614829;1614831;1614847;,rraisley
