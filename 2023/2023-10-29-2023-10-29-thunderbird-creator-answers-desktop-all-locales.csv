That was the ability, when in a message, to click on 'More' top right and then 'open message in conversation' or something like that - to see all exchanges with a particular sender. I've searched the help database and found people had similar problems - some of the answers seem to be about large accounts - but I'm just not clear on what might be the cause in my case. Advice welcome. Thanks Siobhán </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1614532;,siobhan2
