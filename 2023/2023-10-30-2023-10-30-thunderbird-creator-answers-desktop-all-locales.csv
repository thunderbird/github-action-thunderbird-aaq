I went to look up Server settings for Gmail with T-Bird, and the article said I'd have to use IMAP, which I cannot use if I want to have the Global Inbox. So, is use of T-Bird dead for me, if I require/desire a Global inbox? </p><p>Of the emails I've received so far, only one is marked by T-Bird as Junk, which I can identify by the red color, and when I click on it, I have a ""Not Junk"" button.

I click on one account and use the search feature (CTRL-K) to look for messages sent from a particular contact, ""Kevin"". Thunderbird shows a list of all messages that ""mention"" the name Kevin. I click on the contact in the list so that I can see all the email from the particular Kevin that I'm interested in. Thunderbird opens a new window with email previews of sent/received from that contact. </p><p>...But that's where it ends. I can't select any single email. Right-clicking the preview does nothing. I can't expand the preview to see the entire email. If I click the highlighted subject line link, Thunderbird opens yet another window which shows the subject line and ""0 messages"". There is no message text displayed. If I click ""Show results as a list"", Thunderbird opens a window with just one line which reads ""Search 0 Messages"". I can't even highlight the email address of that contact and copy/paste it into a new message! </p><p>This makes the Search function completely useless! I can see that messages from this contact exist, but I can't get to them without manually scrolling back through (maybe years of) messages to find the one I'm looking for. </p><p>What am I doing wrong... or is this a problem with Thunderbird? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jyunte

Immessa la password l'account ha cominciato a funzionare nuovamente, ma dopo aver fatto ciò l'archivio delle e-mail era completamente sparito. Per gli altri account configurati nessun problema. Perchè è successo questo? E soprattutto come si fa ora a recuperare l'archivio? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,"",fpisani68
