I went to look up Server settings for Gmail with T-Bird, and the article said I'd have to use IMAP, which I cannot use if I want to have the Global Inbox. So, is use of T-Bird dead for me, if I require/desire a Global inbox? </p><p>Of the emails I've received so far, only one is marked by T-Bird as Junk, which I can identify by the red color, and when I click on it, I have a ""Not Junk"" button.
