Before I updated Thunderbird yesterday, the card view of emails took 2 lines: - one line for sender and date - one line for the text preview and a star </p><p>But since I updated yesterday, the cards now take approximately 3 lines, the star and text being at different levels. I did not find any setting to revert that change. It kinda feels like a CSS bug since I don't understand why someone would want to lose that much space. Any way to fix it? </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1614704;,xyves44x
