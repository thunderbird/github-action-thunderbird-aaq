This caused me not to be able to download or send messages for one of my accounts. </p><p>I have backups of virtually all of my files, but I don't know what file to look for in order to find this configuration data.  Can you tell me the directory/filename that I should restore to get back to where I was before I made the changes?

People recommended downgrading to 102, so I downloaded and re-installed that version, after deleting the file that was recommended from the Thunderbird folder (now I can't find the name of it!).  </p><p>When I installed 102, it gave me the profile error message. I started to create a new profile and realized that will take me hours probably - I have multiple folders and email addresses in TB.  So I decided to reinstall 115, and now it looks like there is no data at all. Help! </p><p>I'm using Windows 8. </p><p>Thanks </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",DD46

Before I updated Thunderbird yesterday, the card view of emails took 2 lines: - one line for sender and date - one line for the text preview and a star </p><p>But since I updated yesterday, the cards now take approximately 3 lines, the star and text being at different levels. I did not find any setting to revert that change. It kinda feels like a CSS bug since I don't understand why someone would want to lose that much space. Any way to fix it? </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1614704;1614734;,xyves44x
