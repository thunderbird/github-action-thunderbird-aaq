Now when I return to them they are blank. I can read newly opened emails that I left open, but not the old ones. Is there any way I can read the emails that I had left open prior to Supernova? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rumiandme153

I have had multiple problems with this new version 115.3.1 (32-bit).  Very frustrated.  </p><p>I am using a gmail account and thunderbird as client. When I recreated IMAP account to new profile, it makes EVERY correspondent the same person. I use the account for forum emails from an organization where like professionals share information and it is private. The new profile takes the name of one member and puts that in all prior emails, rather then having the correct sender name. I had no problem with my prior profile and cant figure out why Thunderbird is doing this??  I a different email account it did the same thing with a different organization and it put same correspondent name on most, but not all group emails.  </p><p>I am guessing its how thunderbird is reading the message source code. Shouldn't it be taking it from the ""FROM"" tag in it.  </p><p>I appreciate any suggestions or comments. I still have my old profile and can use that with no problem. Also gmail online email stuff is fine, so it has to be Thunderbird that is deciding to input one correspondent's name for forum email. I don't understand why or how to fix.  </p><p>Thank you </p><p>Matthew </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",MSKHawaii
