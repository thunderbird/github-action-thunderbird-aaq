A previous asking of this same question lead me to attempt to install the 'replywithheader' add-on but it hangs with the ""Add ReplyWithHeader? This extension will have permission to: .... Cancel Add"" popup box ... It doesn't matter if I click either Cancel or Add, the box just hangs there.  Or is there some other way of removing the vertical lines?  One might have thought this would be an easily accessible option in the setup. </p><p>Thing is that I'm working on a rather long report with other people and we email changes back and forth but each time another vertical line is added.  How to nuke ALL the vertical lines?  How to stop them from being added in the first place? </p><p>I understand that what displays as vertical line is really a '&gt;' character in the actual text of the message.  If I could figure out where the actual messages are stored I could maybe just delete the '&gt;' characters, perhaps? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1570228;1570250;1570317;1570347;,rayandrews
