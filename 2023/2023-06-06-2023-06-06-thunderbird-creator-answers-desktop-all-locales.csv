I attempted to set an end date for the appointment again but the calendar became corrupted once again. I am attaching a screenshot of what the calendar looked like after trying to set an end date for an appointment.

Avrei bisogno di eliminare questa scritta e che dunque l'email venga inviata con l'oggetto impostato nel modello. Sarebbe possibile? </p><p>Nell'immagine 1 ho creato un filtro che in poche parole dice a Thunderbird: quando in posta in arrivo attivo l'etichetta ""Completato"" tu ogni 10 minuti rispondi con il modello: ""Quante stelle darebbe..."" </p><p>Nell'immagine 2 mostro il modello che ho creato e dunque con questa email Thunderbird dovrà rispondere automaticamente al mittente. </p><p>Nell'immagine 3 infine mostro il problema ovvero nella cartella di posta inviata troviamo due email: la prima, quella del 01/06/2023, 23:57 è stata inviata automaticamente da Thunderbird che ha applicato il filtro e ha anteposto la scritto ""Auto:"" dinanzi all'oggetto. La seconda email invece, quella del 01/06/2023 delle ore 23:49 è stata inviata manualmente e difatti l'oggetto è così come impostato nel modello. Io vorrei togliere quella scritta ""Auto:"" che Thunderbird antepone all'oggetto perché l'invito alla recensione, così come viene spedito in automatico da Thunderbird, non viene recepito da Trustpilot e dunque non programmato in inviti automatici dello stesso Trustpilot, qui entriamo nel difficile (per me) ma è importante eliminare quella scritta ""Auto:"". Sarebbe possibile? </p><p>Grazie a tutti per l'attenzione </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1584304;,realfabry
