I think it would be reasonable to conclude that the phone was deleting the email off the server either because it was set up as a pop account and did not leave copies on server or because it was set up as imap and you were removing the emails to clear the clutter and not realising they were being deleted off the server.  </p><p>Imap accounts created on any device all connect to the server and can only show what is on the server.

Not IMAP so most of the advice about IMAP and IMAP ports will not work out.  I would not generally expect a server mane with IMAP in it to work for POP,  but if the same server is used for both it might.  But using the IMAP port of 993 is almost certainly not going to work. 2. Your provider (who I can not find on the web offering information about email) can tell you the correct server name, port number and connection security for your POP mail account.  I did try looking up setting on the web,  but unfortunately they are so focused on selling me  something I have to give then your zip to even gain access to their support pages.  Pretty shoddy really. 3.

This is especially so as the server is considered canonical.  So if your provider removes your account all the local mail will be removed on the next synchronization.

You close your account with the provider and thunderbird complains it can not connect to the provider.

Personally I rely on making copies of mail in the ""local folders"" account as that is entirely local and unlinked in any way to any incoming mail account.
