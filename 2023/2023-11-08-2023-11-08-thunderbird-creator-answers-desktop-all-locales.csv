I know they should be in C:\users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles. Btw, the AppData folder only showed after I told Explorer to show Hidden files; any help should note this. I found that folder with 2 subfolders; 1 was iup3xrv2.default-release which seemed to have the only relevant content - Mail\2023 and \2023.msf. Those appear to be the Local Folder (2023) I set up to receive my archived emails. But when I tried to open them, an email opened with an attachment that Thunderbird could not open. I would like to be able to access the archived emails through Explorer so I can mass delete, search, rename, see file size etc. Please explain and help. Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",davidob1996

Create it directly in Thunderbird, it's also impossible.

Strange thing, it works, but it can't be like that.

Pole rychlého filtru se přesunulo na horší místo, tlačítka rychlých filtrů apod. změnila vzhled. Namísto původního přehledného vybarvení tlačítka se na každém objevila jakási ""svítící diodka"" tak malá a nevýrazná, že její použití není na první pohled patrné. Celkově je nový skin plošší jak je dnes hloupým zvykem, ale to dovedu přežít. Jak vrátit původní rozložení a vzhled tlačítek rychlých filtrů?
