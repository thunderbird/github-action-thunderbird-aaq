I moved them but it turned them into HTML.  But I found out that the real ones were after those bad entries inside the inbox.  I know this is confusing...or was it after I restored a backup and brought it up again?  I did bring it up in Troubleshooting mode to stop the automatic fetching of accounts, but it was already changed from what I changed.  Now I really do not know where the configuration is kept.  This also screwed up my first account GMAIL Inbox (pop) and I lost everything since 07/2023.  The control file must have gotten messed up because all my changes to fonts were gone.  Also my storage folder location seemed to have been changed to another drive, which I fixed and all that came back.  I backup the whole folder in Roaming and The TBird folder where my user files are kept on another drive.  The whole .../mail/<a href=""http://mail.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.gmail.com</a> folder lost most of it's stuff (reverted back to 07/2023 data) and I cannot find a folder that has the ""current"" data that should be in that folder.  I went back to a backup and NO backups have the complete current folder. </p><p>Also I would like to say that when the update was forced on us the other week (even though it is nice), it did not even say what it was doing.  I thought it wasn't going to come up, but it finally did. </p><p>So it seems like I lost everything since 07/17/2023 in my gmail files.  When I was looking, I did find a <a href=""http://mail.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.gmail.com</a> folder that seemed to have much more data, but now I do not know where it went and it is not in any of my backups, which is very strange.  I do have storage folders for important things and I was able to point back to it and at least I got all of those.  They are important. </p><p>I don't understand what happened.  I have not brought any emails from Gmail in since 11/07 hoping I would find the files before I drained them from Gmail.  Just using web right now.  PITA!  Anyone had this problem or can help me?  I was up for hours early this morning trying to find that stupid folder which had more data.  I know I saw it. </p><p>Thanks, Sam </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",smsterling99
