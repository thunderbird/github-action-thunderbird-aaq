I know they should be in C:\users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles. Btw, the AppData folder only showed after I told Explorer to show Hidden files; any help should note this. I found that folder with 2 subfolders; 1 was iup3xrv2.default-release which seemed to have the only relevant content - Mail\2023 and \2023.msf. Those appear to be the Local Folder (2023) I set up to receive my archived emails. But when I tried to open them, an email opened with an attachment that Thunderbird could not open. I would like to be able to access the archived emails through Explorer so I can mass delete, search, rename, see file size etc. Please explain and help. Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",davidob1996

The message window is so small that I can only see about four lines of text at a time. I can't get the messages to open in a new window unless I click on them and choose ""open in new window"" even after setting them to open in a new window on their own. </p><p>The last update fixed the font on everything from being too big in spite of settings so now I can read a little more at a time. It's still very frustrating having to scroll constantly. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",susiesmith13
