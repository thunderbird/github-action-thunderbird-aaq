Mentre hai scritto, sono riuscito a trovare con Nvda tutte le Opzioni, ho riipristinato l'ordine delle colonne ed ora va OK; l'unica cosa è che devo trovare il modo di trascinare le colonne che ho scelto per metterle dove desidero, ora comunque vanno bene dove sono. Nel caso trovassi una maniera particolare, lo farò sapere, potrebbe essere utile a tutti. Nel frattempo dico che, una volta che usando Tab si arriva al Pulsante per il Filtro Veloce, dopo tale Pulsante c'è il Pulsante per ""L'Opzione di Visualizzazione elenco Messaggi"", ancora un Tab ed avremo il Pulsante per ""Attivare/Disattivare le Discussioni""; proprio da qui, si dovrà usare la freccia orizzontale per trovare tutte le Opzioni Necessarie legate ad ""Ordina per"" e si troverà tutto ciò che hai citato tu. L'unico problema è come far interagire questi Pulsanti con il Trascinamento del Mouse di Nvda, ci proverò e farò sapere. Grazie ancora! </p>",barramaurizio68,false,1,0
