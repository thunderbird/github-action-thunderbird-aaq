Mentre hai scritto, sono riuscito a trovare con Nvda tutte le Opzioni, ho riipristinato l'ordine delle colonne ed ora va OK; l'unica cosa è che devo trovare il modo di trascinare le colonne che ho scelto per metterle dove desidero, ora comunque vanno bene dove sono. Nel caso trovassi una maniera particolare, lo farò sapere, potrebbe essere utile a tutti. Nel frattempo dico che, una volta che usando Tab si arriva al Pulsante per il Filtro Veloce, dopo tale Pulsante c'è il Pulsante per ""L'Opzione di Visualizzazione elenco Messaggi"", ancora un Tab ed avremo il Pulsante per ""Attivare/Disattivare le Discussioni""; proprio da qui, si dovrà usare la freccia orizzontale per trovare tutte le Opzioni Necessarie legate ad ""Ordina per"" e si troverà tutto ciò che hai citato tu.

If it were a public company, its stock might have tanked after this debacle. But it's more of a poorly-funded semi-volunteer effort apparently run by some people who are very sure of themselves. Overly sure. So 115 was pushed out after woefully inadequate testing. It modifies the profile formats so you can't just replace it with 102. I suppose it is theoretically possible to have a program that converts a profile from 115's format to 102's. but MZLA is not going to help with that, and neither are they releasing the information to make that easy for a third party. </p><p>The regrade (115 to 102) options that are describe here all involve having a complete backup of one's profile from 102, all the messages and other account information. You'd disconnect from the Internet, restore the old profile, install 102, do some futzing to make sure it pointed at the profile, set it to not auto update, make sure you see all your old mail and settings, then reconnect. No full backup, no luck. </p><p>I have been able to tame 115 so that (at least on Windows 10 Pro) it looks tolerable. Under the hamburger, I set Density: Compact. Font: 13point. Layout: Classic View. And a painful lot of time wasted rearranging and resizing the message pane columns, which are totally borked in the regrade to 115, and can't go back where they belong but at least won't be as bad as the default (massively wide status and tags columns, for instance). Your mileage may vary. </p>",fred37,false,1,0

I am SO sad! I have been happily using Thunderbird for YEARS and have touted it as the perfect solution to avoiding using MS garbage but that stops now. This latest update is awful. Unless I'm missing something, I used to be able to search and select if I wanted to search Subject or Body but now I can't do that and when I do search it opens a new tab with every message containing the word I searched where before it would just filter out messages not containing the word from my main mail screen. WHY????? I hate the new layout with the menus and the font is weird and hurts my eyes. I've tried changing the Density and font size but it's not helping. The search feature is really the biggest issue for me as I used it several times a day and now it's useless.

Which search function are you referring to? The Quick Filter still works. It may have gotten moved around or misplaced on your setup; Hot Mess did shuffle around a lot of displays, but it still exists. And in it, there are four buttons that show up *after* you start typing into the box: Sender, Recipients, Subject, Body. So the same functions are there as before, but the UI has been redesigned and ""cleverly"" hides part of itself until you start typing. In fact I think it works a bit better than before, because those buttons seem to have higher priority than the old ones, so they are faster to respond. </p><p>Remember, the main point of Hot Mess 115 is apparently to give programmers an opportunity to show off currently-in-demand skills to future employers. You just have to out-clever them. Which is distracting. </p><p>The other search function is the one that searches message bodies. Again it may have been moved around; I had to rearrange my toolbars to be able to find things, and the toolbar rearrangement feature is, uh, not obvious. Again, more trial and error. But I did manage to get it back onto a top bar and it works pretty much like always, which is to say it is virtually useless, as it's a really crude search. But that part is not much worse than before.  </p><p>What is worse, and weird, is that after the search gives you a list of messages, and you click on one, it no longer opens that message. It does open a new tab with just that message in it, and then you have to click on that message. I think this is a bug worth reporting, so thanks for pointing it out. Note that I always open messages in new windows, never in tabs, so anything that creates a tab is a bug. This feature seems not to be checking where messages are opened. </p><p>There are adjustments here and there that let you fix fonts to some extent, and yes you will always have to rearrange the columns in your message list, and resize them to the extent they let you, because the regrade to 115 loses all the work you did to set them up before to the way you like them. </p>",fred37,false,1,0

I generally install all updates when prompted by Ubuntu (using Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS for past 12 months; have used Ubuntu off and on since 2006), so I wasn't consciously seeking to upgrade Thunderbird, with which I had no complaints.  Some specifics: </p><p>1. I was previously unaware of the concept of ""Density,"" so I don't know whether this is new or not.  After upgrade, I became immediately aware that folder layouts were more vertically squeezed (tighter leading, in old typographic terms).  I eventually discovered that the upgrade had moved me to ""Compact"" density rather than ""Default.""  Problem:  ""Compact"" density meant that when, starting from the folder pane on the left, I clicked within the pane for a given folder, the display for the folder did <strong>not</strong> move to the <strong>bottom</strong> of the pane as it always did previously.  Rather, it moved to <strong>near the bottom</strong> of the folder, meaning that I had to scroll down to reach the bottom of the folder where the newest messages are found.  Switching to ""default"" density appears to have corrected this. </p><p>2. When I click on any individual message, the point size of the body of the message is very small: approximately 4 or 5 point in traditional typographic terms.  That means I have to hit ""Ctrl-Shift=+"" multiple times to get the message up to a legible size.  This increase in body copy point size does not survive a quit-and-restart of Thunderbird. </p>",jkeenan1,false,0,0

I am just wasting time looking for how I'm supposed to do things now and I hate the clunky look. Even the toolbar icon changed (wtf!!!) and can now be easily confused with the Chromium and Discord icons when trying to work rapidly. I am a professional embedded SW engineer, using PCs to write software for things which generally don't look like computers and I'm old enough to have started my career before even MSDOS was the main OS around. Since the MSDOS days I've tended to use mostly Windows, because that's what the companies I have worked for use. MS SW is what everyone loves to hate. As an engineer, something between W2K and W7 had probably the best UI and things have just gone downhill since then, e.g. flat look with nothing to show what is a button/clickable, borderless windows with tabs which merge into each other, disappearing scroll bars, highlight colours which are so faint as to be invisible, etc. I HATE MS's pushing crappy changes and productivity degradation with each new release. The MS ribbon replacing menus is a microcosm of MS's attitude to users and I manage to mostly avoid it at all costs. I like Linux's approach to UIs. I.e. the underlying OS is not tied to any particular look and feel. I can choose which UI suits me. Why can't other software work like this? I.e. an underlying engine which does the work and a UI layer / shell which is not fixed by corporate user experience children who think they know best. Sorry for the rant, but I've been around long enough to have experienced way too many software updates which break things or reduce my productivity, not because of bugs, but because of ignorant companies pushing crap to users. Thunderbird was a long term exception to this, but looks as though is now broken. </p>",lisa112,false,1,0

Yes, Windows has gone the wrong way, I think trying to emulate the Macintosh, which is more about abstract design than actual capability. (And Mac users say that it is going down fast too.) I can see three distinct approaches to how a program selects its UI. 1) Native to the OS environment. That is, the T'bird on Windows looks like a Windows program, on Mac like a Mac program, and on Linux imports the style. 2) Platform independent. The program looks the same everywhere, not like a platform-native program. 3) The program has no specific style, and the user can select.  </p><p>Most programs nowadays are type 1, adapt to the environment. Windows users expect Windows UI. Type 2 was popular 30 years ago when you use a terminal tied to some distant computer. Lotus Notes was a good example of bringing this onto PCs, and was thus bad on everything. Type 3 is how Linux works, and geeks like it, but it makes support and learning hard for many users. </p><p>T'bird 115 is apparently an attempt to move from Type 1 to Type 2, recoding its internals so that it is platform independent, with a smaller platform-native code base. Hence it's broken on Windows because it's no longer a Windows program; it's basically a web mail program with a built-in server. Unix geeks think this is cool. Users don't. Unix geeks don't give a flying fleak what users think, since ""lusers"" are assumed to be stupider than them. They're not; they just don't waste precious brain cells on the obscurities and boys' club geekery of Unix.  </p><p>T'bird developers obviously don't pay attention to this forum. They are proud of what they did to us ""lusers"". They do read Bugzilla though. And they are probably spending more time polishing their resumes to show all of the hot-in-the-marketplace skills that they exercised in 115, recoding using the most resume-friendly tools. Even though it wasn't necessary or helpful. MZLA is apparently more of a grad school program for coders than a software business. The source code is their thesis, and they don't care how well the executable runs. </p><p>I wish somebody would take the sources to 102 and build a fork. I'd pay for it. I do have 115 mostly tamed by now but I don't trust it and I no longer trust MZLA. </p>",fred37,false,1,0

Flat UIs were an industry wide fashion, following on from earlier GUIs which used 3d to get a more real world user friendly look as display resolutions improved. I think it was more an attempt to make it more usable on tablets when tablets were fashionable, e.g. big buttons, the HUGE calculator, etc. Unfortunately non tablet users also had to put up with a degraded UI. </p><p>Thinking of which, when will 3d buttons etc. become fashionable again???

I understand that since it's a work in progress, it's not possible to remove it... but if there is no plan to allow disabling it in the future , I would be very disappointed... </blockquote> <p>Yes, this is not Microsoft. Yes, in many areas Thunderbird is highly customizable.  And there may (or may not) be a capability coming to disable the items you mention.  But I think you misunderstand the fundamental concepts of open source if your interpretation is ""a user shall always have the possibility to disable these features ... in the user interface, as provided to you in the base source code."" </p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#Computer_software"" rel=""nofollow"">Open Source</a> allows for you to have the source code so <strong>you can change the code</strong> (or ask someone else to code it for you), so that you can make the product do what you want.  But it is not to be interpreted as ""the suppliers of the code base provide UI to allow you every possible adjustment to the product behavior or UI."" </p>",wsmwk,false,0,6

So long as you choose a custom installation and put it in a folder that's different from the default folder, you can run both 102 and 115 at the same time, and that might be revealing (i.e., if mail goes out faster in 115 than in 102, TB 102 may be at fault; if they are about the same speed, it's not your 102 that's at fault.). I'm running them both at the same time right now, and using a side-by-side comparison to help me get 115 configured roughly the way I have 102 configured, with the exception of some of the great new features of 115. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0
