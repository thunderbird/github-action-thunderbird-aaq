I am having great trouble trying to restore my Address books and Mail in Thunderbird. There are multiple Profiles in my Thunderbird so picking the correct one is just a guess. Is there any chance of getting my Address book (mainly) and my Mail back? Kelvin </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",kbartlet
