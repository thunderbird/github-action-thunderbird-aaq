Here are my thoughts, as I am not aware of any official article on spam:  </p><p>Use the Thunderbird Junk filter. This is a powerful feature, but requires ongoing training. That is, it is not very helpful if you just mark junk. You need to also routinely mark what is NOT junk. This helps Thunderbird 'learn' your email. There is an excellent article on this at  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-junk-spam-messages</a>   </p><p>There are several third-party tools that may also help.  - Mailwasher is free for one account. I have used for years and it works very well - there is also spampal and spamcom that are both free to use - your email provider may have spam filtering tools that are also available  - if your email is self-hosted, then mxguarddog is also free and powerful.  </p><p>Some combination of all this may reduce your spam. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
