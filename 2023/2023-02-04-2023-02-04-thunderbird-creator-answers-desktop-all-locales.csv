I use ""Backup Using File History"". My flash drive seems to fill very quickly and upon investigation I see that the backup includes multiple, daily copies of my Gmail email inbox, sent mail, etc. I'm using TBird Ver. 102.6.1 and I have a gmail address. For example, after 1 week of daily backups, my gmail folder on the computer is 3.38 GB while the identical folder on the flash drive is 23.8 GB due to the multiple copies. I can see that each day I have a new set of gmail files while retaining all previous day's files. I'm not sure if this is a Windows issue, a gmail issue or a TBird issue.  Any advice on how to  correct this would be appreciated? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1563880;1563886;1563954;,neil.baron.1139

I'm getting 4 ""Legitimate banks will not ask you to do this"" errors every time I start up Thunderbird, and then it keeps happening if I leave it on.   </p><p>The problem is that I have carefully checked ALL of the 23 accounts that I have, and all of the 14 SMTP accounts.  They all -- apparently -- are using the new server.  It is <a href=""http://mail.mysite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mysite.com</a> everywhere I can find.  </p><p>When I check the SSL for ""<a href=""http://mail.mysite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mysite.com</a>"" on a SSL checker, it is fine. </p><p>But the error message I keep getting in Thunderbird is for the OLD host, which is ""<a href=""http://boxABCD.myhostingproviderdomain.com:2080"" rel=""nofollow"">boxABCD.myhostingproviderdomain.com:2080</a>"" </p><p>I tried calling them and explaining this and asking them to reissue the certificate, and they said my site already has its valid SSL (<a href=""http://mail.mysite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mysite.com</a>) and that's all they would do...they said it's something in my side. </p><p>My question is where can I find out which (if indeed there are any) email addresses (or could it be my Contacts list?  My Calendar??) are still trying to search for the old SSL.  I already tried clearing the cache, but it didn't help and shouldn't, since I don't think any certs are being cached. </p><p>Thank you so much for helping me figure this out. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1563959;,user239a

Working fine but I need to try the 32-bit version because I have a 32-bit ERP (""enterprise resource planning"") app that writes emails to the default, MAPI-compliant email client on my computer.

I am hoping 32-bit TB will accept these MAPI emails emanating from my old ERP. </p><p>If I uninstall 64-bit TB and install 32-bit TB, will my emails, address book, filters and the rest appear, as before, in 32-bit TB?
