Tutti gli account Outlook configurati su Thunderbird presentano lo stesso problema che invece non è presente negli account Gmail Ringrazio anticipatamente per qualsiasi suggerimento </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1600206;1600350;1600611;,led.vol

In other words, after the delete, the email that was immediately after the deleted email is not visible anywhere in the list - some nearby emails are visible instead. But if I click delete <strong>again</strong>, then the email list display corrects itself and remains correct if additional deletes are pressed. </p><p>This is intermittent in that sometimes the ""email list display after delete"" works properly and the email that followed the deleted one is still visible as expected. I have not figured out a pattern to indicate when the incorrect behavior is going to occur vs the correct behavior. It might have something to do with whether the email being deleted is near the top of the display or near the bottom but I have not figured out a consistent pattern of failure.  </p><p>Sorting by Sender if very handy to quickly remove multiple emails from the same sender by hitting a few delete keys in a row. But it is confusing when suddenly the email list display jumps around unexpectedly and the ""next"" email to be deleted is not even visible in the list. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",outback20
