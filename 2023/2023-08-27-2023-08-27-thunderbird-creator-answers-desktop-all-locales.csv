But I do not wish for it to display duplicate notifications of the emails in the Inbox. </p><p>Is this a bug that has occurred to due migrating from an older version of Thunderbird?

In other words, after the delete, the email that was immediately after the deleted email is not visible anywhere in the list - some nearby emails are visible instead. But if I click delete <strong>again</strong>, then the email list display corrects itself and remains correct if additional deletes are pressed. </p><p>This is intermittent in that sometimes the ""email list display after delete"" works properly and the email that followed the deleted one is still visible as expected. I have not figured out a pattern to indicate when the incorrect behavior is going to occur vs the correct behavior. It might have something to do with whether the email being deleted is near the top of the display or near the bottom but I have not figured out a consistent pattern of failure.  </p><p>Sorting by Sender if very handy to quickly remove multiple emails from the same sender by hitting a few delete keys in a row. But it is confusing when suddenly the email list display jumps around unexpectedly and the ""next"" email to be deleted is not even visible in the list. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",outback20

The incoming email itself is NOT corrupted: I was able to use Thunderbird to save the whole email to local disk as a .eml file and then open that saved copy in Thunderbird and access the PDF attachment. The problem is not with the IMAP server: I copied the email to a postfix server, to gmail, to <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> and to a Microsoft server, all with the same issue.
