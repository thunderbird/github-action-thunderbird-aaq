If TB is open, and I try to scan using software for printer, I get asked if I want to install software- which is already installed. I can't work this way. I am used to having Wordperfect, TB open all day and it used to be fine. I could print screen shots, Wordperfect documents, scan and email.

Since I got back on Monday (25th) I have not been able to send or receive any emails.  Nothing has been changed in the Thunderbird settings. </p><p>At first, I thought Thunderbird might need to be updates. I did an update, to no avail.  Current Thunderbird version is 115.2.3 (64bit).  My computer is running Windows 10. </p><p>I use Bitdefender for protection and I turned off the virus and firewall to see if that helped, but it didn't. </p><p>I don't believe it is my actual webmail server, as I have been able to get my wendyp emails through my Android phone and by logging into my webmail account.  I have also been able to send emails, with no issues using this method as well. </p><p>The strange thing is, I have another email address (page3@westnet.com.au) on the same Thunderbird program on my computer, and that one is having no problems whatsoever.  Again, both settings have not been touched in the past few days. </p><p>Please find attached screen shots of the alerts from my wendyp@wn.com.au account. </p><p>The first attachment is when I try to request new emails from the server on Thunderbird. </p><p>The second attachment is when I try to send an email using Thunderbird. </p><p>The third attachment are my wendyp@wn.com.au email settings, which I have not changed at all. </p><p>I hope to hear from you soon, so this can be rectified. </p><p>Thank you - Wendy Page </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1606347;1606360;1606364;1606366;,isthisurcard3

So, why the frequency of hanging slowness? It's very frustrating when you're inspired by an email message that you're quickly typing down and your thought process is rudely interrupted, because you're waiting for the Thunderbird Mail Client app to return to normal? </p><p>Is there something inherently going on in the background is that is slowing down this app's performance? It's a very bizarre problems that really affects your daily productivity and communication goals.  </p><p>Please shed insight or provide tips and/or advice.  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1614965;1615070;1615723;,MrPina
