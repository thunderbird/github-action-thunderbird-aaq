I set up the old accounts (3 of them) on the new computer from scratch.       Then later I wanted to move the old e-mails from inboxes &amp; archives &amp; drafts to the same accounts onto the new computer, and I did this by copying &amp; pasting from old to new. (Old e-mails are important to me to keep track of long term interactions with people &amp; companies.)      The result was I now have duplicates of the 3 accounts on the new installation of TBird. I would like to delete the new versions that I initially created with the installation. I've been observing, and both the new &amp; old versions of the 3 accounts are receiving new e-mails and saving them, so I believe I can delete the new accounts without losing the inboxes &amp; archives that came over from the old computer.      I've been searching the TBird help areas to no avail. But in the process I've realized I should have read them in the beginning. There's plenty of advice there that would have kept me from making this mistake.      Thanks for any help you can give me in resolving this confusing mess. </pre> <p>James Frazier, Marina, CA </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",jfra2
