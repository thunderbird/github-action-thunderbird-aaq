My suggestion is to browse the profiles in Windows file explorer to determine which have content. For example, the addressbook is abook.sqlite, and any POP accounts will be in the Mail folder, as well as any Local folders. Any IMAP accounts would be defined in the Imapmail folder. Once you know that, and the last date that folders were updated in each, you will have a better perspective on the value of each profile. For addressbook, I would search for the biggest and most recently updated one, as the tools&gt;import feature can import it into a desired new profile. If there are POP accounts, the folders in Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; can be copied into the new profile's Mail\Local folders folder (being appropriately renamed). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Instead, you must selective identify the desired folders and that must be done outside of Thunderbird. Those profiles you have may go back a long time, as Thunderbird never uses more than one. New profiles are automatically created whenever Thunderbird starts and does not 'see' an active profile. Each profile has a Mail folder and in each Mail folder are POP account folders, which each contain folders of messages. Also, each Mail folder has a Local Folders folder and there may be message folders there as well. Your challenge is to identify all of them, rename as appropriate to avoid duplication, and copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder of your active profile. That preserves all of your POP mail in local folders. You are now free to create all the missing accounts. After verifying that all is working, you can delete the other profiles.  </p><p>One more thing: each profile as an addressbook named abook.sqlite.

So, over time, the problem escalates. The issue is rather simple when there is just one profile to fix. To reconstruct all of the mail folders, do as I posted previously. For example, you may see in a profile with a mail folder such as this:  Mail\&lt;accountname&gt;\INBOX and Mail\&lt;accountname&gt;\INBOX.msf  - those two go together. If you have multiple accounts, then you will likely see multiple message folders with the same name. So, my suggestion is to rename so that you will remember, such as accountnameINBOX and accountnameINBOX.msf    - Then, when you copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder, they will be unique from other accounts. I agree it's rather a messy situation, but it has accumulated. Once done, I encourage doing a full backup. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

So check the add-on manager that it is not awaiting a restart to install an update. </p><p>I then suggest you go to the more troubleshooting information on the help menu and look in the Mail and New Accounts section to see what account are configured.   </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-06-17-00-10-08-6d1303.png""></p><p>I have included a small image of my info so you know what you are looking for.  Extra points if you copy and paste your account information into the forum as a reply so someone like myself of David can see what accounts you have configured, instead of guessing. </p><p>If your account is still configured and is otherwise causing some issue,  then the next step should be to contact the OWL support folks to see if they are aware of a similar problem. Historically they have been quite fast to reply to support requests, as well as getting update out if they are required. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Right-click on the shortcut on the desktop you just created and Select <strong>Properties</strong> Find the <strong>Target:</strong> field  and Add a <strong> -P</strong>  at the very end. It should look something like this; </p><p>""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" -P </p><p>Go to the <strong>General</strong> Tab and  change name to <strong>Profile Manager</strong> </p><p>Now this will open the Profile manager easily.  </p><p>I would go to each profile and stop them from checking for mail until you have things all sorted so that emails aren't downloaded to the wrong profile and deleted before you intended.  </p><p>You can also Make shortcuts in a similar way, and add the specific Profile to the target. With this, you can actually open two profiles at once.

It helped while I was sorting things out.  </p><p>For me, it was a bit of work redoing all the settings to match MOST of my old profile settings, but I feel it was worth it.  At the same time I was able to import and sort ALL my old Addresses in the Address books. There are a FEW address books from over the years (various versions like v2, v3, etc...).

I've just had a similar discussion with another person who was not getting a password prompt and after several checks they realised they had not properly switched off all Firewalls. It then worked so they decided to follow advise and get Thunderbird set up as an allowed program and only have one Firewall in operation. </p><p>You should have only one Firewall working on computer. If you have installed various Anti-virus then one of them may be controlling the Firewall. eg: If you use McAFee and it controls Firewall and you switch it off then the default Windows Defender may  auto switch on.  So you will still have a Firewall operating. It's also possible you have domain, public and private selections in the Firewall and you may have only switched off one of them.  So it's possible to think you have switched off Firewall, but may still have one operating. </p><p>Please make sure you have done this and it must be done for whatever program is controlling the firewall. Exit Thunderbird, access Firewall and set up thunderbird.exe as an allowed program and if using Windows Defender set it up to allow using PUBLIC. Then restart Thunderbird. </p><p>Can you please confirm - any program running Firewall has Thunderbird.exe set up as an allowed program . Please post images showing this. So we can rule this out. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

If server does not ask for password then Thunderbird does not ask for it. </p><p>However, the server should be asking for password. The question is why is the server not asking for password. </p><p>If the mail account server settings are wrong then server does not ask for password because account does not exist for wrong server settings, but you have said all server settings are now correct. I presume you have checked nothing has got messed up with stored settings. </p><p>Server may also have temp blocked access by third party if they thought you were not you and someone was trying to access the account. If blocked then it will not ask for password. </p><p>Sometimes you can logon to webmail and update password to force a change.  Sometimes server may ask for a logon using recapcha.  Google typically uses it, but I do not know if your server does hence the reset server password to see if it works. Also why I suggested to opt to save password to see if it prevents this reoccuring. </p><p>If password is saved in Thunderbird then there is no prompt for password, so usually you just need to remove the stored passwords and restart Thunderbird to force a prompt for password. But as you have no passwords stored this fix would not work in your situation. </p><p>One other possible explanation is Thunderbird not being able to get through the firewall; this would prevent server contact and no password prompt. If there has been a thunderbird update or anti-virus update, then it is possible the Firewall thinks thunderbird is a different new program or if you have altered the Firewall eg: installed an Anti-Virus that controls the Firewall. Exit Thunderbird and access the Firewall (note this may be the default computer firewall or if you have an Anti-Virus product installed then the Firewall may be access via that AV product). Reset Thunderbird as an allowed program. </p><p>If you have recently activated a VPN then this could also present a problem because servers would detect a different unknown IP address.  Server may block access because it does not expect that IP address - server thinks you are a hacker. Disable VPN. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

I looked in my profile and I do notice that the Trash file under Local Folders grew from 0KB to 20KB.  While the Trash files located in my email account folders remains at 0KB.  There is also a folder for smart mailboxes in my profile but not sure what that is honestly.  This leads me to believe they could be going to the Local Folder but I do not know how to change this and allow me to see them in the Trash icon in Thunderbird.

It may well be that only IMAP accounts let you choose where the trash goes. </p><p>IMAP accounts do not affect the folders under Local Folders in the folder pane. The IMAP server only syncs with the folders above the Local Folders ""divider."" Everything in your mail is on the server in IMAP until/unless you both delete the message and empty the trash. If you empty the trash on your TB client, that empties the Trash on your server as well. But if you delete a message locally, it goes to Trash and stays there until you Empty the Trash.  </p><p>There is a confusing folder available on some IMAP servers called something like ""Everything"" or ""All Mail"" and redundant copies of everything IMAP (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Spam) are in that folder, including Trash. Thus, it can get very large. And if you Subscribe"" to the All Mail folder (and thus put a copy in your TB client, it can take a very long time to download everything that's in Everything/All Mail, so it's best to hide that folder on the server and mark it not to be shown on IMAP. </p><p>Other than those minor complications, IMAP is by far the more modern and efficient way to handle your mail. </p><p>Come back with questions if you wish.
