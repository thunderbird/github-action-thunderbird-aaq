HELP.","<p>Can't add three existing email accounts to thunderbird. It tells me that they are not configured correctly.  These accounts were working in thunderbird until about a year ago. When I changed my computer, only two of my five accounts would add. I have been doing without them but now I need them back.  Please help me see why I can't add these three accounts. I am running Thunderbird 115.5.1 (64-bit) The accounts that I am having trouble with are .sbcglobal.net accounts.  The ones that work are a .Yahoo.com account and a .gmail.com account. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1621702;,paul.kleewein2

We'd like to move to either Google Workspace or Office 365 for email. </p><p>Considerations </p><p>[1] Our needs are simple, email and contacts. One user uses folders extensively.  [2] I have some exposure to using google workspace with thunderbird, and I'd say that's pretty smooth.  [3] I have no experience with Office 365.  [4] No one wants to move to Outlook from Thunderbird [5] We subscribe to Office 365, so google workspace would be a new cost </p><p>In researching how o365 works with Thunderbird, my conclusion is that Microsoft is still quite capable of making it less than smooth. I'd very much appreciate input from those with exposure to o365, and even more anyone that can compare the two services from the Thunderbird perspective. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",sparrowtwo
