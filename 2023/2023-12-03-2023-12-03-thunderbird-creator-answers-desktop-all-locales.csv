We need to be able to turn this off.,"<p>I've just now noticed the Threading automatic default grouping/marking of messages, and it is appalling. Thunderbird/Mozilla either needs to eliminate this (with appropriate warning notices, perhaps) or at least give us the ability to NOT link various messages. It's not only vastly annoying, it can cause severe real-world problems if anyone not in the CC or BCC fields is receiving these messages that were not intended for them. </p><p>I suppose for now, the only way to NOT link things that were never meant to be would be to change the Subject when discussing important topics. </p><p>Either that, or get a whole new mail service, which I'd prefer not to have to do. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-11550;firefox-1155;,thunderbird,set-up-email-thunderbird,en-US,1621734;,Squirebran

Click Get Messages and see no activity at all, no Error messages, no prompt for password after re-launch. Close / re-launch TB and same result. Uninstall TB and re-install TB and same result. </p><p>I finally resolved by uninstalling TB, manually deleting the profile which is not removed during uninstall. Reinstalled and same problem. Repeated again with no existing profile but with a PC re-boot in between. TB re-downloaded all emails, I had to import address books and TB worked for about 2 weeks. I do custom install to turn off remember password maintenance service leaving all others at the defaults and use manual configuration. Then advanced config to move forward since auto-detect doesn't succeed and there is no option in the initial install setup to choose password transmitted insecurely so the connection fails. It must be changed in the account settings afterwards. </p><p>Now the same problem/symptoms again. Updated to v115.05.1 from TB help menu and same result.

However, this only tripled the amounts of spam I received. Along with troubleshooting this issue, I started marking emails as ""junk"" in Thunderbird.  This has markedly reduced the spam. </p><p>I  have tried closing Thunderbird and re-opening.  Didn't help the failures. </p><p>At one point recently, I could neither receive or send emails.  After my son took a look on Teamviewer, he changed some settings in my accounts to NOT automatically download emails from accounts that no longer have service.

Changing from Normal  password to No authentication did not help. </pre> <p>In Server settings, under Security Settings, there is no choice of ""No authentication"" </p><p>This seems to me to be a bug.  I didn't make any changes in my account settings prior to this error nor prior to the arrival of all the spam. </p><p>But what did happen, which may have contributed or caused these issues is that I lost my Samsung cell phone in June of this year and did not recover it.  It was password protected but I understand that it can still be accessed.  I did not use that phone for email but my email address was probably given in it. </p><p>After writing all of this, I looked again in settings and found that, at the bottom of the menu list, is a second place for Outgoing Server (SMTP) settings.  There I found it set to my old email address - janetc@2xtreme.net.  So I changed that to <a href=""http://hughes.net"" rel=""nofollow"">hughes.net</a> (default).  I'm really confused as to why there are two places to set SMTP setting.  And they can be different????  Anyway, the change did not help.  I still cannot SEND. </p><p>This is the error message I get when attempting to send:  ""Sending of message failed.  Am error occurred while sending mail.  The mail server responded:  Authentication is required to use this service.  Please verify that your email address is correct in your account settings and try again.""  IT IS CORRECT! </p><p>ALSO, I can no longer find the place to change my primary password...  Nevermind, I found it.  I didn't realize there are two different ""Settings"" Menus.  One is in the ""pancake"" in upper right corner and seems to apply to all accounts.  The other is in the individual account settings.
