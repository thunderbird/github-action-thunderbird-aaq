We need to be able to turn this off.,"<p>I've just now noticed the Threading automatic default grouping/marking of messages, and it is appalling. Thunderbird/Mozilla either needs to eliminate this (with appropriate warning notices, perhaps) or at least give us the ability to NOT link various messages. It's not only vastly annoying, it can cause severe real-world problems if anyone not in the CC or BCC fields is receiving these messages that were not intended for them. </p><p>I suppose for now, the only way to NOT link things that were never meant to be would be to change the Subject when discussing important topics. </p><p>Either that, or get a whole new mail service, which I'd prefer not to have to do. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-11550;firefox-1155;,thunderbird,set-up-email-thunderbird,en-US,1621734;,Squirebran

We'd like to move to either Google Workspace or Office 365 for email. </p><p>Considerations </p><p>[1] Our needs are simple, email and contacts. One user uses folders extensively.  [2] I have some exposure to using google workspace with thunderbird, and I'd say that's pretty smooth.  [3] I have no experience with Office 365.  [4] No one wants to move to Outlook from Thunderbird [5] We subscribe to Office 365, so google workspace would be a new cost </p><p>In researching how o365 works with Thunderbird, my conclusion is that Microsoft is still quite capable of making it less than smooth. I'd very much appreciate input from those with exposure to o365, and even more anyone that can compare the two services from the Thunderbird perspective. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",sparrowtwo

When I click on ""Enter new password"" nothing happens, the Window to enter the new password doesn't pop up just the same error message as above appears. Already tried everything I found in the forum as I see I am not the only one with this problem but nothing helped so far. Changed from OAuth2 to Normal password, deleted the OAuth and SMTP lines in Settings-Security-Saved Passwords but no difference...
