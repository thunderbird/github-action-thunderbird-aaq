HELP.","<p>Can't add three existing email accounts to thunderbird. It tells me that they are not configured correctly.  These accounts were working in thunderbird until about a year ago. When I changed my computer, only two of my five accounts would add. I have been doing without them but now I need them back.  Please help me see why I can't add these three accounts. I am running Thunderbird 115.5.1 (64-bit) The accounts that I am having trouble with are .sbcglobal.net accounts.  The ones that work are a .Yahoo.com account and a .gmail.com account. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",paul.kleewein2
