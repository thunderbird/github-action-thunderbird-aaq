Profile files are stored separately from the Thunderbird program files. The program files are static and do not change (except when you upgrade the Thunderbird application version). Because we store profile and program files separately, you can uninstall Thunderbird without losing your messages and settings, and if something goes wrong with a Thunderbird update your information will still be available.

Re your question about manual entry, normally when I am asked for a password I let Firefox/Thunderbird create one. When updating my web and email and because BT had two passwords with the same username, I wanted to see what was happening and didn't want the hassle of having to record 16 characters, so entered each manually, it seemed a sensible idea at the time. </p>",NorJean,false,0,0

It seems that you got the correct response from this forum, however your very problem is making it (obviously) difficult to solve it this way. I wonder if you transferred to your support service the link to the original response, or the same text you pasted here: because the way it's expressed it's unfortunately rather garbled and difficult to understand - If I did not know what it is, I'd be a bit baffled too.

About answers on this forum, I'm sorry again to say that it's difficult enough to try to help people not being used to computers to do things a bit complex, but it's squared when the person has some functional problems like you have currently. It's far easier when one can do the stuff to help directly on the computer, that is, from a person that can help you immediately.

I have less than 30. </p><p>Really I do not see message filtering taking more than a few seconds,  it is the downloads that are relatively slow.  But I explicitly do not have any form of anti virus scanning my mail and I do not have them scanning the files in the Thunderbird profile folder as both things can slow things to a crawl without any meaningful increase in actual security. </p><p>If you are still using a platter disk,  your should seriously consider limiting the windows search and index service access to the profile folder as I have found that actually made Thunderbird shudder it's way through initial downloads.  Since having a SSD drive this has not really been an issue,  but that is because they are so fast,  not because the overheads are any less. </p><p>The two things I mention do not exclusively affect filtering,  but both have significant impact on performance in general and filtering by extension. </p><p>The default filters do not have an explicit, or even implied AND,  each line being considered as an additional constraint and only executed if the mail is still not meeting prior constraints (So an OR).  This can be significantly enhanced using the filtaquilla addon and javascript.  But that is much more complex than point and click filtering.  It is most certainly not for most people. </p><p>Be aware that you can filter on which address book the mail sender is in.  So if you have say a Health Providers address book,  you could filter everyone in it to a common destination.  Simply adding a new sending address to that address book would see the address automatically filtered. </p><p>It is also relevant to consider the order of execution, if your intent is to make things faster.  Filters are run in the order shown in the list,  so if you have a high volume sender (I am some mailing lists with hundreds of mails a week)  having them filtered and moved first means they are excluded from the next and subsequent filters.  So the ""lots"" of filters only get executed after most of the mail in the folder is already moved out.  That automatically means faster as they are invoked less often. </p><p>Finally </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
