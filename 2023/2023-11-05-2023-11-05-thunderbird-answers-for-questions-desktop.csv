I assume that has something with the update of the address book.  </p><p>Anyway, I will follow your instructions. I've re-purposed another PC as a test PC on which I will do this. There are too many problems with doing this on my main PC. </p><p>One of the key reasons I've had to stay with 52.9.1 is the need to be able to encrypt emails only for selected recipients without having to do multiple actions to achieve that. I've used an addon called ""Security settings from address book"" which totally automates the process. Perhaps I'm not understanding TB115 properly, but it looks on the surface as it will do what I need natively, since the addon no longer works. As this is a daily process, I can't be on a version of TB that doesn't provide that functionality, at least not without going crazy from all the extra clicks. </p><p>If TB115 doesn't support this functionality, then I'm pretty much stuffed. I'm stuck on 52 until someone writes another add on to achieve the functionality. I think I'd be waiting for a long time&nbsp;:) </p><p>So, in the mean time I would like to recover my main PC if possible. I've got everything working, though I spent all night last night on it (I didn't anticipate the restore would corrupt TB entirely so I hadn't backed up my passwords and address book so I had to do all that from scratch). It had me going for a while when trying to recreate accounts that have long since been retired, then I found that if I didn't enter a password I could create the account. I need to preserve all emails from all accounts for legal reasons. </p><p>So, as it stands now I have got 52.9.1 almost back to where it was.  </p><p>Except for the theme. All I have is a sickly blue color on the top. I have all the original profiles, so is there a way I can copy the theme from the old profile, or perhaps set a background for the tab/address/menu bar area? </p>",citizen1138x,false,0,0

If you have concerns about 115, my suggestion is to first download the portable version, setup an account, and test the features you want.

The other addons I use are not supported past v60, one is not supported past 52.9.1. </p><p>In any case, all of your suggestions are good and I now have a PC I've set up to test all of this. I should have done that in the first place instead of blindly trusting things would b OK and that a restore would bring me back to where I started if needed. </p><p>Right now though, I've put 115 on the back burner.

I understand that you've encountered an issue with the new version 115.4.1 (32-Bit) of Mozilla Thunderbird, where the focus is not on the last-read mail when reopening a mailbox. This can indeed be frustrating as it disrupts your workflow. </p><p>To address this issue, there are a few things you can try: </p><p>Check for Updates: First, make sure that you are using the latest version of Thunderbird. Sometimes, updates come with bug fixes and improvements. Visit the official Mozilla Thunderbird website to ensure you have the most recent version: <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/download"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Thunderbird Download</a>....<a href=""https://leshorairepriere.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">,</a> , </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-preferences-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">Reset Preferences</a> Reset Preferences: If updating doesn't resolve the issue, you can try resetting Thunderbird's preferences. This can often help with quirky behavior. Please be cautious and back up your important data before proceeding. Instructions for resetting preferences can be found on the official Mozilla support page: Resetting preferences. </p><p>Add-ons and Extensions: Sometimes, conflicts with add-ons or extensions can cause unexpected behavior. Disable your extensions one by one to see if any of them are causing the issue. </p><p>Provide Feedback: It's also a good idea to report this issue to Mozilla. Your feedback can help them identify and resolve the problem in future updates. You can provide feedback here: <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/feedback/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Thunderbird Feedback</a> Mozilla Thunderbird Feedback. </p><p>I hope these suggestions help you resolve the focus issue you're experiencing in Thunderbird.
