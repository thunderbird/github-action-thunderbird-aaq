I understand that you've encountered an issue with the new version 115.4.1 (32-Bit) of Mozilla Thunderbird, where the focus is not on the last-read mail when reopening a mailbox. This can indeed be frustrating as it disrupts your workflow. </p><p>To address this issue, there are a few things you can try: </p><p>Check for Updates: First, make sure that you are using the latest version of Thunderbird. Sometimes, updates come with bug fixes and improvements. Visit the official Mozilla Thunderbird website to ensure you have the most recent version: <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/download"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Thunderbird Download</a>....<a href=""https://leshorairepriere.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">,</a> , </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-preferences-fix-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">Reset Preferences</a> Reset Preferences: If updating doesn't resolve the issue, you can try resetting Thunderbird's preferences. This can often help with quirky behavior. Please be cautious and back up your important data before proceeding. Instructions for resetting preferences can be found on the official Mozilla support page: Resetting preferences. </p><p>Add-ons and Extensions: Sometimes, conflicts with add-ons or extensions can cause unexpected behavior. Disable your extensions one by one to see if any of them are causing the issue. </p><p>Provide Feedback: It's also a good idea to report this issue to Mozilla. Your feedback can help them identify and resolve the problem in future updates. You can provide feedback here: <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/feedback/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla Thunderbird Feedback</a> Mozilla Thunderbird Feedback. </p><p>I hope these suggestions help you resolve the focus issue you're experiencing in Thunderbird. If you need further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask. </p>",theskillsup,false,2,1
