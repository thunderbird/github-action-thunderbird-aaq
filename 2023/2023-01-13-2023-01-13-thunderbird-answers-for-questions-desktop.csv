That would be typlcal for a small business where customers write to info.  </p><p>If that is the case, the only account you need is the zoe account, as keeping the info account will cause you to receive messages to info in both accounts. The SMTP server setup needs to use the zoe email account and the account setup needs (as you did) an identity for info. In your cpanel, you need to have info set as a forwarder to zoe.  </p><p>With this setup, when a person writes to info, the account cpanel forwards to zoe, and the message is retrieved by the zoe account. Since you have info as an identity, you have the option of replying as zoe or info.

I did download the fresh copy of Thunderbird onto the new machine before copying and pasting the profile from the old computer. Here's what I have: 1.  The fresh copy of TB did create what you called a dummy profile. It was named kixomwm3.default-release </p><p>2.  When I open the new TB and go to the troubleshooting info page, and choose Profile Folder, it opens to that same folder, namely, Thunderbird &gt; Profiles&gt; kixomwm3.default-release&gt;, and in fact, I can see all the data from my old machine in that subfolder. </p><p>3.  When I go to the troubleshooting info page and click on About Profiles (near the bottom of the list) it lists 2 profiles.  The first is <em>Profile:  default-release</em> It says Default profile=yes, and lists the root and local directories as kixomwm3.default-release.  The second is ""Profile: default"".  It says Default profile=no and lists the root and local directories as a different folder that is almost empty (it only contains 2 files: parent.lock and times.json) </p><p>In summary, everything seems to look as I would expect it to. The only thing wrong is that when I open TB, it goes to the pages you get when starting to use TB for the first time; that is, 2 tabs:  Account Setup, and Home ""Welcome to Mozilla Thunderbird--Choose what to set up"" </p><p>I am so frustrated!  What am I doing wrong?? </p>",mfsilver,false,0,0

That may be a clue.   </p><p>If that isn't possible, it may be time to create a fresh profile. In your copied profile, you have your addressbook (abook.sqlite) and your message folders. If IMAP, they will be recreated automatically. If POP, I suggest creating the account, but omit password to ensure it doesn't attempt to download messages yet. Then, with Thunderbird not running, copy all content from the ....Mail\account\ folder to the corresponding Mail\account\folder, overlaying the default content. The addressbook can be copied to the profile, replacing the default. If there were folders in Mail\Local folders folder, copy those as well. Now restart thunderbird and check that all is okay. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

With the TB import tool, when I am choosing what to display: name, address, etc., I do not see any information for the first contact other than first name, last name and that is all that shows up in the new address book in TB. No matter what I choose in the drop down boxes for addresses or emails, nothing shows up.  I appreciate the help more than you could know.
