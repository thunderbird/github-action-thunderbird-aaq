The only common denominator that I see is the server. A lot more info would be needed to show otherwise. And it would be difficult to be doing something about it when it's not confirmed on the problem. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0

But strangely, in TB version 115 my Inbox appears with 3 subfolders: the two Gmail accounts I have and ""Local Folders"", but not the three non-Gmail accounts I have. Isn't that strange? </p><p>In addition, I noticed that the Drafts folder has four subfolders: 3 for my non-gmail accounts plus ""Local Folders"". The two gmail accounts do not appear here. Same with Templates and Sent. </p><p>The Junk folder has one subfolder: ""Local Folders"" </p><p>And Trash has no subfolders. </p><p>I can drag and drop a message into Draft/Local Folders. But I can't drag and drop a message into Trash. </p><p>When I delete a message the status bar message ""1 message moved from Inbox to Trash"" is displayed. So Thunderbird is obviously trying to move the message there, but fails for some reason. </p><p>Another hint for solving the mystery might be that a couple of months ago (still under a 9x version) I had tried to run my gmail accounts on IMAP. It worked, but had some interferences with my other devices. So I switched them back to POP3. Perhaps that action left some strange residue data in the account settings. </p><p>Perhaps those symptoms give you a clue of what's going on here. </p><p>Thanks for your help! </p>",mail@vorstaedt.de,false,0,0
