Just like the Inbox it is a dynamically computed collection of messages that can come from multiple other folders. The sources of this dynamic collection appear as subfolders. In my case, there were no subfolders shown. And when I right-clicked the trash bin and went to ""Properties"", the property dialog showed: ""Select the folders to search: 0 folders selected"". In other words, ""Trash"" did not show anything. </p><p>The real trash bin is under ""Local Folders"", although it does not appear in the UI. </p><p>So what I did is: In the properties dialog of ""Trash"", I clicked the ""Choose"" button (near the right edge). I was offered only one choice: ""Local Folders"", which could be expanded to a list of all its subfolders. And here, the ""Trash"" folder appeared. I selected it by a tick mark and pressed ""OK"". Voila, now my ""Trash"" bin showed one subfolder: ""Local Folders"". All the messages that I had previously deleted and that had disappeared mysterously were now correctly shown in the trash bin. Great! Problem solved. </p><p>What remains to be solved is: </p> <ul><li> how could the migration to version 115 have configured the Trash folder in this wrong way? </li><li> I have not understood yet, why my other search folders contain subfolders that appear to be unnecessary. For example, the Inbox searches not only in ""Local Folders"", but also the inboxes of my two Gmail accounts, although they always go into the unified inbox of ""Local Folders"" and never contain anything. Is that, because I had once experimented with setting them to IMAP and the migration code of version 115 somehow picked up on that? </li></ul> <p>Perhaps some Thunderbird guru can comment on that. </p>",mail@vorstaedt.de,false,0,0
