Just like the Inbox it is a dynamically computed collection of messages that can come from multiple other folders. The sources of this dynamic collection appear as subfolders. In my case, there were no subfolders shown. And when I right-clicked the trash bin and went to ""Properties"", the property dialog showed: ""Select the folders to search: 0 folders selected"". In other words, ""Trash"" did not show anything. </p><p>The real trash bin is under ""Local Folders"", although it does not appear in the UI. </p><p>So what I did is: In the properties dialog of ""Trash"", I clicked the ""Choose"" button (near the right edge). I was offered only one choice: ""Local Folders"", which could be expanded to a list of all its subfolders. And here, the ""Trash"" folder appeared. I selected it by a tick mark and pressed ""OK"". Voila, now my ""Trash"" bin showed one subfolder: ""Local Folders"". All the messages that I had previously deleted and that had disappeared mysterously were now correctly shown in the trash bin. Great! Problem solved. </p><p>What remains to be solved is: </p> <ul><li> how could the migration to version 115 have configured the Trash folder in this wrong way? </li><li> I have not understood yet, why my other search folders contain subfolders that appear to be unnecessary. For example, the Inbox searches not only in ""Local Folders"", but also the inboxes of my two Gmail accounts, although they always go into the unified inbox of ""Local Folders"" and never contain anything. Is that, because I had once experimented with setting them to IMAP and the migration code of version 115 somehow picked up on that? </li></ul> <p>Perhaps some Thunderbird guru can comment on that. </p>",mail@vorstaedt.de,false,2,0

FXDomains, my email provider switched my email servers to Microsoft Office 365 based ones. They now no longer support POP3. All of my email accounts where setup on POP3. I can no longer access them in my POP3 based Thunderbird accounts. Thunderbird does not allow me to change the from POP3 to IMAP as the access method. I setup a new account on my PC with IMAP to maintain access to my emails. But, I do not have subfolders and filter rules. FXDomains suggested OWL for exchange. I setup it up but it does not allow two emails with the same name. IMAP tags IMAP on to the current email address.   My only plan now is to find away to backup my emails, subfolders, and filter rules. Then create a new setup with OWL access email account and then import the backup files. I do not know any other way, since Thunderbird does not allow changing from POP3 to IMAP. I just want to be able to keep my current local Thunderbird setup for reading emails.

A Thunderbird nem küldözget vagy törölget csak úgy leveleket. </p><p>Továbbá ebben semmi újdonság sincs, ez eddig is pontosan így működött, csak OAuth 2.0-s hitelesítésre váltott a Google egy bő éve.

What a mess! Who installed the antivirus program or other backup/steaming sync software that has made a dogs breakfast of this user profile. </p><p>This image <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-16-32-46-53e79c.png""> indicates you have made at least 33 attempts to configure a Bigpond mail account.  If they were successful or not I have no idea. If the folders have anything in them, I again have no idea. </p><p>It is one of the reasons I wonder why folks think trying to add something over again if it is not working is going to fix something.  All it does it creates a load of orphaned folders for each attempt. It rarely solves anything because whatever caused things to stop working is still in the mix. </p><p>This image is just proof that you have an issue with something blocking or locking access to files in your profile. (all those prefs-Number.js files)  probably a rogue antivirus,  but it could also be a rogue backup or cloud sync.  File contention is not going to end well with Thunderbird generally loosing dat and forgetting settings you think you have changed. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-16-44-28-f698cf.png"">  </p><p>This image clearly shows the file path being used for that configured account.  You asked where it was and there it is.  I fail to understand how you can say it does not answer your question about what path is used for the account. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-57-34-5e403f.png"">  </p><p>The following image shows folders in a profile named c21ebqtq.default <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-58-23-333035.png""> This image,  which I referenced before shows the path in the currently configured account as being in a profile named tx9q2wer.default-release. <a href=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-57-34-5e403f.png&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-57-34-5e403f.png&gt;</a> </p><p>After grappling with that collection of largely unrelated images which demonstrate that your have two profiles and have probably been thrashing around for 6 months since the old one was lost creating the same things over and over without getting whatever result you were trying to achieve.  In the process you have added some 33 or more sets of server entries to your prefs.js file and pose that file as having a thousand new entries in it.  I have no idea how many lines might be in a prefs.js file.  I have never looked.  I just do not tend to add or remove accounts.  I fix the ones I have so they work. </p><p>So I suggest before you go any further you go back to using the original profile.  Some years ago,  when V68 was released I wrote a <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2019/09/i-lost-my-profilemail-on-update-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post</a> describing how to recover from the sudden loss of the existing profile folder.  I suggest you try using that to get back to your 2018 configuration that you lost I am guessing last Christmas. </p><p>The path used for each account has no relevance to what I think you are trying to achieve,  but at this point I am assuming both what happened and what you have been doing to recover from the files on your drive.  You have not articulated what the actual problem is.  Because you have asked pointed questions and been unhappy with the correct answer to your pointed question,  I am guessing at both the issue and your motivations. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
