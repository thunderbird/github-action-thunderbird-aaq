What a mess! Who installed the antivirus program or other backup/steaming sync software that has made a dogs breakfast of this user profile. </p><p>This image <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-16-32-46-53e79c.png""> indicates you have made at least 33 attempts to configure a Bigpond mail account.  If they were successful or not I have no idea. If the folders have anything in them, I again have no idea. </p><p>It is one of the reasons I wonder why folks think trying to add something over again if it is not working is going to fix something.  All it does it creates a load of orphaned folders for each attempt. It rarely solves anything because whatever caused things to stop working is still in the mix. </p><p>This image is just proof that you have an issue with something blocking or locking access to files in your profile. (all those prefs-Number.js files)  probably a rogue antivirus,  but it could also be a rogue backup or cloud sync.  File contention is not going to end well with Thunderbird generally loosing dat and forgetting settings you think you have changed. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-16-44-28-f698cf.png"">  </p><p>This image clearly shows the file path being used for that configured account.  You asked where it was and there it is.  I fail to understand how you can say it does not answer your question about what path is used for the account. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-57-34-5e403f.png"">  </p><p>The following image shows folders in a profile named c21ebqtq.default <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-58-23-333035.png""> This image,  which I referenced before shows the path in the currently configured account as being in a profile named tx9q2wer.default-release. <a href=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-57-34-5e403f.png&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-11-21-57-34-5e403f.png&gt;</a> </p><p>After grappling with that collection of largely unrelated images which demonstrate that your have two profiles and have probably been thrashing around for 6 months since the old one was lost creating the same things over and over without getting whatever result you were trying to achieve.  In the process you have added some 33 or more sets of server entries to your prefs.js file and pose that file as having a thousand new entries in it.  I have no idea how many lines might be in a prefs.js file.  I have never looked.  I just do not tend to add or remove accounts.  I fix the ones I have so they work. </p><p>So I suggest before you go any further you go back to using the original profile.  Some years ago,  when V68 was released I wrote a <a href=""https://thunderbirdtweaks.blogspot.com/2019/09/i-lost-my-profilemail-on-update-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post</a> describing how to recover from the sudden loss of the existing profile folder.  I suggest you try using that to get back to your 2018 configuration that you lost I am guessing last Christmas. </p><p>The path used for each account has no relevance to what I think you are trying to achieve,  but at this point I am assuming both what happened and what you have been doing to recover from the files on your drive.  You have not articulated what the actual problem is.  Because you have asked pointed questions and been unhappy with the correct answer to your pointed question,  I am guessing at both the issue and your motivations. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

But did you then open that msgFilterRules.dat file which is on D drive to see if it was still a complete file?  Is it possible you never had a good copy in the first place or maybe you copied the wrong msgFilterRules.dat file? Did you ever open msgFilterRules.dat to check it was the correct file? </p><p>In Thunderbird Account Settings &gt; Server Settings Bottom right is 'Local directory:.....' Expand window wide enough to see all the contents because it will tell you what profile you are using and the full name of the 'pop account name' folder. Then you can be certain you are looking in the correct location. If you have more than one pop account using same domain, it's possible to have more than pop account name folder - it will have additional number. There are occasion when you may only have one pop account but still have more than one pop account name folder. </p><p>I performed a test: </p> <ol><li> I exited all Thunderbird and I will not open it again until all the copy pasting has been completed. </li><li> I accessed: C:Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/'Profiles' folder </li><li> Selected a 'profile name' folder lets call it 'Z' </li><li> Selected 'Mail' folder </li><li> Selected 'pop account name' folder  </li><li> Right click on 'msgFilterRules.dat' file and selected to open using Notepad' - check contents to make sure this is the correct file.  </li><li> Close 'msgFilterRules.dat' window to exit. </li><li> Right click on 'msgFilterRules.dat' file and selected 'copy' </li><li> Go back up the directory to 'Profiles' folder </li><li> selected another 'profile name' folder - I'll call it 'X' which is actually using a separate version of Thunderbird. </li><li> Selected 'ImapMail' folder </li><li> selected 'imap account name' folder </li><li> delete the  'msgFilterRules.dat' file </li><li> right click in imap account name folder and select 'Paste' - thus pasted in the copied  'msgFilterRules.dat' file. </li></ol> <p>Started Thunderbird on 'X' profile Tools &gt; Message filters Full copied list is visible But as expected I will need to edit each filter because this account will not have the same directory for folders and indeed some folders may not even exist at this point. </p><p>If you are using custom headers in pop account filters then you may need to copy the mailnews.customHeaders settings from one profile to the other profile. Those settings are in the 'pref.js' file.

Just like the Inbox it is a dynamically computed collection of messages that can come from multiple other folders. The sources of this dynamic collection appear as subfolders.

For example, the Inbox searches not only in ""Local Folders"", but also the inboxes of my two Gmail accounts, although they always go into the unified inbox of ""Local Folders"" and never contain anything. Is that, because I had once experimented with setting them to IMAP and the migration code of version 115 somehow picked up on that? </li></ul> <p>Perhaps some Thunderbird guru can comment on that. </p>",mail@vorstaedt.de,false,1,0

As the emails do not exist on server then it is impossible for them to exit in an imap account no matter whether it is Thunderbird, Outlook or EMClient etc. That only explains why you cannot see them in Thunderbird imap account. </p><p>Suggest you check to see what is actually in the profile folders, just in case something occured like a new imap account was created so the original still has an old sent file or maybe it created a new sent file and the old original still exists. </p><p>First check where the imap account is pointing - what is the profile name and what is the actual name of the account it is using. </p> <ul><li> Account Setting &gt; Server Settings for the account </li><li> Look bottom right for 'Local directory:...' </li><li> Make window wide enough to see all the text in the 'Local directory' text box. </li><li> Please copy it and paste it into this forum OR create an image which shows info and post image. </li></ul> <p>This means I can sure where that account is storing mail. </p><p>You mention an update, but I'm not sure what version you are running. Currently, Thunderbird is not updating to the new supernova 115* - that can only occur if you download and install it.  If you were directed to update to that version then it was not Thunderbird. It means you have updater software program on your computer and it suggested that update not understanding Thunderbird is still updating 102* eg: 102.13.1 updates to 102.14.0 </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> If you are running 115.1.0 - Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information </li><li> If you are running 102.14.0 - Help &gt; More Troubleshooting Information </li></ul> <ul><li> Under 'Application Basics' - half way - Profile Folders - click on 'Open Folder' </li></ul> <p>A new window opens showing the contents of your profile name folder. </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird now. </li><li> Click on 'ImapMail' folder (it contains all imap accounts) </li></ul> <p>What do you see&nbsp;? </p> <ul><li> Please post an image showing contents of that 'ImapMail' folder - so I can understand what if anything has occurred. </li></ul> <p>One of the imap mail account folders will have identical name to the one mentioned in 'Local directory:...' If there are more than one - maybe one has same name but with an additional number do the following. </p> <ul><li> click  on each imap account name folder you see to check contents. </li><li> Make sure you have the files displaying details, so you see columns 'Name', 'Modified date', 'Type' and 'Size' and they are sort by 'Name'. </li><li> Post an image showing contents of each imap mail account folder so I can understand what is stored, where it is stored, what size and when it was modified. </li></ul> <p>In the imap account name folder you should see: mbox text files if you are downloading full copies of emails. They are files with same name as folders you see in Folder Pane. These files do not have any extension and they contain emails. Also files with the extension .msf - these are index files used by Thunderbird and they do not contain emails. You may see folders with .sbd extension. they are created when you have subfolders and they may contain mbox files etc. </p><p>You are looking for 'Sent' which is likely to be the current file and possibly files of same name with additional number eg: 'Sent-1'. </p><p>You can open these 'sent' files using 'Notepad' if size less than 512MB or 'Notepad++' if size less than 2GB. Oldest email will be at the top. Do any of those 'Sent' files have an email at the top which is older than 03.08.23&nbsp;? </p><p><strong>If No</strong> no sent emails older than  03.08.23&nbsp;: then you will need to see if server has a load of deleted sent emails - check Trash folder OR whether those emails got archived and are now in an  'Archive'  folder.   If server is a gmail style which uses labels then it may have something like an 'All Mail' folder - so check webmail to see if has that type of folder. It may have sent emails that have no sent label. They just need to have sent label reapplied. Last alternative - do you have a backup of Thunderbird created at an earler date?  </p><p><strong>IF yes</strong> you see sent emails older than  03.08.23&nbsp;: then do this. </p> <ul><li> Copy the 'Sent/Sent-1' file </li><li> Go up directory to 'profile name' folder </li><li> Select 'Mail' folder to see contents </li><li> Select 'Local Folders' folder to see contents </li><li> Paste the copied  'Sent/Sent-1' file into Local Folders folder.  </li></ul> <p>Start Thunderbird Check the 'Local Folders' folder </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
