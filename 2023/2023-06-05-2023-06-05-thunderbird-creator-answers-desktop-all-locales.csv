The  Google Calendar app on my Samsung A13 phone running Android 12 shows it correctly on my calendar. If I then edit the event in Thunderbird and save it (even it I don't make changes), I am listed as an attendee to the meeting as well as the organizer. This causes my phone to show the event with a black interior rather than the normal color for events on my calendar. My presumption is that the black interior means the event hasn't been confirmed by all attendees. If I ""remove all attendees"" in Thunderbird for the event, my phone shows it correctly again. </p><p>I saw a similar problem report on the web about Google adding the organizer as an attendee. It said something about being logged in to ""the primary"" calendar when creating the event on a google calendar, but with no explanation about what the ""primary calendar"" is, and the description of that problem isn't exactly what is happening to me. </p><p>Removing all attendees or just living with different colored events on my calendar are viable options, but it is annoying. Any suggestions would be welcome. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1584022;,gsem66

I have three other accounts with external hosts whose storage capacity is limited. Each email account is for a specific purpose.  I am using IMAP setting for all email accounts.  What I hoped I could do is set up folders in Local folders for each of the limited storage capacity accounts to direct the emails I want to save using the Message Filters.  Not only did it not work, it wiped out the message filters that had been working well for me for ages.  My message filter page is completely blank. </p><p>Being somewhat non-literal, I only recently learned that Local Folders really did mean folders on my hard drive.  So wondering what else I don't know, what happens to the emails I archive.   Are the emails still on the mail server?  Or are archives on my hard drive?  If the archives are on my hard drive and not on the remote mail server drive, are the emails there permanently - i.e., they're there until I delete them, or until something goes wrong with my hard drive?  (Why would anyone think that might happen?) </p><p>If the archives are no longer at the mail server, but are on my hard drive - that would seem to solve my problem.  I thought of the idea of moving emails to the Local Folders because I thought that archiving did not take the emails off the mail server. </p><p>If someone can make sense of all this so I don't stress myself out over what can go where, I will greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;:-} </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1584031;1584229;1584332;1584333;,bdjim
