I installed a new copy of thunderbird on another computer.   After some time I was able to get it functional there.  I would now like to have the same mail folder structure on the new machine as the old and import all my old information.  I have exported the contents of the old Thunderbird profile to a usb drive.  There are a large number of files and folder - 167  to be exact.   The  path the  to the profile folder on my old computer was ....AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\t3ozjfx.default. This is the 'Local directory' in the Server Settings on the old computer.   The path to Profile folder on the new installation is also  ...AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ but then there are two profile type files.  One called t3ozjfx.default as before and another called test.default.  The 'Local directory' in the Server Settings on the new computer is .....AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\t3ozjfjx.default\ImapMail\<a href=""http://mail.cts.com-1.au"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.cts.com-1.au</a> It took me a great deal of effort to get emails sending and receiving properly on the new machine.  It should have been just a matter of having the correct port addresses, server name, and encription method.  However one had to fiddle with the local directory path to get operational </p><p>My question is given the above should I be able to get my old  email file structure and the contents of those files onto the new computer by using the import facility in thunderbird.  I would also like have the 'sent' messages on the old computer on the new computer.  Will the thunderbird import operation be able to do this using the profile file information I put on the usb memory. </p><p>I hope I have not been too tedious in asking this question.   It would be an immense relief if I could get Thunderbird on my new computer to have all the contents and folder structure that I had on the old computer. </p><p>sincerely yours </p><p>Devin Trussell Melbourne Australia </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1589203;1589210;1589215;1589217;1589224;1589226;1589227;1589232;1589237;1589238;1589239;1589240;1589241;1589356;1589393;1589484;1589526;1589533;1589545;1589623;1589716;1589873;1589914;,info9493

When I delete messages, either through Junk or trash or spam. They go away immediately. When I close and reopen TB, they are all back. I suspect that's because of IMAP. Right? But if I go to gmail and delete them there, they do not come back. And I lose every gmail message that I delete from them. i.e. They are deleted from gmail and also TB. Even though I had saved them on TB. How can I delete the gmail messages from gmail, but not TB? I want them gone on gmail, but saved on TB. What account settings should I be changing?
