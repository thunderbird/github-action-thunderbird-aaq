I was able to turn it off, no problem. </p><p>However, it also turned on threading in my Search Results and that still remains. I cannot find a way to turn it off there. </p><p>Note: I open the Search window by clicking on <strong>Edit &gt; Find &gt; Search Messages</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>Ctrl+Shift+F</strong>. </p><p>Note: I am NOT talking about Ctrl-K or any other method for which the posted Community solutions do not work. </p><p>How can I turn off threading in the Search results when using the method of <strong>Ctrl+Shift+F</strong>&nbsp;? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",seattleuser
