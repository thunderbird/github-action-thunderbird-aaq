To try to adjust any of them only expands or contracts all of them like an accordion. This makes me have to widen the Search window itself to be excessively wide across my desktop in order to see details like the hour stamp in the Date column or the full folder name that appears in the Location column which itself is the rightmost column in the way I have it set up. </p><p>Note: I am talking only about the Search box you get when doing Ctrl+Shift+F, not any other method of Searching. </p><p>What can I do to fix this, to allow me to once again individually adjust column width on the Search window? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",seattleuser

Is it just that one has Avast and the other has Kaspersky? and Kaspersky doesn't have the same strictures? thanks if you can reassure me... I can't see anything wrong with anything visible in the certificate but in bold type it says that no reputable bank, store or other public entity would ever have a certificate in the condition this one apparently is in. Not sure what to do ... thanks for any help. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1611131;,filterfeeder
