Suddenly I cannot do this.  Instead of the email itself I now get a ""new message"" box appear and it simply contains a line like  imap-message://username@btinternet.com@mail.btinternet.com/Sent#2039 or similar or mailbox-message://nobody@Local%20Folders/Active/1%20Gmail#2732 or similar (depending where I have copied or dragged it from) rather than the message. This is a very disturbing &amp; distressing change.  I know Windows Live Mail is not your product &amp; is no longer supported anyway, but I keep loads of messages from my six email accounts stored in local folders for reference both within Thunderbird &amp; WLM. For some reason I seem to now be able to reverse the process and copy direct from WLM to Thunderbird which has previously not been possible. I have Thunderbird 115.3.2 (32 bit) and Windows Live Mail 2012 I have Thunderbird set up as IMAP and WLM as POP. I have not knowingly changed anything and this change has come about of its own accord. I updated Import/Export Tools NG Add-On a couple of days ago as I was compelled to.  Could this be the cause&nbsp;?  If so how can I reverse it&nbsp;?  Or is it something in the settings for this add-on (which I have attempted to capture a screenshot of &amp; attach) Thank you for any help you can offer </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1611242;,joycembrett

Since I did a full disk backup just before this TB ""upgrade"" I thought I could restore the previous profile of the same name.  That didn't work, same message. I went back and retrieved a week old version of the profile and same result. profiles.ini lists the same file as default. </p><p>Did this new version of 115 corrupt my profile?.......Intentionally!!!
