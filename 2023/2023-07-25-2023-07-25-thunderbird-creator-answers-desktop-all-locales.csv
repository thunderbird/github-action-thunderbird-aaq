Currently, my default account is automatically selected. But previously, I could select one of of my other email accounts using a drop-down in the FROM field. How do I change this back - or is there a setting or an add-on I can use for this basic functionality? thanks </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",androidshit71
