We deal with an organization which issues their own S/MIME certificates. For a long time it worked flawlessly - we imported their CA as trusted, imported personal certificates of email recipients and everything worked smooth. Lately they started issuing two different certificates per person - one for signing emails, another for encryption. And now since emails from them come with a signature created with a certificate which has ""Digital Signature"" and ""Non Repudiation"" uses - everything works fine ""inbound"". The problem starts if we want to send encrypted emails back to them. Even if we import the encryption certificates we get (those have only ""Key Encipherment"" usage) and the certificates themselves are valid in any possible way (lifetime, proper CA chain imported and so on), still Thunderbird tells us it can't find proper certificate to encrypt the message. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",crackmyback
