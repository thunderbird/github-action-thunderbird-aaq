In previous versions I would put large icon/text button up there for Reply, Reply All, Forward, Print, and Delete.  Those buttons don't appear to be available in Supernova for this toolbar.   </p><p>Some of them appear to be in a fixed area as buttons with text beside the icon, and this area does not appear to have any customization available.  For example, I don't use the Junk and Archive buttons, so if this ""button area"" must remain visible in this position, I'd like to be able to customize which of these buttons are visible. </p><p>My real preference would be to not have these buttons appear where they are now (to the right of the FROM: info), but instead to be able to have them in the Mail Toolbar at the top of the window as I could in the past.  See attached screenshot for clarification of the Mail Toolbar-&gt;Customize window that doesn't currently allow for Reply, Reply All, Forward, Print and Delete to be added to the top Mail Toolbar. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",swbrains

When initiating a message with ""Write"": The ""-- "" appears as the first line the signature block text The signature block text follows as expected. (This is OK) Adding a ""BR"" tag at the end created a blank line between the signature block and the quoted text worked as expected. (OK) </p><p>2. Replying to a message using ""Reply"": The signature block appears _WITHOUT_ the ""-- "" and the quoted text follows my signature block as expected. (NOT OK) </p><p>Adding a ""-- "" to the HTML code cause the ""-- "" to appear _as expected_  as the first line of the signature block. (This worked as expected: The ""-- "" was put back as the first line of the signature block). (OK) </p><p>The added ""BR"" tag (as above) continued to work as expected to create a blank line between the signature block and the quoted message text. (OK) </p><p>4. BUT-- when creating a message with  ""Write"" button,  using the _same_ signature file as above produced two lines of ""-- "" before the signature block text.

I'd also like to still be able to add the active email and URL link of to my signature block without having to contend with all T-bird's hidden assumptions.  </p><p>At least in MS Word one can turn off Microsoft's annoying assumptions of what users want. The same should be possible in T-birds HTML signature block. </p><p>Attached: JPEG image of one of my active html/t-bird signature files. </p><p>Possible? </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1592647;,jeffb4
