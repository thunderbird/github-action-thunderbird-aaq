When initiating a message with ""Write"": The ""-- "" appears as the first line the signature block text The signature block text follows as expected. (This is OK) Adding a ""BR"" tag at the end created a blank line between the signature block and the quoted text worked as expected. (OK) </p><p>2. Replying to a message using ""Reply"": The signature block appears _WITHOUT_ the ""-- "" and the quoted text follows my signature block as expected. (NOT OK) </p><p>Adding a ""-- "" to the HTML code cause the ""-- "" to appear _as expected_  as the first line of the signature block. (This worked as expected: The ""-- "" was put back as the first line of the signature block). (OK) </p><p>The added ""BR"" tag (as above) continued to work as expected to create a blank line between the signature block and the quoted message text. (OK) </p><p>4. BUT-- when creating a message with  ""Write"" button,  using the _same_ signature file as above produced two lines of ""-- "" before the signature block text. (NOT OK) </p><p>The ""BR"" tag at the end continued to work as expected.  </p> <hr> <p>What I Want: </p><p>I'd like to disable T-bird's wrapper HTML/CSS code and simply be able to create my own simple HTML instead. I'd also like to still be able to add the active email and URL link of to my signature block without having to contend with all T-bird's hidden assumptions.  </p><p>At least in MS Word one can turn off Microsoft's annoying assumptions of what users want. The same should be possible in T-birds HTML signature block. </p><p>Attached: JPEG image of one of my active html/t-bird signature files. </p><p>Possible? </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1592647;,jeffb4

Currently, my default account is automatically selected. But previously, I could select one of of my other email accounts using a drop-down in the FROM field. How do I change this back - or is there a setting or an add-on I can use for this basic functionality? thanks </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",androidshit71
