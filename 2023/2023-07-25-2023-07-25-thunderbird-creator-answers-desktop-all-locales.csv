Also, multiple computers show the same issue, always the same mails that are displayed wrong. </p><p>There is no problem with the metadata, it shows the recieved-date as correct. </p><p>There is probably no problem with the mail server, as other clients (Apple Mail) display all mails with correct dates. </p><p>Thunderbird is up to date, and no extensions installed. </p><p>What could possibly cause this kind of issue? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",sudoku_jowly02

(NOT OK) </p><p>Adding a ""-- "" to the HTML code cause the ""-- "" to appear _as expected_  as the first line of the signature block.
