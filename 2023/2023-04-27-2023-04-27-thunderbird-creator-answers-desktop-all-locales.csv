I am using Thunderbird and pop3 to do download the emails (roughly 90GB) and all emails are left on the gmail servers for now. The server is conacted every 5 minues and like this over a few weeks every 5 minutes some emails are downloaded. In the beginning it was thousands of emails every time, but it slowed down quickly, to only around 10 emails every 5 minutes in the end.  On my first try, I successfully downloaded all emails between 2006 and 2016, then Thunderbird announced there were no more new mails. Gmail online shows that emails between 2016 and 2023 are well present on the server. I went into the gmail settings, re-marked all emails as eligible for pop3 and started to download everything again. This time it downloaded all emails 2006-2014 (again, requesting every 5 minutes and with diminishing new emails on every request). Again Thunderbird announces ""No new emails to download"" even though theres plenty between 2016 and 2023 that can be found through the gmail web application.  Using the ""recent"" setting (adding 'recent:' in front of the pop3 user-name, I manage to download the past month worth of emails but nothing more.) Google Support said all my settings looked correct, they couldn't help and I should ask Thunderbird Support. Could you help me? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1577655;1577659;1577662;1577664;1578495;,SUPI1
