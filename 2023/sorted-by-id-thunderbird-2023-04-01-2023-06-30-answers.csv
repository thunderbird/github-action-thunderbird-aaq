There was no option to ""remove"" it like normal Favorite Folders.    I couldn't find any setting to remove it and even looked in Config Editor.  I removed the account completely and, yes, it removed the Favorite Folders entry.  However, the minute I added the account back, it returned.    The only fix I found was to copy the profile from the other machine over, delete the current profile, and replace it.  That worked.

I do have 54 email accounts currently, and maybe 600,000 messages; with the sorting rules, starting over is a little tedious. Looks like I will have to do this one way or another. Not being a pro or anything, I am thinking that something in this version is linking to something in an old version, and that must be the problem. The other 100 threads on this subject suggested to delete 4 or 5 files (pkes11.txt, cert9.db, kg4.db, session.json), plus all older derivatives; in addition to reset the master /principle password; in addition to install the new version of the software. Obviously none of these worked. I suppose if I read a couple million lines of the code I could figure this out. Just hoping I get lucky and someone knows how to make passwords work.

Or do I have to create them?</em> </p><p>At the moment, Gmail has no knowledge about the folder structure in your Pop account. Pop accounts and all folders therein are completely independent of the server. No Pop account folder can synchronise with any server folder/label. All pop account folders and emails are stored on your computer. The only connection is Thunderbird is allowed access to the Gmail 'Inbox' label to download any emails it has previously not downloaded. </p><p>Any email you have sent via gmail Pop account will go through the gmail smtp server. Recently, gmail decided to start putting copies of those emails into the 'Sent Mail' folder/label on server. Just in case you ever chose to view via webmail. This means, if you logon to the gmail webmail account via a browser, you may find the 'Sent Mail' has some of your emails. </p><p>Any email you delete in a Pop account goes to pop Deleted folder, but gmail has no idea where it went. If you have a setting that deletes from server Inbox, then gmail see this as a 'remove the Inbox' label, so email still exists in the gmail server 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Gmail Imap accounts are entirely different. Gmail stores all your emails in one folder called 'All Mail'. Gmail understands it is not the best method for people to use - it's not exactly very workable to have everything incoming, sent and archived in just one folder, so they invented 'labels'. 'Labels' are like applying a special tag allowing a virtual view of an email so it is displayed in a more logical folder style. It also means you can apply several 'labels' allowing one email to appear in various folder views. </p><p>Gmail has a set of default 'labels' so emails stored in 'All Mail' can be viewed in a more logical manner. 'Inbox', 'Drafts', 'Sent Mail', 'Spam', 'Trash (sometimes called 'Bin'),'All Mail'. So when you create an imap account you will get all of those default folders automatically 'Subscribed' to be seen. You can set the gmail webmail to 'not show in imap' eg: 'All Mail' folder. Any other folder you require in Thunderbird imap account needs to be created either via Thunderbird or a label via gmail webmail account and set up to be 'shown in imap'. </p><p>All imap folders can be set up to download full copies of emails - aka fully synchronise with server OR just download headers to save space - those emails get downloaded when selected to be viewed and temp stored in a cache. </p><p>When you delete an email in gmail imap account it should go to the gmail imap 'Trash' folder. As folders synchronise with server, gmail will understand email has been put in gmail Trash so delete email from the 'All Mail' folder.  Any email that has been in the gmail Trash folder for 30 days will get auto deleted by gmail off server and therefore will disappear from the imap Trash folder as well. </p><p>The imap gmail account folders cannot be considered as completely independent of the server and can only display whatever is on the server.  </p><p><em>2) If the Gmail account had some labels that have no corresponding folders in TBird will folders be created automatically in TBird? Or am I excepting too much of TBird?</em> </p><p>So, when you create the imap account, you will only see the folders matching the labels that are already created on the server and set as  'show in imap' and see/download any email that is in any of the server folders/labels which you have subscribed to see.  Any other imap folder must be created by you. Senario: If you need an imap folder called 'Family'  - this folder/label does not automatically exist on the server as a default folder. You can create a new imap folder called 'Family' in Thunderbird imap account and it will auto get added as a label in the gmail webmail account. </p><p>OR if you created a new label called 'Family' via the gmail webmail account which you set up to 'show in imap'. Then in Thunderbird you need to subscribe to see the 'Family' folder/label and it would auto display in the imap account. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

Instead select the account name itself. </pre> <p>ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:  </p><pre>    // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation     user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); </pre> <p>- copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

Do not scan incoming or outgoing mail and do not allow Anti-Virus to auto fix anything. In addition I suggest you do not allow it to scan any Thunderbird profile folder or it's contents as it can play havoc with files that store emails. </p><p><strong>Firewall - </strong> Thunderbird program should be set up as an allowed program otherwise it can be awkward about allowing access to internet. </p><p>Advise you never only rely on whatever is held on server because it is only one copy.

What a relief (never would have figured out myself)! </p><p>I have an unrelated question at the end of my below-diatribe and am wondering whether we might have an off-line exchange, so I might formulate another question concisely for the T-bird blog so as not to take up too much bandwidth formulating the question. </p> <hr> <p>I've been a T-bird user actually almost since it's inception (I'm that old&nbsp;:-)). At about version #63 when the major internal architectural changes occurred, I gave up on T-Bird and stayed with Version #62 (or so) until about three months ago. Why: I had a _stable_ email client that did exactly what I wanted! That is, I had a sufficient number of Add-On's that worked around bugs and that overcame T-bird deficiencies in my daily workflow. </p><p>I was forced to look at the current T-bird  (&gt;= #101) when I moved my mid-2012 Mac laptop to Open Core MacOS Monterey  because T-bird #63 couldn't run reliably on Monterey. (Apple no longer provides ""legal"" updates to this hardware and Open Core makes it possible to run more current MacOS versions.). </p><p>What kept me with T-Bird over the years: • Easy viewing of email headers (mostly used for looking at scam email) • Add-ons that actually added useful features in my workflow • And sadly, in the majority: Add-ons that worked around T-bird bugs, some that had/have lingered for over a decade. </p><p>At least in the present version some of the decade-old bugs are gone. For example, I like putting blank lines between numbered list entries (using shift-return). Do this too many times and  you couldn't get out of numbered list mde without standing on your head. </p><p>At least for now (please pardon my cynicism), the ratio of Add-On;s that do useful things to the add-ons that ""fix"" egregious persistent, decade-old bugs has markedly declined. I am hoping this trend will continue... </p> <hr> Possible off-line blog to help me formulate a question about message display/font-size/font display----- <p>The question(s) concern(s) getting plain-text and quoted plain text messages to display in Helvetica or Ariel font.

So that is 6 files in all. The 3 current .sqlite files were copied into the Laptop's Profile replacing the exiting abook.sqlite and history.sqlite as well as inserting the abook-1.sqlite.  When the Laptop TB was launched it picked up the Personal Address Book, and Collected Addresses but was missing the 201 contacts imported into the Desktop called AAA and 200 others file. I did some sleuthing and saw that the prefs.js file did not have any ldap entries for the missing contacts from the ""AAA and 200 others"". I found the Desktop's entries in it's prefs.js and inserted those 4 lines for the abook-1 file into the laptop's prefs.js. Upon relaunching TB my missing contacts were found! If you have any problems with what I did please advise on what I should have done differently. If there is no other feedback I will mark this as solved. Thanks for your help! </p>",laurencegregg,false,0,0

You are free to choose your products,  but some anti virus products have long and very chequered histories when involved with mail clients.  So of the stories are documented here. <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Antivirus_Related_Performance_Issues</a>  Additionally some products have anti scam and spam tools which are good for one binary version of Thunderbird (so about 4 weeks) before they can start doing odd things like filing everyone not in the address book in spam or such like. </p><p>As for you feeling uneasy.  Why?  When information comes in over the wire.  You anti virus scans it in the guise of an encrypted connection.  When the email is at rest in Thunderbird's storage it is a plain text file.  It represents no more risk then a takeout menu on your refrigerator.  When you open the email Thunderbird does not allow remote images,  fails to run scripts and generally prevents the body of the email being anything but some text to read,  even with the images (which reduces privacy) little changers.  So you decide to open an attachment.  So Thunderbird turns it into something other than plain text and writes it to your system temp folder so it can be opened, and your anti virus scans the resultant file. </p><p>So I reiterate my original question.  Why? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Non c'è una corrispondenza tra le cartelle di Thunderbird e le cartelle del sistema operativo. Se ad esempio in Thunderbird hai creato una cartella di nome <em>MiaPost</em>a, sul tuo disco non troverai una cartella con quel nome ma un file di nome <em>MiaPosta</em> <strong>senza alcune estensione</strong>. Quel file è in formato mbox e contiene tutte le email che Thunderbird mostra nella cartella con lo stesso nome. </p><p>Ora, il sistema di indicizzazione di Windows non è in grado di indicizzare i file mbox, per cui se attivi l'integrazione con il sistema operativo vengono create le cartelle .mozmsgs ed i file .wdseml che sono leggibili ed indicizzabili da Windows <strong>ma non sono realmente utilizzate da Thunderbird</strong> (sono cioè delle copie in cui il file monolitico mbox viene rappresentato da una cartelle e da una serie di email singole). </p><p>Quindi in sostanza, <strong>Thunderbird continua a lavorare con i file mbox, mentre Windows usa le cartelle .mozmsgs ed i file .wdseml per poter indicizzare la posta</strong> e mostrarla quando fai una ricerca. In un certo senso quindi è come avere due copie della stessa posta. A parte la maggiore occupazione di spazio, non ci sono però controindicazioni, anzi come abbiamo visto i file .wdseml possono essere utilizzati per recuperare email in caso di necessità. </p><p>L'integrazione con windows in altre parole non è la causa del problema, anzi ti offre una opzione di recupero in più. Il <strong>mancato allineamento di cui parli nasce sicuramente da una causa differente</strong>: ad esempio in passato hai cancellato una cartella in Thunderbird, questo ha determinato l'eliminazione del relativo file mobox ma non delle coppie .mozmsgs ed i file .wdseml. </p><p>Le impostazioni che hai mostrato sopra sono quelle standard e dovrebbero portare alla generazione di un file mbox per ogni cartella di Thunderbird. Per esserne certo prova un semplice esperimento: </p> <ul><li> crea in Thunderbird una nuova cartella </li><li> copia in questa cartella qualche email poco importante </li><li> controlla se nel profilo viene creato un nuovo file senza estensione con lo stesso nome della cartella </li></ul> <p>Se funziona, allora Thunderbird sta lavorando correttamente (a prescindere dalla comparsa di una nuova  coppia .mozmsgs ed i file .wdseml.) </p><p>Scusami se mi sono dilungato. </p>",@next,false,0,0

TB is now downloading emails in batches of 2000 starting from 2014.

This evening, instead of opening Thunderbird and downloading the messages immediately, I wen to my provider's webmail first. It showed an Inbox of 45 messages with 2.69 MB and a spam folder of 65 messages at 1 MB. I then opened Thunderbird and let it download the messages from the server. When I went back to webmail and refreshed the page it showed the Inbox was 0. So it appears that Thunderbird is downloading messages from the server Inbox and deleting them. So that's not the issue in this case. I think the issue is with the spam email folder. I noticed in recent times that I was getting fewer spam messages with the rest of the Inbox but thought they were just being deleted. I think the company had gotten more aggressive about putting spam in a folder in Webmail that I couldn't see on Thunderbird and things were not getting deleted. The company has a link to a spam filter section and I found that an ""auto-delete"" spam function was disabled. I had enabled it to delete spam with some arbitrary score they provided but it had turned back to disabled. So I think Thunderbird is OK and my provider has a crude spam function that you have to log into webmail every day to review. I appreciate your suggestions that led me to discover this. </p><p>Best Regards, </p><p>Howard </p>",hpatterson6,false,0,0

You had a POP account and those messages should be on your PC unless you deleted the POP account, in which case it depends on how you deleted it.

The timeout issue is sometimes caused by incorrect settings, such as specifying SSL/TLS when STARTTLS is preferred. If various settings all continue to indicate a timeout, there is a config setting to adjust timeout that may work. For what it's worth, you may want to try it. Steps are:   - settings&gt;general  - scroll down to bottom to 'config editor; - locate  mailnews.tcptimeout   - the default is 100.

I believe I originally had a POP3 set up on Thunderbird with the ""leave a copy on the server"" checked, but I received an email from my hosting company, Newtwork Solutions, that told me I needed to reconfigure my Thunderbird because of a change to TLS 1.2 with new recommended IMAP settings. I thought IMAP settings left emails on the NS server no matter what I did on my PC - like a mirroring. When I hit ""go"" to initiate the new IMAP settings on Thunderbird, 1000s and 1000s of my emails from NS began flowing in, populating my Thunderbird desktop inbox. It took nearly a day. I do have all my emails on Thunderbird on my PC. I then subsequently organized the emails into folders, which I thought meant those folders would also appear (be ""mirrored"", which is what I thought IMAP did) on the Network Solutions server, but when I went to my NS webmail app, all my emails were gone from the server. That ""flowing in"" looks like it was a removal of all the emails from the NS server. I have someone at NS supposedly restoring my emails, after which I think I should use the new Netsol POP3 settings: ""Incoming Mail Server POP3: <a href=""http://netsol-pop-oxcs.hostingplatform.com"" rel=""nofollow"">netsol-pop-oxcs.hostingplatform.com</a>. Port: 995 / Outgoing Mail Server SMTP: <a href=""http://netsol-smtp-oxcs.hostingplatform.com"" rel=""nofollow"">netsol-smtp-oxcs.hostingplatform.com</a>. Port: 587"". Does anyone know, will this Thunderbird POP3 set-up allow me to specify ""keep on the server"", so no matter what I do on my PC, my emails will remain in my Network Solutions webmail app's inbox? I like Thunderbird, but want to use it only if my emails are safely stored on the Network Solutions server. Also, how long will Thunderbird be safe to rely on for my business use now that is is no longer officially supported? I am wondering if I should just go over to Google. But I've used Thunderbird for so long, I don't want to change. THANK YOU TO ALL. </p>",robertlaporta,false,0,0

In your second post, you didn't explain what you did. All I can infer is that you moved the messages to various local folders, which would have removed them from the server. On your POP-related question, Thunderbird will keep messages on server if that is what you specify. From one of your last sentences, you implied that Thunderbird is no longer supported. That is NOT TRUE. Thunderbird has a paid staff of developers and god-only-knows how many volunteers actively involved. I doubt you will find any email client more actively supported than Thunderbird. We have millions (yes, millions) of active users, and a major upgrade coming this summer. Stay tuned.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Check also through gmail webmail that there aren't any filters that copy sent mail to the Inbox (<a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/thread/8511992/stop-sending-copy-of-sent-email-to-my-inbox?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">or any other filters</a>).  Another possible cause is if you have gmail webmail set to send from other accounts ('Send mail as..'). </p><p><a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Gmail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Gmail</a> </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

Further investigation since my last post has uncovered a copy of the same email folders on the PC with MS365, so I can put the iiNet laptop aside from the issue before me. But my objective is to get those folders set up so I can see them from WITHIN TB, not outside it - if that is possible.  That would give me ready access to saved messages that I am likely to refer to in the future. The mail folders are located at D:\Thunderbird\sp5uno6a.default\Mail\<a href=""http://exchange.iinet.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">exchange.iinet.net.au</a>.  I assume they were written there when I was using iiNet for email on this PC.  There are two folders for each subject, one an MSF file (which could be an index) and the much more substantial File proper, which I assume contains the saved messages. The most recent activity on folders in this directory corresponds with the date I switched to MS365, confirming that these are the folders I am after. The Account Setting currently on TB for Message Storage shows the Local Directory at D:\Thunderbird\Local Folders. Although I have inserted manually in TB folders with the same names as those saved earlier, and a few of them now have one or two messages stored in them, I cannot find where they are being saved.  I'm guessing that would be where I might save copies of the folders saved earlier.  But mine is an uneducated guess. Any advice that will enable me to copy those email folders to where I could again access them from within TB would be greatly appreciated. </p>",BruceM1,false,0,0

My objective is to place them somewhere inside TB so I can at least refer to them there, preferably in the same account. I have now confirmed that TB is writing the ""new"" mailboxes (ie mailboxes entered into the single account on this TB installation) at C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\sp5uno6a.default\Imapmail\<a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>. As an experiment, with TB closed I copied from my D drive (ie archive location)  to the above address the mail files Amazon (2,802 KB) and Amazon.msf (65 KB), which were saved from a previous account. Now when I open TB and select the folder Amazon, I initially see all the messages stored in this box on my D drive.  After a very short time, they all disappear.  When I check back using Windows Explorer, I find that the file Amazon.msf has been over-written and is now just 4 KB in size.

It relates to creating changes that require having pre- knowledge and knowing multiple steps to find accessible functions. The need to do multiple steps for every folder is the barrier. If there was a one-step process for each folder, that would likely be in compliance. The critical part is the solution is not obvious. One needs to know that the solution is in the View part of the Menu options, then Sort By (when the Threads option looks obvious but does not lead to a solution) then finally Unthread.  To start the whole process, one must KNOW, Have preknowledge, that those three short horizontal bars as an icon lead to a Menu. WCAG requires the solution to have an obvious path. A right click on a folder with Threading options would be appropriate. Instead, the options are divided into may different multi-step paths.  WCAG requires an option for ""Text under an Icon"". Not just ""Hover and text will show up"" Many have no idea that those three short horizontal bars mean anything. Mozilla deleted these options about 4 or 5 years ago.   We have a large population of ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, who may be literal thinkers and others who have inabilities to memorize processes that are not obvious or an inability to translate Icons into a text based concept.

I was not able to find or set anything  that would enable me to send crash reports to Thunderbird or Mozilla. </p><p>Actually - Thunderbird stopped working and i had to ""force quit"", which is what i always do when it freezes for a while.

This was not always the case - it might have started a year ago.  </p><p>But very recently - when i click on and open an email that's already open, a different email shows up. The only way i've found around that is to close the email and open it again from within my ""Inbox"". </p><p>And today i opened an old email and it was full of gibberish.

What I don't understand about it being an IP issue is that all of my email accounts are connected to the same IP, but it is only the one account causing issues. We didn't make any software changes but we did send out a large, blast email campaign Tuesday, (as we do every month), and there were probably some SPAM reports as a result. The reason I am looking for help with Thunderbird is that I sent an email to one of my employees as a test through webmail and it went right through. Then sent the exact same email from Thunderbird and it bounced. However, this email bounce to multiple employees below was sent through webmail.

I am hoping my host Network Solutions will be able to restore my email data that was cleared off their server by my recent IMAP Thunderbird installation. At that point, I intend on setting up a new Thunderbird account as a POP3 with ""leave a copy on server"" checked. If I delete the existing IMAP version on my PC without opening it (so that it doesn't open and start pulling everything off the server again), can I keep all the folders with all the emails on my PC so my new POP3 version will see them? BTW, I am currently saving a copy to a backup drive of my Thunderbird ""profile"" folder, which is about 24 GB. As it is copying, I am seeing the names of all the folders I have on my PC that have all the emails the IMAP version pulled off the Network Solutions server. Could I point my new POP3 Thunderbird account to this folder so that when the POP3 version is up and running all my folders and emails would be there? That would be a dream scenario. </p>",robertlaporta,false,0,0

The bottom line seems to be that if you're using Windows 11, and you put it into SLEEP mode, but you leave Thunderbird active, you'll be unable to log onto your various email accounts, even though you use the correct userids/passwords.  I've also found that if you restart Thunderbird in Troubleshooting mode, you'll be able to log on with the correct userids and passwords. </p><p>I did a fair amount of research on the difference between sleep mode in Windows 10 and Windows 11.  In Windows 10 I never had a problem.  There is apparently something called Hibernate mode and you'll read things which say it's often not available on Windows 11 desktop machines (which is what I have - a Dell XPS8950).  Nevertheless I tried very hard to activate Hibernate mode on my Windows 11 Pro machine, without success.  I called Dell and they basically gave me the same information that I had already read online.  None of the procedures worked, usually because the options that the recipe told you to use were unavailable or brought up screens that were completely different. </p><p>There was one option that did work, going into Command mode and entering ""powercfg/a"".  It showed that on my machine supposedly Standby (S3), Hibernate, and Fast Startup were available.  But when I tried to activate Hibernate mode using another ""powercfg"" option, it said that I lacked sufficient authority. </p><p>I believe Hibernate is the same as S4.  There are S options from 1 through 4.  I'm guessing that my Windows 10 machine was using S0 because I found something that says it allows fast startup which I did have in Windows 10. It seems clear to me that S3 is the culprit.  Whether Thunderbird can be fixed to interrogate the status of the machine before it attempts to retrieve or send email I don't know. </p><p>I now make sure that I NEVER leave the machine in Sleep mode with Thunderbird active.  To help me with this I've changed it so that Sleep mode will never be activated by the mere passage of time.  In practice I've taken to doing a complete shutdown because it was easy to make an icon on the desktop which did this.  The only way I know to activate sleep mode is CTL/ALT/DELETE and then click on the option in the lower right corner.  Too many steps.  It's easier to just shut the machine down. </p><p>By the way, on the Dell keyboard for my Windows 10 machine there was a key for sleep mode.  This key is not present on my Windows 11 machine, again with a Dell branded keyboard. </p>",tcluster,false,0,0

It's possible you're experiencing problems authenticating with the SMTP server because of whatever is happening on your email providers end. I strongly suggest you use webmail to access any communication from your provider and act on it before it's too late. If you will be transferring your service to Plusnet as a broadband customer of John Lewis, then you will will have to use the SMTP server settings of your new service provider after the transfer is complete. Contact you provider for help with that process. If you will not be transferring to Plusnet, then you will need a new email service. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

I can't fit it all on here, but it's what I was referring to with changing the server entries.  </p><p>&gt; Dear Valued Customer, &gt; We’re committed to making sure you have the most secure email experience. &gt; &gt; That’s why we’re updating our security. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an online security protocol that encrypts all data between servers and email clients. Due to an increase in attacks and security vulnerabilities in recent years, older versions TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer being used. To make sure your data continues to be safe, we are supporting the more advanced TLS 1.2. &gt; &gt; We’ve determined that you are connecting to your email using an unencrypted client connection and your data is not safe. &gt; &gt; This security update requires all email server connections to use an encrypted connection. We will make the switch to require encrypted connections on May 4th, 2023. &gt; My existing server entries are not the same as the ones in this letter.  I thought that might be why the update messed up my incoming mail from aol.  Do think this is possible?  Currently my server type: POP Mail Svr  Server Name:  <a href=""http://pop.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.aol.com</a>   Port 995   Neither of those is what they are showing starting May 4th.

Sending a message to myself and using Message-&gt;Message Source yielded: </p> <hr> <p>         &lt;meta http-equiv=""content-type"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8""&gt;           <br>     </p><div class=""moz-signature"">-- <br>       &lt;font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica""&gt;         my name         <br>         my company         <br>         etc. etc.       &lt;/font&gt;</div>     <p></p> <hr> <p>5. Ok. So far so good. BUT--The problem--It's a documented bug: </p><pre>  a. Open a new message. The signature block looks as expected.   b. Put a one or more blank lines above the initial first message line.   c. Move the cursor to any of those blank lines using the mouse or arrow keys </pre> <p>RESULT: T-bird has changed the font to ""variable width"". </p><p>If you try to change the font back to Helvetica, the point size no longer matches my the point size in my signature block ""font"" spec. (So such isn't a workaround.) </p><p>For my daily work flow, this is an _expletive_ nuisance! </p><p>6. I was incorrect in my previous email saying that creating a template ""solved"" my problem. The only reason creating a template ""solved"" the problem was that I put my company logo image on the first line. Within my logo on the first line the  same effect occurs as described in #5. If I remove the logo and add blank lines above the signature block,the same unwanted font change occurs. </p><p>7. So, we come back to the original issue: Since it doesn't look like this bug will be fixed any time soon, I want to turn off having T-bird adding any code to my signature block code and simply execute the HTML as I've written it. </p><p>Why: a) I don't want to work around the T-bird bug of arbitarily changing added blank lines above the signature block to ""variable-width"" b) ALSO I don't really want the ""-- "" signature block separator forced at the beginning of the signature block in T-bird's generated code. c) The above assumes I have no user-access to the class=""moz-whatever"" True? </p><p>POSSIBLE? </p><p>A sincere thank you for the time you've spent on my issue! </p>",jeffb4,false,0,0

Seems like the logic has changed and now every time something is done with any mail, the Windows Defender interrupts and uses 1-2 CPU Cores to scan for about 1 minute per mail or action. I can reproduce this issue with any e-mail action. - click on it - mark is as junk - delete it - receive it </p><p>Thunderbird is now (after so many years) unusable for me. And with all the recent spam mails on my accounts Thunderbird now needs more than an hour to receive all mails. This wasn't a problem before the 102.x version of Thunderbird. I would guess that something in the code makes many small reads what was formally just read once (or out of memory) and now the Windows Defender scans the the accessed files every time. And no, it is not an option to exclude Thunderbird from the Windows Defender. With all those spam mails in recent times, there are also often viruses/trojans in the attachments, I still want the system to get rid of those. </p><p>I do not use any extensions oder addins in Thunderbird.

I currently have 467 of these aliases (forwarding addresses) and was quite pleased with myself for having managed to export them from my domain provider's email interface into a csv file and then put them into my TB address book thinking that would enable TB to ""autocomplete"" then whenever I started typing one of them in the ""customise address field"". No such luck - whether it's the first or 50th time I've used them. I don't quite see how the solution works, if it means entering each one individually and then once that task is done, using a drop down menu with 467 aliases to choose from as that involves more work than just tying the whole alias in the ""customise from field"" box. </p><p>When using unique disposable forwarding aliases in the way I do, it is normal to end up with a LOT - one for every organisation/institution/website that you communicate with, as it is a great way of controlling spam and detecting and limiting the damage from the regular data breaches that institutions subject us to nowadays. </p><p>What puzzles me is the fact that TB can do autocomplete on all these aliases if I put them in the other fields, such as To, Cc, or Bcc.  So the issue is that it will ONLY offer addresses for autocomplete if they are already associated with TB identities. I already have three TB identities associated with pop3/smtp mail accounts and they are all available to choose in a drop down for the From: field. Interestingly, if I start to type one of the existing ID addresses into that ""customise From"" box, then there is no autocomplete offered on that either - even though it is already on the drop down list for selection. </p><p>It looks as if TB is designed NOT to do what I want - there is no autocomplete facility on that ""customise From: address"" field, even though it allows me to customise a From address, and use it, for some reason it isn't programmed to use the autocomplete function when doing so. </p><p>Your solution states: ""Here you can enter an id (and sig if desired) for every alias""&nbsp;? In the manage identities window it looks like you are suggesting I manually create 467 new identities, one for each alias? That's not an attractive solution! </p><p>Sorry to sound so negative!

So they offer these convoluted ""how to"" documents using third parts email clients to try and fill the gap in their service.  Fundamentally it is trying to copy your documents folder using your printer to store the files. It also allows the blame for failed transfers (very common) to be placed with the mail clients.  IMAP is not some sort of file system and uploads using it do modify the mail,  so it is not a clean transfer even when it works. </p><p>Thunderbird can not read backups of IMAP server folders.  It has no idea how data is stored on an imap server it internally uses MBOX files, and it is possible to place them in the ""local folders"" folder in the profile and they will be read on the next startup of Thunderbird.

This is not going to happen and each folder will need to be imported to Thunderbird from a MBOX and then manually ""copied"" to the appropriate folder in the IMAP account you have setup. </p><p>Looking further at the mbox image you posted.  You are using apple special format. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-05-02-16-35-55-53c019.png""> </p><p>So to import the 2020 dues.mbox package,  you will first need to copy the internal mbox file and then save it with a name.  That is the part which the import export tools can import.  You might also want to look at the content of the file in a text editor to ensire there is mail to import.  IMAP frequently has no local copies instead relying on the server to the actual email when requested. </p><p>Basically this is a very complex issue and you may well be best served to get someone in to spin up a mail server internally to load your new/cur/tmp/maildir files to so you can begin the copying described by dreamhost as I assume the original server is not available. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You sorta' shot yourself in the foot by bypassing the import. Assuming your accounts are POP, you now have messages in two places, the messages prior to the switch on one PC and newer ones on newer PC. But, if POP accounts are set to leave messages on server for a period greater than the transition period, then you could safely import the profile with nothing lost.

In other words,  - go to C:/Users/(MyUserName)/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles - copy all the files and subfolders of the profile I want to use (including all the address book, extension, history, ""impab"" files, etc.) - paste those files and subfolders into the default profile folder - say yes to all overwrite warnings </p><p>Is that right? If so, I have 2 further questions: 1. What is the difference between the ""default"" and ""default-release"" profiles? Does it matter which one I make the default before I paste over it? 2. Tbird has already imported all my 1000's of Gmail messages into the Inbox of the default profile. On my old system those messages were organized into dozens of Inbox subfolders, which were populated through message filters, and local folders. Once I overwrite the new profile with my backed-up profile will all that be reproduced? I don't want to end up with 1000's of messages in my Inbox that are already in subfolders (or deleted from them). </p><p>Really I have one more question that I hesitate to ask: Thunderbird has been around a long time. Why isn't there a simple way to do this? Like a startup switch, ""Create new profile or Browse to select existing profile""? I would have thought it was obvious that Thunderbird users who upgrade to a new computer might want to transfer their entire profile as is. I never expected to have to do all this file manipulation to accomplish it. </p>",tonyalt1,false,0,0

It would also explain why th eindex file was left alone. </p><p>Advise; Do not allow any Anti-Virus or file cleanup software any access to your Thunderbird profile folders as they are well known to cause havoc. </p><p>Do not store large numbers of emails in a single folder because in reality they are being stored in a single text document which is a bit risky if things go wrong.  It could be harder to compact folders if they are too large; compacting removes all traces of previously moved and deleted emails thus helping to reduce file size and maintain a healthy file. It is much harder to open very large text files should you ever need to try and rescue emails; in some cases it can crash a computer due to the excessive use of RAM.  Suggest each year you 'Archive' the sent emails.

My grasp of your basic intent is to have thunderbird and accounts on drive C and local folders on external drive. Transferring to new computer would be to copy profile to new PC (which is now a simple menu option, thankfully) and then reset LocalFolders to point to the external drive. I don't understand the steps in detail on what you did, as it would be in the details should be clues on where the messages are missing.  I will add that the definition of where Local Folders is stored is at account settings for local folders, not within 'copies&amp;folders' for the account.  </p><p>My inference is that your issue is to copy local folders from Win 7 to the new profile. A simple way, using WIndows FIle Explorer, is to rename the Win 7 Local Folders to something else and then copy the renamed folder to within the Local Folder on the Win 10 PC (while Thunderbird isn't running).  </p><p>Although I don't know your full intent, something to consider might be to put the entire profile on the external drive.

I have stepped through all the normal steps to move my local folders and when that didn't work, I also tried other folders where I thought the missing emails might have strayed. </p><p>This past year, my routine backups stopped saving to the backup drives where all Thunderbird from 2009 has backed up without issue so this has been a hidden problem for almost a year.

Since the old laptop shows the 2022-2023 emails in the Local Folders up until I stopped moving them there last week I know they are somewhere. on the Windows 7 hard drive.

It's tiny and can find darn near anything in a fraction of a second. Unbelievable speed. Just type a few characters in and it starts. I wrote this, thinking of your comment about searching for .msf files. Scarcely a day passes but I don't use it several times.  </p><p>Second, I encourage you to establish a simpler means of backups. Thunderbird's export to zip may not fit your needs, but the importexport addon has a nice one. If doing any other backup, it MUST be done when Thunderbird is not running. I have seen many posts here from people using proprietary backups that failed to restore, either because they reallocated data placement or they ran while Thunderbird was active. My suggestion is to put the entire profile together, whether on drive C or elsewhere. Since the bulk of the profile is messages, putting everything together makes a restore a simple step. Thunderbird needs to stay on C, but the profile can be anywhere.  </p><p>Do keep me posted, as I want to see you escape from this situation. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

The accounts migrated beautifully but the folders for the accounts, although some were created, the contents for those folders did not migrate. The hard part of setting up the accounts was done for me during the migration. None of the contents of the folders associated with my email accounts were moved.  None of my old emails were migrated. My Local Folders were not migrated at all - not the folders or the contents. All of the folders and contents are on my old computer.  Thunderbird still runs perfectly on my old computer even though the computer itself is very old, extremely slow and cannot be upgraded beyond Windows 8.1. If I can copy the files from my old computer straight to my new one I will do that, but the first part of the name is different, i.e. combination of numbers and letters before the actual name of the file is different. If that doesn't matter, or if I need to alter that to make the migration work, it will be easy. Please let me know. I don't want to break what worked if I can help it.

While I found the folder 'Thunderbird' in my Windows 7 PC in the 'Program Files' folder, not in the 'Appdata' folder, I was able to copy it directly to a thumb drive.  The Thunderbird folder is about 5.5GB size.  Then I turned on the Windows 10 PC, and looked for a similar folder.  I could not find any folder named 'Appdata\Roaming' on the new PC.  While not the current (102. release) of Thunderbird was present, there is a recent release. I got a message to update to the latest version, which I did do. </pre> <p>So, following your instructions, I found two folders relating to Thunderbird.  One is named Mozilla 'Thunderbird', the other is named 'Thunderbird'.  Using the Windows drag function, I hit on the thumb drive folder, 'Thunderbird', then dragged it to both the Mozilla Thunderbird folder and then to the Thunderbird folder on the 10 PC.  After making the copies, I opened Thunderbird on the PC.  NOTHING was there ..... only the initial folders which appear on the left side of the screen. </p><pre> So, I went to the Tools menu, clicked on the Import option.  I followed the prompts .... one option is to transfer the files from an external source.  I clicked on it, located the thumb drive and selected it.  When it showed in the window, I clicked on the Thunberbird folder, then pressed the Next button, and that's when I got an error message at the top, stating that there is a problem:  ""Import operation failed unexpectedly.  More information may be available in the Error Console."" </pre> <p>So, now I am no further along than I was before I started. </p><p>Furthermore, the 10 PC has one of my e-mail addresses listed, but when I tried to open it (in the 10 PC), instead a Gmail window opens asking for the e-mail address and the password.  The e-mail address that appears in the box is correct .... I've checked it several times, but when I type in the password, Gmail sends back a message that it's an incorrect password.  This is IMPOSSIBLE since I'm using this same e-mail address to converse with you, and I use it every day to converse with others, and I can  go to the native Gmail e-mail app, and it works there also.  So, WHY it doesn't allow me to open the e-mail address in Thunderbird on the 10 PC is a total mystery!!!! Please help!  I need to move off this 7 PC before it dies completely &amp; I lose all the important data that is stored on this PC. Finally, I'm going to have the same situation with FIREFOX, since that is my primary internet access application also, and based on these problems, I'm very fearful that I will have the same problems porting over all the web links that are in FIREFOX on the 7 to the 10.

In other words, if the server is configured to NOT keep messages, then it will delete them when downloaded even if the ""leave messages on the server"" option is enabled in Thunderbird. Some email providers, such as Gmail, have a setting that let's you choose how the server handles such messages. Check with your email provider if such an option exists.

Is there a way to fix this? </p><p><br> If you are copying emails back emails onto the org gmail mail account then there are limits which gmail impose. So if you have a lot of emails you are trying to upload then yes, it is going to take a while. You can only upload a certain amount each day. You can persist with this and it will work, but it will take time. See info: <a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en</a> </p><p><br> 2) Is there another way I can share/copy the emails via some other device/program that will allow the org to read and access the emails (i.e, external hard drive, but not sure what format the export would need to be for them to be able to access/read the emails?) </p><p>david has already mentioned one method, but you do not need to export a profile. It contains tons of information the recipient does not need and then they would have to work out where the emails are stored and may still need to convert them. </p><p>Thunderbird stores emails in mbox text files. It is possible to export in various formats. Regarding the person who wants the emails returned to the organisation - do they use Thunderbird&nbsp;? If no, what email client are they using or do they use webmail only&nbsp;? But to be honest, if you supply the files containing emails then you have done your duty. It would be their problem on how they put the emails back on the server. But it would be helpful to provide them in a format which is preferable.  </p><p>If you want to send all emails in a .eml format. Do the following to get a folder containing a load of individual emails in .eml format. </p><p>If you have all the emails in a Thunderbird folder - lets call it 'OldMail' folder because I have no idea where you have put them. </p><p>Create a new folder on your desktop called 'OrgEmails' </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Select the 'OldMail' folder (whatever folder has the organisation emails) </li><li> Click on first email in the Message List to get focus on list </li><li> Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press 'A' key - This highlights all the emails in the folder.  </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails and select 'Save as' </li><li> Window opens asking where to save - locate Desktop and select the 'OrgEmails' folder in list </li><li> click on 'Select Folder' button </li></ul> <p><br> All the emails you highlighted will now get copied as individual emails with .eml extension into the folder on the desktop called 'OrgEmails'.  Allow a little time for this process to complete if you have a lot of emails in that selected folder. </p><p>Now convert to a zip folder: </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'OrgEmails' folder and select 'Send to' and choose compressed zip option. </li><li> You should have a 'OrgEmail.zip' folder containing all emails and it's probably half the size of the original 'OrgEmails' folder. </li></ul> <p><br> <strong>Alternative option</strong> - access file that contains all the emails and create a copy.

Hence the 'real time protection' is getting very much involved on downloaded files and when files are opened and updated. </p><p>Scanning emails is not as helpful as you may imagine because Thunderbird by default does not allow remote content unless you choose to allow it. Thunderbird will not auto open any attachment. You should never open anything or click on anything just because you are curious what it is. Only open attachments which you know who sent it and that it is legit.  Emails are not really the problem, but allowing remote content and opening attachments can be. Neither of these occur by default. Only by an action by you. </p><p><br> If an Anti-Virus ever wants to 'fix' anything to do with a thunderbird file then do not allow the fix because it is likely the Anti-Virus will mess up your emails. If you use AV then set up instruction to 'ask' you what to do, so you can stop the fix and sort out the problem yourself.  Anti-Virus products do not understand that all downloaded emails are stores in a text file, so one file has many emails. If it fixes a file then you may lose emails. </p><p><br> As you say ""If I disable the realtime protection in Windows Defender I have no problems."", so you know what is causing the issue and I can assure you this is a long standing problem when it comes to Anti-Virus products. </p><p>Microsft says ""While real-time protection is off, <strong>files you open or download</strong> won't be scanned for threats."" </p><p>Suggest you first try this - make the Thunderbird profile folders are exempt from scanning.

I still have the backups. When I right click on any of the items in the Folder Pane there is no option to Subscribe nor Refresh. I did not remove the Gmail account.

But that would not have effected anything to do with your profile. </p><p><strong>You are correct about the reason for the reinstallation. I have a separate hard disk (D:) for programs and my Thunderbird installation was in the default directory so I wanted to move it there. However, I’m sorry but I misled you, by unforgivably sloppy use of language, about how I did it. I didn’t just delete the program, I did a proper uninstall.</strong> </p><p>Q - Did you reinstall the same identical version of Thunderbird which you were previously using&nbsp;? </p><p><strong>I doubt it. What I mean is, the installer exe I used for the installation I removed was pretty old. I can’t be specific because I have deleted it now. I guess that installation will have been upgraded periodically, so the net result probably was up to date, technically speaking. But to reinstall Thunderbird I downloaded and used the very latest version of the installer. So even if the reinstalled version was identical in principle to the version I uninstalled, I doubt it will have been an identical installation. If you see what I mean.</strong> </p><p>Q But did you mean you also wanted to move the profile data itself to a new storage location? </p><p><strong>Well, I’ll be honest, I don’t understand much about what a “profile” entails. Ideally yes, I’d have moved the profile data to a new location too, because I have another separate hard disk (E:) specifically for data. I like to try and keep my C: drive confined to Windows as far as possible. But the installer doesn’t give any options with respect to where the profile data should live, and I don’t know if it’s possible to relocate it, or if so how. So what I believe happened is my original profile was deleted when I uninstalled the original installation, and was recreated (presumably in the same default location) when I reinstalled.</strong> </p><p><em>re: I managed to recreate my four accounts without any difficulty,</em> </p><p>If you merely reinstalled the program then it would have started up and hooked up to the original profile data, thus meaning you did not recreate any accounts. Q Did this occur? </p><p><strong>No, I recreated the accounts, same way as I did when I originally installed. The reinstalled Thunderbird didn’t hook up to any original profile data. Like I say, I assume(d) the original profile would have been deleted when the program was uninstalled.</strong> </p><p>However, if you actually move the 'profile name' folder to another location.... Q Did you do this: Start Thunderbird, create a new profile and pointing it to look at the old profile - this would have updated the 'profiles,ini' file, so the new installed Thunderbird would know where to find the new location of original profile. Q Or this: Did Thunderbird start with a new profile, so you created the mail accounts again and then went into the Account Settings - Local directory and pointed the account to look in a different folder&nbsp;? </p><p><strong>Neither of the above. I didn’t create a new profile and point it to look at the old profile (I wouldn’t know how). Thunderbird started with a new profile, as I understand it; I recreated the mail accounts, but I didn’t do anything about pointing anything to look anywhere else.</strong> </p><p>re Address Books: In Address Book Q: Have you lost visibility of any actual address books? Q: Do you only use 'Personal Address Book' and 'Collected Addresses'? </p><p><strong>I’m not sure if I’ve lost visibility of any actual address books. Not a very helpful answer I’m afraid. I did a bit of experimentation last year with creating one or two new ones, but I think I may have deleted them again because something about them wasn’t working like I expected. What I actually wanted was lists of names in a group i.e. mailing lists. I think I made two mailing lists instead but I didn’t need to use them yet. What I actually see now, under Address Books from the menu, as well as the two you mentioned, is four more all called just Address Book. I believe these four are there because when I recreated my four accounts, Thunderbird asked me each time (something like) if I wanted to link to an existing address book it had found, and it seemed like the sensible answer was yes. They are all empty. Apart from them, yes, I only use Personal Address Book and Collected Addresses. And to say  I use them is a bit of an exaggeration; from my perspective, address books just live in the background and take care of themselves, without any input from me. In particular, I don’t understand how or why addresses get into one or the other of Personal Address Book or Collected Addresses; I only recall ever editing existing entries, not adding them. It was only when I started to compose emails after reinstallation, and started to type names that I expected to auto-complete and didn’t, that I had a look at the address books and found lots of missing entries.</strong> </p><p>Q: Is it only contacts that are missing? Q: What is the name of the address book that has missing contacts? </p><p><strong>When you say only contacts ... you mean, as opposed to mailing lists? No, I think there are mailing lists missing too. But only if a mailing list is a line item in an address book. I can't remember if that is the case, or if it is an object in its own right under Address Books from the menu, like an address book.</strong> </p><p><strong>Personal Address Book now has no contacts in it at all. Collected Addresses has 39 contacts; I couldn’t say how many were in it for the old installation, but I’m guessing two or three hundred at least.</strong> </p>",spargeus.maximus,false,1,0

Also, if you need to access those mbox files, it can be difficult to open the file if they are in excess of 2 GB and I would say ideally not larger than 500MB.  I don't let them get larger than 100MB. Extremely large text files can use enormous amounts of RAM if you try to open them and can cause computer to crash.  Thus I advise you avoid that potential senario. </p><p>Create more folders to organise emails for storage eg: Family, Friends, Bills, Online Orders, Thunderbird, etc etc. </p><p>In Account Settings &gt; Copies &amp; Folders set up 'Archiving Options' and archive anything over a year into yearly folders. You can also select to maintain folder structure.   Archiving can help to keep folders more manageable and reduce risk of loss. After Archiving emails from a folder - compact the folder. </p><p><strong>Compacting:</strong> Compacting is not compressing. Compacting the folder removes any downloaded emails which you have since moved or deleted, thus keeping the file tidy. Compacting is very important especially on Inbox, Drafts and Junk/Spam folders which get more moving and deleting than other folders. </p><p>Basically -The mbox file gets copied and Thunderbird scans through it looking for good wanted emails which it puts in a new file. Those emails that have been 'marked as deleted' are not copied.  Then new file replaces old file and new index is created. File size is reduced and made tidy.  Compacting in itself does not corrupt the file, but if file has not been maintained then it is more likely to be already corrupted and compacting it may end up removing more emails than you desired. Hence my advise is to create folders and organise emails into smaller files. </p><p>If you are seriously worried about eg: 'Inbox' You need to completely empty the 'Inbox'. Create folders and move emails into those folders. Then archive all the old mail. When Inbox is empty - right click on Inbox and select 'Compact' This will in effect create a nice new Inbox file completely empty and ready to receive new emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

This is helpful and clarifies some things.   You say: ""Thunderbird uses an index file to display the list of emails and it calls on the mbox file to display contents of actual emails, but if the index file gets corrupted/out of synch with what is actually in the mbox file, then it needs a repair. ""  So I take it that when the display of the Email was corrupted what was happening was that the index, presumably in a relational database, no longer pointed to the correct place in the mbox (text) file and hence what TB showed me was a mess.  That makes sense if the index was pointing with an offset so much of the formatting information at the top of the body of the Email was missed.  I think that fits perfectly with what I was seeing.  I guess to me this raises a huge question about why and how the index is getting out of synch and perhaps that is related to the compacting and the index not getting rewritten to reflect changes the compacting had made. Question: is TB looking at the mbox file on the IMAP server or copies on the local hard disc?  Where would I look to see the mbox folders and their sizes?  (Local is Ubuntu, IMAP is on a shared access Debian machine run by a very experienced and competent ISP.  I can follow this up with them when I understand it better.) </p><p>I understand the issues about sizes of folders.  I actually have many years of Emails stored in very many folders in a hierarchical structure.  The inbox is not the biggest folder and I think so far I've seen one corrupt Email there but a couple in other folders.  I _was_ allowing TB to compact whenever it wanted (and it now wants to do so very often).  Again, I guess pretty much repeating the last question, is compacting local or on the distal IMAP server, or both and having to keep them in synch?  I have quite slow broadband here and with some large folders, and many folders, I could understand if some synching between the local and distal stores is getting broken by time outs in the link. </p><p>Is there somewhere you recommend for me to read more about distal and local storage and about how archiving fits into that?  So far I haven't used archiving as I was reluctant to add more complexity to the storage systems but you are making it sound like a potential solution to some of the (putative) issues. </p><p>Thanks again and TIA for a bit more information/pointers.

My understanding of Troubleshooting mode (the only way I can get out of this problem and successfully re-enter the passwords) is that it deletes unused or old or unnecessary (not sure which) files.  Whatever the problem is, it doesn't delete the information about the three email accounts, instead it acts like the password is missing or invalid.  It invites me to enter the password, but it immediately responds with another invitation to reenter the password.  In other words, it acts like the password I entered is incorrect.  I assume there's no file that contains ONLY the passwords - instead I'm guessing there's a file which contains information about the email servers which includes the passwords.  Next time this happens I could examine this file.  Or is there possibly a trace function I could invoke when the entered password doesn't work? </p><p>I have no cleanup programs, nor do I use any of the security programs like Norton or McAfee.  I depend upon Windows Defender.  I do use Carbonite.  Is it possible that if Carbonite is copying a file to the cloud that the file is momentarily unavailable to Thunderbird?  Carbonite is the only new feature I've added on the Windows 11 system.  Thunderbird was on the same external ""D"" drive in Windows 10.  I put it there to make it easy to switch over to Windows 11. </p><p>I'm willing to work with anyone who knows how Thunderbird works to get to the bottom of this most irritating syndrome.  I appreciate all help. </p>",tcluster,false,0,0

In fact, i'm <em><strong>absolutely not</strong></em>. I am specifically, &amp; only, suspecting that <em><strong>my</strong></em> TB database might be somehow partially corrupted, &amp; thence causing the problems documented in my OP.  </p><p>Thus, your... </p><p>&gt;I can import .ICS files exported from Google Calendar. I just tested this and it worked fine </p><p>...is, with respect, nice for <em>you</em> but irrelevant for <em>me</em>. Of course <em>you</em> can import, because i never alleged any <em>global</em> coding error, ergo as long as your ICS file is not corrupt, then naturally it imports. As my OP showed, including pic, <em>my</em> ICS file clearly is a problem. <strong>I would love to know how i can troubleshoot it, &amp; ideally fix it</strong>.  </p><p>Regarding your... </p><p>&gt;When I right click on an event all I see is: ""Open"", ""ConvertTo"" and ""Delete Event"". I am (not yet&nbsp;:-) ) a TB calendar expert but I don't think there is a duplicate event menu item </p><p>...that's most surprising to me. Btw, i never asserted TB had a `Duplicate Event` context-menu item. What i said was... </p><p>&gt;Both Ctrl-C Ctrl-V, &amp; RMB-Copy RMB-Paste, simply do NOTHING [for it seems like the majority (but not entirety) of my Events].  </p><p>...ie, the way to duplicate an event is to copy it, then paste it on the target day. Here's a pic of the context-menu, attached. I cannot understand how your context-menu is missing some of these options. Now, in preparation tonight for replying to you, i did more tests, &amp; realised that i need to edit part of my OP. The now-<em>wrong</em> part is pasted immediately prior to this paragraph. The <em>corrected</em> replacement is... </p><p>&gt;Both Ctrl-C Ctrl-V, &amp; RMB-Copy RMB-Paste, simply do NOTHING [for it seems like only <em>some</em> of my Events, &amp; those being older than several years]. </p><p>In other words, it now seems that duplicating any of my events from the past few years works fine, but frequently fails for old events [eg, ~5 or 10 years ago].  </p><p>Re your... </p><p>&gt;Please try Thunderbird Troubleshoot Mode (if you haven't already) </p><p>...yes i have done this, but it makes no difference, ie, more recent events still duplicate, old events still often fail silently to duplicate.  </p><p>Re your... </p><p>&gt;Please let us know: your email provider  e.g. gmail, your calendar provider e.g. google, what 3rd party software like add-ons, anti-virus or firewalls you are using </p><p>...with respect, how is any of that relevant? We're talking about my <strong>ICS data</strong>, <em>not my email data</em>, &amp; [you did not know this <em>before</em>, but from my current reply you <em>now</em> do] the fact that `Troubleshoot Mode` [ie, disables all AddOns, `user.js` etc] does not help, logically eliminates any of those extraneous factors as being causal.  </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p><strong>TL;DR: I would love to know how i can troubleshoot my ICS data, &amp; ideally fix it.</strong> </p>",MsDropbear,false,0,0

I saved a copy of the pkcs11.txt file, which in retrospect was a good idea, because when I restarted Thunderbird it did not make a new version of the file.  Also, it asked for the password but when I entered it the indicator in the upper left corner kept going back and forth which suggested it was in some kind of loop.  I restarted it in Troubleshooting mode and it worked, sort of, even though there was no pkcs11.txt file.  I say ""sort of"" because I didn't keep detailed notes, but I think it worked without my entering a password. </p><p>Anyhow, I noticed that the pkcs11.txt file had the file spec for the C drive location, going back to 2018, so I made a copy of pkcs11.txt with that location changed to the new D drive location, and I restarted Thunderbird, NOT in troubleshooting mode, and it works perfectly. </p><p>So I believe all I really did was change the file location shown in the pkcs11.txt file to point to its new location.  It'll be interesting to see if this eliminates the problem I've been having.  To recount, those problems initially seemed to be related to Windows 11 sleep mode, and I stopped using that, but then more recently there was a recurrence of the problem and I know it wasn't related to Windows 11 sleep mode, so I'm not sure what caused it.  I have my fingers crossed that the problem won't recur. </p><p>I appreciate your help.  I'll update this record if anything happens down the line.

Your answer to 2a and 2b were helpful although can't imagine why an option to delete any new added item would not be in order. </p><p>I've been editing with the config editor for yrs. both with Postbox (a similar app) and previous versions of TBird off and on as I kinda wanted to use TBird but it always lacked some of the capabilities of Postbox. </p><p>But currently my old version of Postbox is not scaling well enough in my new higher resolution Laptop. TBird is showing up better at my display settings in any Scale Layout choice.

However, I can't see that there is any problem with the extension - it seems to me it is the website that is wrongly set up or the Addons Manager is faulty. The fact that the Manager failed in both our cases, it works  just fine via Google, which might well suggest a problem with the Manager. In some cases, although searching from the Add-ons Manager appears to give correct results. it shows extensions which are not compatible with 102.11. This actually could be the fault of the extensions but as more than one from different authors have problems it is more likely that the site (or its operators) is not sorting them into version correct types. I doubt the authors have control over this.  For example, a search from within the Manager for ""calendar"" gives a page with ""Google Calendar Tab"" and ""Open Google Calendar "" on it. Albeit similar, but apparently from different authors, neither of them work correctly with my version of 102.11 so it appears likely they are the wrong version. Even if the fault lies with the authors, I thought that extensions were supposed to be checked before they were allowed on the site - they used to be, anyway.

I will try to answer your excellent questions with the below summation. I installed an old saved version Ver 52.8.0 of Thunderbird on new Laptop and started Thunderbird, choosing to later create Email account data. Stayed in long enough to set few things including Auto Update to OFF and then exited (didn't want any surprises right now).  In a file manager I looked at the newly created folders and files in the TBird install. It did have a Profile with some files in the Profile root folder. But did not yet have a Mail folder. </p><p>I then (in file manager) copied the all the contents of my Postbox 3.x Profile (the Profile root folder files and Mail Folder, did not include minidumps) to the new created Thunderbird Profile overwriting everything with same name. (Postbox has similar mbox, msf file formats) </p><p>Then restarted Thunderbird and Popup came up saying migration updating or something like that. When it was done all my old Postbox email folders and email where there and all my account settings also came up good. I did not have to setup any new account or even give a login password. Everything came over as it was in my old Postbox profile.  I looked in TBird Options, Advanced, Update    it had a selection dot by Never check for updates (not recommended).  And in reference to this last sentence above, I need to make a correction to my original question wherein I said looking at new Acct settings that came with copied Postbox Profile it still had the box by Check for new messages at startup UNCHECKED. All my Mail and settings were there and functioning. That was my confused error of presentation, when I meant to type the Options-&gt;Never check for Updates. I apologize for my sloppiness therein. [ This is in fact the case since my old Postbox profile still has the [ ] Check for new messages at startup UNCHECKED, but that's not the same setting premise as software updates. I also leave this one unchecked since I like to choose when I download from server (not on startup). I'm still using my old Postbox to download from the Server until I decide on a new Email app. ] </p><p>But in any case everything came up the same in Thunderbird just fine. Because I wanted to check Thunderbird out a bit before I started taking stuff off the server with it.  So I must commend TBird on it's ability to absorb a moved Profile since that is important to be able to copy one's past Emails to a New app. </p><p>The only thing I'm curious of here is why it updated to ver 60.9.1 (32bit).  Again I realize updates are sometimes inevitable but I like to be able to decide on my own when that it is with any app or Windows itself. </p>",RB2124,false,0,0

I am on my Windows 10.  Thunderbird is on my Mac.  I will get to the rest when I am on it again. Here it is the next morning and, now back on the Monterey OS, I confirmed that I used my Comcast email address in the cc: field.  Later today I will telephone my ISP technical support about this abnormality of the last two months.  There is no other address synced with my Thunderbird on this system.  Thank God; otherwise I would have trouble with that address too!  Looking at your question in more detail, the From address is the same as the cc: field.  I am suspicious because someone might have tried to send messages to me who does that on a regular basis.  Those messages may have bounced.  The Get Message command does not seem to do anything.  In the Sent folder the cc: and the From fields show the Comcast address.  Comcast addresses end with @comcast.net while GMAIL ends with @gmail.com.  The Outgoing Server in Thunderbird under Account Settings is <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> and the Port is 465.  I use POP Mail Server <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> with Port 995.

I've read that in the future TBird is thinking of leaving the mbox format and going to SQL (or possibly SQLite) for it's Mail db files. If that happens what issues might be on the horizon for moving previous TB mbox profiles to the new Profile? Also wondering whatever version/type of the SQL db files if they might have viewable access with an app like SQLite in a case of them not importing into whatever email app the future might hold? </p>",RB2124,false,0,0

Z toho zbytku si platím stravu, ošacení, léky, základní hygienické prostředky atd. Letos naposledy mohly fyzické osoby podnikající podat daňové přiznání v papírové formě, příští rok to již nebude možné, takže všem, co ji doposud neměli, byla zřízena datová schránka. Certifikát je zatím ještě platný. Stáhla jsem si Adobe Reader, takže na 30 dní mám demo write. Do zkušebního dokumentu vložil digitální podpis. Jenže já prostě nemohu těch mých 3500 navýšit o poplatky za Adobe Writera, či Microsoft Office 365. To bych musela buď odhlásit plynoměr, nebo se odstřihnout od elektřiny, nebo vypovědět smlouvu u telefonního operátora a přijít o mobil + wifi.

Yesterday a Comcast technician helped a little with this problem although my eFax is still not fixed.  He explained that I had an address on my Safe List.  Addresses there mean that you only receive from those addresses.  Later I will get on the the Mac again and look further into this.  Now, I just realized that I should have written Monterey instead of Catalina.  Earlier I had to reinstall Catalina and upgrade to Monterey to make available video functions.  Now, I am on the Mac Monterey (not Catalina as indicated in the beginning).  For one thing, my Thunderbird did not come with a Spam folder; so I created one called Junk.  I do not know if that causes conflicts.  On my smartphones I only access my GMAIL, not my Comcast one.  In my Comcast account in the advanced email settings, I do not have use email safe list checked.  What is there is the email address my telephone provider requires for eFaxing.  So, as the technician explained yesterday, having that checked meant that I could send only to that address and expect a response, such as a cc: copy.  Unchecking that box made a difference because I now receive those copies and other messages that I regularly received.  Thank you. </p>",tightpurchaser,false,0,0

I tried to reproduce the error you're getting, by importing events from the same ics file, twice, into the same target calendar. The first import is successful because the target calendar is empty. The second import fails with that exact error, and the Error Console gives the exact reason why the import fails as follows: </p><p><code>There has been an error reading data for calendar: Home.  However, this error is believed to be minor, so the program will attempt to continue. <strong>Error code: DUPLICATE_ID. Description: ID already exists for addItem</strong></code> </p><p>The problem is the IDs of the events you're importing from the file are already in use by existing events in the target calendar. This ID is a unique identifier for each event, and therefore cannot be shared between events in the same database. In other words, duplicates of the ID are not allowed into the database. This therefore means you cannot simply import the same events on top of each other and overwrite the existing ones, thus eliminating duplicates and keeping only one entry of each event. Not in the current version of Thunderbird that I know of anyway. Thunderbird now uses SQlite as its database for calendar data storage. Perhaps there is an add-on for doing that. You could also file a feature request (enhancement request) to skip duplicate items here <a href=""http://bugzilla.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> if one hasn't already been filed. </p><p>You may want to use an external tool to merge the ics files from the two calendars into one ics file, then import that into a new blank calendar. I can't offer any recommendations for such a tool as I've simply not had to do this before. Google Calendar apparently automatically merges duplicates. You could use that and then export the resultant calendar. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

When I updated, the shortcut was set to the thunderbird.exe inside my Thunderbird64 folder. If I clicked that thunderbird.exe, I got the ""Settings"" window front and center. When I changed the shortcut to one that calls the thunderbird.exe in the topmost folder (my Thunderbird folder), everything went back to normal. </p><p>I'm guessing that you had to go into the other Thunderbird folder in Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\ to find the profiles.ini file and the Profiles folder, and you had to edit the .ini to call the right profile.

Braxmail, which goes along with it, is an even more impregnable provider than Protonmail or its equivalents. It is an Android phone, and unfortunately where I live it is not compatible with the only reliable provider in my area. So it just wasn't suitable for me. But I loved the Thunderbird program which Braxmail is compatible with. But I can;t get Apple Mail on the Brax phone, and I can't get Braxmail on my iPhone! So I thought if I installed Thunderbird to use with Apple Mail, it would make it easier to transfer the data I have on the Braxmail program (It is supported on my MacBook Pro.).

It's just a folder that uses that name (because the TB programmers set it up that way), so fear not. I <strong>respect </strong>and <strong>share </strong>your desire to keep your computers lean, clean, and mean! All I want you to try is creating a new, empty folder, and creating a new 1kb file to put in that folder. The text I gave you above will direct TB to hide your All Addresses folder from the Address Book panel list. </p><p>So, try it, if you will. You know that depositing a paltry amount into your checking account doesn't draw your banker's attention. Adding this folder and file will hardly be <strong>noticeable </strong>to the Windows 10 system, but TB will scan it and try to comply with your wishes. </p><p>To create the new folder in the right place, open TB, click Help in the menu bar (if you don't have the menu bar showing, press ALT on your keyboard, and the menu bar will show temporarily), then click (More) Troubleshooting Information, scroll down in this panel to Profile Folder on the left, and click the Open Folder button, and with the File Explorer window open, <strong>shut down TBird</strong>. Now place your cursor on a blank place in that open folder, right click and choose New &gt; Folder, call it Chrome, and hit Enter. Now leave that File Explorer window open and open any text editor you use (Notepad will do just fine) and put the line from my last post in the open text window. Then Save that text as (the name is important, as is the capitalization) UserContent.css  Now right click the name of that saved file and choose Copy, and in the still-open File Explorer window, double-click the Chrome folder name and paste the UserContent.css file into the Chrome folder. Now you can close File Explorer and re-open TBird, and when you open the Address book panel list, there should be no All Addresses folder listed. </p><p>It sounds challenging, and maybe even a little intimidating, but it's really, really easy if you take it just step by step, with this message window open (or a copy of this message and my last copied and pasted into something you can keep open) as a guide. </p><p>C'mon back and let us know how you did.

I can select individual names or contiguous names and get them into my To, CC, or BCC window just fine.  Where I have the problem is in selecting and keeping them selected so I only have to add them to my TO, CC, or BCC window ONCE.  Let's say I'm working with an address book of 500+ addresses; of those, I want to 150 to 250 for a given email.  Every time I sent an email of that quantity, the recipients are different, so I can't compile a new address book.  With the old Thunderbird, there were keys I could hold that would keep non-contiguous address selected until I added them to TO, CC, or BCC.  So I might choose from A to H, then I to M, then N to Z.  I can't figure out how to do this in the new Thunderbird in the latest MacOS.  Holdling the Cntl button doesn't do it, not does holding the space bar -- both suggestions found online. </p>",sbest64,false,0,0

It seems that I have one Profile folder for both my Gmail account and the old one, the Gmail stuff being within a subfolder called <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> and the old a/c stuff within a subfolder called Mail. This subfolder contains files called, e.g., John Smith, John Smith.msf and (in some instances) John Smith.sbd corresponding to the filters run on incoming mail. There are similar files within <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> – although only two ending in .sbd: [Gmail].sbd and INBOX.sbd. If I copy all the John Smith files from Mail into <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> and then restart Thunderbird, a folder called John Smith appears briefly in the list of folders in my Gmail a/c and then disappears, and the John Smith files have also disappeared from <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>.

If you send a message using GMail online, a copy of that message goes immediately into your Sent Mail folder in GMail, and as soon as your Thunderbird is open and running, GMail will try to synchronize by putting a copy of that same message into your Sent Mail folder in Thunderbird. (If you don't have a Sent Mail folder in Thunderbird, the only place GMail can put the copy is in your Inbox). If you send a message from TBird, GMail will put a copy of that message in your Sent Mail folder online (AND that message will also appear in your All Mail folder online, because ALL of your mail goes there -- which makes it confusing).

I think your difficulties may be beyond my capacity to offer help. ""If I have my Gmail account in Firefox, Chrome + Edge and use one to send an email, it will put a copy in the Sent folder on all browsers."" Yes, that's the way it's supposed to work. Gmail is one central server, and all three of your browsers link to that same server. The server tries to keep all of the Gmail folders you see in all of your browsers coordinated and synchronized. What you see in Gmail on Firefox and what you see in Gmail on Chrome should be identical. So far, so good. </p><p>""It also puts a copy in Tbird but it appears in it's inbox."" That's weird. What's in your Gmail folders should match what's in your TBird folders, except for any Local Folders you have. They are not coordinated with Gmail's server. The things you send from Gmail online should be copied to the Sent folder of Gmail, and you should be able to see them in the Gmail application on Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, AND they should appear in the Sent folder on your TBird client. I have no idea why they would go to your Inbox, unless you have a setting in Gmail that says ""Send a copy of anything I send from Gmail to my Inbox in Thunderbird."" I'm not aware of any such setting, but that doesn't mean there can't be one. </p><p>""If I send an email using the same gmail account in Tbird it appears in Gmail's All Mail Folder but not in the Sent folder in Tbird."" Also weird. It should appear in your TBird Sent folder and in your Gmail Sent folder (after a while, when the server syncs with your Tbird). As for the All Mail folder, I have nothing good to say, and my knowledge of how it works could be recorded on a small Post-It note. </p><p>I hope someone else will have some helpful ideas for you, since I seem to be fresh out of them.

If the mail-server (e.g., GMail) has a policy that any mail in Trash gets deleted after it has been there for 30+ days, Thunderbird cannot prevent the disappearance of old mail from your synchronized Thunderbird Trash folder. If the mail is gone from the GMail Trash folder, it's gone from the Thunderbird Trash folder. </p><p>However, Thunderbird has Local Folders, and your IMAP mail-server can't touch those. They are strictly local, on your computer. You can create local folders and you can store mail in local folders as you wish, and your mail-server will not manipulate the contents of those folders.  </p><p>If you have items in your IMAP account Trash folder that you do not want GMail (or your mail-server) to delete, select those items in the main Trash folder, right-click, and choose Move To, and follow the arrows until you get to the local folder where you wish to store those items permanently. Thunderbird will not delete any of those items, and your mail-server cannot access them. But if you have moved an item from the account Trash to a folder in your Local Folders, do not waste time looking for that item online in the Web interface for your mail-server. It won't be there. </p><p>Attached is my layout of folders. I use the Local folders for local storage, and I monitor those folders to make sure they don't grow too large. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

You can do that in several ways: 1: create a filter that does it; 2: highlight the messages, right-click and copy; exit TB and in File Explorer copy the Mail\Account\*.* folders to Mail\Local Folders - If account is IMAP, you should first click File&gt;offline&gt;download to ensure you have all messages on PC.

Let me summarize the problem. </p><p>Many customers and suppliers schedule appointments sending the invitation by email. Invite to calls, meetings, videocalls, etc. are sent with a email message. You confirm those scheduled events and add to your calendar by using integrations between those email messages and your calendar app/service. </p><p>TB now forces us to use its own calendar.  You no longer can integrate TB with another calendar app like before. </p><p>So I setup lightning, as I have no other option.  But every 2 months the integrations to other calendar apps stops. Sometimes it just don't sync, sometimes it's a security problem like now (password don't match). Each time I have to remove all integrations and redo the setup of lightning again from scratch. This time it didn't work....so I'm pissed off. </p><p>I do not know if the problem is from Mozilla side or from the calendars apps (Apple, Outlook, Google, etc.) I just want to avoid using TB calendar and go back to the old setup (TB directly linked to a calendar app) </p><p>And, I said, for no reason I will drop email integration to calendar services. I'd stop using TB and migrate to another email client that can manage invitation from different calendar services. </p><p>Thank you Wayne Mery for your message and support. </p>",gianluca7,false,0,0

The main function of IMAP accounts is to sync your account folders in your client software with your account folders on the mail server. You needn't be confused by the fact that when you delete a message from your inbox, it goes into the Trash on BOTH your client folder-list and the server (online) folder-list. That just means that the Delete button does not remove messages from the server. But if you right-click on Trash in your account folders in Thunderbird, and choose Empty Trash (or if you go online and choose the server's Empty Trash Now option), SHAZZAM! That trash is wiped from both your Thunderbird Trash and the Web interface Trash. Gone, baby, gone. (I like the ring of the option GMail offers me when I open my SPAM folder online: ""Delete Forever."" Has a real permanent sound to it, eh? </p><p>BUT </p><p>If you have a message, say, in your Inbox, and you want to keep it forever, you might move it from your Inbox to your folder named Archives (or to another new folder you created under Local Folders -- you can create a bunch of them for different purposes). In that case, you removed that message from the server by taking it out of the server's system. Now if you go to the online Web mail site of your server and check your Inbox there, that message you just moved will not be there after the server syncs with your client program. And if you check for that message online in the Trash folder, it won't be there, either. The server no longer has access to it, now that you've removed it from the server's system. </p><p>""If someone can make sense of all this so I don't stress myself out over what can go where, I will greatly appreciate it."" </p><p>I'm trying, my friend.

Lo dico perché posso provare ad aiutarti ma non posso fornirti nessuna garanzia. Dato che parliamo di dati che -mi sembra di capire- sono importati decidi tu se procedere o se nel caso non sia meglio chiedere l'intervento di un tecnico/esperto della tua zona. </p><p>Attenzione anche al fatto che <strong>la procedura seguente vale solo per gli account POP3</strong>. Per gli account IMAP il metodo da seguire è differente. </p><p>Detto questo ecco come potresti procedere: </p><p>[1] Anzitutto segui questa guida per effettuare un <strong>backup completo del tuo profilo Thunderbird</strong> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/profili-thunderbird#w_effettuare-una-copia-di-sicurezza-del-profilo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/profili-thunderbird#w_effettuare-una-copia-di-sicurezza-del-profilo</a> Non ci sono particolari rischi nella procedura che ti sto suggerendo, tuttavia è sempre meglio essere prudenti e disporre di una copia di sicurezza di tutti i dati. </p><p>[2] Installa in Thunderbird l'estensione <strong>ImportExportTools NG</strong> che trovi qui <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/it/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/it/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/</a> Se hai dei dubbi su come fare l'installazione, segui questa guida <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/installare-componenti-aggiuntivi-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/installare-componenti-aggiuntivi-thunderbird</a> </p><p>[3] Crea sul desktop o in un'altra posizione comoda una cartella che conterrà la copia d'archivio </p><p>[4] <strong>Individua tutte le cartelle di Thunderbird che contengono la posta che vuoi archiviare</strong>. Se vuoi archiviare anche la posta inviata, includi anche la cartella omonima (Posta inviata). Per ognuna delle cartelle che hai così individuato procedi in questo modo: </p> <ul><li> Click con il tasto destro del mouse sulla cartella </li><li> ImportExportTools NG &gt; Esporta cartella </li></ul> <p>Indica alla procedura di esportazione di salvare nella cartella che hai creato sul dekstop Se la cartella di Thunderbird ha delle <strong>sottocartelle</strong>, puoi anche usare il menu contestuale </p> <ul><li> ImportExportTools NG &gt; Esporta cartella con sottocartelle (con struttura) </li></ul> <p>in questo modo puoi salvare la cartella e tutte le sue sottocartelle in un unico passaggio </p> <ul><li> Ripeti la procedura per tutte le cartelle che vuoi salvare. </li></ul> <p>[5] A questo punto nella cartella sul Desktop dovresti avare una <strong>serie di file senza estensione contenuti in una o più cartelle</strong>. Sono tecnicamente file mbox e contengono una copia esatta della tua posta. Questi file non si possono aprire direttamente, ma puoi utilizzare ImportExportTools NG per riportarli in Thunderbird anche in futuro. Basta creare una cartella in Thunderbird, quindi </p> <ul><li> Click con il tasto destro del mouse sulla cartella </li><li> ImportExportTools NG &gt; Importa file MBOX </li></ul> <p>[6] Probabilmente potresti aver bisogno di consultare la posta archiviata in maniera più comoda. Puoi quindi <strong>crearne una seconda copia di archivio in formato HTML</strong>. Sul desktop crea una seconda cartella, poi torna in Thunderbird e per ogni cartella di posta da archiviare segui questa procedura: </p> <ul><li> Click con il tasto destro del mouse sulla cartella </li><li> ImportExportTools NG &gt; Esporta i file nella cartella &gt; Come file HTML (con allegati) </li><li> Nella procedura di salvataggio indica la nuova cartella del desktop come destinazione </li><li> Il risultato sarà un file HTML che contiene l'indice delle email, ed una serie di altri file HTML, uno per ogni email. Tutti questi file sono apribili con qualsiasi browser. </li></ul> <p>[7] A questo punto le due cartelle che hai creato sul desktop contengono una copia della tua posta in due formati differenti. È consigliabile che ne fai subito una copia su un <strong>supporto di memoria esterno al computer</strong>, per esempio una chiavetta USB dedicata a questo scopo. </p><p>[8] Potresti a questo punto cominciare a cancellare la posta da Thunderbird, ma se non hai problemi di spazio sul tuo computer <strong>ti consiglierei di lasciarla stare</strong>. Infatti se l'account è di tipo POP3 puoi limitarti a intervenire solo sulla casella Aruba tramite webmail. Da un qualsiasi browser accedi alla casella di posta e da li <strong>elimina le vecchie email per liberare spazio. Assicurati che le email che vai a cancellare siano le stesse di cui hai fatto il backup nei punti precedenti</strong>. </p><p>In sostanza con questa procedura le tue email saranno disponibili in tre copie: </p> <ul><li> Una rimarrà in Thunderbird in modo da poterla consultare in ogni momento </li><li> La copia in formato mbox contiene i messaggi nella forma originale e può essere utilizzata anche in futuro per recuperare tutte le email </li><li> La copia in HTML è invece immediatamente consultabile anche direttamente nel browser. </li></ul> <p>Se hai dei dubbi chiedi pure. </p>",@next,false,1,0

Negli account di tipo IMAP questa distinzione è molto importante, ma negli account di tipo POP3 lo è molto meno. In questo secondo caso non fa molta differenza dove siano state scaricate le email. <em>L'unica differenza che mi viene in mente è che le mail nelle cartelle di deafult dell'account potrebbero essere ancora legate al server se hai modificato le impostazioni standard</em>. Puoi verificarlo in Tasto menu &gt; opzioni account &gt; NOME_ACCOUNT &gt; Impostazioni server Ad esempio qui si può impostare la cancellazione automatica dei messaggi più vecchi. O impostare la cancellazione sul server quando un messaggio viene cancellato da Thunderbird. </p><p><em>2. quando faccio import export ho notato che non sempre mi scarica tutte le mail  (che in alcuni casi sono migliaia), come posso are per essere sicura che esporti tutto?</em> Per la mia esperienza ImportExportTools NG esporta tutti i messaggi.

Se fai click destro su una cartella e poi Proprietà, Thunderbird ti dice quanti messaggi sono presenti nella cartella, e poi confrontare questo valore con quello che ottieni con l'esportazione in HTML. In casi molto rari ImportExportTools NG trova messaggi danneggiati, ed in questo caso non riesce ad esportarli. </p><p><em>3. se faccio una sovra esportazione mi riconosce le mail già esportate oppure le ripete l'esportazione?</em> No. Però in futuro puoi limitarti ad esportare solo le email ricevuta a partire dalla data del backup precedente. </p><p><em>4. se cancello una mail da Aruba che è stata precedentemente archiviata (archivio di default) si cancella anche dall'archivio?</em> Con POP3 no. Però possono esserci dei settagli particolari su Thunderbird o sulla webmail. Quindi per averne certezza ti conviene fare delle prove con delle email sacrificabili o create appositamente. </p>",@next,false,1,0

What you need to do then is find a graphics program on your computer and open it and PASTE that clipboard image into the program. The easiest graphics program to find is built in to Windows 10, and it's called Paint. Would you click the Start button and look through the menus you see, and see whether you can find Paint? It may be in Accessories. If so, double-click the name to open it and put your pointer in the open white space, and right-click your mouse and choose Paste.  </p><p>Wow!

That is your junk folder according to your account settings. </p><p>All the folders you have circled are standard storage folders as far as Thunderbird is concerned.  They have the yellow icon. </p><p>Now this is where it gets messy.  You email account is I am assuming IMAP.  This gets it's folder list from the server and is in most cases supposed to get ""special folder"" designations from the server as well.  When there is a conflict between the account settings and the servers implementation of the junk/spam folder designations you can even get two.  Such as I have in one of my Gmail accounts. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-06-11-16-02-45-b097ac.png""> </p><p>In your case it does not look like the server is even offering a ""junk/Spam"" folder of it's own choosing or a sent so Thunderbird has set up it's own. There does appear to be an issue with the way the server is configured.  But you probably have no way of addressing that.  I cover it just as an attempt to explain the situation you are in. </p><p>You can change the  folder Thunderbird uses for junk in your account settings &gt; server settings part. By going to the copies and folders part you can change where copies are placed for sent items.  Just be sure to empty the existing junk folder before making the change as you can't do it afterwards and the same for the sent folder.  In that case move everything to one of the other ""sent"" folders you are trying to delete.  Your issue is you have what appears to be two already on the server other than the one thunderbird is using.  So which to select. </p><p>I know from experience that Microsoft use the folder ""Sent Items""  in their exchange environment, but also in Outlook, so it you are using Outlook app on your phone it will be creating the Sent Items. (you might get a clue based on the actual contents of the folder.)  The sentmail is an older naming convention and some servers actually default to this as the sent folder name.  Internally Thunderbird has the term in the developers code comments.  Most of those are over 20 years old. </p><p>My guess is that the correct folder for your server is SentMail,  and because of the misconfiguration I mentioned earlier both Thunderbird and Outlook have made up their own based on their defaults.   </p><p>When you connect to your providers web mail offering,  what folder do they show as a sent mail folder?  That is basically what David is suggesting.  OR you could contact them to inquire what folder name they use in IMAP for sent mail.  Then set you account setting appropriately. </p><p>I know you are looking for ""do this"" instructions,  but this is not a situation where that can happen as it is about synchronizing your settings to what the server is configured to use and we don't know what that is for the server.  So you have to determine it. </p><p>Just as an example,  Yahoo used a folder called ""Bulk Mail"" for spam/Junk.  In this they are I think unique.  But I mention it to demonstrate that without the server information we are sort of flying blind and can only suggest to you way of determining what the correct setting might be to harmonize things. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Generally these issues come for folk not compacting their storage, or the compact failing to complete. </p><p>Or contention issues getting access to the storage files to actually perform the function.  This is also a leading cause of compact failures.   </p><p>The leading cause of these contention issues is the ubiquitous antivirus product that is scanning this huge file every time it changes.   They are inherently slow,  taking something like 10 minutes per gigabyte.  Lots of folk have an inbox that is more than a few Gigbytes in size and updated every 10 minutes or so.  Then updates again to remove junk, move mails or delete them using filters (two more updates)  all before you the user actually get a look at the mail to interact with it. </p><p>The upshot is we recommend you exclude the Thunderbird mail and IMAPmail folders, but preferably the entire Thunderbird profile folder, from this on access scanning to prevent this contention. </p><p>There are detailed diagnostic steps here <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing:Memory_Usage_Problems</a> They are show in relation to memory there,  but really they are fairly generic. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Based on your suggestion and my findings, I went back into Outlook, grabbed one of the 111 problem files, and looked at the source: Even though the Subject and date stamp are shown correctly, the source is WRONG!!!! The source has the same errant Subject and date stamp as was imported! I checked a couple more and found the same. </p><p>Okay, so re-importing is out. But stepping away from what I can do for a minute to what happened. I think I know: Since I've been sending this series to the same several people, I have created each new message by opening the previous message and selecting ""Resend"". I'm guessing that Outlook sees all the 111 messages as the same message repeated. (I've done this a few times with TB accounts also [Edit as New Message]; I'll have to look back at their source.) </p><p>Back to fixing: So okay, if I decide I can't live with 111 ""identical"" messages, is it possible to edit the underlying file? I make this to be: </p><pre>[Identity]\[profile]\Mail\Local Folders\Outlook.sbd\Sent Items </pre> <p>And more importantly, if I do edit here, is there any kind of character count or coding within the file that will cause me to trash the file if I change it?

My email account (on my server) is IMAP but my Thunderbird account is setup as POP so that's probably why I don't see any sync options in my account settings.  So what I'm trying now is setting up Tbird on another computer and I'm downloading my server emails now. Once they are downloaded, I'm going to grab the emails I need and move them to a new local folder then copy that local folder to my main computer and put that folder into my ""local folders"" for Tbird, then move the files I need into my inbox.  Hopefully that will solve the problem for now, then I can back up my inbox and have all my current emails up to date. - Then, I'll look into switching my Tbird account over to IMAP from POP - looks like I need to create the new IMAP account and disable the POP account. </p>",jon107,false,0,0

A shortcut method I use is this: I select all of the messages I want to move to local folders for safekeeping, then right-click on the selected block of messages and choose Copy To and follow the choices down to the folder I want to put them in. Now they're in the local folder, and while the block of messages is still selected, I click the Delete button. The last step, since I never use Trash as a storage folder for anything I really might want later, is to right-click the main Trash folder and click Empty Trash. They're gone from the Inbox, gone from the All Mail folder, and gone from the Trash. They're only present in the local folder I put them in. </p><p>It's because that All Mail folder is a confused and confusing nuisance that many users unsubscribe from it in Gmail (you can just Hide it in the Gmail Settings &gt; labels section, and uncheck Show in Imap, and you'll not be bothered by it again). </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

Instead, you must selective identify the desired folders and that must be done outside of Thunderbird. Those profiles you have may go back a long time, as Thunderbird never uses more than one. New profiles are automatically created whenever Thunderbird starts and does not 'see' an active profile. Each profile has a Mail folder and in each Mail folder are POP account folders, which each contain folders of messages. Also, each Mail folder has a Local Folders folder and there may be message folders there as well. Your challenge is to identify all of them, rename as appropriate to avoid duplication, and copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder of your active profile. That preserves all of your POP mail in local folders. You are now free to create all the missing accounts. After verifying that all is working, you can delete the other profiles.  </p><p>One more thing: each profile as an addressbook named abook.sqlite.

So, over time, the problem escalates. The issue is rather simple when there is just one profile to fix. To reconstruct all of the mail folders, do as I posted previously. For example, you may see in a profile with a mail folder such as this:  Mail\&lt;accountname&gt;\INBOX and Mail\&lt;accountname&gt;\INBOX.msf  - those two go together. If you have multiple accounts, then you will likely see multiple message folders with the same name. So, my suggestion is to rename so that you will remember, such as accountnameINBOX and accountnameINBOX.msf    - Then, when you copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder, they will be unique from other accounts. I agree it's rather a messy situation, but it has accumulated. Once done, I encourage doing a full backup. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What you have accomplished, however, is you've taken your copies of those messages out of the control of the server. Then the task remains to take the load off the server by doing some housekeeping. </p><p>When you move copies to your own local folders, you are not deleting them and then emptying the Trash, you are just copying them. The fact that they disappear from an IMAP folder in TB doesn't mean they're deleted. In order to remove anything from the server (AND thus from All Mail), you've gotta delete that message and then clear it from the trash. </p><p>I actually find housekeeping easier in the server online interface than in TBird. I can check the server's folders/labels, select the unwanted stuff, send it to the Trash folder, and then open the Trash and either delete all, or do some picking and choosing and delete the rest. Sometimes, I just click the box at the top of the column to select ALL, and then go down the column and UNcheck any individual things I might want to give another think to. </p><p>Then when you re-open TBird (did I mention that it's a good idea to close TBird before you open the online interface and start housekeeping?), you'll see the syncing happening with each folder you open (the spinner is the evidence), and you'll see the results of your work online. </p><p>I see no reason to have the server stuck with long-term care of my messages. I put 'em in my local folders and take 'em off the server, and image my OS and program drives every night (only takes a minute and a half or so) so that if disaster were ever to strike, I have all my important stuff backed up and can recover in a flash. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

You have changed the port from from 465 to 587 and now I assume you get some sort of sending error.  What is it?  Clearly it has nothing to do with TLS.  Without knowing what the actual error is, offering anything but platitudes is not really an option. </p><p>What I do know about the bargain basement solutions offered by network solutions is they fail entirely to offer a valid SSL certificate for the server you are asked to connect to and a manual exception has to be created for each and every host and port used.  You I guess have an exception recorder for the old port but not the new.  I also have seen a couple of topics suggesting a bug in the request for a certificate not occurring if the password is saved.  So I suggest you go to the saved passwords in Thunderbird and delete the saved password for that outgoing account.

I have 24 hours experience with TB.  Yesterday I downloaded the software and successfully added 2 email accounts.  They are infrequently used accounts so I can afford to experiment before adding my primary email account.  My primary email account is web-based Outlook.  I'm bumping up against the maximum storage before needing to purchase more storage or deleting emails.  </blockquote> <p>So an IMAP configured account which is synchronized to the server is really not going to be much use to you without a true export option as offered by the import export add-on,  but it will probably be slow.  IMAP is also what Thunderbird created unless you chose to change the default in the new account to POP </p><p>Add-on <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> but search for it by name in the add-on manger (Menu&gt; add-ons and themes) to make the installation simpler. </p> <blockquote> If possible, I want to copy entire folders from the primary account to local folders on my PC using TB.  </blockquote> <p>Not a good choice as silent timeouts tend to see mail just go missing. So while technically possible I do not recommend it. </p> <blockquote>  I thought that process would be called archiving but am now thinking it's called exporting.  </blockquote> <p>What you want to do is export mail from the account.  But I really do not think Thunderbird is as reliable as you need to do this directly to a local folder.  Using the export tool to export folders to an mbox file will provider a Thunderbird independent backup/archive.  Which can be re-imported to local folders using the same tools reliably </p> <blockquote>  To be sure I don't lose anything, I absolutely want to leave the original folders/emails in my Outlook account  </blockquote> <p>So using a POP account which only downloads to local storage the inbox folder is not going to be an option as you would need to move the mail to have it download. </p> <blockquote> until I've copied them to local folders and verified everything came through.  Once I'm sure the emails are safely in a local folder, I'll delete most of them from the Outlook server. </blockquote> <p>See my comments on the import export add-on. </p> <blockquote> From my very, very short experience with TB, it looks like ""archiving"" means moving (not copying) items from one folder to another but the folder receiving the items still resides in TB, not on my PC.  Is this correct or am I mistaken? </blockquote> <p>You need to start thinking in terms of ""account"" and most certainly the default archiving means moving mail around in the account not outside it. </p> <blockquote>  I also think that ""exporting"" means moving (not copying) items from one folder to another folder that may, or may not, be a local folder on my PC.  </blockquote> <p>Export is always a copy.  It moves nothing. </p> <blockquote> I think the choice of folder and location is mine during the export process.  Is this correct?  </blockquote> <p>Only if you use the addon.  File save really only works for a few emails. </p> <blockquote> And is it correct that the items are permanently removed from their original folder during exporting?   </blockquote> <p>Most emphatically not. </p> <blockquote> While playing around with one of the email accounts I successfully moved to TB, I selected a group of 10 emails in a particular folder, right-clicked on the group, and selected ""Copy to ..."" where I selected a new local folder.  This successfully placed copies of the 10 emails in the local folder while leaving the originals in the folder on TB.  I suppose I could use this process to place the emails from my primary account into local folders but it would be time-consuming (unless I could ""select all"" for a given folder and copy a very large number of emails at one time).   </blockquote> <p>Select all Ctrl+A as well as using the block selection of ctrl key and shift with the mouse selection are all options.  As I mentioned earlier I do not recommend using them for bulk moves as the risk of loosing something rises as the number of mails increases.  Historically a few hundred would move ok but a few thousand would not.  Hence my recommendation of the import export tools addon. </p> <blockquote> I'd very much like to know if my understanding of archive, export and copy are correct and, if so, which I should use to get my emails into local folders.  Thanks in advance. </blockquote> <p>I think they are not correct. </p><p><strong>Archive </strong>is primarily moving mail around in an account.  It can be configured to place mail in another account i.e. ""local folders"",  but dependent on how the IMAP server works (it does not work at all with gmail)  it is best to just consider it to be within the account. </p><p><strong>Copy </strong>is what it says on the tin.  But again silent timeouts can cause issues for large numbers of mail. Folder copies (drag and drop usually) in my experience almost always are incomplete. </p><p><strong>Export </strong>is not something Thunderbird does natively and requires an addon.  the ImportExportTools addon is the de jure tool for this and handles the process by verifying each mail with the IMAP server as part of the export so it is slow and bandwidth heavy. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,0

I'll start referring to ""accounts"" as you suggested. 2.  I understand the difference between IMAP and POP, and specifically set up both new accounts as IMAP. 3.  I added ""ImportExportToolNG"" to TB after doing research but was waiting to use it until I got a response to my post. 4.  ""Archiving"" mainly moves mail within an account but not outside the account.  Not what I want to do. 5.  ""Exporting"" does NOT remove the mail from the original account.  Good; that's what I want.  I want the original to remain until I decide to delete it. 6.  ""Copying"" does what it says but may be unreliable when used with thousands of emails at one time.  Not a risk I want to take. 7.  You don't recommend using TB to export folders directly from the original account into local folders.  Rather, you recommend using the export tool (ImportExportToolNG) to export folders to an MBOX file and then export the folders from the MBOX file to local folders.  Can you point to a post or tutorial that explains what an MBOX file is and how I set it up? </p><p>By the way, I've never used an email client before but am impressed with how TB permits me to have several accounts open at the same time.

Well, I changed the server port back to 993 (which is probably what the tech rep told me it should be), but I didn't see anything like an ""apply"" button, so have I really changed it?  </blockquote> <p>Yes </p> <blockquote> And why does it say ""Default:110""? </blockquote> <p>Because your connection is not using encryption and it is a pop mail account. If encryption was used it would say Port 995 was the default. </p> <blockquote> I thought there were two servers one for outgoing and one for incoming, but the page just talks about ""server."" </blockquote> <p>Thunderbird maintains two separate server entries,  but they can be the same sever name.  It depends entirely how your provider configures their server as to what setting you should use.  They actually could require port 60,000 and that would be correct. </p> <blockquote> And I thought one had to choose between POP and imap,  </blockquote> <p>Correct.  At the time you create the account.  The name of the server has nothing to do with the protocols used. </p> <blockquote>  but on the page the top line says simply, ""Server Type: POP Mail Server,""  </blockquote> <p>Correct,  that is the protocol type selected at the time te account was added to the Thunderbird program and is immutable. </p> <blockquote> without any port number, and the second line says, ""Server Name: <a href=""http://imap.myfairpoint.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.myfairpoint.net</a>"" with port number 993. </blockquote> <p>What protocols the server supports has nothing at all to do with it's name. </p> <blockquote> But this all may be irrelevant, because I still can't see my incoming mail and the cause of that would seem to lie elsewhere. </blockquote> <p>Err didn't the folk at your provider send you mail and you got it in Thunderbird.  So Thunderbird is fetching what is on the server. Or it was at that point. </p><p>So we have a whole load of issues here still. </p><p>1. You account is POP.  Not IMAP so most of the advice about IMAP and IMAP ports will not work out.  I would not generally expect a server mane with IMAP in it to work for POP,  but if the same server is used for both it might.  But using the IMAP port of 993 is almost certainly not going to work. 2. Your provider (who I can not find on the web offering information about email) can tell you the correct server name, port number and connection security for your POP mail account.  I did try looking up setting on the web,  but unfortunately they are so focused on selling me  something I have to give then your zip to even gain access to their support pages.  Pretty shoddy really. 3. There is a reasonably good article on protocols and ports here. <a href=""https://au.siteground.com/tutorials/email/protocols-pop3-smtp-imap/v"" rel=""nofollow"">https://au.siteground.com/tutorials/email/protocols-pop3-smtp-imap/v</a>  It may help you with understanding of what the discussion is covering. 4.  Perhaps you could get your service provider to email you a copy of the server setup details,  names, ports protocols etc. so we are not guessing what they expect. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

I doubt that it is an IMAP provider issue because the holder relates to outlook.office365 and Microsoft prodded around my computer for about four hours and you would think that they would know if their IMAP servers were preventing it deletion. I deliberately refrained from mentioning the folder names because they are in Italian and I think that would likely lead us into blind alleyways. However for your info  the folders are Problemi di sincronizzazione, errori locali, errori server and conflitti. I suspect that they are office 365 app folders which may have been installed when I bought a recent Home and Student Office 2021  licence (from Microsoft). Where the Italian folders came drom I have no idea as I didn't install any Italian version although I have dabbled in Italian in the distant past but I think the Italian-ness would be a red herring </p>",ray.pioli,false,0,0

Your workaround is basically a slightly different way to move the Thunderbird data. Unfortunately, it did not work and I have been thoroughly surprised. </p><p>I copied the Thunderbird folder from the source (my old computer) on a thumb drive and it appeared that there were lots of files within the folder, so I assume it did a proper job of copying the contents of the folder. I then brought it to the new computer, went on Windows Explorer, and attempted to find the appropriate location for the folder. I went to C:\users\&lt;myid&gt;\ and that is where I saw the problem. There is no folder by the name of AppData.  </p><p>This morning, when I was trying to transfer the data, some kind of app or program by the name of duet display appeared on my computer. I then did a little bit of research and it seems as though some other people have complained about this program appearing mysteriously on their computers. Based upon what I've read, which I do not thoroughly understand, I decided to uninstall that program. I don't know if this has anything to do with the disappearance of the AppData folder, but it is as good an explanation as any, especially since I can still find a file with the name duet display on it. </p><p>If I uninstall Thunderbird and then reinstall it, will the AppData folder be re-created along with the roaming and thunderbird files under it? Otherwise, I may be stuck restoring the computer to its default settings and I am certain that having to reinstall programs will probably cause more problems.

I am surprised you haven't gotten an email from the host saying you email account is near full.  </p><p>You may have to actually; </p><p>1. Log into the email servers account to delete all of the emails you thought you deleted through Thunderbird, and while at it check the other folders there. Sometimes there are folders on the email servers that aren't shown through Thunderbird. </p><p>2.  Control what happens when you delete an email through Thunderbird.  Go to <strong>ACCOUNT SETTINGS - SERVER SETTINGS</strong> under your email account in Thunderbird and look for <strong>When I delete a message:</strong>  I set this to ""Move it to this folder""  and set the folder to ""Trash on ~MyEmailsTrashFolder~.  But you will have to empty that from time to time.  </p><p>Have you emptied your folder called ""Deleted""? </p><p>3. You are keeping a lot of folders in your email account. That's good if you need to access them from anywhere and any system. I only need to access then from my Home computer after a while, so I create <strong>LOCAL</strong> folders for organization and drag them off the server and save them locally.  This reduces my need to get online.  </p><p>You seem better than me at limiting the # of folders too. Good Job haha. I JUST created a NEW Profile to clean up things... </p><p>Having everything saved locally, seems to make Thunderbird faster for me too, as I don't have to go online to see them.

JMO </p><p>I WOULD export your profiles to a safe place before doing many changes. I'd also copy the whole profile's folder as a 2nd backup. I hate to lose info.  </p><p>If you are sure it's all backed up, you could delete Thunderbird and reinstall,  even though you could do it without backing up because data (Under the Users <strong>AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles</strong>) and the Program are completely separate.  But backing up is a good thing&nbsp;:) </p><p>I had issues, and I ended up creating a NEW Profile and opening both side-by-side.  I had used Thunderbird for YEARS, so I had a TON of old emails and Thunderbird had many versions of things like address books. So, I created a clean Profile, but still had access to the OLD Profile.  WOW is it fast now&nbsp;:) </p><p>I wrote a ""How to Create Profile Shortcuts"" To be added to this page; </p><p><a href=""http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-multiple-profiles</a>  </p><p>but it hasn't been approved yet. If you want, I can post how here, but do at your own risk (it should work no problem).  </p><p>It allows you to also open two profiles at the same time.  </p><p>You could just make a shortcut to use the profile manager more easily if on Windows.  </p><p>Do a search for Thunderbird .exe Right-Click on the Icon and select <strong>Open File Location</strong> Right-click on Thunderbird.exe and <strong>Create Shortcut</strong> Allowing to create one on Desktop. Right-click on the shortcut on the desktop you just created and Select <strong>Properties</strong> Find the <strong>Target:</strong> field  and Add a <strong> -P</strong>  at the very end. It should look something like this; </p><p>""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" -P </p><p>Go to the <strong>General</strong> Tab and  change name to <strong>Profile Manager</strong> </p><p>Now this will open the Profile manager easily.  </p><p>I would go to each profile and stop them from checking for mail until you have things all sorted so that emails aren't downloaded to the wrong profile and deleted before you intended.  </p><p>You can also Make shortcuts in a similar way, and add the specific Profile to the target. With this, you can actually open two profiles at once. I did this to compare my 10+ Year Old Profile settings to the NEW one I created.  </p><p>That line in the Target would look like this... </p><p>""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe"" -P ""MyProfleName-NotFolderName"" </p><p>Again, for this Profile, rename it to the actual Profile it will be opening. </p><p>So, I have a few Shortcuts to the Profile manager AND the Profiles themselves. It helped while I was sorting things out.  </p><p>For me, it was a bit of work redoing all the settings to match MOST of my old profile settings, but I feel it was worth it.  At the same time I was able to import and sort ALL my old Addresses in the Address books. There are a FEW address books from over the years (various versions like v2, v3, etc...).   I feel it was worth it. I still have access to my OLD stuff, but rarely need to go there. It's a nice, fresh start and noticeably faster.  </p><p>YOU may just want to create a temporary <strong>TEST</strong> Profile to see if you can solve connections with that.  </p><p>Good Luck!!! </p>",Chicks_Hate_Me,false,0,0

Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.

I collected the PC and set about changing the password in case of error. I did this myself and again with 123-reg telephone support.

GMail forces it's own copy v so unless you use BCC,  just disable it in Thunderbird.

Enter the antivirus.  Do you have one? I have seen some pretty nasty crashes and connection failures caused by anti virus products and simply settings in them like ""monitor encrypted connections"" can see mail grind to a halt. I am not a fan of mail scanning as I am yet to be convinced it is really necessary.  But even for folk who routinely disable email scanning this scanning of encrypted connections which is generally considered to be web stuff can bite IMAP mail accounts. </p><p>Try if you can restarting your computer in safe mode with networking as see if you have the same issues. That does disable browser scanning and other AV functions,  so I would not recommend it long term nor would I suggest extensive browsing while you test if Thunderbird is still affected. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

In <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> created copied a folder with messages into Parent folder Checked Thunderbird, new Child folder and messages appeared via sync. </p><p>At this point I believed all was now set to proceed with main upload to <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> </p><p>Copying a handful of folders at a time (exact number varied due to the number of messages in each folder) old message folders were moved to the new, “proven good”, Parent folder. Checking in <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>, the uploaded Child folders and their messages were shown. </p><p>Thunderbird at first appeared slow to recognise the new Child folders, although it did appear to be checking.  This did not concern me, as there was a lot of new data for Thunderbird to now sync. After leaving Thunderbird running over the weekend, when no new Child folders appeared, this is when I started to question if Thunderbird was seeing or sync’ing <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> as desired … that investigation has finally brought me here asking for other input. </p><p>I think the about process is very similar to what you are suggesting?

I'd do a full image backup of C: first just in case something goes awry, and also have a full backup of the current folders before I delete them.

I've just had a similar discussion with another person who was not getting a password prompt and after several checks they realised they had not properly switched off all Firewalls. It then worked so they decided to follow advise and get Thunderbird set up as an allowed program and only have one Firewall in operation. </p><p>You should have only one Firewall working on computer. If you have installed various Anti-virus then one of them may be controlling the Firewall. eg: If you use McAFee and it controls Firewall and you switch it off then the default Windows Defender may  auto switch on.  So you will still have a Firewall operating. It's also possible you have domain, public and private selections in the Firewall and you may have only switched off one of them.  So it's possible to think you have switched off Firewall, but may still have one operating. </p><p>Please make sure you have done this and it must be done for whatever program is controlling the firewall. Exit Thunderbird, access Firewall and set up thunderbird.exe as an allowed program and if using Windows Defender set it up to allow using PUBLIC. Then restart Thunderbird. </p><p>Can you please confirm - any program running Firewall has Thunderbird.exe set up as an allowed program . Please post images showing this. So we can rule this out. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Gmail realise that this is not exactly very userfriendly, so they created 'labels' which means they offer a view which looks like folders.  When a 'label' is applied to the email in the 'All Mail' folder, it gets displayed in whatever the label is called. When a new email arrives on the gmail server, it will auto get the 'Inbox' label.  Depending upon whatever settings you have set up in the webmail account, it may also get another label eg: 'Important'. The application of 'labels' means the one sinle email in the 'All Mail' folder can be seen in more than one label/folder. They are not separate copies of that email, just a virtual view of email in various folders/labels. When you delete an email you need the email to go to the gmail Trash folder/label which is sometimes also called 'Bin'. Gmail will then realise you want to delete the email from the 'All Mail' folder, so all labels get removed and email cannot be seen in any folder and after 30 days gmail will auto remove that deleted email from the 'Trash' and it's gone. </p><p>In Thunderbird, you need to use an imap account in order to see all the same 'labels/folders' as shown on the server.  In Thunderbird those gmail 'labels' are separate files, they are displayed as folders. All default server folders will be auto subscribed to be seen. </p><p>You must set up Thunderbird to do the following. When you delete email - put email in the gmail default 'Trash' folder. Check this now and confirm you have this set up properly. </p> <ul><li> In Account Settings </li><li> Select 'Server Settings' for the gmail account </li><li> When I delete a message: </li><li> Select&nbsp;: 'Move it to this folder' and select 'Trash on gmail account/email address' </li></ul> <p>If you make any changes to this setting please check to see if deleting now works ok. Post an image showing this setting so we can see what you are using. </p><p>Then when you click on 'Delete' email should get put into the gmail 'Trash' folder. </p><p>However, there may be occasions when you want to delete the email from one folder but not all folders eg: delete from Inbox but keep the same one displayed in 'Important'. OR delete the email from the imap account Inbox but keep it stored on server in 'All Mail'. This process means you really need to instruct gmail to just remove a 'label' not actually delete completely. In Thunderbird, you need to use a different delete method, one that bypasses the gmail Trash. Using keyboard - Hold down 'Shift' and click on the 'Del' key. Note there is no 'Undo' action available for this. But it does mean email is still in 'All Mail' folder, so you could access gmail webmail account and get a label re-applied for whatever folder you want. </p><p>You say <em>when you delete an email, it reappears in four different places.</em> There are two things here to clarify: <strong>1</strong>. <strong>What method are you using to delete&nbsp;?</strong> Are you right clicking on email and selecting delete message&nbsp;? Are you reading email in Message Pane and clicking on 'Delete' button&nbsp;? Do you have the 'Delete' column header enabled - select email and click on the bin icon in column&nbsp;? There are other methods - what method are you using? </p><p>'<em>2. '</em><strong>What four different places are you talking about?</strong> If you see the 'All Mail' folder in folder Pane then I'll advise you to unsubscribe from seeing it because it is just a complete copy of absolutely everything you are already seeing in all other folders.  In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li> right click on the gmail account name and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> Select the 'All Mail' folder and click on 'Unsubscribe' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Please tell us what other places the deleted email appears. </p><p>Suggest you post an image of the Folder Pane so we can see all the list of folders. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

That includes Address Books, Calendars, mail accounts, emails, filters etc etc. A Profile can have many mail accounts. Very useful because you can see all emails for all folders in all accounts in the same view and all have access to the various address books. </p><p>Each mail account is for an email address which can be set up as either Pop or Imap. Each mail account gets displayed in the left Folder Pane along with it's own set of folders. </p><p>Below is an example images showing how the left Folder Pane displays various mail accounts - one per email address. Some are pop and some are imap and of course at the bottom is Local Folders. I'm using the Thunderbird dark theme and do not worry about the folder icons because I had altered them.  </p> <ul><li> The first image shows 4 mail accounts plus Local Folders. I have collapsed 3 of them, thus decluttering the area. </li><li> The second image shows those 'collapsed' accounts now expanded to see all their folders, the top main account is just showing part of it's folders - I would need to scroll up to see them. </li><li> The third image is slightly different, I've selected some folders to be 'Favourite' folders then abled the Favourite view so those folders get displayed at the top. </li><li> The fourth image is different again. This time I've switched on 'Unified' view. At the top you see all the default folders. These are virtual display folders. eg: Inbox now contains all the emails from all the various account Inboxes. Note how it has a &gt; chevron on the right of Inbox - click on it and then you see all the individual Inbox for each account.  Below all the Unified default folders then comes all the separate accounts and all the folders I created display within each account. </li></ul> <p>Hopefully this will explain how several mail accounts get displayed within the Folder Pane. You can expand or collapse them as required.

This is not new, it has been the same for so long I cannot recall it being any different. </p><p>Example: If you typed some text such as <strong>what gets undone</strong> and went to a new line and typed the word <strong>test</strong> (at this point all the text on both lines is part of the same block using undo now would remove all of it - so do not do it) then used 'back space' to edit thus removing the <strong>t</strong> so you have <strong>tes</strong>, this effectly means this is a new starting point as there has been an edit, now retype in the letter <strong>t</strong> and that becomes the new start point; now use Ctrl+Z to undo, you will find only the letter <strong>t</strong> gets removed. Use Ctrl+Z again and the t is reinserted as that was the previous edit section, Use 'Ctrl+Z' again and everything is removed as that was all part of the same contiguous editing block. </p><p>Note:  if you ever type a section and then want to preserve it - add a space and use backspace to clear the space or type a double full stop/period and then use backspace to clear one of full stops. This acts like an edit meaning if you then pasted in text and needed to undo, a Ctrl+Z would only undo back to last new starting point - the edit of the space/full stop so Undo in this case would only remove the pasted section. </p><p>This is a neat trick to remember - using the backspace as an edit to reset a start point. This is particulary useful for those who like to use Undo. </p><p>That's all well and good but what happens if by accident you used Undo and the whole lot disappears. Do this: 'Edit' &gt; 'Redo' (<strong>Ctrl+Y</strong>) will get it back. Using 'Ctrl+Y' Redo is used as a reverse of Undo 'Ctrl+Z' </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

Whenever you are asked for an account password you are also prompted below in the dialog to use the password manager to save the password. </p><p>Thunderbird saves a separate password for incoming and outgoing.  Even if they are identical. </p><p>Many folk who appear on this site with password issues have installed a third party password manager (sometimes in an internet security suite, I think Norton for one had such a ""feature"" if I recall correctly) and that is the source of their frustration.  Not Thunderbird or their mail server/provider. </p><p>It is also a ""feature"" of many antivirus product or their firewall components to simply block new unknown versions of Thunderbird,  and here you are on a beta that updates often.  When that blocking occures you are prompted for a password. </p><p>Finally if Thunderbird fails to connect it pops up a connection failed error and asks for a password,  the assumption that that is the most common reason for a once working setup to suddenly fail.  But the existence of a request does not in itself mean there is a password issue at all, it means there is a connectivity issue. </p><p>So then we move on to oauth authentication which is used by most of the non ISP mail providers these days.  The initial authorization process uses a password known to you to authorize the access. The actual ongoing token used by Thunderbird to interact with the server is supplied via the internet to Thunderbird by the mail provider and is stored in the password manager.  You will see these in the password manager as oauth: in the beginning of the entry.  Authentication failures with oauth do not pop up a ""normal"" request for password prompt.  Instead starting a flow of web pages to authenticate permission for Thunderbird to access the account with the provider. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

They have not changed that on the e-mail server.

That would explain the change to using sent Mail and Deleted Items.  Trying to fight that is like trying to stop the flow of the amazon river.  When in rome do as the romans do has been a long term saying and it is very relevant here.  refusing to accept the folder names the server imposes it futile and will lead to ongoing issues going forward.  you will not even be able to effectively emply the trash.  in the end you account will crash because it is full. Or you will be buying more space with the provider to store your undeleted mail.  It is not about just getting the folder you like to see visible. </p> <blockquote>The ""Junk"" folder shows up every time I subscribe on my account.  So I'd  say it still exists on the server, correct? </blockquote> <p>Yep I would say it exists.  You can even tell Thunderbird to use it in account settings.  But what happens to the mail the server considers junk and places in it's chosen spam folder is you will not see them.  I would guess missed mail in your future unless you use whatever the server designated junk/spam folder is.  Generally Thunderbird is notified of a folders status when it connects and allocated the correct special folder icon to designate it's special function. </p> <blockquote> I was able to correct this the last time, about a week ago, when the same thing happened.  It was a different folder that I was having an issue with trying to get it back.

Force deleting the foldertree.json file in the profile directory forces a rebuilding of the folder pane from source rather than use that cache on the next start.  Just don't try deleting it with Thunderbird running. </p> <blockquote> Anyway, I'll keep plugging away at this and hopefully someone with the right answers will be able to help me restore Thunderbird to the way it was before all these changes happened.    </blockquote> <p>You might try simply running Thunderbird on your system once you restart it in safe mode with networking.

I am running 102.12.0 64-bit on Windows 10 22H2. I should have checked it more carefully.  I never run beta versions or those under development knowingly.  </p><p>The article link was helpful because I was unaware that right clicking a displayed connection would allow me to edit the data.  Likewise the information about oauth token gives me more to consider.  Thanks.   </p><p>I do not see a ""flow of web pages"" related to TB permission to access the ISP mail client but rather see only the message shown in the screen shot.  Providing the known-to-be-at-my-ISP mail account password in response only returns the same message.  The message appears periodically, based on a time interval (I think) and is presented for each of my ISP email addresses regardless of anything I initiate in TB. </p><p>I do use a password manager, Roboform.  If it provides a password without me being aware of it, that is news to me.  That's another avenue to investigate. </p><p>I had not suspected a connectivity issue because I can send and receive Gmail and browse the web successfully, although I have experienced some response delays.  My wife has experienced the same using her iPad and iOS facilities without TB.  I left this area unexplored because I thought the issue to be related to 100+ degree temperatures in our area for the last couple of weeks.  I will explore this further. </p><p>Finally, can you respond to my recovery strategy of resetting passwords in both TB and at my ISP?  Is this plan realistic?  Is there a better strategy?

Unfortunately in the last 20 years the public consciousness has largely turned ""the internet"" and ""the web"" part of the internet into interchangeable terms.  If you are not familiar with ports,  it may be helpful to consider them in terms of lanes on a highway.  You can access lane 443,   but that does not mean you can get stuff to the same destination even using lave 993 </p><p>Things like VPN's, software firewalls and in some cases other installed software all can interrupt data on specific ports,  either intentionally your thorough accident.  Some VPN's simply do not support anything but the World Wide Web.  Software firewalls are particularly suspect as most rely on recognizing the software making the call to the port.  Hardly helpful if the software is a new version.  For instance you mention Thunderbird as version 102.12.0.  The point part (12) will last about 4 weeks usually.  The next component which you report a 0 can be updated any time in that 4 weeks if there is some sort of emergency release required.  So at best these software firewalls go out of date about every 4 weeks and most rely on phoning home to learn of new releases. </p><p>Hardware firewalls on say routers do not interest themselves in the source application.  They simply allow or block data on a port number, or block and allow certain <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram"" rel=""nofollow"">datagrams </a>on the port using packet inspection.  Historically there was a US ISP that released new modems to their customers that blocked their own mail ports.  It was a mess and went on for longer than it should have because the majority of mail is now transacted on webmail,  not mail clients. So even these can cause issues. </p><p>Roboform is not something I am familiar with,  but in the past the Norton ""vault"" caused issues with auto filling old passwords.

I (accidentally) ran the filters manually on all folders and noticed messages moving out of my inbox.  I looked at the log and saw that 28 messages were moved from where they were to where they belonged.  This was after trying repeatedly on 6/29 to get the filters to work working in folder ""To Filter"" in the Inbox.  At that time I was seeing the same messages in the log, e.g. ""[7/2/2023, 3:49:15 PM] Applied filter ""HBO Max"" to message from Max &lt;Max@stream.max.com&gt; - Don’t miss the Love &amp; Death finale. at 5/25/2023, 6:21:11 PM moved message id = 5NtFvr6cRjCIPHPfssn-yw@geopod-ismtpd-5 to mailbox://nobody@Local%20Folders/Advertisements"" but the moves didn't happen.  I tried several times over maybe an hour but the moves (for some, not all of my changes) did not occur even though they were logged.  It wasn't just once and it was over a long period of time.   </p><p>After that I noticed few errors in my filters and corrected them.  When I tested the filters they worked.  The log was correct and the actions listed were actually taken.   </p><p>Don't know what was happening 2 days ago but the problem seems to be gone.  My guess is that the hourglass at the top of the folder list for advertisements has something to do with it.  In any case it seems there's nothing to do now.   </p><p>Thanks, Mike </p>",MikeA01730,false,0,0

The good backup I mentioned is on my previous computer, which is still set up but unused for exactly this sort of problem. That computer has an older version of TBird. So I'll export that folder as individual .eml files, then import those files into my current PC. Hopefully that will fix it! More soon.

I decided to delete all my ISP email accounts and the smtp connection settings for them and add them back.  I was successful in getting 3 of 5 accounts added back, but I'm struggling with the last 2.  In TB I go to Account Settings &gt; Account Actions &gt; Add Mail Account...  to get to the data entry panels.  In the first set I enter the name, email address (complete with domain name) and password requested.  Before coming to TB I set my browser to my ISP's web pages for setting up and changing email passwords and set the PW there to the same value that I copied and pasted into the PW panel. </p><p>After clicking the Done button I got a response indicating confirmation.  I think - but don't know - that this step checked to verify the ISP domain was valid and maybe even that an account exists there.  After this confirmation, I chose the POP3 protocol for mail handling for the account and chose to configure manually.  My ISP uses port 110 for incoming POP3 mail and 'none' for connection security and port 587 for outgoing SMTP mail with connection security also set to none.  These settings worked  for the 3 accounts that I successfully deleted and added back in TB. </p><p>For the 2 accounts in question, my last response after it checks the password is per screenshot.  I can't understand why it works for 3 accounts but not for the last 2.  I thought that there might be a delay at my ISP in updating changed passwords, but I'm getting the same results a couple hours later. </p><p>Any suggestions? </p>",rabbithutch1,false,0,0

Maybe  duplicate messages deletion works only on incoming messages. And why are there triplicate and quadruplicate and sometimes 12-15 identical messages? Thanks. Ron </blockquote> <p>The why is complex and generally related to outside influences and incomplete downloads,  either through connection loss, antivirus activity, network congestion causing timeouts or just slamming the lid shut at the end of the day. </p><p>They generally duplication only occur if you leave mail on the server as it is the management of the local mail Vs the retention status on the server that results in duplication because the POP protocol is not well suited to  that when many years of mail are involved.  IT was a concept rooted in a time when having a couple of hundred email over a period of years was to have a lot and for those with ""a lot""  the server only allocated around 5mb of disk space to the account filled and forced deleting fairly quickly anyway.  The situation being that unless Thunderbird knows exactly were to start, the sever serves the lot when asked. </p><p>One thing I did not mention in the causes is actual physic issues on the disk that make the program unable to read the files in question.  That is a matter to address with operating system disk integrity checking tools. </p><p>I would also like to take you definition of crash to task here.  A crash results in the program ceasing to appear on the screen and by default is followed by the popping up the the Mozilla crash reporter so you can describe when you were doing when the program crashed and include that in the crash report. </p><p>Hanging is when he program simply ceases to respond and is sometime involved a message from the operating system the the program is not responding.  I will go out on a limb and guess this is what you had happen,  not a crash, as it is something I would expect to happen if processing a huge folder of files and sorting the duplicates out with that add-on.  I  could even see (have seen in the past) a dialog informing you the process had timed out,  and offering to continue.  Something you show allow. </p><p>So did it crash,  or was it working away and you became impatient? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

Sorry to take a week to say so. </p><p>2)  Matt, when  I said ""obscure"", I didn't mean it was hard to get to.  Rather, I meant that for a new user - myself, at least - I don't think of an email account as a file, so I wouldn't expect it to be under File / New.  It's a combination of the location and the labeling that makes it obscure. </p><p>3)  I followed the instructions in David's 6/30/23, 5:10 AM post before seeing Matt's 6/30/23, 6:20 PM post.  Here's where that's at. </p><p>a)  I added all my accounts successfully.  The data went into C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\ </p><p>b)  With TB closed, I copied the Thunderbird folder to K:\AppData\Thunderbird\ </p><p>(The folder copied easily, except for one .js file.  However, I was able to copy that file too in Windows Safe mode.) </p><p>c)  With TB open, I changed the profile location of each account in that account's server settings. </p><p>d)  On that basis, when I ""get messages"" for each account, files change in the K drive location, not the C drive location, meaning that TB is utilizing the K drive location for the account.  Good. </p><p>e)  HOWEVER, when I close TB then remove the Thunderbird folder from C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\ and then reopen TB, it opens with no accounts.  This means that even though the information *FOR* each account is in K drive, and *SOME PART* of TB knows to use K drive for the account, *THAT PART* of TB - that is, *THE PART WHICH TELLS TB TO USE K DRIVE* - is itself on C drive, somewhere in C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\ </p><p>f)  Then I wanted to tell TB to look on K drive - in K:\AppData\Thunderbird\ - for the information about the accounts (and everything else TB needs to know, besides what's in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird), so I can delete the Thunderbird directory in C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\  </p><p>(That's really optional, since at least I've got TB dumping my messages into K drive, which has room for them, instead of my cramped  C drive, but I'd like to get rid of a directory that's (almost) only clutter.) </p><p>g)  At this point, after doing all the above, I finally saw Matt's 6/30/23, 6:20 PM post.  And with this page ... </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles</a> </p><p>I managed to get to Help / Troubleshooting Information / Profiles / about:profiles </p><p>(Actually, on my TB 102.12.0 64-bit, it's ""More Troubleshooting Information"" rather than ""Troubleshooting Information"".)  </p><p>h)  That page (see attached image) shows two profiles.  The first says ""This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted."" </p><p>So on the second profile, I clicked on Open Folder.  I figured I would navigate to the location of K-drive copy of the first profile.  However, when I got there, I found that I couldn't save the new location.  There's no Save button. </p><p>i)  So Then I figured I would create a new profile and make it the default, as per Matt's suggestion.  But when I opened the Create Profile Wizard, it said (again, see attached image), ""Your user settings, preferences and other user related date will be stored in:"" and then showed the C drive location. </p><p>I suppose I can still follow through on my intention in ""i"", which might immunize me to the problem Matt pointed out with David's suggestion, but it seems i still can't wipe out the Thunderbird folder on C drive. </p><p>Stymied again! </p><p>Your comments, suggestions and warnings at this point, gentlemen? </p><p>Thanks again to you both! </p><p>Keith </p>",firefox2367,false,0,0

I gave instructions to change the location of the accounts - which works perfectly - but I also made the error of stating you could then remove the original profile. My error. My instructions to copy profile to another drive and then change settings for account in thunderbird are  a quick and easy way to move profile, BUT, that still leaves the original profile pointing to accounts in the new profile. SO.... when you deleted the old profile, the pointers to the new profile died. To fully remove profile from drive C, you need to use profile manager. But even then, you still have a commitment to drive C, as that is where Thunderbird gets its information. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Unfortunately, neither the password deletion worked... I've managed to send messages by connecting through VPN to my institutional server, though. It is not the best solution and I've posted a question to my internet provider. Still waiting for their answer, I 'm afraid. Any other idea? </p>",eleanag,false,0,0

Another weird problem occurring is there a sub-folder I wish to delete, and the program won't let me delete it.  Don't know if that's related to the first problem. </p>",cmb1,false,0,0
