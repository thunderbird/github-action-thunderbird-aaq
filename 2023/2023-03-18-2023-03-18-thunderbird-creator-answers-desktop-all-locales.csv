I'd like to do the same for my wife. However her existing other provider accounts are POP but her Gmail account is IMAP - can I mix POP and IMAP accounts in the one profile, and are there any pitfalls to watch out for. Her accounts are both personal and work related so it is vital not to lose anything. If I can do this, would unified folders function correctly and how (if) would dragging from POP to IMAP mailboxes/folders work? Guidance would be much appreciated </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1571183;,jameschall

When I want to share a Pages document, I have different options but none of them is via a Thunderbird email. In ""extensions"", the box ""Thunderbird"" is not even clickable (see picture attached).  Two professionals tried to fix my problem but eventually said that the issue seems to come from Thunderbird and not from Apple.  Hence my question: how can I be allowed to share a Pages document in a Thunderbird email smoothly, without having to go the other way around (new e-mail -&gt; attach doc -&gt; Pages doc)? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your support. </p><p>Best, </p><p>Flora </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1571432;1571437;1571655;1571665;,flora.riechel

However Thunderbird filters don't provide this option. That is, if I fill the option ""forward to"" with a few email addresses, everybody will receive my email where all the recipients are visible.

The ""About Thunderbird"" dialog would take me to 91.13.1, which is the latest version of Thunderbird 91, but I see that there is also a Thunderbird 102. In fact, if I click on ""Download  Thunder bird"" from the Thunderbird Release Notes main page, it downloads the 102.9 installer. What is the recommended upgrade path? From 78.14 to 91.13.1 and then later to 102.9 or straight to 102.9? </li></ul> <p>Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1571218;1571351;1571353;,TampaTom

Recently I have run into a problem.  I can receive emails from my Gmail accounts but I can no longer send emails.  It just freezes and shows a “sending message” box.  I have checked and checked on the settings and OAuth2 is set and I am out of ideas.  Thunderbird works fine for other accounts, (GMX) </p><p>oauth://<a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> (<a href=""https://mail.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/</a> …) entries are in the password listing for all accounts.  </p><p>So, I removed one the Gmail accounts and reinstalled it.  I was asked to confirm that I want to allow Thunderbird to access the account and I agreed.  Now THAT one works.  I knew the account works because I set it up an a Portable Thunderbird first and it worked.  </p><p>Is there an easier way? I have EIGHT Gmail accounts an others that use OAuth2. (13) </p><p>Also, I noticed that after I removed that account, the “<a href=""http://pop.gmail-9.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail-9.com</a>” was still in the Mail folder.  A new “<a href=""http://pop.gmail-16.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail-16.com</a>” was created after the account was reinstalled.  As a matter of fact, there are several “pop.gmail-?#.com” entries for accounts that were removed years ago.  Can I delete them? Should I?  </p><p>Thank you.
