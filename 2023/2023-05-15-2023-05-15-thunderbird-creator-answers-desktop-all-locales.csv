At around the same time, I also deleted and reinstalled Thunderbird, because I wanted to change its install location. I managed to recreate my four accounts without any difficulty, but an unexpected consequence of one or the other of these actions seems to be that most addresses have vanished from my address books. It is as if the address book records are pointers to intray email headers, and when those emails are removed, so are the address book entries ... though I'm sure that's not what's actually going on! Maybe it's just coincidence, but whatever the explanation, it <em>is </em> the case that my address books are shadows of their former selves. I browsed the first three pages of hits when I searched for ""address book"", but there are more than a thousand hits and that way lies self-help madness! Although I did look at one hit that gave me to wonder if I need to rebuild the global database. Grateful for any wisdom; been using Thunderbird for many years and this is the first time I've resorted to asking the community.

I recently installed an old saved version 59.x.x [Correction, was Ver 52.8.0] of Thunderbird on new Laptop and started Thunderbird, choosing to later create Email account data. Stayed in long enough to set few things including Auto Update to OFF and then exited (didn't want any surprises right now).  I then (in file manager) copied the all the contents of my Postbox 3.x Profile (the root folder files and Mail Folder, did not include minidumps) to the new created Thunderbird Profile (overwriting everything with same name). Then restarted Thunderbird and Popup came up saying migration updating or something like that, but it came up with all my old Postbox email folders and email and all my account settings. My old Postbox profile had the [ ] Check for new messages at startup UNCHECKED, which that all came up in Thunderbird just fine. Because I wanted to check Thunderbird out a bit before I started taking stuff off the server with it.  I then checked the TB version and it was then 60.9.1 (32bit).  So it did update which was surprising since I had updates set to OFF both in Thunderbird and the old Postbox Profile accounts. Ok so whatever with that, the thing I wish I could change now is there any way to hide the Subject Column in the Message list. I only need Correspondents and Date,  the Subject is in the message at left anyhow. But for some reason Subject is not listed in the column selection drop down.
