In past year began using Thunderbird for my company email that migrated to Exchange. I have TB 102.13.1 setup to retrieve my company email thru Owl for Exchange plugin. Been using it for while now and all goes good with the exception of filters and tags. I have several filters setup on the inbox to check on incoming messages and every 10 minutes. If an email comes in from a certain sender the filter will tag it a certain color.  I have a total of 3 filters that look for particular  senders to tag different colors. When I first setup it seemed to work as intended. Recently it has stopped to automatically tagging the emails. I can manually tag the email but that kinda defeats the purpose of having the filters. Is there anything I should look for to trace the problem. As I said it worked initially. TIA </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tpoole
