This still happens after a Thunderbird restart with all addons disabled. This basically prevents me from customizing the keybinds with the tbkeys addon and makes Thunderbird a lot less useful to me. </p><p>If there's a way to truly disable/change keybinds within Thunderbird itself, I'd happily go in that direction, but I couldn't find any documentation on it. tbkeys seemingly ""prevent defaults"" the keybinds you specify, however that seems to fall apart if you hold the key down. Regardless, I think that disabling or changing the keybinds without needing an addon should be a native Thunderbird feature. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",wilhueb
