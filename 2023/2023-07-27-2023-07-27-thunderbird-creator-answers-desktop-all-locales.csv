The program also seems much faster in opening and more responsive in general, congratulations! </p><p>I found a small bug I think and I would also like to take the opportunity to give some suggestions about the program. </p><p>The bug is with the calendar. When creating an event you can place it in several pre-established categories, each of which had a different color in previous releases. Color which was then also displayed in the box created on the calendar, through a colored line which helps the eye to identify different events. But in 115.0.1 this feature is buggy, all categories have the same color and the colored line is not displayed on created events. </p><p>Suggestions: </p><p>1) Instead of a small colored line it would be useful if the whole box of the event created in the calendar were colored in the chosen colour, it would be more functional for days with many close events and also more aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. </p><p>2) In thunderbird you can customize folder view with various columns. Once the first folder has been customized, you can copy the same setting and apply it to other folders and subfolders, there are two special functions to do this, but there is no way to apply the setting to all folders at once! It would be extremely convenient in all those thunderbirds that have many configured mailboxes. </p><p>3) The date column should never be shortened when resizing thunderbird from full screen to custom size or side view with other programs. All the other columns if resized do not have much impact on the user experience, you often understand the subject even by reading only the first three words, you often understand the correspondent even by looking only at the first 5 letters, but in my opinion the date column should be always fully visible, time included. </p><p>4) Please allow donations in Bitcoin, free software for free software. </p><p>Thanks again for your work, we love you!&nbsp;:) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,it,"",V.

I've always had that at the top of the folder tree, not in alphabetical order way down the list. Or in my ""Travel"" folder I similarly to ""Kept"" have tickets and hotel bookings. I want that near the top too, but also, within it I want the subfolders in chronological order of trip. And so on.

I suspect that there must have been some email content from the hosting server being reticent to arrive, or maybe not all, and it timed out. </p><p>Anyway, if there is a problem with the arriving email and content, it would look better if the header was there so that some action, other than closing the tab, could be actioned. Otherwise it looks like Thunderbird is not behaving correctly. </p><p>Even subsequent re-openings of the email show a significant delay.

Deleted everything from win.10. The minute the new Tbird  115. Tried to install. A pop up window said my password and user name failed to connect to my server Spectrum. no matter how many times I tried latest config. And password . It would continue to reject it. I only have one email address for 15 years. But it keeps rejecting the password.  Tried switching from pop3 to IMAP. Can’t get past the log in box. And therefore I can’t get a blank, clean new install. I have deleted every remnant of Tbird.  I’ve tried this 30 times this past month. And the same result happens. The pix show what happened the first time I tried to reinstall. Now I can’t even get to those options.  All that happens is the constant rejection of either the password or the server domain name. Like spectrum “(<a href=""http://mail.two.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.two.com</a>) or <a href=""http://mail.spectrum.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.spectrum.net</a>. Those are Spectrum’s server domain names that always worked. And still do.Just not with MY Tbird.  I don’t want to have to surrender and switch to Outlook. I love Tbird. I started using it in the days when it was part of Netscape in 1998. </p><p>Please help thanks  Michael </p>",download-and-install_1;spectrum;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1593356;1593360;,expo21
