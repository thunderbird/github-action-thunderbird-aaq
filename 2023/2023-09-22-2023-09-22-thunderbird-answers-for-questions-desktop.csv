Thunderbird is automatically updated, then it is the last version available (eventually downloaded from the site just to be sure). I read carefully the page at the link you suggested and the points 4, 6, 8 and 10 caught my attention, because more close to my environment. Well, I was able to solve my problem, just focusing on previous points. The situation is: - 6 IMAP mail accounts from different provider (gmail + 2 Italians) having total folder size of 122GB! - all the indexing in the windows property of all the folders already set to no-index - wrong indexing of all the emails in Thunderbird now set to the last 30 days - all the accounts interval checks for new mails already set to 10 minutes - wrong configuration of all IMAP folders to check for new messages now set correctly - a couple of add-on disabled out of three (I will check in the future what to do) - off-line mode very useful to narrow the investigation of the problem More over, I have not found the hidden preference ""mail.check_all_imap_folders_for_new"" cited at point 8 last bullet in the page, it is very likely it was an old parameter. Any way no impact at the end. I took note of the dramatic increase of HD space and I hope to find a couple of day to clean much of this. That's it.  Thank you a lot, because I made a survey on other email clients and no one is like TB that I like so much. All the best Vincenzo </p>",62marvin,false,0,0
