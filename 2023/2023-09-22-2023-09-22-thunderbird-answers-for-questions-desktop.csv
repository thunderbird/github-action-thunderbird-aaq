Thunderbird is automatically updated, then it is the last version available (eventually downloaded from the site just to be sure). I read carefully the page at the link you suggested and the points 4, 6, 8 and 10 caught my attention, because more close to my environment. Well, I was able to solve my problem, just focusing on previous points. The situation is: - 6 IMAP mail accounts from different provider (gmail + 2 Italians) having total folder size of 122GB! - all the indexing in the windows property of all the folders already set to no-index - wrong indexing of all the emails in Thunderbird now set to the last 30 days - all the accounts interval checks for new mails already set to 10 minutes - wrong configuration of all IMAP folders to check for new messages now set correctly - a couple of add-on disabled out of three (I will check in the future what to do) - off-line mode very useful to narrow the investigation of the problem More over, I have not found the hidden preference ""mail.check_all_imap_folders_for_new"" cited at point 8 last bullet in the page, it is very likely it was an old parameter. Any way no impact at the end. I took note of the dramatic increase of HD space and I hope to find a couple of day to clean much of this. That's it.

I was hopeful that would be a one time thing for it to get its bearings, but no such luck. Opening another folder in a new tab is still taking several minutes, during which time TB is completely locked up and unusable. </p><p>I will say that after the new tab is established in TB, I can navigate to different folders within my accounts just fine. There appears to just be a glitch when opening a new tab. </p><p>I'll try the full Windows Safe Mode later today and report back. However, I have already confirmed that the pre-Supernova version of Thunderbird does not have any such issue, so even if Windows Safe Mode somehow resolves this, it remains a Supernova-specific issue. </p><p>I do have large folders with hundreds of emails in each, and my main storage account is around 65GB. However, again, the previous version of Thunderbird does not display any such issue, with the same account settings. </p><p>I'm currently working around the issue by just opening up the tab(s) I need and leaving them there, but this is definitely something that should not thwart the new version compared to older versions. </p>",lowraxe,false,0,0

Anyway, I opened TB while in Safe Mode and it did open right up quite quickly. However, by running in Safe Mode I also did not have my hard drives unencrypted, so the ""storage"" accounts that I keep in TB also could not be opened. </p><p>With that information in hand, I went back to non-Safe Mode Windows and opened TB, first with no internet connection (which was still slow) and then with my drives still encrypted (not available), and the situation where the drives were not available opened right up with no problem. </p><p>So, my diagnosis is that Supernova does not like me storing my email on a drive other than the drive where TB exists. It seems that opening the program initially, and opening a new tab triggers some process that has a problem accessing the other drive. To be clear, the other drive exists on the same incredibly fast NVME mSata as TB, but just on a different partition. </p><p>Again, this is not an issue in older versions of TB, so is there anything that can be done to remedy this issue? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",lowraxe,false,2,0
