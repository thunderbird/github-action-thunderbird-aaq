The issue is that I have a global inbox that emails from my two accounts are downloaded into. The servers need to be included for these accounts when downloading mail. Maybe the option to download mail from individual accounts has been discontinued? </p><p>[<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1021349|The"" rel=""nofollow"">button ""Get Messages"" is not active or does not work</a>] </p>",eugbug1,false,0,0
