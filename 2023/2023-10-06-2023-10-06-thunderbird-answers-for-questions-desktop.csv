I group emails in my Inbox by tag, and those in other folders by date. Sorting by date is okay, but being able to group those dates into relative chunks is really helpful. It's the grouping function that no longer stays collapsed. Curiously, the text in the patch you linked to refers to both ""thread"" and ""group."" I don't know enough to know if that's significant.

I might note that until recently, my emails were going out and coming in using the <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> server for both. For those who might be following this thread, Spectrum also specifies: </p><p>To get started, make sure you have: </p><pre>   Username: Your full Spectrum-provided email address    Password: Your Spectrum-provided email password    SSL: On    Protocol: IMAP    Port: 993    Port: 587    Requires Authentication: Yes, or checked </pre> <p>Once I re-install Thunderbird, I will install my 4 email accounts and even try the suggested Security STARTTLS setting if things don't work as well as trying different ports.

Why the TBird folks make this so difficult is beyond my comprehension. </p><p>I have the VMs (virtual machines) from today (with broken TBird 115), from a week ago (with 'working' TBird 115) and from 7 months ago (with TBird 102). I also have VHDs (virtual hard disks) containing the complete verbatum profiles from today, from a week ago, and from 7 months ago. I will boot the VM+VHD from a week ago, export that profile, then boot the VM+VHD from 7 months ago, blacklist TBird, update Linux to current, import the exported profile, and I'll be up-to-date but running TBird 102 with all my mail current. </p><p>Regarding what is wrong with Supernova, Wayne and i have discussed it but got nowhere.

I really don't have time to be filing bug reports.  I just want to go back to the version that was working.  This is ridiculous.  I downloaded the add-on, and reset Unified folders.  It brought back my Sent folders, but now my unified folders are not populating.  We are supposed to be making improvements, not becoming a burden on users.  I donate money to try and help out, and that's all i can do for now.  I'm 65 years old trying to figure out how to keep from starving to death, that is my priority.  Don't fix it if it aint broken.

Interesstingly, I could migrate all my emails and folders effortlessly to 14 - and I would have kept it, if there was a way to expand the disc space. </p><p>English is not my native language, so there might be some misunderstanding here, but I definitely mentioned that I upgraded Thunderbird continuously from whatever version was the newest in spring 2020 until October 5, 2023 and it worked like a charm. Unfortunately, I made the mistake to buy a new computer and install Thunderbird 115.3.1 on this <strong>new</strong> computer. This initial installation on the <strong>new</strong> computer, which took place on Oct. 5, 2023, caused the subsequent problems.  </p><p>My account is IMAPed, indeed, and I access it on several devices and <strong>all emails are available on all of them</strong>.  And they only disappear from my inbox - or any inbox on any device - when I delete them. I might even delete an email on my phone but leave it in my inbox on my computer. At least, I could do this until Oct. 5, 2023. After I installed TB 115 on my new computer, things changed. On this computer - and only there, and this being the <strong>only initial installation of TB 115</strong> - my emails disappear from my inbox - and <strong>only from my inbox</strong> - as soon as I close TBird 115.  </p><p>It might be early on a Saturday morning over here, but:  </p><p>If the server settings overrule local settings, and the server settings <strong>were not changed</strong> between closing TBird 115.3.1 on my <strong>old</strong> computer and opening TB 115.3.1 on my <strong>new</strong> computer, why do my emails <strong>only disappear on the new computer - and only from my INbox</strong>? <strong>All the contents of the other folders are not deleted</strong>. Shouldn't this logic not also apply to the Sent box, because all my emails disappear (on purpose)  from the server as soon as they are sent? Yet, the are all in my local Sent box. </p><p>The screenshot attached shows TBird 115 on my <strong>old</strong> computer, please note the date and time (CEST) in the bottom right corner, the second screenshot shows my inbox on my <strong>new</strong> computer after closing TBird. Please also observe the date and time (CEST) in the bottom right corner. The server settings were not changed in the meantime unlike the contents of my coffee cup. If you compare the screenshot of my <strong>new</strong> computer with the ones I sent yesterday, you will notice that there were emails in my inbox. And no, I did not delete them. They were work-related. </p><p>If the server settings overruled local settings, as you stated in your reply, my inbox on this <strong>old</strong> computer should be completely empty. Yet, it is not. And these local settings would be pretty superfluous if the server settings controlled the behaviour of Thunderbird, wouldn't they? </p><p>Neither F8 nor Layout&gt;Classic View does the trick. I am not daft. </p><p>Thanks for the article about threaded messages. </p><p>Somebody recommended that I should use the ""Quick Filter"" function in 115 which would allow me to filter for my unread messages, as they are no longer marked as ""unread"" when they belong to a thread (-&gt; Inbox shows 1 new email, but no indication in the message pane (i.e. sender and subject bold), so I have to open all messages to which this new message might belong).

Here's a little-known trick: If you want to be able to reinstall Thunderbird at some future time and not have to diddle with the many config editor stuff you've entered on prior installation, you can create a file that reinstalls on future versions. Here is how to do that:  - exit TB - open the prefs.js file in the profile with a text editor, such as Notepad. Do NOT use a word processor, as this is simple text and you DO NOT want to change it.  - locate entries you want to use on future installs, such as mailnews.default_view.flags and copy that one line, including the&nbsp;; at end of line  - paste it into a new txt document and save, renaming the file as users.js  - Now, when you install THunderbird in the future, copy this file into the profile BEFORE you create accounts and the default will be unthreaded at the outset.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself. </pre>",davidsk,false,1,0
