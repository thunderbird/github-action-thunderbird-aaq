A thread refers to a conversation. I've never threaded conversations and never will. Groups are a more generic way of organizing. I group emails in my Inbox by tag, and those in other folders by date. Sorting by date is okay, but being able to group those dates into relative chunks is really helpful. It's the grouping function that no longer stays collapsed. Curiously, the text in the patch you linked to refers to both ""thread"" and ""group."" I don't know enough to know if that's significant.

Here's a little-known trick: If you want to be able to reinstall Thunderbird at some future time and not have to diddle with the many config editor stuff you've entered on prior installation, you can create a file that reinstalls on future versions. Here is how to do that:  - exit TB - open the prefs.js file in the profile with a text editor, such as Notepad. Do NOT use a word processor, as this is simple text and you DO NOT want to change it.  - locate entries you want to use on future installs, such as mailnews.default_view.flags and copy that one line, including the&nbsp;; at end of line  - paste it into a new txt document and save, renaming the file as users.js  - Now, when you install THunderbird in the future, copy this file into the profile BEFORE you create accounts and the default will be unthreaded at the outset.&nbsp;:) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
