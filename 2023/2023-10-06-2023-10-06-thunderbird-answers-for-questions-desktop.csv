Unfortunately, I made the mistake to buy a new computer and install Thunderbird 115.3.1 on this <strong>new</strong> computer. This initial installation on the <strong>new</strong> computer, which took place on Oct. 5, 2023, caused the subsequent problems.  </p><p>My account is IMAPed, indeed, and I access it on several devices and <strong>all emails are available on all of them</strong>.  And they only disappear from my inbox - or any inbox on any device - when I delete them. I might even delete an email on my phone but leave it in my inbox on my computer. At least, I could do this until Oct. 5, 2023. After I installed TB 115 on my new computer, things changed. On this computer - and only there, and this being the <strong>only initial installation of TB 115</strong> - my emails disappear from my inbox - and <strong>only from my inbox</strong> - as soon as I close TBird 115.  </p><p>It might be early on a Saturday morning over here, but:  </p><p>If the server settings overrule local settings, and the server settings <strong>were not changed</strong> between closing TBird 115.3.1 on my <strong>old</strong> computer and opening TB 115.3.1 on my <strong>new</strong> computer, why do my emails <strong>only disappear on the new computer - and only from my INbox</strong>? <strong>All the contents of the other folders are not deleted</strong>. Shouldn't this logic not also apply to the Sent box, because all my emails disappear (on purpose)  from the server as soon as they are sent? Yet, the are all in my local Sent box. </p><p>The screenshot attached shows TBird 115 on my <strong>old</strong> computer, please note the date and time (CEST) in the bottom right corner, the second screenshot shows my inbox on my <strong>new</strong> computer after closing TBird. Please also observe the date and time (CEST) in the bottom right corner. The server settings were not changed in the meantime unlike the contents of my coffee cup. If you compare the screenshot of my <strong>new</strong> computer with the ones I sent yesterday, you will notice that there were emails in my inbox. And no, I did not delete them. They were work-related. </p><p>If the server settings overruled local settings, as you stated in your reply, my inbox on this <strong>old</strong> computer should be completely empty. Yet, it is not. And these local settings would be pretty superfluous if the server settings controlled the behaviour of Thunderbird, wouldn't they? </p><p>Neither F8 nor Layout&gt;Classic View does the trick. I am not daft. </p><p>Thanks for the article about threaded messages. </p><p>Somebody recommended that I should use the ""Quick Filter"" function in 115 which would allow me to filter for my unread messages, as they are no longer marked as ""unread"" when they belong to a thread (-&gt; Inbox shows 1 new email, but no indication in the message pane (i.e. sender and subject bold), so I have to open all messages to which this new message might belong).

I group emails in my Inbox by tag, and those in other folders by date. Sorting by date is okay, but being able to group those dates into relative chunks is really helpful. It's the grouping function that no longer stays collapsed. Curiously, the text in the patch you linked to refers to both ""thread"" and ""group."" I don't know enough to know if that's significant.

I only use a ""POP"" inbound mail access account - I've never used IMAP online account access. Also I use the same core LOCAL FOLDERS for all my inbound accounts (now only one inbound mail account) online.  </p><p>Prior to this week, a folder would open after (I'd say) 2 seconds with mouse pointer sitting on it. This was still too short a time for me but I figured my shaking hand issues made my own moving a messages a bit harder (slower). Now that time is less than one second. The time it takes for me to to touch a folder long enough for a ""being dragged message"", to actually move to that folder, is more than enough time to also open the folder. Usually the folder opens well before a dragged given message moves to that folder. </p><p>Another thing that started about 3 to 4 weeks ago, is that I get unable to move error messages errors when running my message filters. This happens both in auto message filter mode and when I manually run message filters or manually run ""get messages"". Subsequent tries sometimes succeed and sometimes take up to 6 additional tries to finally get all the messages to be moved to the corresponding folders, from inbox. The same also happens when moving messages from any folder, to the trash folder. </p><p>Don't know if this is somehow related. </p>",steve570,false,0,0

I suggest you try that one.  If that does not do it.  Look to any antivirus program you may have,  they often inject incompatible addons into the running process and mess up new versions of Thunderbird. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
