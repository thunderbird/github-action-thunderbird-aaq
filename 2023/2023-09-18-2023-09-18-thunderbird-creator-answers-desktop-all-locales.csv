So I switched to native support and everything was working great mostly.  </p><p>But then the last few days or so, the Calendar stopped showing some of the events. Some of them show just fine but a lot of my events are missing. They are still there on the Gmail side of things. They just don't show in Thunderbird. </p><p>I found a recent chat about this exact thing but it was an outdated issue that I believe was fixed. But here it is again (or maybe a different cause/bug is behind it this time).  </p><p>I don't know if its the difference between events that show you as busy or free, or if something else is the variable the determines what shows and what isn't. But it is definitely not working right now. I had to sync my Google calendar with with Windows Calendar for the time being. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",jh20001

When I select the email I want to print it picks up all the ""headers"" from the old emails in the trail and wants to print all these as well.  I have attached an example that only shows a small email, but I have some that have 15-20 emails in the trail. I know I can restrict how many pages to print but that seems like a cumbersome way to do it and still gives you ""some partial info"" from the other emails. I'm not sure what I'm missing and have been a long term Thunderbird user for many years. In the example attached, I only want to print the latest email at the top and not the following info that could in most cases be over about 7-8 pages. I hope my explanation is clear to you.  Can you help, please? Many thanks, David </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dph2107
