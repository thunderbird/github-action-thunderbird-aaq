My Thunderbird settings for notifications when new email arrives are: </p> <ul><li> to animate the dock icon when new mail arrives and to show the count of unread messages; </li><li> to play a sound. </li></ul> <p>My macOS notification settings for Thunderbird allow notifications and enable badges, sounds and banners (including on the lock screen). </p><p>Iâm very pleased with TB 115âwhich brought me back after ten years using another email client. I have one small issue which I suspect is more a request for an enhancement than it is a bug report. </p><p>I have four subfolders of my inbox to which specific emails are routed (by Thunderbird message filters) when downloaded by Thunderbird. When an email is routed by a TB filter to a subfolder I receive a visual macOS notification and hear the relevant sound. However, the app icon does <em>not</em> show a figure for the unread email. </p><p>I assume the app icon figure for unread emails applies only to emails in the inbox itself. If that is the case it would be a really nice enhancement for it also to cover unread items in subfolders of the inbox. On the other hand, of course, itâs also quite possible that Iâm doing something wrong! </p><p>Stephen </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",stffox

When I select the email I want to print it picks up all the ""headers"" from the old emails in the trail and wants to print all these as well.  I have attached an example that only shows a small email, but I have some that have 15-20 emails in the trail. I know I can restrict how many pages to print but that seems like a cumbersome way to do it and still gives you ""some partial info"" from the other emails. I'm not sure what I'm missing and have been a long term Thunderbird user for many years. In the example attached, I only want to print the latest email at the top and not the following info that could in most cases be over about 7-8 pages. I hope my explanation is clear to you.
