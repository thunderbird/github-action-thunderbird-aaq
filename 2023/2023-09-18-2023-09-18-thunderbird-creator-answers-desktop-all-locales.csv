When I select the email I want to print it picks up all the ""headers"" from the old emails in the trail and wants to print all these as well.  I have attached an example that only shows a small email, but I have some that have 15-20 emails in the trail. I know I can restrict how many pages to print but that seems like a cumbersome way to do it and still gives you ""some partial info"" from the other emails. I'm not sure what I'm missing and have been a long term Thunderbird user for many years. In the example attached, I only want to print the latest email at the top and not the following info that could in most cases be over about 7-8 pages. I hope my explanation is clear to you.  Can you help, please? Many thanks, David </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",dph2107
