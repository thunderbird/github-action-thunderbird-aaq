Avebo già l'account attivo e funzionanbte su Thunderbird ma da circa un mese fa se cercavo di visualizzare le email cliccando su ""messaggi in arrivo"" non accadeva più niente e vedevo solo il cursore rotante in attesa infinita di qualcosa. Ho quindi deciso di cancellare l'accounto e di riaggiungerlo, ma il risultato è stato quello che ho detto all'inizio. Spero che qualcuno sappia aiutarmi a risolvere. </p>",other;needsinfo;,thunderbird,other,it,1604522;,franco18

When I select the email I want to print it picks up all the ""headers"" from the old emails in the trail and wants to print all these as well.  I have attached an example that only shows a small email, but I have some that have 15-20 emails in the trail. I know I can restrict how many pages to print but that seems like a cumbersome way to do it and still gives you ""some partial info"" from the other emails. I'm not sure what I'm missing and have been a long term Thunderbird user for many years. In the example attached, I only want to print the latest email at the top and not the following info that could in most cases be over about 7-8 pages. I hope my explanation is clear to you.
