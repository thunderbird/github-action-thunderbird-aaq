However, under the Inbox, each email account is listed, with its messages inside, and Local Folders is listed. I don't want that. I just want to see the Inbox with its subfolders and nothing else. </p><p>I understand that this may be a feature of unified view. However, I have another machine with the same setup, that doesn't use Unified Inboxes, but all the mail still falls into the one inbox, and there are no individual inboxes under it. That's what I want. On that machine ""All Folders"" is checked and disabled. </p><p>So I don't know what I did on that machine to get all the mail in a single inbox without the individual inboxes under it, nor what caused the All Folders option to be disabled; but I'd like to replicate it on this other machine. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1574832;,Enargins

Unable to authenticate to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>. Please check the password and verify the 'Authentication method' in 'Account Settings | Outgoing server (SMTP)"" The authentication method is ""Normal password"" so I tried the password associated with this account (I have 4 email accounts) at GD, this did not work. Since OL is a Microsoft product, I also tried the password associated with my MS account, to no avail either. Finally, I get the TP message: ""Server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> has disconnected. The server may have have gone down or there may be a network problem."" </p><p>So I did the following: I called GoDaddy and after a lengthy discussion, was finally told that, because OL is working when I access it through GD and it is also working on my mobile devices, it had to be an issue between TB and OL and that I should contact MS and TB. </p><p>I then contacted MS support via chat (65 minutes total!) and was finally told that ""outlook has an issue now and it's a BUG"" and ""Just to inform, we are aware of this concern. Currently, there's number of customers who are affected of this issue. Our research engineers are currently working on this. Rest assured, we are doing our best to get everything up an running the soonest. "" and finally ""Are you contacting TB? I consulted our higher support for your concern and you also have to contact TB for this."" </p><p>I'm essentially at my wits' end.. I don't think that the problem is at GD because OL for which I have signed up works fine on all the devices. It's something between OL and TB and since OL does not seem to know if this sudden connection failure is an issue of the OL server I'm connected to, I hope that someone in the TB community knows what's going on. </p><p>Any advice is greatly appreciated, I have used TB for years and really like it and would hate to have to be relegated to using OL online &nbsp;:( </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1574865;1575430;1575741;,Aegeri1046
