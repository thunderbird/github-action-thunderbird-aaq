I use thunderbird with a 365 account to manage my mail. I set the option ""mail.server.default.check_all_folders_for_new"" to true to get all folders when I refresh the email. The problem is that at startup I get an error saying ""the current operation on [FOLDER] did not succeed the mail server for account [ACCOUNT] responded [FOLDER] doesn't exist"" (see screenshot). I got it for several folders. The problem is that these folders are all deleted or renamed folder that doesn't exist in 365 and if I go to account &gt; subscribe these folder doesn't exist. My guess is that internally thunderbird saved the old folder to be refreshed and never removed it. Is there a way to fix this problem?

If I understand correctly, when the last filter action is complete in a given filter, that filter will not execute any more in connection with the current piece of E-Mail being processed.  If instead, what was intended was that ""Stop Filter Execution"" will prevent that filter from being applied to any pieces of E-Mail to be processed within the current collection of E-Mail being retrieved, that would be nice to know. </p><p>I have a collection of filters, which if the filter's conditions are met, the filter will move the piece of E-Mail to a particular folder.
