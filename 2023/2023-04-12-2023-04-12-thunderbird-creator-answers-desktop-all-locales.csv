I can use email just fine on my iPad and I can log onto the servers individually using web-based email clients, so I know what the current passwords are, it's just that when I use those passwords in Thunderbird it doesn't work.  I bounced Windows and the router to no avail.

It worked fine - I've been using Thunderbird on my new Dell Windows 11 computer for a couple of weeks.  My Thunderbird is at 102.10.0.  I tried changing the Authentication Method from ""Normal Password"" to ""Encrypted"" for one of the email servers but I got a message from Thunderbird telling me that the site didn't support encryption and that I should change it back to ""Normal Password"", which I did. </p><p>The only thing I could imagine was that some recent Thunderbird maintenance introduced a problem so I hoped that I'd discover that the problem was fixed with new maintenance this morning.

The email is POP3 from att (actually snet). <strong>They require a different app password for each computer.</strong> I have the different app password. I want to use my Linux Mint laptop to access my email and  use a backup of the desktop's profile when the desktop is out of service.

It seems that these instructions are replacing  Laptop's hidden .thunderbird folder with desktop's  .thunderbird folder. This seems odd since Step3 of ""On your Destination Computer"", opens Thunderbird. Won't that create a .thunderbird folder with new installs.ini and profiles.ini files? They will be replaced in Step8. </p><p>I am concerned that Step3's newly created .ini files (which have a different hash that links them) will be lost in Step8 and there is some dependency on that hash value that is not clear. Is that hash sent to the email server so that they can identify the machine/app that is accessing their server? </p><p>Is there a more appropriate support page for what I need to do?
