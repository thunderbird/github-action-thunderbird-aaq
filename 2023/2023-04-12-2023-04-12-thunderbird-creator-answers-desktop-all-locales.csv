Suddenly last night I started getting messages that I needed to enter a PW to log onto my three email servers, but each attempt was met by another request to log onto the server.  I can use email just fine on my iPad and I can log onto the servers individually using web-based email clients, so I know what the current passwords are, it's just that when I use those passwords in Thunderbird it doesn't work.  I bounced Windows and the router to no avail. The only big recent event in Thunderbird was that I moved it from the C drive to the D drive (an external SSD) in preparation for moving to a new Dell computer. It worked fine - I've been using Thunderbird on my new Dell Windows 11 computer for a couple of weeks.  My Thunderbird is at 102.10.0.  I tried changing the Authentication Method from ""Normal Password"" to ""Encrypted"" for one of the email servers but I got a message from Thunderbird telling me that the site didn't support encryption and that I should change it back to ""Normal Password"", which I did. </p><p>The only thing I could imagine was that some recent Thunderbird maintenance introduced a problem so I hoped that I'd discover that the problem was fixed with new maintenance this morning.  Didn't happen.  I'm at a loss and it's really upsetting me.  Please help.  Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1575596;1577783;1581166;1581314;1581391;1581477;1581530;,tcluster

La cartella seguente C:\Users\wespy\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\txpij6cc.default-release\ImapMail occupa quasi 61 giga su disco.

The email is POP3 from att (actually snet). <strong>They require a different app password for each computer.</strong> I have the different app password. I want to use my Linux Mint laptop to access my email and  use a backup of the desktop's profile when the desktop is out of service.

It seems that these instructions are replacing  Laptop's hidden .thunderbird folder with desktop's  .thunderbird folder. This seems odd since Step3 of ""On your Destination Computer"", opens Thunderbird. Won't that create a .thunderbird folder with new installs.ini and profiles.ini files? They will be replaced in Step8. </p><p>I am concerned that Step3's newly created .ini files (which have a different hash that links them) will be lost in Step8 and there is some dependency on that hash value that is not clear. Is that hash sent to the email server so that they can identify the machine/app that is accessing their server? </p><p>Is there a more appropriate support page for what I need to do? I am not clear on the subsequent steps to launch TB on the laptop and change the password on the laptop.

I eventually just decided it's quicker/safer to copy the T'Bird portable folder over to an SSD, run T'Bird from that to do the update, then copy it back to the Sandisk Extreme Pro.  That seems really odd and if anyone knows what's up with that, I'd gladly like to know. </p><p>However now, the past update (I always update to latest version) and this update, something strange happens.  It states an update available, or i put it off and later click Help&gt;About Thunderbird to click the update button, and it downloads it, then I click ""Restart to update thunderbird"", and it closes, and a very brief updating window box is present (states Thunderbird is installing the update, or something to that effect, see attached screencap), with the update bar not moving at all, so within about a second, that update box closes and T'Bird starts, and has not updated, still on (as of right now), version 102.9.1.   </p><p>If I then repeat the above, clicking Help&gt;About Thunderbird, it again presents the button to click ""Restart to update Thunderbird"", so I click it, and same as above, keeps failing to update.  There is no error message.  I've repeated this process multiple times and it won't update to 102.10 that it had already downloaded. </p><p>I also tried toggling the setting ""Use a background service to install updates"", to turned on (was turned off by default?), but every time I restart T'Bird, it's off, uncheckmarked again.  Attached is that update box with the bar that never moves, just appears for a second then T'Bird is running without having updated. </p><p>The extreme slowness updating running T'Bird from the flash drive has been ongoing for a long time but this failing to update at all is something new for the last 2-3 versions at most (AFAICT). </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1575267;1575288;1575651;1575657;,habanero.dave
