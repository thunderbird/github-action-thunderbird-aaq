Never had this problem with TB. After years of happily using TB and loving its wonderful functions and features, this inability to send outgoing emails is a mystery. Tried just about everything, but can find no fix. Tried to find a Mozilla-authorized earlier version to replace the newest version but could not find one on a Mozilla-authorized site to download.  </p><p>Worked with 7 computer techs from the company from which I bought my new Win 11 computer this year--they couldn't find a fix. Worked with 5 techs from my Internet provider but not one of them could fix the outgoing email problem. Uninstalled, re-installed, repeated, checked all settings, stopped security software--nothing fixes the problem.  My Spectrum webmail still brings in my incoming and sends out my outgoing emails but TB does not send the outgoing. I can only conclude the problem is the newest version of TB. Am I right?  Is a fix on the way? </p><p>Who has run into this problem and how have you fixed it?  Already spent 2 1/2 days working on this and not even the ""computer experts"" have a clue. Any TB heroes out there who can come to the rescue? Or should I wait a few weeks until this glitch in the newest version is fixed?  Thanks in advance. I'm lost without my wonderful TB! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",marywithaquestion

I had saved the Profile so that saved email, addresses, etc were quickly reinstalled. One feature that I like was the display of the number of emails saved in each folder. That didn’t return.
