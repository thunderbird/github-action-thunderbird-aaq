La stampa di alcune mail (non tutte) che normalmente viene stampata su una pagina, in questa versione viene suddivisa cosi: La prima parte dove viene indicato il mittente viene stampato su una prima pagina, una parte del corpo della mail viene stampata su un'altra pagina e un'altra parte ancora del corpo della mail e la parte finale viene stampata  su un'altra pagina (sulla versione normale il tutto rimane su una pagina). Ho controllato tutti i valori in editor di configurazione e sono esattamente uguali a quelli della versione funzionante (102.14.0 (32 bit). Non riesco a trovare la causa di un comportamento diverso in fase di stampa (vale anche su stampa in PDF, etc). Grazie, saluti </p><p>P.S. Preciso che sono dovuto passare alla versione Beta perche in fase di Ricezione di alcune PEC inoltratemi, gli allegati non venivano allegati alla mail ricevuta. Nella versione Beta questo problema è stato risolto ma e' sorto il problema della stampa anomala di alcune mail su piu pagine mentre normalmente vengono stampate su una pagina.
