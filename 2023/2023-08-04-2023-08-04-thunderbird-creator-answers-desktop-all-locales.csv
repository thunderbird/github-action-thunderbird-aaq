However, I am finding more and more that emails go to the recipient's spam folder (or are rejected) because the domain of the SMTP server does not match that of the mail (on one of the two accounts). I don't want to keep changing the SMTP server depending on which mail account I send from.  </p><p>I don't want to use a different program per mail account, and I don't want to just use one account as I segregate between mails to people I know well and more general mail, also to keep spam in one account.  </p><p>Is there any way to solve this? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",Mark-E-H

La stampa di alcune mail (non tutte) che normalmente viene stampata su una pagina, in questa versione viene suddivisa cosi: La prima parte dove viene indicato il mittente viene stampato su una prima pagina, una parte del corpo della mail viene stampata su un'altra pagina e un'altra parte ancora del corpo della mail e la parte finale viene stampata  su un'altra pagina (sulla versione normale il tutto rimane su una pagina). Ho controllato tutti i valori in editor di configurazione e sono esattamente uguali a quelli della versione funzionante (102.14.0 (32 bit). Non riesco a trovare la causa di un comportamento diverso in fase di stampa (vale anche su stampa in PDF, etc). Grazie, saluti </p><p>P.S. Preciso che sono dovuto passare alla versione Beta perche in fase di Ricezione di alcune PEC inoltratemi, gli allegati non venivano allegati alla mail ricevuta. Nella versione Beta questo problema è stato risolto ma e' sorto il problema della stampa anomala di alcune mail su piu pagine mentre normalmente vengono stampate su una pagina.

But now i have set up my acconts and rearranged some buttons. Is there maybe a problem with Exchange synchronisation on startup?

Never had this problem with TB. After years of happily using TB and loving its wonderful functions and features, this inability to send outgoing emails is a mystery. Tried just about everything, but can find no fix. Tried to find a Mozilla-authorized earlier version to replace the newest version but could not find one on a Mozilla-authorized site to download.  </p><p>Worked with 7 computer techs from the company from which I bought my new Win 11 computer this year--they couldn't find a fix. Worked with 5 techs from my Internet provider but not one of them could fix the outgoing email problem. Uninstalled, re-installed, repeated, checked all settings, stopped security software--nothing fixes the problem.  My Spectrum webmail still brings in my incoming and sends out my outgoing emails but TB does not send the outgoing. I can only conclude the problem is the newest version of TB. Am I right?  Is a fix on the way? </p><p>Who has run into this problem and how have you fixed it?  Already spent 2 1/2 days working on this and not even the ""computer experts"" have a clue. Any TB heroes out there who can come to the rescue? Or should I wait a few weeks until this glitch in the newest version is fixed?  Thanks in advance. I'm lost without my wonderful TB! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1594966;,marywithaquestion
