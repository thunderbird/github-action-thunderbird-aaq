I had saved the Profile so that saved email, addresses, etc were quickly reinstalled. One feature that I like was the display of the number of emails saved in each folder. That didn’t return. The only number that appears is the number of unread emails in the Inbox.  </p><p>I found a user who had the same problem 3 years ago.

Any suggestion to cause the folder content numbers to appear following the names of the folders? Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",I_Rufus
