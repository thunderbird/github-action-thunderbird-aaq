I continue to struggle to understand the details of the link between 'Lightning' and 'Google Calendar'.  All my established calendars seem to have excellent two-way communication (e.g., changes in either calendar are reflected in the other), while the (internally generated) Birthday Calendar does not.  Puzzling.  I do note that Birthday Calendar displays perfectly within 'Lightning', but is 'tagged' with a 'locked' icon.  Attempts to remove the 'read only' status are unsuccessful.  Nevertheless, even as 'read only', it would seem that Google Calendar should be able to reach out and 'read' the file.
