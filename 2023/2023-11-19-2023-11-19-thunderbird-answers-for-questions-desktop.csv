Email in Thunderbird can be either text or HTML,  but that has been an option for the last 20 years.  Generally email is sent in HTML format and it is probably the most common format for email bodies now.

To me that means the subject contains the given string somewhere in its text but it's looking increasingly likely that TB treats 'contains' in a very limited way to actually mean 'this exact whole word is found, with a space either side'.
