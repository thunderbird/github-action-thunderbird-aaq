My email server provider says that they have had no recent reports of problems from any other user and they have checked that I have the correct smtp settings.

Olin vanhalle koneelle ladannut oikoluvun joka oli todella vajaa. Aluksi lähes jokaista sanaa sai tarkastella ja kun valimis lisäsin uuden sanan. Uudelle koneelle en netistä löytänyt suomenkielen sanastoa. Koska olin nähnyt ison vaivan päivittämällä oikolukua vuosia, niin minua tietysti otti pannuun. No, tein seuraavasti, poistin Thunderbird asennuksen uudelta koneelta. Avasin kansion %appdata% suorita ikkunan kautta (piilotettu kansio), kansiosta tuhosin Thunderbird kansion. Vanhalta koneelta vastaavasti %appdata% kopio Thunderbird kansiosta ja siirto uuden koneen Appdata kansioon. (on muuten melkoinen järkäle, koska pitää sisällään sähköpostia viime vuosi tuhannelta asti.) Tämän jälkeen asensin Thunderbirdin uudelleen. Mitään ongelmia ei ilmennyt. Asennuksen jälkeen kaikki sähköposti olevat uudella koneella joten kuten toimivan oikein kirjoituksen kanssa.  Kysymys kuuluu; missä tuo oikeinkirjoitus tiedosto sijaitsee? Saako sen talteen ja vieläpä auki jollain ohjelmalla? Sitä voitaisin ehkä laajentaa yhteisön avulla ja laittaa jakoon.

Till my other computer Quit (Month ago), Thunderbird had been working fine. Had been using 32 bit version, on 64 bit Windows 8.1 computer. Saved a copy of my Working Profile on external hard-drive. Got a New pc, Windows 11, also 64 bit. Downloaded Thunderbird. Got a 102.3 (?) 64bit version. Installed. Tried to put a Compuserve e-mail account in. Compuserve comes off <a href=""http://Aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Aol.com</a>. (<a href=""http://pop.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.aol.com</a>). I put my info in. An Aol window comes up with my address and a NEXT key in window. Thunderbird is ""Checking password"".  Checking password..... Checking Password.... I click on Next. Put in my Password..  Incorrect password. I quit out. Go to Compuserve Mail, thru Firefox. Log-in successful with Same password... Hmm.... 3rd part App Password create??? I go to Aol Security page... Put in Thunderbird (note there about previously created App pw). Create Another. Go back to Thunderbird.... Or TRY. ""Invalid or missing Profile"". Uninstalled/reinstalled Thunderbird. SAME problem. I went back, and downloaded the 32bit version of Thunderbird. SAME Problem. After looking at a couple of online Thunderbird site messages, I went to my .../appdata/roaming/thunderbird/profiles. I renamed the profile.default with profile.default_old. Renamed two .ini files to .old. Reinstalled 64bit version. Was able to Run Thunderbird again, but STILL wouldn't connect to Compuserve. WAS able to connect to Gmail account. Tried going into settings. Found SAVED PASSWORDS. Saw Full sign-in password was there. Changed it to the Aol App password. Same problem. Hmmmm... At some point, I was able to IMPORT from my Previous Profile (created with 32bit TB, on Win 8.1 64bit pc). SAME problem connecting to Compuserve email. Why did IMPORTING Change the Modified Date of the ORIGINAL Profile file??? I am also trying to change my Profile location, from an SSD to my Terabyte hd. Saw something about changing the Local File destination, in settings.. Did that. Thunderbird restarted. NO change, except that the ""Local Files"" listing, in the Folders listing, now had a LOCK on that Profile. I tried to change File Location for my Compuserve folder, but, was told it was In-Use by Local Files. There was Nothing in the Heading Folder for my Compuserve email folders to set them ALL to another Profile file. There was an Option in EACH (sub-folder) to set the Profile Folder Location. As I said, above, I have been using Thunderbird, for Years, and would hate to have to get to Another email program, and RE-folder all my mail together (sorted by user, org, service, etc). My E-mail service is Still ""up there"" with my mail.  Wonder if I could try to Repair my old drive, and grab program files from there. (Where is that Usb to Sata converter???) If I was able to get Thunderbird 32bit program files (with my Working settings), I could probably use them, as I had been. What would happen if I then installed the 64bit version, over that? Hopefully, I gave enough of an idea of what I tried. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1568334;,RandMF

I can get Gmail to turn it off permanently, but Thunderbird seems to stick it back in (perhaps as a default when it installs a new update -- the same way that Windows11 restores its default preferences when it does updates [g]).  I've also notice that when Tbird compacts folders, it occasionally deletes messages that were part of a thread.  In one case I was able to retrieve the body of the message from the Gmail source; in another case, the message was lost forever. </p><p>The way the user settings for Thunderbird's threading is designed is, for me anyway, VERY annoying.  It's a bloody pain in the neck when I have to go into every single folder and turn it off and it won't STAY turned off.  Life would be a lot easier if Preferences included a ""no-threading"" option that would override any individual folder choices.  </p><p>It's just an annoyance when threading organizes stuff in a way I don't like.  (The only threading I've ever really liked was that provided by the TapCis front-end for Compuserve in the 1980's and 1990's.)   But it becomes really significant when threaded messages can get deleted during compacting. </p><p>Thanks for any tips anyone can offer in dealing with this. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1568370;,MandyWh
