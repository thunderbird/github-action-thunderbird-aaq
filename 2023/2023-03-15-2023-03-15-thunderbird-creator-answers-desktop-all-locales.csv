When I try to install TB 102.8.0 or TB 102.9.0 all seems to install fine.  When I then go to use TB, I get an error ""Authentication failure while connecting to server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a>"". When I re-install TB 102.6.1, all works again. I'm 76 and this stuff seems to be going over my head.  Any ideas of what I need to do? BTW, my account for Gmail mail works fine but does not use any outlook settings </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",jbresn

Only unformatted text is adapted to the default font. </p><p>Meaning: pasting in an (e.g.) Calibri 12 from a Word doc might have the result of Calibri 20 in Thunderbird. Or Calibri 8. So size is not honoured. </p><p>So equally pasting in a <em>different </em> font, the size from the originating source can be radically different from the size that appears in Thunderbird. </p><p>Which brings up another issue.  If one tries to change the font size using the T⯅ and T⯆, results are rather unpredictable. This is particularly true for pasted text, trying to match it to the default text. There is no graduation. Ideally Thunderbird fonts should be as graduated and under control as a Word Processor fonts for control over appearance and reading effect. </p><p>Thanks for considering these thoughts! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1571051;,ssum
