Note that this is also the case if you right click the message a chose Delete - go to the Trash and you will see that the message is no longer in bold. This is obviously annoying in case of spam and outright dangerous if you got a suspected virus message. </p><p>Today I got the latter and after unsuccessful google search I found a <strong>safe workaround that deletes the message without opening it</strong>. </p><p>Here is my solution: </p> <hr> <p>Lets say, your message has ""Info"" as a subject and ""Home"" as a sender (as did mine, it also had an attachment). 1) You go to the dashboard of the affected account and chose ""Manage message filters"".  2) A small window opens, there you chose ""New"" to create a new filter. 3) In the filter creation window, try to make the conditions as specific as possible, so that they fit only the email(s) you want to get rid of. In my case, I chose ""if subject is Info"" AND (!!) ""if sender is Home"". AND means ""Match all of the following"". 4) In ""Perform these actions"" chose whatever you like. You may want the message to be outright deleted, moved to Trash or to Spam. I have chosen Mark as Spam, in the hope the Spam filter will learn (though I've never seen an evidence of that), and Move to Spam folder - since I wanted to be able to verify that the message is there still in bold. 5) You click OK and get returned to the previous window. 6) There, with the new filter highlighted, chose a folder you want to apply it to and click Run now. 7) Now go to the folder where the message was supposed to be moved and verified the results. In my case, I went to Spam and saw that the message was there, still unopened. 8) After that right click on the Spam or Trash folder where the message is and empty it. The message(s) should be gone forever. </p><p>I have no reasons to think that the message was opened at some point in the process (notably during emptying the Spam folder), so to my best knowledge this method is safe. If you have reasonable doubts, pls share them here. For the future users, with higher TB version, I would first advice to make a test with some ""innocent"" messages, esp. if you're trying to remove a virus message. </p><p>The best thing would of course be <strong>if the TB engineers fixed this obvious security issue</strong>. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",trescojones
