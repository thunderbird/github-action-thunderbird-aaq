I have used my phone many times to check my  mail but have never run into this before.  I do have a legacy email address, an <a href=""http://adelphia.net"" rel=""nofollow"">adelphia.net</a> address, that still works,  it was replaced by a <a href=""http://roadrunner.com"" rel=""nofollow"">roadrunner.com</a> address when Spectrum took over my cable.  Exactly what do I change in the settings to fix this?  My account name?...  I am sorry but I am old and this is difficult. </p>",garyshook,false,0,0
