If the mail-server (e.g., GMail) has a policy that any mail in Trash gets deleted after it has been there for 30+ days, Thunderbird cannot prevent the disappearance of old mail from your synchronized Thunderbird Trash folder. If the mail is gone from the GMail Trash folder, it's gone from the Thunderbird Trash folder. </p><p>However, Thunderbird has Local Folders, and your IMAP mail-server can't touch those. They are strictly local, on your computer. You can create local folders and you can store mail in local folders as you wish, and your mail-server will not manipulate the contents of those folders.  </p><p>If you have items in your IMAP account Trash folder that you do not want GMail (or your mail-server) to delete, select those items in the main Trash folder, right-click, and choose Move To, and follow the arrows until you get to the local folder where you wish to store those items permanently. Thunderbird will not delete any of those items, and your mail-server cannot access them. But if you have moved an item from the account Trash to a folder in your Local Folders, do not waste time looking for that item online in the Web interface for your mail-server. It won't be there. </p><p>Attached is my layout of folders. I use the Local folders for local storage, and I monitor those folders to make sure they don't grow too large. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

Highlighting messages in an old-account folder and dragging them to the desired folder in the new account does work, but it's a slow process if you try to move than a couple of dozen messages at once, so I've been doing this a bit at a time in idle moments over the last couple of months. However, this morning I thought I'd found a way of speeding this up: I went offline and then discovered that I could move several hundred messages at once. However, although the moved messages did initially appear in the new-account folder, after a little while they'd disappeared from both the new account and the old one. Any idea what's going on and if there's a way around it that preserves the speed of transfer? (Fortunately I have a copy of my profile in the old account from shortly before I switched account.) </p>",mail93,false,0,0

I've realized that this is achieved by opening the address book (in a tab), and then dragging the tab onto the desktop to make a new window (which also creates a 2nd tab with mailbox view, along with the dragged address book).  That feels a little hokey, and takes 2 steps for what might be a 1-step process.  But it does get the job done. I would still welcome a definitive answer that there isn't a smoother way to get a separate address book window. </p>",James6M,false,1,0

I can select individual names or contiguous names and get them into my To, CC, or BCC window just fine.  Where I have the problem is in selecting and keeping them selected so I only have to add them to my TO, CC, or BCC window ONCE.  Let's say I'm working with an address book of 500+ addresses; of those, I want to 150 to 250 for a given email.  Every time I sent an email of that quantity, the recipients are different, so I can't compile a new address book.  With the old Thunderbird, there were keys I could hold that would keep non-contiguous address selected until I added them to TO, CC, or BCC.  So I might choose from A to H, then I to M, then N to Z.  I can't figure out how to do this in the new Thunderbird in the latest MacOS.  Holdling the Cntl button doesn't do it, not does holding the space bar -- both suggestions found online. </p>",sbest64,false,0,0
