Select the messages in the folder (Ctrl+A to select all), then Ctrl+S to save them as eml files in an external File Explorer folder.  To import them to another PC that has TB, create a subfolder of Local Folders, then add the eml files to the subfolder by drag and drop from File Explorer. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
