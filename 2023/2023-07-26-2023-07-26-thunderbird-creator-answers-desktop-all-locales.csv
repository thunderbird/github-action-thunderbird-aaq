And it did make me wonder why. One screen shot shows the RSS feed index as displayed in the left pane of the application. Old Thunderbird showed the site icons, New does not. 115 on left, 102 on right. </p><p>Second was the display of the article content. The other screen-shot shows the content of the feed article. New Thunderbird does not show the page content only a like of text, where-as old Thunderbird showed the page within Thunderbird itself. 115 on left, 102 on right </p><p>Considering the behaviour of the same feed and article on two versions on the same day, I can only guess that the processing logic has changed. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",compass_drg
