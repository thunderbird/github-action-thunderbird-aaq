That should be copied to your Sent folder on the server, so that if you need to send it again to someone else, it will be easy. Then send the bulk mailing out to all of the other addresses. If the server won't make large-group copies of a single document in the Sent folder, your initial copy is good, and provides a record of the mailing transaction. If that doesn't work for you, I think you'll have to check with your email handler online, to see what's going on with bulk mailings not being copied to Sent. It might be important to set your Sent Mail instruction with the Other option, and use the drop-arrow to see the choices. Choose the server's Sent folder, not the local IMAP one. I get better results from that method. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

As far as Pocomail, I've seen some propriety conversion tools. However - and this is a long shot - I think Eudora uses MBX format. if true, you could export to MBX, install Eudora 8 (a precursor of a eudora/thunderbird marriage) and that would create TB-compatible messages (which I have confirmed by converting a Eudora account to TB0, and then importing that to thunderbird.
