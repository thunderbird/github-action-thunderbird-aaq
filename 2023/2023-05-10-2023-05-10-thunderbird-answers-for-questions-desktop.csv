Is there a way to fix this? </p><p><br> If you are copying emails back emails onto the org gmail mail account then there are limits which gmail impose. So if you have a lot of emails you are trying to upload then yes, it is going to take a while. You can only upload a certain amount each day. You can persist with this and it will work, but it will take time.

It contains tons of information the recipient does not need and then they would have to work out where the emails are stored and may still need to convert them. </p><p>Thunderbird stores emails in mbox text files. It is possible to export in various formats. Regarding the person who wants the emails returned to the organisation - do they use Thunderbird&nbsp;? If no, what email client are they using or do they use webmail only&nbsp;? But to be honest, if you supply the files containing emails then you have done your duty. It would be their problem on how they put the emails back on the server. But it would be helpful to provide them in a format which is preferable.  </p><p>If you want to send all emails in a .eml format. Do the following to get a folder containing a load of individual emails in .eml format. </p><p>If you have all the emails in a Thunderbird folder - lets call it 'OldMail' folder because I have no idea where you have put them. </p><p>Create a new folder on your desktop called 'OrgEmails' </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Select the 'OldMail' folder (whatever folder has the organisation emails) </li><li> Click on first email in the Message List to get focus on list </li><li> Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press 'A' key - This highlights all the emails in the folder.  </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails and select 'Save as' </li><li> Window opens asking where to save - locate Desktop and select the 'OrgEmails' folder in list </li><li> click on 'Select Folder' button </li></ul> <p><br> All the emails you highlighted will now get copied as individual emails with .eml extension into the folder on the desktop called 'OrgEmails'.  Allow a little time for this process to complete if you have a lot of emails in that selected folder. </p><p>Now convert to a zip folder: </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'OrgEmails' folder and select 'Send to' and choose compressed zip option. </li><li> You should have a 'OrgEmail.zip' folder containing all emails and it's probably half the size of the original 'OrgEmails' folder. </li></ul> <p><br> <strong>Alternative option</strong> - access file that contains all the emails and create a copy.

Ultimately, it is how the server has been configured that determines what happens. In other words, if the server is configured to NOT keep messages, then it will delete them when downloaded even if the ""leave messages on the server"" option is enabled in Thunderbird. Some email providers, such as Gmail, have a setting that let's you choose how the server handles such messages. Check with your email provider if such an option exists. I have seen threads about the ""leave messages on the server"" option seemingly not working for Gmail accounts (nothing so far on Bigpond), and the solution to them is to of course change that setting in Gmail. </p><p>If you were to add your account as an IMAP account in Thunderbird, Thunderbird will show you exactly what is on the server.
