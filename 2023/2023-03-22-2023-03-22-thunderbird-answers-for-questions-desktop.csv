Second, there is a neat little freeware snapshot utility at this url:  bluefive dot pair dot com. Name is snapshot. It's free, small, and easy to create screenshots.  Third, a single Thunderbird profile stores all accounts that are visible. Thunderbird just needs one profile, although it is not uncommon to find unused, irrelevant, old profiles also stored, and some people like to have several profiles stored, possibly for different users who share same PC. But that info is just for your awareness. For a full, easy to restore backup, copy c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird  folder. That includes everything for a rebuild. For a rebuild, install Thunderbird FIRST, then exit, then copy the backup, overwriting any dummy entry that the installation created. Done.  Fourth, I am a simple user for Firefox.
