Solo nel cestino si vede uno dei due indirizzi scomparsi. Aggiungo che, se provo a scrivere un nuovo messaggio, ho la possibilità di usare tutti gli indirizzi. Qualcuno mi può cortesemente aiutare per fare in modo che tutto si veda in modo corretto? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,it,"",francesco19

The task is to modify those two accounts so that Thunderbird profile sees them as a local folder not a standard 'live' mailbox (where it constantly attempts to connect to server and won't allow access to the emails held offline). </p><p>The folders are there on my hard drive, but something needs to be done to the profile to recognise them as local folders rather than live accounts. i.e. working like a PST file in Outlook. </p><p>Happy to pay consultancy if this needs bespoke coding. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",charles119
