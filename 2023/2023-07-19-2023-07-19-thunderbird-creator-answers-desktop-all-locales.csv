I need to create permanent accessible offline archives of these emails. </p><p>Thunderbird cannot archive emails when the server connection is lost. I've tried a plugin export addin, doesn't work. The emails are there on my computer. But I can't access them through my normal profile. </p><p>Looking for someone who knows and can modify the basic behaviour of Thunderbird. The task is to modify those two accounts so that Thunderbird profile sees them as a local folder not a standard 'live' mailbox (where it constantly attempts to connect to server and won't allow access to the emails held offline). </p><p>The folders are there on my hard drive, but something needs to be done to the profile to recognise them as local folders rather than live accounts. i.e. working like a PST file in Outlook. </p><p>Happy to pay consultancy if this needs bespoke coding. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",charles119
