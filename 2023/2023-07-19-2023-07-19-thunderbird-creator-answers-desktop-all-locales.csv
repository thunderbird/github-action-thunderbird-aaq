On one (running Win10) Supernova downloaded automatically, odd as I thought you had to opt in to get it. (The other running Win11 is still on v102). No problem as it looks good. (I'll make any suggestions separately.) But I'm concerned about migration as I have a lot of messages, both archived and in live folders. Judging by some forum responses version 102 should still be lurking in the background. Is that right? And if so what's the migration plan once Supernova is out of beta? And as I was about to move storage location from C: to D: for space issues, is it best to hold off until Supernova is fully live? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1591612;,steve.w.dodd

I've read the junk mail controls. I have tried various methods of deleting Junk. All the ways I can think of. But some of those junk emails just keep coming back day after day. I thought I read somewhere that it takes 1,000 tries before TB finally deletes them before the inbox. I have the Junk Settings on all accounts to send all junk mail to the junk file on Local Folders, before the inbox. But that only works on some. How can I get a message that is in the inbox - to mark it junk and get TB to recognize it every time after? It seems to me that I click it junk and that message still comes into the inbox day after day. And day after day, I click it as junk. But it still comes back. I have to manually move it to the Local Folders Junk. And again, even though I have it targeted to delete after one day.
