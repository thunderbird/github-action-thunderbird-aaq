El problema mayor es con la <em>bandeja de entrad</em>a, me aparece vacía y sin la posibilidad de desplegarla para ver las bandejas de entradas de todas las cuentas de manera independiente. Lo mismo me pasa con la de <em>correo no deseado</em> y <em>papelera</em>. Y en una de las cuentas, la carpeta Archives tampoco aparece en las unificadas sino que aparece como una carpeta normal dentro de la cuenta. Este problema, al menos en mi caso, hace inútil la vista de carpetas unificadas. He probado a arrancar en modo seguro por si algún complemento anterior pudiera estar influyendo, peor el comportamiento ha seguido siendo el mismo. Si alguien tiene alguna idea de que puede pasar, se agradecería la ayuda. Saludos. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,es,"",Hector.D.Rguez
