One with Google and the other with Talk Talk. I have recently purchased a new PC and have downloaded Thunderbirds onto it. I have had no problems in sync the email account with Google. In seeking to synch the account with my Talk Talk email, I get the following message- ""Incoming Folder Already exists"" I have deleted the old Thunderbirds from my old PC I have deleted Thunderbirds on the new PC. Shut it down and then downloaded it once more Again, the Google sync was easy and successful in seconds The synch to my Talk Talk email account brings up the message ""Incoming Folder Already exists"".

A few weeks ago, our email service went out and when it came back on, the POP3/SMTP server links weren't working.  Found some guidance online that IMAP works better with ATT, so we deleted the account and created a new account with IMAP.  Legacy folders and emails wouldn't show up.  Found that TB had a new folder listed under IMAP, so migrated all my old folders into that new IMAP folder, but no matter what I do, they are not recognized, and Inbox will only load about 3 weeks of emails.  Anyone know what the deal here is, or how I get TB to recognize my legacy folders? </p><p>The funny thing is, when I move them over and then restart, for an instant, they all show up, then a few seconds later, they disappear.  This tells me that TB sees them in the folder, but then must overwrite them.  Not sure how to stop that from happening?  Do I need to actively create new folders on my list with the same name or something? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1577951;1578018;,harrington_1995
