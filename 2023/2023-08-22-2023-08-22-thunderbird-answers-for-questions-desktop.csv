'<em>Q: </em>When was the last time you actually opened to read any of those pre 2012 emails&nbsp;? </p><p>If you can see headers but no contents then it means there is some data in the index file, but it cannot locate the email in the mbox file that stores the emails. </p><p>Possible reasons for problem: <strong>1.</strong> If you originally moved emails from an imap account into Local Folders then you would have needed to ensure you had downloaded full copies before the move, otherwise you have only copied headers. Hence why I asked when you last accessed and read those old pre 2012 emails. Maybe they have not ever been accessed. Maybe they were never properly copied over to Local Folders. </p><p><strong>2. </strong>You allow an Anti-Virus to scan your profile folders and it did not like the mbox file - maybe it found one email it did not like and decided to kill the whole file. That would mean the index file is still intact but cannot point to emails that do not exist. Strongly suggest you do not allow scanning of profile folders because AV's cause havoc. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> Emails do exist, but the index file has become out of synch. This is an easy fix. Right click on folder and select 'Properties', click on 'Repair Folder' and click on 'OK' </p><p><br> <strong>Q: </strong>Do you have those emails in mbox files in the profile or not? '<em>Q: </em>Do you have a backup of the Thunderbird profile folder? </p><p><strong>How to check what is in 'Local Folders' foldre in profile:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; More TRoubleshooting Information </li><li> Under 'Application Basics' - half way - Profile folders - click on 'Open Folder' </li></ul> <p>A new window opens showing the contents of your profile name folder. </p> <ul><li> Click on 'Mail' folder to see contents </li><li> Click on 'Local Folders' folder to see contents. </li></ul> <p>I do  not know the exact method of storage you have used. Here's an example If you have the pre 2012 emails in 'Archives' &gt; '2011' folder. Click on 'Archives.sbd' folder to see contents Does the mbox file called '2011' (no extension) have a reasonable size? Does the 2011  mbox file exist&nbsp;?  Do you only see an index file eg: 2011.msf? If you see mbox file called '2011' (no extension) - Open mbox file called 2011 using Notepad (if size is less than 500MB) to see if it has emails. OR use Notepad++ if size is less than 2GB. If you only see '2011.msf' index file then you only have the index file and no emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

And yes, Paul, this is a duplicate because I wasn't sure if the one I sent to the Firefox community also went to Thunderbird community; obviously it does. Maybe my need has to do with the perhaps unusual way I use T'Bird. I get about 80 emails each day. Two or three times a day, using my browser, I always first check the Inbox on the server where my emails arrive (Earthlink in my case, although I also use gmail and some others). There I scan them all, and then read and delete many, having no further use for those partiicular ones. If time permits, I also look at what my filter on the server has put in Suspect Email, as there's just about always something of interest there. My server holds a limit of 100 MB (Inbox plus Suspect), and that limit is reached in a couple of days if I let it go. Then I leave the browser, fire up TB application on my computer, and download into my TB Inbox what I allowed to remain on my server's Inbox (not Suspect Emails; those will be deleted automatically in due course), deleting them from the server Inbox in the process. The wonderful TB filter sorts all incoming emails into a broad and deep set of folders that are my permanent store. This is where I keep media-emails for later reading, and most importantly where I go over the emails I need t spend more time with and reply to. Yes, these are stored (by TB) on my computer, just like the data files of any other application. But I have a Dropbox account and my other applications, such as WORD store copies of everything on Dropbox. That way, if I'm away from my main computer, I can still look at and work on those files.  But I can't do that with Thunderbird. OR CAN I? THAT'S MY QUESTION!' I have two laptops, one of which is the ""main computer"" where I use TB and keep my TB Inbox. That  computer has to go in for repair, which could take several days.  So, I'm needing to use TB on a different computer during that time, and I don't want the server Inbox to fill up.  Just looking at emails on the Server is not good enough.  I can even reply to emails there, but those replies will not be associated correctly with the threads when eventually downloaded in TB on my main computer. I hope this gives a clear picture of my problem.  I can take it up with Dropbox, but I thought I'd ask TB folks first. </p><pre>   Thanks for any further suggestions. </pre> <p>==John </p><p>(Edited to remove paragraph spaces to make question readable.) </p>",jlburch,false,0,0

Remember TB is only a email down-loader reader the actual email resides on the Online Email server until expires or user deletes the email. Thunderbird is not a cloud but local running software that connect to the Online email server. So not sure why you want to save to cloud when the Online email server saves it to cloud already. </p>,Dropa,true,0,1
