And yes, Paul, this is a duplicate because I wasn't sure if the one I sent to the Firefox community also went to Thunderbird community; obviously it does. Maybe my need has to do with the perhaps unusual way I use T'Bird. I get about 80 emails each day. Two or three times a day, using my browser, I always first check the Inbox on the server where my emails arrive (Earthlink in my case, although I also use gmail and some others). There I scan them all, and then read and delete many, having no further use for those partiicular ones. If time permits, I also look at what my filter on the server has put in Suspect Email, as there's just about always something of interest there. My server holds a limit of 100 MB (Inbox plus Suspect), and that limit is reached in a couple of days if I let it go. Then I leave the browser, fire up TB application on my computer, and download into my TB Inbox what I allowed to remain on my server's Inbox (not Suspect Emails; those will be deleted automatically in due course), deleting them from the server Inbox in the process. The wonderful TB filter sorts all incoming emails into a broad and deep set of folders that are my permanent store. This is where I keep media-emails for later reading, and most importantly where I go over the emails I need t spend more time with and reply to. Yes, these are stored (by TB) on my computer, just like the data files of any other application. But I have a Dropbox account and my other applications, such as WORD store copies of everything on Dropbox. That way, if I'm away from my main computer, I can still look at and work on those files.  But I can't do that with Thunderbird. OR CAN I? THAT'S MY QUESTION!' I have two laptops, one of which is the ""main computer"" where I use TB and keep my TB Inbox. That  computer has to go in for repair, which could take several days.  So, I'm needing to use TB on a different computer during that time, and I don't want the server Inbox to fill up.  Just looking at emails on the Server is not good enough.  I can even reply to emails there, but those replies will not be associated correctly with the threads when eventually downloaded in TB on my main computer. I hope this gives a clear picture of my problem.  I can take it up with Dropbox, but I thought I'd ask TB folks first. </p><pre>   Thanks for any further suggestions. </pre> <p>==John </p><p>(Edited to remove paragraph spaces to make question readable.) </p>",jlburch,false,0,0

IMAP accounts are usually offered a lot more space quota, but in your case IMAP may not necessarilly be a solution. </p><p>Thunderbird works best when you use the default location for storing emails. </p><p>Try: Create a folder in Dropbox called 'TBIRD' <strong>copy</strong> the profile name folder and put it in 'TBIRD'. so you have something like this. C:\Users\NAME\Dropbox\TBIRD\xxxxxxxx.default </p><p>where xxxxxxxx.default is the copied profile folder name. Remember you have to Exit Thunderbird first before you copy the profile  name folder. </p><p>Then you need to set up a new profile which points to the new dropbox location. In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; TRoubleshooting Information </li><li> Under 'Application Basics'  near bottom - Profiles - click on 'about:profiles' </li></ul> <p>It opens in a new window </p> <ul><li> click on 'Create a new profile' </li><li> click on 'Next' </li><li> Give it a suitable name like 'DBOX profile' </li><li> click on 'Choose folder' </li><li> browse to where you have copied the profile </li></ul> <p>eg: C:\Users\NAME\Dropbox\TBIRD\<strong>xxxxxxxx.default</strong> </p> <ul><li> select profile name folder and click on 'Select folder' </li><li> Click on 'Finish' </li></ul> <p>This updates the 'profile.ini' file, so that a new profile location is added to list of profiles. So Thunderbird knows a profile exists in a different location - dropbox. </p><p>then you can choose which one you want to use as default. Maybe you keep using the original because it still exists in old location - remember I did say 'copy' profile name folder. Then you can perform a copy of profile and simply overwrite/update the one in dropbox. I suppose doing it that way means you effectively have two copies which may be useful. Or you can set the DBOX profile as default. Then other computer can access dropbox - create a new profile and point it to profile on dropbox. </p><p>A completely different approach is to keep a copy of the profile on a USB drive and just take it with you.  Update profile on other laptop/computer and then use it. Perform backup to USB when finished and then update when you return. If you have a lot of emails this may not be so easy, but you could use an external hardrive. </p><p>OR use a USB/external hardrive with profile and use a portable version of Thunderbird - sorry do not know a lot about portableapps but this is a link to website: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable</a> </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

'<em>Q: </em>When was the last time you actually opened to read any of those pre 2012 emails&nbsp;? </p><p>If you can see headers but no contents then it means there is some data in the index file, but it cannot locate the email in the mbox file that stores the emails. </p><p>Possible reasons for problem: <strong>1.</strong> If you originally moved emails from an imap account into Local Folders then you would have needed to ensure you had downloaded full copies before the move, otherwise you have only copied headers. Hence why I asked when you last accessed and read those old pre 2012 emails. Maybe they have not ever been accessed. Maybe they were never properly copied over to Local Folders. </p><p><strong>2. </strong>You allow an Anti-Virus to scan your profile folders and it did not like the mbox file - maybe it found one email it did not like and decided to kill the whole file. That would mean the index file is still intact but cannot point to emails that do not exist. Strongly suggest you do not allow scanning of profile folders because AV's cause havoc. </p><p><strong>3.</strong> Emails do exist, but the index file has become out of synch. This is an easy fix. Right click on folder and select 'Properties', click on 'Repair Folder' and click on 'OK' </p><p><br> <strong>Q: </strong>Do you have those emails in mbox files in the profile or not?

Here's an example If you have the pre 2012 emails in 'Archives' &gt; '2011' folder. Click on 'Archives.sbd' folder to see contents Does the mbox file called '2011' (no extension) have a reasonable size? Does the 2011  mbox file exist&nbsp;?  Do you only see an index file eg: 2011.msf? If you see mbox file called '2011' (no extension) - Open mbox file called 2011 using Notepad (if size is less than 500MB) to see if it has emails. OR use Notepad++ if size is less than 2GB. If you only see '2011.msf' index file then you only have the index file and no emails. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0

If you have thousands of messages, don't copy all of them at once. There is a general consensus to not select more than 2000 messages for copying at a time, to prevent Thunderbird from freezing/hanging when trying to process too many messages. I don't know if this is still a problem with the latest release v115 because I haven't had to do this in a long while. Copy them in smaller batches until all messages have been copied over and none is left in the original location.  </p><p><strong>Option 2: Use a Global Inbox</strong> Thunderbird offers the option to configure POP accounts to deliver messages into one Inbox folder.

Since you're using IMAP, the Trash folder in TB should contain the 111,000 messages that the Gmail Trash folder contains. Your action of trashing them in Gmail is mirrored in TB as well, because IMAP facilitates two-way sync between the server and TB. Also, Gmail's All Mail folder contains all your messages. That's the one true folder that exists in Gmail, and as the name suggests, it contains ALL your messages. The other ""folders"" are just labels that get assigned to messages, e.g Trash. No, if you empty Gmail's Trash, you will not gain back storage space on your Mac. In fact, you don't even have to empty the trash to regain disk space. You just need to change synchronization settings in TB from the default ones. By default, TB will download ALL messages in ALL folders IN FULL and store them on your Mac's storage to facilitate offline access. That doesn't have to be the case. You can choose specific folders that TB will download messages from in full, and also which messages should be downloaded by age. For example, you can configure TB to only download messages from Inbox and Sent, that are no more than a week old.
