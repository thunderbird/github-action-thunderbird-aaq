Remember TB is only a email down-loader reader the actual email resides on the Online Email server until expires or user deletes the email. Thunderbird is not a cloud but local running software that connect to the Online email server. So not sure why you want to save to cloud when the Online email server saves it to cloud already. </p>,Dropa,false,0,0
