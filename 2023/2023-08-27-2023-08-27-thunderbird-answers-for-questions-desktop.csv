Gmail negli ultimi tempi sta diventano molto più rigida nel rigettare i messaggi dai server che non supportano correttamente DMARC, creando molti problemi ai piccoli fornitori di caselle email. </p><p>Per il resto non posso aiutarti più di tanto. Thunderbird è solo un client e non può modificare le impostazioni del tuo server. Quel livello di accesso è nella disponibilità solo del tuo fornitore o eventualmente tua se il tuo tipo di contratto lo prevede. Il fatto che tramite webmail l'invio funzioni, purtroppo non è molto significativo. La webmail opera su protocolli diversi dal server SMTP e con un diverso livello di accesso alla rete per cui le due cose non sono direttamente confrontabili. </p>",@next,false,0,0

Please note bugzilla is not a chat forum, so comments need to be factual eg: exact step by step on how to reproduce a problem, image of problem, data shown in the error console, etc.  Bugs have to be reproduceable in order to sort out what is going wrong.  Bugs also get prioritised, so most important tend to get done first and in some cases bugs are getting fixed by volunteers, so you have to cut them some slack, they may choose bugs based on their field of expertise or time available. </p><p>You tend to discover more iritating bugs when a major new design is developed and the supernova 115 has seen a massive rewrite of code. It is inevitable there will be gremlins in the early stages and as more parts of the design get rewritten. However, that's why anyone using 102* is not being auto updated at this point in time. Although anyone can choose to download and install 115*, but I would advise creating a backup of profile first just in case of problems or prefer to go back to 102*. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

But it is not quite that simple apparently. </p><p>Outlook is essentially a corporate mail client designed from the ground up to function as a client for the Microsoft Exchange corporate mail server.  In recent years Microsoft has shoe horned their exchange product into the cloud and are offing it as a part of the office365 package,  unfortunately is is not designed in many way to be compliant with the internet mail standards. <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9051/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9051/</a> </p><p>I have not used outlook for more than a decade, so I made a trip to Google and it looks to me like this Outlook ""flag"" flags a message to be followed up, adds the message to the ToDo list etc.  But I do not see any clear indications from Microsoft that it has any meaning outside outlook. </p><p>I think this 2022 article answers your question <a href=""https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/outlook-categories-flags-and-imap-accounts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/outlook-categories-flags-and-imap-accounts/</a>  In as much as outlook saves none of the information back to the IMAP server,  so Thunderbird will not be able to see it. </p><p>This person which appears to have some real world experience suggests that there are problems with exchange server and setting flags in outlook.  Essentially the same issue as mentioned above,  but with more detail of what actually happens.  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/exchangeserver/comments/n4l42t/imap_and_exchange_flagging_only_works_one/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/exchangeserver/comments/n4l42t/imap_and_exchange_flagging_only_works_one/</a> </p><p>It sounds to me like outlook has an issue that is not being addressed by Microsoft. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
