Also, everything I see about Owl or ExQuilla is dated 2022 or earlier. Is Owl or ExQuilla still the only solution to be able to send email?

I truly hate the Outlook interface and the way it handles the names, I haven’t found any equivalent to “Display Name” in Thunderbird and I cannot live in a first name only world when looking at a list of email. </p><p>Another question: Is there anyway to make an IMAP account work like a POP account? I prefer to leave nothing on the email server. I like retrieving the email when I want to check it, vs having it pushed to me. I also like deleting it from the server after I have retrieved it and just keeping the email in my email client. I have lots and lots of folders and filters for both my incoming and sent email and I do NOT want to try recreating it for Outlook.  </p><p>I hope someone has experience with this Godaddy/Exchange/Office365/M365/Outlook problem and how it works with Thunderbird 102.11.2. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1583571;1585399;,at1357

Recentemente ao ser admitido num setor da prefeitura, percebi que utilizavam um servidor de e-mail compatível com o Thunderbird (Locaweb), e resolvi testa-lo em meu computador, no intuito de caso gostassem, inserissem o uso do software em todo o setor, devido sua praticidade e funcionalidade, porém, nas últimas semanas, percebemos que na conta de e-mail do setor, sumiram da pasta caixa de entrada alguns e-mails essenciais. Imediatamente suspendi o uso do Thunderbird, fiz a remoção da conta, e voltei a usar no navegador, porém, são mensagens antigas essenciais ao setor, que precisamos recuperar, e acessando as pastas internas, verifiquei haver ali alguns arquivos  de extensão msf, (inbox, trash) que possivelmente, pela data de criação e tamanho, possam conter as mensagens desaparecidas, preciso resolver isso amanhã, ou pode me custar o emprego, pois os e-mails que sumiram, fazem parte dos processos do setor, é necessário que eles retornem ao servidor do Locaweb para aparecer em sua caixa de entrada, poderiam me orientar quanto a esse processo de importação? Se é possível qual o procedimento, isso realmente está me preocupando, meu intuito era apenas ajudar, mas virou um transtorno. Ajudem-me por favor. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,pt-BR,"",eliasferreiracontact
