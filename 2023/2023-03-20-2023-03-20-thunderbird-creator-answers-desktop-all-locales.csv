I have read a ton of articles and none seemed offer a solution (or least not a solution that worked or I could understand).  It appears these missing folders are in the following folder: (C) &gt; Users &gt; AppData &gt; Roaming &gt; Thunderbird &gt; Profiles &gt; 3lqu3vu8.default &gt; Mail &gt; <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> &gt; Sent.sbd &gt; Storage Folders.sbd &gt; Inbox Storage.sbd  The names and size of the subfolders seem to be a perfect match for what is missing.  How can get this folders (or the information in these folders) back into the Inbox?  Any help will be greatly appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1571595;1571612;1572597;1572635;,mncandleman

If I change the layout to Vertical View, there are no headers on the message list.  The headers are there in both the Classic and Wide views.  Also, when the headers do appear, I am unable to drag a column header to a new position.  Is this s defect or something on my end. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1571581;,RamonaSteve

Parts of toolbars are missing or are totally relocated. Functions are not working properly; e.g, I can't filter by field, and when I try to type in the filter field, the letters are not coming out correctly as I type them in. I can use tags, although the ""tag"" function is not properly located, but when I select a tag, the tag the color I assigned to it doesn't show when I go back to the inbox. I am using Windows 11 Home Version, which I updated right before the Thunderbird update; everything else is fine. Is there a way I can get back to the old version, and if so, will I have to wipe everything out and start over? The last time I did this there were numerous problems and I had to pay my computer guy close to $1000.00 to fix them; even then, some problems remained. Thank you! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1571591;,caroGlou9815
