At the time, many of my email accounts were storing the mail on that disk.  I've copied all the files off to a working disk and dumped the old disk.  I changed Thunderbird to point to the new location.  Now, all of the accounts are working again, except one (using POP).  Thunderbird simply won't check email on that account, and the last email shown is 4 days ago.  When I click Get Messages and select the account, nothing seems to happen.  Nothing shows up in the Activity Manager.  The account is definitely working on the server-side, as I can view it in K-9 on my phone, and another account on the same POP server is working fine in Thunderbird.  Outgoing email on the account sends fine. </p><p>I've tried various suggestions, including wiping my password database (Thunderbird did not prompt me for that account) but nothing seems to make a difference.  I wonder if it's to do with the Inbox (which is a hefty 7GB mbox file).  I tried Repair Folder on the Inbox but it did not make a difference; Thunderbird still won't check the email.  I did briefly try renaming the Inbox file to Old-Inbox but Thunderbird still wouldn't check the email.  I want to make sure I retain all my old emails (they are all showing, so it doesn't look like the file got corrupted).  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to get the email working again without losing all the mailboxes? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1585948;1585950;1585951;1585953;,neil__b

Recently, I somehow fat-fingered something I was typing and all of my inbox folders disappeared, including 3 accounts and a number of subjects within the accounts.  Now, when I get messages, the bar at the bottom says I have received a new one from one of my two accounts, but nothing shows up, so I can't read anything.  It's probably a one-keystroke command, but I don't know how to correct it, and in the meantime Thunderbird is unusable. </p><p>How can I correct this?

Mac Mail has a ""smart"" folder called Today which captures only email received current day.  Is there any way to do that using a saved search on Thunderbird?  I tried using Date Is ""today,"" but, perhaps not surprisingly, that returned no results, whereas if I input the today's actual mm/dd/yyyy I get a result.  But of course that does me no good since I'd need to edit the search properties daily to put in a new today.  Is there a syntax for ""today and only today"" that would work, or is this not possible?

Yesterday I downloaded the software and successfully added 2 email accounts.  They are infrequently used accounts so I can afford to experiment before adding my primary email account. </p><p>My primary email account is web-based Outlook.  I'm bumping up against the maximum storage before needing to purchase more storage or deleting emails.  If possible, I want to copy entire folders from the primary account to local folders on my PC using TB.  I thought that process would be called archiving but am now thinking it's called exporting.  To be sure I don't lose anything, I absolutely want to leave the original folders/emails in my Outlook account until I've copied them to local folders and verified everything came through.  Once I'm sure the emails are safely in a local folder, I'll delete most of them from the Outlook server. </p><p>From my very, very short experience with TB, it looks like ""archiving"" means moving (not copying) items from one folder to another but the folder receiving the items still resides in TB, not on my PC.  Is this correct or am I mistaken?  I also think that ""exporting"" means moving (not copying) items from one folder to another folder that may, or may not, be a local folder on my PC.  I think the choice of folder and location is mine during the export process.  Is this correct? And is it correct that the items are permanently removed from their original folder during exporting?  If so, this export process would NOT be what I want because the items would have been removed from the Outlook server before I could verify a good transfer. </p><p>While playing around with one of the email accounts I successfully moved to TB, I selected a group of 10 emails in a particular folder, right-clicked on the group, and selected ""Copy to ..."" where I selected a new local folder.  This successfully placed copies of the 10 emails in the local folder while leaving the originals in the folder on TB.  I suppose I could use this process to place the emails from my primary account into local folders but it would be time-consuming (unless I could ""select all"" for a given folder and copy a very large number of emails at one time).   </p><p>I'd very much like to know if my understanding of archive, export and copy are correct and, if so, which I should use to get my emails into local folders.

Using an office computer requires those contacts to be accurate on both systems and updated in the back ground.  Use of Google to do this is out of the question due to the lack of Groups or it's called Label. An organizational field like Doctors or Customer service.  I notice some these fields on my phone contact are nonexistent on Thunderbird contacts.  Why?  I thought it was converted to VCard format with contains many more fields. Editing a Contact only shows a minimal number of fields compared to VCard. CardDAV just looks confusing and I can't tell what is what, and causes duplicates. So why is there no merge without duplicates if the same Name field is already on file.  I've tried to use tools like BirdieSync, but it just duplicates every dam contact causing a mess.  This is really a problem because computers are here to make life better not add more work. So, before I get rid of TB just what is down the road for this problem?  My phone Contact software should have a APP that connects to my PC and copies new contacts or updates contacts to the Thunderbird contacts and visa versa. If they are both using VCard what's the problem? PC to Phone and phone to PC, without Google or Microsoft data theft of my contacts. Any Ideas? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1586149;,bmazak
