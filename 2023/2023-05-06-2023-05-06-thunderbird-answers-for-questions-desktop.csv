Each email address has been set up as a mail account in Thunderbird. You appear to have three mail accounts. If you looked in 'Account Settings' you would see those accounts listed.

As the Unified folder has been expanded, it means it will also show you the individual account Inboxes as well. If you do not want to see them then click on the icon on the left of Unified Inbox and it hides them. </p> <blockquote>  I used to get all emails in one folder.  Is there any way to set it back to that? </blockquote> <p><br> There is nothing wrong with the image you posted. You do have all your incoming mail displaying in one Unified Inbox.
