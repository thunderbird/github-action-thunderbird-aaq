Recreating a fresh profile is a long process to get all your accounts setup, plus whatever local folders you have. I'll answer your last question: backing up. Assuming your profile is in default location and that you use windows, I suggest first exiting Thunderbird (VERY important) and then copying c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird to a USB stick  or other folder. That ensures nothing will be lost if you have to later copy it back. On your next-to-last question, Yes, Thunderbird can keep prior profiles available. If you create a new profile, you can switch by help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles.'   </p><p>I also suggest you post more specifics on your problem, as someone here may have a suggested solution.

Normally, the profile is in the users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird\profiles folder, but that's not the one you said you used. Also, Thunderbird does not automatically recognize the right profile, but looks at the profiles.ini file to tell it which to open. If it is a new install, it creates an empty profile, which is probably what you see. I suggest you exit TB and use windows file explorer to browse the profiles and determine the one that has most recently been used, as that is probably your preferred profile. My thought then would be to copy that profile into the thunderbird\profiles folder, start TB, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles', click 'about:profiles' and then select that profile from the list. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I had to right click and add the TAGS as one of the columns in the inbox. then just like sorting by date, subject, I can sort by tags and I now see the untagged but I still haven't figured out how to get them to group under one header and collapse or expand by tagged group.  Now that I have a tagged column in the inbox, which I never needed to have before, TAGs is not greyed out.  I don't like a lot of columns in my email so I didn't think to look there at first. Date, subject, who from, is all I want.  I also HATE threads and no matter how many times I kill it, it comes back to life. I sometimes wish software would STOP TRYING to be smarter than me.  I KNOW what I want and if TB think its so smart and I turn off threads all the time then learn to keep it off and stop trying to help me be more productive doing it TB's way cause you're actually slowing me down.  There's definitely things to get dialed in with this release that are going to take adjustments - for my schedule I don't the time to figure it out - now I know how my clients feel when we release a new software version, but at least I provide a video of the new upgrades and how to use them. </p>",mariah2,false,0,0
