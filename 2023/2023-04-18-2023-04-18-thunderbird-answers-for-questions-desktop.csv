But please understand it's difficult to hear you because of the continuing growth of our user base. People like Thunderbird and a fair number donate regularly. Could it be better? Definitely. Have you seen the article produced by the developers on the need to rewrite old code and streamline Thunderbird? It is an encouraging and forward-thinking document that parallels some of what you write about, but with no indication of a removal of features. If you haven't seen it, the article as at  <a href=""https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/</a>  Speaking just for myself, I acknowledge there are faster, smaller, email clients: a favorite is Becky! -- simple, small, does email and nothing else; and there is Sylpheed, a real speed machine; and Clawsmail is similar and supports HTML, also fast and small. But what they have in common is they each serve only a small niche of users.  </p><p>I should add that this forum is administered by volunteers, people who have no voice in the code or its design, but who volunteer their time here to help other users. The comments in this post are just mine. I do not speak for the Thunderbird users, who each speak for themselves. If you want a discussion in-depth, you might want to consider posting your concerns at bugzilla dot mozilla dot org, or at connect dot mozilla dot org. Thanks for sharing your views. We agree on one thing at least: Thunderbird needs to get better and it's already on the way. The beta is a good sign of that. </p>",davidsk,false,0,1

Firefox is Bloatware, yet it launches and competes 4 times faster than Thunderbird. That speaks for itself. </p><p>The reason there are so many competitors to Thunderbird also speaks for itself, a LOT of people don't like the Bloatware of Thunderturd.
