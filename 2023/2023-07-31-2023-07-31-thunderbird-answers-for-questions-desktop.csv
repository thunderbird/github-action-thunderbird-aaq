To resolve this, let's try a couple of steps. Firstly, please make sure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed, as updates often include bug fixes. Secondly, let's clear the event and re-create it, ensuring you add your colleagues only once this time. After creating the event, double-check the recipients before sending the invitation. If the issue persists, you might want to consider removing and re-adding your email account to Thunderbird. This can sometimes refresh settings and help resolve unexpected behavior.

Starting Thunderbird minimized with a Flatpak command is a bit tricky, but there's a workaround you can try. Unfortunately, there isn't a direct flag for this in the command.

No worries, we're here to help! When Thunderbird stalls during installation, it might be due to various reasons, such as conflicting software or corrupted files.

As for the calendars, the installation process usually doesn't automatically import them.

If that doesn't work, see if you can export calendars from Outlook in ics format, and import those to TB.  If not, export to csv.  For contacts, export to csv, but before importing to TB, it's often advisable to edit the csv in a spreadsheet to make the structure more closely resemble the TB format (which can be seen by exporting a test address book from TB to csv).

It sounds like you're facing an issue with the recent Thunderbird update that deleted some folders and data within them. I get how frustrating that can be. To restore Thunderbird to its previous state, you can try a couple of things. First, you might want to check your Thunderbird profile folder for any backup copies of your data. If you have backups, you can replace the affected folders with those backups. Alternatively, if you use an email provider that supports IMAP, your emails might still be on the server. You can try re-syncing Thunderbird with the server to retrieve your missing emails. If those options don't work, you might need to manually re-import your emails if you have local backups.

To do this, you can actually set up Thunderbird to use Firefox as your default browser. First, make sure Firefox is your default browser in your operating system's settings. Then, in Thunderbird, go to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Options"" &gt; ""Attachments"" &gt; ""Outgoing."" Look for the option that says ""Use Firefox"" (or your default browser) to open links. Once you've set that up, when you click on links in emails, they should open in Firefox's private browsing mode. This way, you can enjoy safe and private browsing for charity donation sites like the Humane Society. </p>",suram080,false,0,2

It's definitely not fun when things change unexpectedly. To get all your folders and subfolders to have the same columns in version 115, you can try this: Go to ""View"" in the menu bar, then ""Columns,"" and select the columns you want. After that, right-click on a folder and choose ""Apply columns to"" &gt; ""All Folders."" This should hopefully make all your folders and subfolders match up with the same columns. I get it, change can be tough, but hopefully, this helps you get your setup back on track!

No worries, we've got your back! It's possible that there might be a hiccup in the saved password for that account. Let's try this: head over to your Thunderbird's options/preferences, find the Security section, and click on ""Saved Passwords."" Look for the entry related to the problematic account and remove it. Then, restart Thunderbird, and when it prompts you for the password again, enter it and check the box to save it. Hopefully, this should stop those pesky repeated password prompts. Give it a go, and if you run into any bumps along the way, just holler for more assistance. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

Let's try a few things to sort this out. First, make sure you're entering your email and password correctly, as sometimes typos happen. If that's all good, you might want to reset your password just in case. Go to the Thunderbird password reset page and follow the steps there. If you're still having trouble, it's a good idea to clear your browser cache and cookies. Sometimes these can cause login issues. Give these steps a shot and let me know how it goes!

To fix this, you can start by checking if there's any filter applied that might be hiding your emails. Sometimes, accidentally applying filters can cause emails not to show up. Also, try restarting Thunderbird or even your computer – sometimes a simple refresh can do wonders. If that doesn't work, you might want to check your account settings to make sure everything is properly configured.
