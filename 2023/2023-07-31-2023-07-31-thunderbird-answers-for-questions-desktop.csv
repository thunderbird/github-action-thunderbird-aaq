Hence the refusal. </blockquote> <p>Hi.   Thanks for your reply, but I do not understand this comment.  My C: drive has been the destination for my mail for decades.  I've never lost any mail data from it.  In fact, as the drive with automated scheduled backups, it is my most protected drive.   </p><p>Are you saying Thunderbird does not now allow any location on C: to be the Local Folders storage? </p><p>That's contrary to what I've been doing for years.   Has something changed? </p> <em><p>Matt <a href=""#answer-1593977"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote> The path in and of itself requires the user to have administrator privileges to access it.   </blockquote> <p>""C:\Thunderbird""  is not an OS-managed directory.  Why would admin privs be required to access it?   (And I do have admin privs anyway ...) </p><p>And as I wrote, the Appdata/Roaming area, supposedly the correct area, has the same problem! </p><p>Thus, I am still mystified ... </p>",steve.johns,false,0,0
