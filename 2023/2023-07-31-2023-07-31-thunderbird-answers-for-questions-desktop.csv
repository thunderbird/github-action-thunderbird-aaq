I've never lost any mail data from it.  In fact, as the drive with automated scheduled backups, it is my most protected drive.   </p><p>Are you saying Thunderbird does not now allow any location on C: to be the Local Folders storage? </p><p>That's contrary to what I've been doing for years.

Why would admin privs be required to access it?
