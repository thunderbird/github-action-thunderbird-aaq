The behavior you've described might be a bug, and it's good that you've tested it against different calendars. To potentially fix this, you can try updating Thunderbird to the latest version, as software updates often include bug fixes. If the issue persists, you might want to consider reporting it to Thunderbird's official bug tracker or support forum, where the Thunderbird community and developers can assist you further. </p>",suram080,false,0,0

Let's try a few things to sort this out. First, make sure you're entering your email and password correctly, as sometimes typos happen. If that's all good, you might want to reset your password just in case. Go to the Thunderbird password reset page and follow the steps there. If you're still having trouble, it's a good idea to clear your browser cache and cookies. Sometimes these can cause login issues. Give these steps a shot and let me know how it goes!

Then, restart Thunderbird, and when it prompts you for the password again, enter it and check the box to save it. Hopefully, this should stop those pesky repeated password prompts.

Create a new filter and choose the conditions you want (like ""Subject contains"" or ""Sender is""). Then, in the actions section, choose ""Reply with"" and select the message you've prepared.

It sounds like you're facing an issue with the recent Thunderbird update that deleted some folders and data within them. I get how frustrating that can be. To restore Thunderbird to its previous state, you can try a couple of things. First, you might want to check your Thunderbird profile folder for any backup copies of your data. If you have backups, you can replace the affected folders with those backups. Alternatively, if you use an email provider that supports IMAP, your emails might still be on the server. You can try re-syncing Thunderbird with the server to retrieve your missing emails. If those options don't work, you might need to manually re-import your emails if you have local backups.
