Google require oauth2.0 authentication and that should have been corrected last year when you had issues.  But Google wrote to me this week telling me I must use two factor authentication.  I am not sure how I am going to dump that requirement.  I just might have to move to another mail provider like GMX. </p><p>Have you tried to log into your gmail account using a browser recently?

As a freelance journalist, my handle is “eeyore944.” My personal account handle is “eeyorehome9.” Both are @gmail.com. </p><p>Eeyore944 appears to be working in part; as of last weekend, that account had received 101 emails since 6:00 a.m., Dec. 12, which is a normal incoming volume, but I can’t send out with Thunderbird from that account. </p><p>Eeyorehome9 is not so clear or simple. The flow of messages addressed to that account since 12:52 a.m., Dec. 12, has been badly disrupted. On Dec. 15, I received seven emails there, but with that exception, eeyorehome9 has received between one and three each day since Dec. 12. Incoming daily volume for that account normally is in the dozens. </p><p>When I try to send from eeyorehome9, either in reply or with an original message, the client responds with messages like these:  Sending of the message failed. Unable to authenticate to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.googlemail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.googlemail.com</a>.

Within a day or two, Gmail corrected that, so I am able to communicate via original Gmail, but not using Thunderbird. </p><p>As for Thunderbird's credentials, my password is created by and saved in 1Password, which I have used since 2019, and my TB password has remained unchanged since many years before then. </p><p>Like you, I am reluctant to use two-factor authentication. But I haven't been told I require it. </p><p>Would it be possible to overcome this problem by reinstalling Thunderbird over the existing app?

I'm certainly willing to try your proposed solution, but first I need to clarify: Are you saying I may need to abandon Thunderbird to solve this problem? Or is gmail the problem, and I can solve it by using another email? Are my options really so limited? Has Mozilla rolled over and accepted Google's fiat without protest? That doesn't sound like the Mozilla I have trusted for years and made contributions to. Please, help me understand. I see the wisdom of two-factor authentication, and I can see how a requirement to adopt it for my login to Thunderbird or any other client would make a serious difference in my ability to use it. I have seen some discussion of passkeys replacing passwords. Would they provide security equivalent to two-factor auth? If so, could I bypass gmail? </p>",Mysterfied,false,0,0

Initially my husband couldn't get mail on his PC but I could see his on my PC and it worked fine for a couple of days.  But then as a test I closed my Thunderbird on my PC and restarted.

But more importantly many mail scanning antivirus product use self signed certificated to hack your mail to scan it and this can cause failures as well as Thunderbird simply does not recognize the certificates.  Due to some bugs,  not all certificate errors bubble all the way to the top and an alert message.

You are now inside the profile. Rename logins.json, key4.db, and cert9.db, and then restart thunderbird. (I always suggest rename instead of delete for safety. Thunderbird will recreate the renamed files.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It seems the issue is that the dialog box asking for the password never opens so I can enter the password.  Any other thoughts? </p>",mark_gory,false,0,0
