Google require oauth2.0 authentication and that should have been corrected last year when you had issues.  But Google wrote to me this week telling me I must use two factor authentication.  I am not sure how I am going to dump that requirement.  I just might have to move to another mail provider like GMX. </p><p>Have you tried to log into your gmail account using a browser recently?
