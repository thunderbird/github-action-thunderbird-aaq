Google require oauth2.0 authentication and that should have been corrected last year when you had issues.  But Google wrote to me this week telling me I must use two factor authentication.  I am not sure how I am going to dump that requirement.  I just might have to move to another mail provider like GMX. </p><p>Have you tried to log into your gmail account using a browser recently?

This box no longer comes up when I start up Thunderbird or when I try to send a message. Initially my husband couldn't get mail on his PC but I could see his on my PC and it worked fine for a couple of days.  But then as a test I closed my Thunderbird on my PC and restarted.  My mail works just fine as I have my password saved but now his doesn't download on my PC either. </p><p>I tried to force it by telling it to download new mail but nothing at all happens - no error message - just no response at all. If I try to send a message (which also needs a password) it sits there for ages then I get the error message that it timed out - see below. </p><p>We have 2 accounts with different email addresses but on the same Thunderbird ""account"" - one has the password saved and the mail just loads and I can send messages as always on that one. </p><p>I have gone into Password Manager and looked at every part of settings etc but can't see any option for saving a password other than through the dialog box - which no longer comes up. </p><p>So - I'm sure my the problem would be solved if I could just either get the password box back or find some way to add a couple of passwords to password manager.  </p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide. </p>",mary.therese,false,0,0

I am unsure if that is the real problem, since the implication is that Thunderbird already has them. Anyway, these steps may help: - settings&gt;privacy&amp;security - click saved passwords and then show passwords.  - highlight the four rows for the two accounts (one incoming and one outgoing for each)  - click delete  That should remove the passwords.  Exit and restart Thunderbird and you should see request for password.  </p><p>If you get new error messages, post that for feedback prior to next steps. The following would be my next suggestion.  </p><p>If that does not work, click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to profile folder, click open folder, and then exit thunderbird. You are now inside the profile. Rename logins.json, key4.db, and cert9.db, and then restart thunderbird. (I always suggest rename instead of delete for safety. Thunderbird will recreate the renamed files.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Well worth the read <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird</a>   </p><p>Here is my own documentation on threading, duplicating the above, but it may help: You need to highlight each folder and click View&gt;sort by&gt;unthreaded. If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps. The video was  created with table view for the message list pane.  </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.
