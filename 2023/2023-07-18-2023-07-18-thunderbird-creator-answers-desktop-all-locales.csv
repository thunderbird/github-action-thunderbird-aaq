I have at work the Thunderbird eMail that goes through a different server. I followed the directions and copied the ""Moving Thunderbird Data to a New Computer"" to a flash drive.   I used that and have all the files that were on it, now on my at home computer. It appears that everything is good up to that point. I even get the window that shows that Thunderbird recognized my other server's setup, however when I choose ""OK"" it gives me an error message that it is already on the server. I can see the Thunderbird email system on my home computer. But I can't get it to show any of the emails that I know are there from my work computer and I can't get it to download. I'm not sure if I have been clear enough, but I hope either someone can help me with what I have provided--or provide me with directions on how to do the install--EASY directions--because I'm unable to follow what I have found so far. And a reminder--I do still have all the files that I copied to the flash drive--so I could start all over again, and it would not be a problem.

I had them set to share an inbox, by having both accounts, plus the Local account, point to the same Local Directory on the Server Settings Page.  </p><p>Until recently both of these accounts, while having distinct email addresses and distinct outbound mail servers, shared a single incoming mail server. I had it configured on both. </p><p>Normally I have focus set to the Local Inbox. I could use the global Get Messages button and it would fetch my mail.  </p><p>Recently I reconfigured the mail servers. So now each account has its own incoming and outgoing servers. </p><p>Now, when I use the Get Messages button it only downloads from the first account. To explicitly download from the second account I must use the Get Messages popup on that account. Not ideal!

But since I typically have the Local account active it must then just use the first non-local account. I want it to do them all. </p><p>I was looking for a solution. a discussion: ""Unify your POP email accounts with a global inbox"".  I also find in Server Settings/Advanced: ""When downloading from this account's server, use the following folder to store new messages / Inbox for different account"".  </p><p>These both seem to accomplish the same thing I'm currently doing differently.

I allowed Norton Software Updater to run the TB 115 as an upgrade, rather than download and install  115 as a new install. It seems to be working fine and I like it but I am concerned that I may get future problems. I don't particularly want to save the profiles and re-install if it is unnecessary. Can you please give me your recommendations? Thanks P.S. I have a small number of errors and warnings in the Error Console, mostly from start-up but they mean nothing to me and there are no obvious issues. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1591285;,bhuddart01
