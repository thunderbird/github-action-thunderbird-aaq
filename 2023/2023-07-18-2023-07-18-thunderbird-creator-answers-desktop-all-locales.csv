I do have backup and have the whole Thunderbird\Profiles folder.  I watched the YT video, but I don't get it.  It should just be easy to point the whole folder to it.  All my stuff on C is fine, so it does come up with the email accts and the address book.  I did try to do an Import, but got errors.  Please Help!  I am an OLD IT guy, so I am not stupid.  It should be easier than this!  I will attach 2 pics.  Maybe someone will take pity on me...LOL.   </p><p>FYI, I use an Over 10 year old W7Prof Installation, migrated thru about 3 pc's, on an i-5 (yes, I am lazy And Love W7) and my 1TB hard drive is over 12 years old (yes, I know...don't ask), And It DIED.  So you can imagine what I been going thru since last Sat!!!  WHAT A MESS AND BRAIN STRAIN!  </p><p>Also, I HATE Gmail Web Mail!!!  </p><p>Oh, and I have donated before.  I had Windows Live Mail forever, but when Googley put the OAUTH PW mod in, I had to switch.  I do like T-Bird.  Sorry to write so much...Thanks again... </p><p>THANKS, Sam in FL </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",smsterling99

(A pop-up window may appear for a few seconds, then it closes, with no new messages downloaded and no errors shown) I'm using the POP setting. Tried to recreate the account as IMAP - it just shows ""checking password"", would not proceed any further. (No error message, no timeouts. I tried to enter incorrect password on purpose - still no error message, apparently they don't even connect.) Disabling firewall doesn't help.  EVERYTHING WORKED FINE BEFORE THE UPGRADE! PLEASE BRING BACK THE WAY IT WAS!!! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1591227;1591230;1591231;,arcadiev
