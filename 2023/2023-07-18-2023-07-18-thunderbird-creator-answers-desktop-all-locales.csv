I'm frankly not sure which ones use the going-away account, and which don't; I was counting on Tbird to show me which was which... but it doesn't.

I had them set to share an inbox, by having both accounts, plus the Local account, point to the same Local Directory on the Server Settings Page.  </p><p>Until recently both of these accounts, while having distinct email addresses and distinct outbound mail servers, shared a single incoming mail server. I had it configured on both. </p><p>Normally I have focus set to the Local Inbox. I could use the global Get Messages button and it would fetch my mail.  </p><p>Recently I reconfigured the mail servers. So now each account has its own incoming and outgoing servers. </p><p>Now, when I use the Get Messages button it only downloads from the first account. To explicitly download from the second account I must use the Get Messages popup on that account. Not ideal!

But since I typically have the Local account active it must then just use the first non-local account. I want it to do them all. </p><p>I was looking for a solution. a discussion: ""Unify your POP email accounts with a global inbox"".  I also find in Server Settings/Advanced: ""When downloading from this account's server, use the following folder to store new messages / Inbox for different account"".  </p><p>These both seem to accomplish the same thing I'm currently doing differently.

I can see the Thunderbird email system on my home computer. But I can't get it to show any of the emails that I know are there from my work computer and I can't get it to download. I'm not sure if I have been clear enough, but I hope either someone can help me with what I have provided--or provide me with directions on how to do the install--EASY directions--because I'm unable to follow what I have found so far.
