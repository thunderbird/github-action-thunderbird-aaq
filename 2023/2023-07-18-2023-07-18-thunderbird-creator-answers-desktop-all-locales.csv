I allowed Norton Software Updater to run the TB 115 as an upgrade, rather than download and install  115 as a new install. It seems to be working fine and I like it but I am concerned that I may get future problems. I don't particularly want to save the profiles and re-install if it is unnecessary. Can you please give me your recommendations? Thanks P.S. I have a small number of errors and warnings in the Error Console, mostly from start-up but they mean nothing to me and there are no obvious issues. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1591285;,bhuddart01
