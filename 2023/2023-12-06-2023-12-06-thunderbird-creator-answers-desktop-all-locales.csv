When I now start Moxilla I get the message ""The message cannot be moved or copied to folder 'Trash on..."" when it gets to one of the message filters.  It downloads all the POP messages, good and filtered. If I leave Moxilla OPEN and new filtered message come in later on that day, Moxilla handles all new messages correctly. The local ""Trash"" folder is somehow locked but unlocked later in the day.

Every time it does, I spend days-to-weeks trying to recover a working edition of Tbird.  Why can't you build updates that don't lock a customer out of his/her own emails. </p><p>I don't know how or when, exactly, it happened.  I use Win11pro which is up to date.  I have one Tbird install on dropbox so I can access all my emails from any of four different machines.   It worked yesterday (on two machines at any rate, I didn't use the others).  Today, no matter which machine I log into, I get an message stating that I ' <em>you have launched an older version of Thunderbird.   A newer version of Thunderbird may have made changes to  your profile which are no longer compatible with this older version.

Why can't you make changes that don't destroy a person's account(s), profiles or data?

When I say regularly I mean almost one time or more per 8 hours work day.  I tried to identify a pattern, an action, a keyboard combination, anything really but I can't seem to find it. Today I literally just stepped away from my screen, came back 20 minutes later and found my folder in threaded view. It is driving me crazy.  </p><p>How can I stop Thunderbird from forcing me to use this threaded view I do not want? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",inscriptionsrejan
