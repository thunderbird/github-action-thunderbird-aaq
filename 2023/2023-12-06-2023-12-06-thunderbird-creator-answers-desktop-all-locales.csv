When I now start Moxilla I get the message ""The message cannot be moved or copied to folder 'Trash on..."" when it gets to one of the message filters.  It downloads all the POP messages, good and filtered. If I leave Moxilla OPEN and new filtered message come in later on that day, Moxilla handles all new messages correctly. The local ""Trash"" folder is somehow locked but unlocked later in the day.

I tried some of your solutions like removing the saved password for the account. But it never starts to check the account so it never comes to the point where it asks for the password. I also checked the email provider and I could login into webmail and see all mails. Furthermore I tried to send email from that account and it worked fine.  </p><p>There are only 2 accounts, one is gmail the other is an ""email only account from <a href=""http://one.com"" rel=""nofollow"">one.com</a>"". </p><p>I have ofcourse looked into status from <a href=""http://one.com"" rel=""nofollow"">one.com</a> and there has been no problems. I used to use POP and have even tried IMAP for that account. But no matter what its not checking or even trying to connect to that account. It never shows in the bottom left corner that its checking that account only the gmail account.  </p><p>I have used Thunderbird for many years and I really like the product. I hope someone has a way to troubleshoot this as I would like to continue to use Thunderbird.  </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",thakangbaby

Using the help topic 'Ignoring Threads' didn't help, as when I clicked on the View menu I only have submenus - Toolbars/Layout/Folders - no Threads menu.  If I right click on any of the messages, clicking on either Ignore Thread or Ignore Subthread, makes no difference. I have done an Alt Print Screen, but can't save that as a .jpeg in order to attach it - is there some other way I can send a copy? Thanks in advance for your help!
