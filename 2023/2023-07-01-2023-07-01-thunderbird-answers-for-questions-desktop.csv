That will remove password from the account. When you next attempt to retrieve mail, Google should prompt you for your gmail account and password and should then show a screen to allow the account to work.

However, despite configuring the SMTP settings as provided above, I am facing difficulties with both connection timeouts and failures when attempting to send emails. I am using VPN.</em> </p><p>Thunderbird is a third party email client and alot of servers do not like people trying to connect to their servers via a third party app using a VPN because the server believes it could be someone trying to hide their IP address and that means the person trying to access the account may be a hacker.  Basically server is not playing ball in order to preserve your privacy. </p><p>However, some people may be using a VPN but by using static IP get a better result.   Others who want to use a VPN may have needed to set up a tunnel for Thunderbird to use. Generally the advise is do not use the VPN unless you are using a static IP. So, try to set up a static IP to use over VPN and see if it improves the situation. </p><p>The SMTP settings you posted are correct.  It sounds like every so often you might get a connection and it works ok but it fails frequently. This implies server settings in Thunderbird are not the problem, otherwise you would have never got a connection to gmail via oauth. </p><p>To test they work correctly suggest you restart computer in  'safe node with networking' and do not use VPN. You will also need an ethernet cable to connect computer to router. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It's great that you're using Thunderbird as your email client, but sometimes VPN connections can cause issues with server connections. If you're using a VPN, try setting up a static IP to improve the situation. Also, ensure that your SMTP settings are correct, as you've mentioned. Gmail might have some compatibility issues with Thunderbird, but the webmail interface isn't as user-friendly. As for the forum login issue, it might be a technical glitch that could be looked into by the technical team.

Quello che non capisco però, è come mai Google mi rompe di nuovo le scatole, quando l'autenticazione a due fattori l'ho già dovuta applicare un anno fa, con Incredimail. Stando a questo l'autenticazione dovrebbe essere già valida anche per gli altri programmi di posta, in questo caso Thunderbird, infatti la finestra che si apre è collegata a Thunderbird; anche se adesso continua ad aprirsi ogni dieci minuti circa, qualunque cosa io faccia. Ad ogni modo ho controllato e tutti i miei account di Google (quattro), avevano l'autenticazione a due fattori attiva, perciò non capisco la richiesta di Google...che devo fare secondo te? Grazie! </p>",estcheema,false,0,0

Non so cosa sia Oauth, ma se ti riferisci all'autenticazione a due fattori, ieri l'ho disattivata e la posta arriva lo stesso, almeno su Thunderbird e sul sito di Gmail. Però ho dovuto chiudere Thunderbird, perché continuava ad apparire la finestra di Google. Chiuso Thunderbird, la finestra fastidiosa non appare più e ho ripreso ad usare Incredimail che a me piace molto perché è molto semplice, anche se ormai l'hanno tolto dal web. Il fatto è che Thunderbird mi sta creando problemi anche con Incredimail, che è il mio client di posta predefinito. Evidentemente va in conflitto e mi blocca la ricezione di posta, quindi non so più cosa fare perché mi sembra che anche Thunderbird non sia poi così facile da usare, oltretutto l'interfaccia non è semplicissima e ha un sacco di funzioni che trovo abbastanza complicate e inutili. Però ha il pregio di mostrare tutte le email di qualunque account, sulla stessa finestra e questo è quello che mi interessa principalmente in un programma di posta... </p>",estcheema,false,0,0
