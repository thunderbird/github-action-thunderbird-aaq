One of the gmails has a folder ""All Mail"" which seems redundant &amp; which I'd like to remove. None of the other accounts has this. It's like having 2 ""inboxes"", have to mark BOTH ""Read"" to get new messages, well, marked as READ. Again, no other account has this, and I've been using TBird for decades, never saw this before. How do I get rid of this folder? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Dan </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1599544;,astral4910
