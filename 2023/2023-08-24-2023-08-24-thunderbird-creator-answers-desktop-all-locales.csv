So unfortunately my laptop died and I have been trying for hours unsuccessfully to transfer my old TB data to a new laptop.

I manually put in <a href=""http://pop.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.aol.com</a> and <a href=""http://smtp.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.aol.com</a> and not the Verizon settings recommended by TB which I had also tried.  I believe I have the correct user name and password but can I check it to see if thats the problem? I am running Windows 11 on my new computer. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
