As you see I sort by date. The newest mail is on the bottom and the oldest is on top. I expect Thunderbird to jump to the latest message (bottom) on startup but it keeps starting at the top so I have to scroll down to see the newest messages.  </p><p>Maybe anyone of you have any idea how to fix/change this behaviour? </p><p>EDIT: I could sort by date descending instead of ascending and have the newest message on top but I prefer it to have it at the bottom.  </p><p><br> Thanks Multi </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",multimill
