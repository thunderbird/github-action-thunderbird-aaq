Unfortunately if the folder is nested deeper than that, The higher level folders do not show the new email indicator so you don't know where the email is and have to go to View --&gt; Folders -&gt; Unread folders to find the new emails.  </p><p>Is there a setting I need to change to resolve this? </p><p>Thanks in advance, Dave </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",david.parker1

One of the gmails has a folder ""All Mail"" which seems redundant &amp; which I'd like to remove. None of the other accounts has this. It's like having 2 ""inboxes"", have to mark BOTH ""Read"" to get new messages, well, marked as READ. Again, no other account has this, and I've been using TBird for decades, never saw this before. How do I get rid of this folder? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Dan </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1599544;,astral4910

I had no problems until ver. 115 was installed. Now I get The authentication required message. I'm using Comcast as my provider. I have looked at this problem in earlier versions, but following the suggestions hasn't helped. I've checked that all the email addresses are correct. I have 3 Comcast email addresses I use and I have set the Outgoing Server to match each email address. I have also gone to Comcast and checked the box allowing 3rd party email apps. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,thunderbird,emails-thunderbird,en-US,"",jds1239
