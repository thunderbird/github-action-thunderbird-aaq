I have noticed that when editing a draft, it does not get overwritten, but it saves a new one.  I don't like this because it causes unnecessary clutter in my drafts folder that I have to manually clean out at the end of the week. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",gsrgtrdg4565653

On the other installation, there's no icon, and the display name and the sender's address are on one line above the subject. I have no idea why the first PC has this two-line-plus-icon layout for the senders of messages. I can't find any settings that will get rid of the icon and the two-line display. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",danawilson001
