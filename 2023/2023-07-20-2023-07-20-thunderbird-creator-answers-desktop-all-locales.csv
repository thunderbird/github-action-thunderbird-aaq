They are both sub-folders of my Drafts folders. I am almost certain that the second one is a leftover from my deleted IMAP account. I have found some discussions and “solutions” of this issue online but none of them seem to fit my situation, and the instructions in them do not reflect what happens on my screen.

I have no idea why the first PC has this two-line-plus-icon layout for the senders of messages. I can't find any settings that will get rid of the icon and the two-line display. </p>",customize;tb115;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",danawilson001
