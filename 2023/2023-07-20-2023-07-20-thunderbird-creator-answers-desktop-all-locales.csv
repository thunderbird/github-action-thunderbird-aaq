I  only know if the recipients receive the email if their reply to me has their received email in tow (which I just now discovered - phew!) </p><p>So the problem seems to be a display issue within Tbird itself. Also the recent update has changed the location of various buttons, which after a lot of searching, I found lurking in unexpected and difficult to reach places. Naturally this takes time and I'm sure I will find previous buttons lurking somewhere. </p><p>Has anybody else found odd responses from the recent update? </p><p>Enjoy the rest of the day and all subsequent days!! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",georgec4

On the other installation, there's no icon, and the display name and the sender's address are on one line above the subject. I have no idea why the first PC has this two-line-plus-icon layout for the senders of messages. I can't find any settings that will get rid of the icon and the two-line display. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",danawilson001
