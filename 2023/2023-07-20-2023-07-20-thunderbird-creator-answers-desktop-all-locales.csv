This is clearly an issue with trying to authenticate to Google as it happens after auth, but come on, this is a given requirement these days.  If your app doesn't work out of the box (MacOS 13 btw), it may as well not exist for the OS, so this is very confusing. </p><p>Trying out older versions was a real comedy of failures as well.  Too old and it's just a disaster.  Too new and it just self updated to 115 again which doesn't work.  So kinda seems like this is not a functional app anymore, at least not on Mac.  Baffling.

Comments/questions: 1. Why is it virtually impossible to simply slide a column header divider to a new location where one wants the divider to be without other adjacent columns changing size too? 2. Why do columns like Date and Tag refuse to slide to a minimal size and even double-clicking requires multiple attempts to reduce the width? 3. Why do column widths not transfer exactly when using Apply to...&nbsp;? 4. Is it possible to have an Apply to... option that is All Accounts and their Children? (Rather than having to do it on each Account separately.) 5. Once a particular ""view"" (generic use of the term) is to one's satisfaction, what is the supported way to reproduce that <strong>exactly </strong> on all folders in all Accounts, so that every element (column selections, sizing, sorting, etc) is identical on all folders?

I need to have the Thunderbird (TB) eMail on both my work and home computer. It is already on my work computer and I have copied the TB eMail to a USB according to what I found on here, and have checked and all the files appear on the USB. I have tried to get the TB eMail on my home computer now, with that USB, but can not, no matter what I try. I have downloaded the TB eMail from the Mozilla site to my home computer several times; deleted it to try again; and have cleared everything out every time I do. However EVERY time now, I am getting an error message that the Profile Setting Can Not Be Found.....specifically it says "" Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."" in a pop up window. I don't know how to get rid of this so that it does not pop up every time - because again, it pops every time even after I delete the TB completely. If someone could guide me on how to get the TB on my home computer without that popping up, and how to proceed from there, because I do have all those files on the USB, it would be GREATLY appreciated!!!
