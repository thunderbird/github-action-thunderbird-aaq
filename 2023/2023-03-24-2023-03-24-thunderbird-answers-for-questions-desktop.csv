How do I keep the menu bar visible? </p><p>Update re: my issue with threaded emails -- I took a chance and clicked on a Sender email address in one email in a thread. That click expanded the specific email. In the Inbox folder, all emails in a given thread are now visible, and all emails in that thread contain a Save As option. So this problem seems to be solved. </p><p>Sorry if I confused you earlier. The Save As option I referred to originally is to be found in specific emails, under a ""More""/""Other"" dropdown menu in the header of the specific email, and not in the menu bar at the top of the screen. My guess: when the threaded function is active, TB collapses all mails in that thread and collapses or simplifies the menu bar within each email.

You use 'Body' 'contains' and then a string of characters which seem to be a link or webpage - I'm not entirely sure because you blanked them out. So this could mean remote content links eg: clickable image links. These links may change on a per email basis.  Suggest you type just the domain, so if you currently have: <a href=""http://domain.ru/Info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.ru/Info</a> Then try 'Body' 'contains' '<a href=""http://domain.ru"" rel=""nofollow"">domain.ru</a>' </p><p>I do recall that it's not exactly that simple trying to get Message Filters to work on links that are contained within the email, some of which could have a load of HEX in link and have a tendency to  freqently change.  However, the 'body' filter option has always searched only the message text itself and not tags/ links/headers etc within the email as they come under different HTML tags and in this instance href part of email. I believe the developers /powers that be...are considering adding the href part of a link to the search, but don't hold your breath, they've been considering that for quite a while. </p><p>It's much easier to locate them based on eg: a 'Reply-to' email address located in the headers. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

For TB's there is no path box or any other options. I thought it strange but I don't think I missed anything. I had to move the profile to a non-hidden folder to get it to load. That did not solve the issue, I think the folder is too small to be the lost profile as nothing came back with it.  Somehow my GRUB bootloader got borked and (initRAMfs) did a repair that wiped out all of TB &amp; only some settings in Firefox &amp; disabled all it's extensions. The drive booted right after that but was Read Only. A second reboot  returned Write privileges, but only Mozilla stuff was messed up as far as I can tell. More research is in ordrer I guess, before I resort to a TimeShift restore.   </p><pre>  Thanks for trying to help. </pre>",_j.Post,false,0,0
