We deal with an organization which issues their own S/MIME certificates. For a long time it worked flawlessly - we imported their CA as trusted, imported personal certificates of email recipients and everything worked smooth. Lately they started issuing two different certificates per person - one for signing emails, another for encryption. And now since emails from them come with a signature created with a certificate which has ""Digital Signature"" and ""Non Repudiation"" uses - everything works fine ""inbound"". The problem starts if we want to send encrypted emails back to them. Even if we import the encryption certificates we get (those have only ""Key Encipherment"" usage) and the certificates themselves are valid in any possible way (lifetime, proper CA chain imported and so on), still Thunderbird tells us it can't find proper certificate to encrypt the message. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,,crackmyback

I only use Local Folders for email storage with several sub folders. I upgraded the Netbook to V115 however on opening the program I was unable to see any of my stored emails. I did note however that Thunderbird did download new emails from the server and displayed the number of new emails (urrently 14) but none of the headers were displayed. So I can not rtead any existing emails or unread new emails.

I've always had that at the top of the folder tree, not in alphabetical order way down the list. Or in my ""Travel"" folder I similarly to ""Kept"" have tickets and hotel bookings. I want that near the top too, but also, within it I want the subfolders in chronological order of trip. And so on.

The program also seems much faster in opening and more responsive in general, congratulations! </p><p>I found a small bug I think and I would also like to take the opportunity to give some suggestions about the program. </p><p>The bug is with the calendar. When creating an event you can place it in several pre-established categories, each of which had a different color in previous releases. Color which was then also displayed in the box created on the calendar, through a colored line which helps the eye to identify different events. But in 115.0.1 this feature is buggy, all categories have the same color and the colored line is not displayed on created events. </p><p>Suggestions: </p><p>1) Instead of a small colored line it would be useful if the whole box of the event created in the calendar were colored in the chosen colour, it would be more functional for days with many close events and also more aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. </p><p>2) In thunderbird you can customize folder view with various columns. Once the first folder has been customized, you can copy the same setting and apply it to other folders and subfolders, there are two special functions to do this, but there is no way to apply the setting to all folders at once! It would be extremely convenient in all those thunderbirds that have many configured mailboxes. </p><p>3) The date column should never be shortened when resizing thunderbird from full screen to custom size or side view with other programs. All the other columns if resized do not have much impact on the user experience, you often understand the subject even by reading only the first three words, you often understand the correspondent even by looking only at the first 5 letters, but in my opinion the date column should be always fully visible, time included. </p><p>4) Please allow donations in Bitcoin, free software for free software. </p><p>Thanks again for your work, we love you!&nbsp;:) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,,V.

In past year began using Thunderbird for my company email that migrated to Exchange. I have TB 102.13.1 setup to retrieve my company email thru Owl for Exchange plugin. Been using it for while now and all goes good with the exception of filters and tags. I have several filters setup on the inbox to check on incoming messages and every 10 minutes. If an email comes in from a certain sender the filter will tag it a certain color.  I have a total of 3 filters that look for particular  senders to tag different colors. When I first setup it seemed to work as intended. Recently it has stopped to automatically tagging the emails. I can manually tag the email but that kinda defeats the purpose of having the filters.

This still happens after a Thunderbird restart with all addons disabled. This basically prevents me from customizing the keybinds with the tbkeys addon and makes Thunderbird a lot less useful to me. </p><p>If there's a way to truly disable/change keybinds within Thunderbird itself, I'd happily go in that direction, but I couldn't find any documentation on it. tbkeys seemingly ""prevent defaults"" the keybinds you specify, however that seems to fall apart if you hold the key down.

The Gmail Inbox covered couple years, and the mail file hidden deep within Windows 11 Roaming folder was over 3GB.  The Thunderbird account was installes as POP. </p><p>How the installation got fixed: 1. Just in case, I copied the Mail folder from C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\zkwmmr59.default-release\Mail 2. Uninstalled Thunderbird, rebooted and installed As Administrator (original version was just installed by file Open).  After installation software came up with the POP account, and the original write error. 2. I removed present Gmail account Settings\Account\Settings\Account Actions\Remove Account, and then in Account Actions added MAPI account for Gmail. </p><p>This has resolved the write to folder prohibition issue, doesn't make much sernse, but it works, and software started to download headers, and now continues to download all messages, no issues observed.

I am going to upgrade my old MacBook Pro to a MB Air, and my Time Machine has stopped working.  While researching a solution I found that perhaps there was not enough space on my HD to 'create a snapshot'. So in the process of deleting stuff in order to make space, I found lots of 'duplicates' in the Apps Storage section of the HD, I thought it was safe to delete them as the 'originals' would still be there (same date, same size). I now know I have been very ignorant/stupid (my dog died a few weeks ago and my mental health hasn't been the same since.) However, I was very mistaken and seem to have deleted a lot of my working apps, the most important of which being Thunderbird, which gathered my 4 different email accounts. I'm not sure what version I had last, as it has disappeared, but I'm pretty sure it would be the latest version. My latest download is 68.2.2 (20.11.19). So I tried to reinstall it, but came across this notification 'You have launched an older version of Thunderbird... Create new profile, or Quit.' I googled this but being a not-very-techy senior lady, I can't make sense of what I should do, my main concern being not to lose all my settings, my emails saved in folders, as well as being able to receive and send. I am sure I saw some reference in the past of a library which would contain the emails, but don't know what to do about this notification.  The other problem, of course is that I can't completely rely on Time Machine as my last backup is dated 24.7.23. Thank goodness today is a Sunday as there should be less traffic on my email accounts (I am involved with lots of local activities, including being a community journalist). I would be so grateful if someone could help me navigate this minefield and reinstate my app so it works as closely as it did before.

I actually like the spaces toolbar and would like to use it to navigate through my main spaces (mail, calendar, address book). Ideally, when I want to change the space, e. g. from Mail to Calendar, the currently open tab should be reused. Otherwise I don't get the purpose of the spaces toolbar. If all spaces are opened in a new tab then I can use the tabs to switch between the space and the spaces toolbar gets useless. </p><p>In my opinion it would be nice to have an option to open spaces selected in the spaces toolbar in the current tab.
