I first noticed this problem happening on a few e-mails maybe 2 months ago but it seems to becoming more common. At first, I though that it was just a case of e-mails using bold tags in the subject line so that it *looked* unread. But once I opened the Error Console, I could see it throwing errors each time I moved the selection from each of these messages.   The weird thing is that there are at least 6 different errors in the console and the specific error seems to change from time to time.
