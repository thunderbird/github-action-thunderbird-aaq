Following my original post, I typed Enter Ctrl-V at the end of existing text; that started a new line (so obviously Thunderbird 'knew' I was in the composition/message pane) and set variable width instead of pasting.  I then right-clicked and clicked on paste, followed by right-click and paste without formatting, but no success either way in pasting - in a couple of my following experiments, right-click and paste actually changed fixed width to variable width. </p><p><br> tbkeys lite settings are Main key bindings: { </p><pre>   ""f"": ""cmd:cmd_forward"",    ""r"": ""cmd:cmd_reply"",    ""k"": """",    ""u"": ""cmd:cmd_previousMsg"",    ""d"": ""cmd:cmd_nextMsg"",    ""n"": ""cmd:cmd_nextUnreadMsg"" </pre> <p>} </p><p>Compose key bindings: { ""ctrl+w"": """" } </p><p>I don't understand the syntax, so can realistically only follow instructions unless I want to break things.   However, I have just brilliantly tried ""ctrl+v"": ""paste"", which seemed to result in ctrl-V doing nothing at all, followed by ""ctrl+v"": ""cmd:cmd_paste"", which doesn't prevent both ctrl-V and right-click paste from changing format to variable width. </p>",ferrerslocke,false,0,0

These messages need to be shared with the email provider to have corrected. They will know what has to be done because the DKIM and SPF issues mentioned in messages are known concerns. This is happening because many email hosts (such as Gmail) are now putting more stringent security controls in place.
