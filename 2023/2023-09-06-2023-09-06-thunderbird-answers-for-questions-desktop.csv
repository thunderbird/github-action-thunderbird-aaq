Following my original post, I typed Enter Ctrl-V at the end of existing text; that started a new line (so obviously Thunderbird 'knew' I was in the composition/message pane) and set variable width instead of pasting.  I then right-clicked and clicked on paste, followed by right-click and paste without formatting, but no success either way in pasting - in a couple of my following experiments, right-click and paste actually changed fixed width to variable width. </p><p><br> tbkeys lite settings are Main key bindings: { </p><pre>   ""f"": ""cmd:cmd_forward"",    ""r"": ""cmd:cmd_reply"",    ""k"": """",    ""u"": ""cmd:cmd_previousMsg"",    ""d"": ""cmd:cmd_nextMsg"",    ""n"": ""cmd:cmd_nextUnreadMsg"" </pre> <p>} </p><p>Compose key bindings: { ""ctrl+w"": """" } </p><p>I don't understand the syntax, so can realistically only follow instructions unless I want to break things.   However, I have just brilliantly tried ""ctrl+v"": ""paste"", which seemed to result in ctrl-V doing nothing at all, followed by ""ctrl+v"": ""cmd:cmd_paste"", which doesn't prevent both ctrl-V and right-click paste from changing format to variable width. </p>",ferrerslocke,false,0,0
