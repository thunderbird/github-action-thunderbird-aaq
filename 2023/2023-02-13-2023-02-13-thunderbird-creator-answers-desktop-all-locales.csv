I have been browsing forum to improve my knowledge of issues related to use of Thunderbird with Comcast email server.  This was prompted by three things: 1) I experience intermittent inability to send or receive Comcast mail through Thunderbird; <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a>  port 993 2) Fielding many customer complaints relating to inability to use other (non Thunderbird) 3rd party mail clients, has led to several calls to Comcast tech support and recently the cheerful ""Welcome to Xfinity"" auto-bot  outgoing message reel has included a long, politely-ominous warning that Comcast will soon be ending support of certain (unspecified) legacy email clients. 3) When digging about in the control panel of my venerable Windows 10 HP laptop, I opened the Credentials manager and under Windows accounts I found a credential that is unfamiliar and totally meaningless to me. I also found a credential related to SONY XBox which I deleted as I do not own a Sony XBox.   As this laptop travels with me to various jobs and is often used on a variety of networks and sometimes used (with permissions) by remote tech support folks I wonder if this unknown credential is a result of that.   Anyone on this forum willing to have a look?    Also I would like to get any relevant information about bullet point 2 as it relates to Thunderbird.   How are relations with Thunderbird and Comcast mail services? </p><p>Thanks  Doug </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security,en-US,1565460;,seeheargear
