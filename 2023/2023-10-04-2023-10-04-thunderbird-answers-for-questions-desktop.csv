Use the menu bar (right click on the tab bar and select menu.  Is has the entries you seek on it's Tools menu. 2. Use Thunderbird to automatically move messages marked as junk to the junk folder. Periodically check the junk messages in the junk folder for an false positives and right click and select empty Junk from the context menu. Note you can empty the junk folder that way without actually opening it by right clicking the folder, but I would not really recommend deleting without first reviewing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

In the server settings you can specify that. TB is likely attempting to download all messages if the account is perceived as new. That is, TB likes to download what messages do not appear to have been downloaded and, if account is a new setup, it makes that assumption. If the messages are still on the account online, deleting the account in TB makes no affect on that. BUT, whenever you create a POP account for an account with existing messages, TB's assumption is that you want the downloaded, as that is what POP is for. TB does not sync POP accounts, so you can delete on PC and it will remain online. I suggest you first delete one message to verify that it is working properly. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Set it to just a day or two and that should help prevent the downloads. Again, deleting an account in Thunderbird (or any other email client) does not delete the actual account, so messages are still there.  To delete messages and keep on server, you're asking a lot of an IMAP account. That you do not want messages downloaded means you won't be able to access them, so I'm puzzled on your objective with the account. Knowing that may prove helpful. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You can mitigate the downloads by reviewing settings at synchronization&amp;storage pane. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I figure that means that 24 hours from now, I'll only have Yahoo messages in TB from the past day. My original post asked how I could safely (meaning, without losing my messages on Yahoo's servers) delete my Yahoo account in TB. From what I understand, you explained that the only way they could be deleted on Yahoo's servers is by TB syncing my Yahoo account and my Yahoo account in TB. So if I simply delete my Yahoo account in TB, there won't be a setting to tell TB to sync my Yahoo account. (If that sounds like The vessel with the pestle, I'll try to reword the above.)

MS also support IMAP and POP which are open standard protocols for email. Most MS servers support both IMAP and POP and Exchange and email providers  in the past have had issues with IMAP and POP but not Exchange and vice versa. p.p.s. it is possible you have deleted the emails from your Mobile client or copied the emails to Mobile and then deleted them so your Mac can't see them but i'm guessing you don't delete anything when using Mobile right&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;? </p>",rtanglao,false,0,0
