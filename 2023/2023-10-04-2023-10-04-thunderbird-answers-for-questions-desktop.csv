Because you will not be getting the same error for non gmail accounts,  so I  am guessing your doing something to initiate getting mail on the same account and clicking the get mail icon would do it as it is NOT a get mail on all accounts (shift+F5). </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It took me ages to work out you were referring to the appmenu. <img class=""wiki-image frameless"" src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2017-10-22-15-37-15-18c775.png"" alt=""Fx57Menu"" title="""">  </p><p>So I have some suggestions that might work. 1. Use the menu bar (right click on the tab bar and select menu.  Is has the entries you seek on it's Tools menu. 2. Use Thunderbird to automatically move messages marked as junk to the junk folder. Periodically check the junk messages in the junk folder for an false positives and right click and select empty Junk from the context menu. Note you can empty the junk folder that way without actually opening it by right clicking the folder, but I would not really recommend deleting without first reviewing. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
