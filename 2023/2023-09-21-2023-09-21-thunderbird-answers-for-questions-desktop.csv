Here is my own documentation on threading, duplicating the above, but it may help: You need to highlight each folder and click View&gt;sort by&gt;unthreaded.

If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </p>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

After pulling off a fair bit of hairs, it seems that a correct explanation of the problem is the following (I started from a fresh empty profile). </p><p>I have 2 accounts, from the same mail provider (LaPoste) with no difference, they both don't have any personal folder. That provider has that unusual folder organization where everything is under INBOX and their folder for sent email is INBOX/OUTBOX (I know...), drafts are under INBOX/DRAFT and junk under INBOX/QUARANTAINE </p><p>When I add account n°1, TB detects that it should place a copy of sent email in INBOX/OUTBOX and same for draft and junk (although for junk, it does not automatically activate ""Move new junk..."" but the selected grayed out option is other, ""INBOX/QUARANTAINE"". In account settings, the ""Place a copy in"" would show ""No available"" folder under option """"Sent"" Folder on:"" is active with and correctly displays ""OUTBOX"".  When I go under the "" all folders"" view, the INBOX/OUTBOX correctly as the green flying envelope icon. </p><p>When I add account n°1, TB does not do any of that detection and wants to create Sent, Drafts and Junk folders. Well, no big deal, I could change that manually although it is *super* weird why it would work in one case and not the other. Again, same provider, fresh profile, no difference I can think of. </p><p>Now, the real problem seems to be with unified folder that try to be too smart I guess. I want, for both account, to store sent message locally but other email clients (e.g. my iphone) will still put its sent message in INBOX/OUTBOX. What I'd like to do is when I chose the folders to be used in ""Sent"" unified folder, to have both INBOX/OUTBOX and the local folder.  I do that through the properties of the ""Sent"" unified folder. </p><p>But what seems to happen is that TB seems to only follow what was set in ""Place a copy in"" from account settings, and even if I have checked the INBOX/OUTBOX for that account, there is no subfolder entry created. </p>",philippe_44,false,0,0
