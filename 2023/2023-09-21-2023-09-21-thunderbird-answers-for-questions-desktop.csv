For example, for the problematic IMAP account (LaPoste),  the ""trash"" folder is under the inbox but does not appear initially under the ""inbox"" smart folder. Again, in the settings of that smart folder, only the inbox of LaPoste is selected, **nothing else**. </p><p>Now, if I put something in LaPoste's trash folder, by deleting a message, then LaPoste/inbox/trash became *automatically* selected in the the inbox smart folder. I now have ""trash"" and ""inbox"" of LaPoste selected in the search criterial for inbox smart folder. The trash folder of LaPoste the appear in the inbox smart folder for a bit and then the whole LaPoste account disappear from the inbox smart folder and I have to uncheck the ""LaPoste/inbox/trash"" folder to make things work again. </p><p>So, net net it seems to me  </p><p>1- the search criteria in smart inbox is somewhat broken and when a folder is selected, even if all sub folder are unchecked, they are parsed and when something is found there, they are auto-reselected. 2- when that auto-reselection occurs, something funny happens and the whole tree disappear from smart folder it belonged to. </p>",philippe_44,false,0,0

Here is my own documentation on threading, duplicating the above, but it may help: You need to highlight each folder and click View&gt;sort by&gt;unthreaded. If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </p>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default. Problem solved.   </pre>",davidsk,false,0,0
