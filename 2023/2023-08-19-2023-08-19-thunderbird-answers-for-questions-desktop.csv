It means you must have some updater software on your computer which is looking for updates and it located:  <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/115.1.1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/115.1.1</a> Then it informed you about this 'update' which you downloaded and installed.  </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; More Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Bottom of 'Application Basics' is 'Profile' - click on 'about:profiles' </li></ul> <p>It opens in a new tab to tell you all the profiles installed. It will tell you which one is currently set up as default. It will list all the profiles. </p><p>Suggest you use this method to open the current new profile and also the original profile. </p> <ul><li> You would be looking for the 'Root Directory' location and it will have a 'Open Folder' button (In Linux - 'Open Directory' button). </li><li> Click on 'Open Folder' button to see contents of that profile name folder. </li></ul> <p>Once you have both profiles open in new independent windows... </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird now - this is important. </li></ul> <p>You will see various folders and files. </p><p>Calendar: If you just have the 'Home' default calendar then  'calendar-data' folder could be copy pasted to new profile - replacing the default empty calendar-data folder. </p><p>AddressBooks: </p> <ul><li> Personal Address Book - 'abook.sqlite' file </li><li> Collected Addresses - 'history.sqlite' file </li></ul> <p>Both of the above can be directly copy pasted into the new profile name folder  replacing the empty default ones. (I would delete the empty ones first then paste in copied files or allow replacing/overwriting) Any other eg: 'abook-1.sqlite' file can only be imported via Address book, so this must occur later on after restarting Thunderbird. </p><p>It's worth getting a copy of the old profile 'pref.js' file and putting it on the desktop. It may contain information for working out what was the name of the address book which is using 'abook-1.sqlite' file. </p> <ul><li> Click on 'Mail' folder to see all Pop account name folders and Local Folders account. </li><li> Click on eg: Pop mail account to see contents. </li></ul> <p>You need to copy all files that do not have any extension - they are mbox files, they have same name as folders you normally see in Folder Pane and they contain emails or they point to a subfolder. You need to copy any folder that has a.sbd extension. </p><p>As these are POP mail accounts you can copy and paste them into the new Pop account folder in new profile. </p><p>When it comes to the 'Local Folders' mail account - you can copy the entire 'Local Folders' folder - go to new profile - clickon 'Mail' folder - delete the current empty 'Local Folders' folder and then paste the copied 'Local Folders' folder into the 'Mail' folder. </p><p><br> Start Thunderbird. </p><p>Import other address books. In Address Book Import &gt; SQLite databases click on 'Continue' locate the old profile and select eg: abook-1.sqlite and click on 'Open' Choose 'Create a new directory called 'abook-1'and click on 'Continue' As it should have all the same format it should get imported ok. Then in address book check it's contents and then you can rename the address book to a more suitable name - that name you may discover in the 'pref.js' file you put on the desktop - it can be opened using eg: Notepad.  Scroll down to the where the 'ldap' section starts. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,1

I presume these copies are all in the ...AppData/Roaming folder and nothing in the Local? </p><p>For ctroein, I found that TB is installing  ""Mozilla Maintenance Service"" What this does is use the Windows update function to detect a TB update. It is a clever way to remove some background computing. However, if like me, you do NOT want updates, then uninstall this. There is also a flag in TB to disable but don't remember what it is just now. I believe it signals the Service function to work. I think if it is uninstalled you will not get the auto update in background when not looking. </p><p>It seems to me that Windows and many apps are too free with giving updates. What happened to good programming and letting users know when there is a critical update as in a severe bug or a security issue to patch? </p><p>Will try all these copies tonight. </p>",peterdev,false,0,0

Not everyone wants to be prompted with a UAC pop up everytime an update needs to be applied. </p><p>So enabling the  Mozilla Maintenance Service merely overrides the UAC pop up, thus auto allowing the update to be applied. You can force Windows to always prompt you to pop up the UAC to ask to allow update via: </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> scroll to 'Updates' section </li><li> uncheck the checkbox 'Use a background service to install updates'. </li></ul> <p>You can still have Thunderbird check for updates but ask you when to update or not, that is an entirely different option.

It will only be aware of what new release has been made available via official website and they may not be the same update. In fact, when a major release is occuring, it is normal to offer the new release, but not offer the new release as an update at that point in time. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
