Would be nice to get help, Dirk </blockquote> <pre>I try to be more complete: I have a thunderbird gmailaccount and a recovery skynetmailaccount. For no apparent reason the skynetaccount stopped receiving mails while the gmailaccount still did. So I tried to contact thunderbird and had to make an account for it and another for mozilla before help could be given. And than I asked help which in dutch didn't work. So I gave up for some time. A bit later I wanted to look at my emails and they seem to be all gone, also the gmail. </pre> <p>Dirk </p>",odirkvandeputte,false,0,0

Mail hits the inbox, and gets filtered. I use one filter to handle the multiple subjects, all settings just as in your example. It is supposed to mark these messages as read. This mark as read filter is above the next in the filter list. The next filter in the list then uses ""From"", ""Contains"", ""All of The Following"", and moves the messages to a folder I specify. This filter, which has existed for a long time, is still moving the messages as it should. Unfortunately, the ""mark as read"" filter is not functioning automatically. When I go to the folder these messages were correctly moved to, they are still marked as unread. When I manually run the mark as read filter on this folder, all the messages in the folder disappear. </p><p>I don't think using the same filter for everything will work for my organizational needs in this case. Some of the mail going to this folder, having various unspecific subjects, needs to get there, and stay unread until I actually open it. Other mail in this folder (coming from the same sender) must be marked as read depending on specific subjects. </p><p>If you still need a photo, I will get you one, but I'm hoping I have already cleared up the confusion.  </p><p>Jeff </p>",lobudgt,false,0,0

Automatic execution works on inbox only,  except for the on sending and archive functions. </p><p>Then you talk of using separate filters, one of which moves the messages so they are not there to be found by subsequent filters </p> <blockquote>I created a new filter today, for a messages that end up in a particular sub-folder. The triggers were two subject based filters, set to mark these messages as read. A separate filter is set to send these messages into the aforementioned sub-folder. </blockquote> <p>It is gererally accepted that filter actions on a single mail must all be included in a single filter.   So if you have two subject constraints it would be input as shown below using match any f the following </p><pre><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-08-18-21-44-38-ec0d39.png""> </pre> <p>If you want to mark as read,  mark as junk and move a message that is also achieved in that same filter.  With any move statement last in the list of actions to take. </p><p>A filter is a discrete action,  so if one filter moves an email the next filters that should match the mail will not even see it. </p><p>Perhaps post the actual content of your filters.  That way there is a chance I might be able to see where it send your mail. (If it is an IMAP account it might still be in the process of moving.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
