I tried several and they either failed because the Add-0n manager would not accept them or because they were broken. The latter could have been because they author had not updated them,  but I thought you were supposed to check for that when a version number was specified. Trying by using Chrome to go direct to the site and not using the Add-on manager produce extensions which add-on manager refused to add because they were not suitable for my version.  </p><p>When I tried the URLs you gave above tonight, they took me to a page which said they were all for my current version, 102.11.0.

As I said in my first letter, this seemed wrong to me - thank you for answering my first query and confirming that they were only language oriented differences.  My queries on Usenet gave me several URLs which I did not follow up as I thought at the time I had solved the problem.

However, I can't see that there is any problem with the extension - it seems to me it is the website that is wrongly set up or the Addons Manager is faulty. The fact that the Manager failed in both our cases, it works  just fine via Google, which might well suggest a problem with the Manager. In some cases, although searching from the Add-ons Manager appears to give correct results. it shows extensions which are not compatible with 102.11. This actually could be the fault of the extensions but as more than one from different authors have problems it is more likely that the site (or its operators) is not sorting them into version correct types. I doubt the authors have control over this.  For example, a search from within the Manager for ""calendar"" gives a page with ""Google Calendar Tab"" and ""Open Google Calendar "" on it. Albeit similar, but apparently from different authors, neither of them work correctly with my version of 102.11 so it appears likely they are the wrong version. Even if the fault lies with the authors, I thought that extensions were supposed to be checked before they were allowed on the site - they used to be, anyway.
