If I click on an email received after 1 July with the paperclip icon, no attachment pane shows at the bottom of the email. When I move to the next email in the list, the attachment pane very briefly flashes then disappears. This also happens when I move an email with a working attachment pane to another folder or sub-folder. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",neillb46
