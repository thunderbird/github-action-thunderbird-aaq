The delay is shorter than the previous version of Thunderbird. </p><p>This creates two difficulties.  Firstly, as I drag a message past folders on the way to the destination folder they can be expanded.  Presumably my pointer pauses briefly.  Secondly, the destination folder is often expanded and has to be collapsed later.  It's tedious because to speed the backup I avoid big .sbd files by having a subfolder for each of ~10 years </p><p>I've looked for solutions:   </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/162lh4m/auto_expand_subfolder_while_dragndrop_over_it"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Thunderbird/comments/162lh4m/auto_expand_subfolder_while_dragndrop_over_it</a> describes the difficulty but had no solution. </li><li> I browsed the config editor's list but did not find a setting for the delay </li></ul> <p>In case it matters: </p> <ul><li> The layout is Classic, with the folder pane being full screen height  </li><li> The only extension is CardBook (for contacts) </li><li> The theme is ""System theme -- auto"" </li></ul> <p>Maybe the delay is OK for most people but my hands tremble a little.

Questo strano comportamento rende il programma poco piacevole da utilizzare e fa perdere un sacco di tempo a riportare verso il basso la lista messaggi con possibili errori dovendo digitare tasti e spostare il cursore. E' possibile risolvere questo errore? Grazie. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1612595;,cosentino1960
