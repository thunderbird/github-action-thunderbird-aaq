I have a Verizon email account which runs through AOL. When I tried to send an email I had written, A box opened up saying that the ""password"" I had entered was not correct. The last time this happened, I had to go into AOL and have it generate a ""one time password"" for third party programs, that I need to copy and then paste into Thunderbird when I logged in. </p><p>The only time I can get Thunderbird to request a password is when I send an email . So I did that and pasted the AOL password into the box when it requested a password. I then had a messages appear that said incorrect password and this continued each time I tired it. </p><p>I finally called AOL's tech support and was told that I needed to send myself an email by using my email account within <a href=""http://AOL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">AOL.com</a>. I needed to do this for 7 days. Send myself an email from AOL and then open that email within my email account on AOL. The reason I was given was that AOL no longer recognized my computer. None of this makes sense, but I've been doing this for 4 days. And each day I have also tried to get Thunderbird to start working again, but I keep getting the same results. </p><p>I also have a Comcast email account and I use Thunderbird to send and receive emails for that account and it works fine. Never had a problem. </p><p>Is there some kind of issue between AOL and Thunderbird that is causing this? I could use some help on this please. I'm a long time user of Thunderbird and would like to be able to continue using it.  </p><p>Thank you. Fred </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1612752;1612782;1626663;,FredBerney

I have hated using the Gmail interface because I had problems find emails that I clearly remembered reading.  Now, It appears that Thunderbird has adopted Gmail's horrible display method and now I can't find emails that I know that I received.  I hope that there is a setting somewhere that allows me to undo this.  I looked, but I could not find any. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1612768;1612785;,johnmoster
