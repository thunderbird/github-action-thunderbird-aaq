Gmail will auto delete any emails that have been in the  gmail Trash after 30 days, thus allowing you time to retrieve an email deleted in error. Gmail will auto remove any deleted emails from the 'All Mail' folder if those emails have been put into the gmail Trash folder. </p><p>Note: If you by pass the gmail Trash folder then gmail reads this as remove only a label which means the email is archived meaning email is still in All Mail but all labels are removed so you do not see it anywhere else. </p><p>So everything works perfectly ok until you decide to delete an email from an 'All Mail' folder which you know has already been deleted. Why are deleting emails from  'All Mail'? It does take a little while for Thunderbird to jibber jabber with server about what has been deleted and then server gets up dated and then the imap 'All Mail' folder gets synchronised again to reflect changes. </p><p>Bottom line is this if you have set everything up correctly and it sounds like you have everything set up correctly....then Do not delete anything from the 'All Mail' folder. I would go as far to say do not do anything with an 'All Mail' folder and the best solution is unsubscribe from seeing it. </p><p>If you delete an email from 'All Mail' then it will automatically get deleted from whatever folder it was displaying in eg: Inbox.  Strongly advise you do not do anything in a gmail 'All Mail' folder. It is the one and only copy that truelly exists as far as gmail is concerned and nothing in an imap account can be truelly regarded as a separate independent copy because all folders synchronise with server. </p><p>As far as gmail is concerned there is only one copy of an email and it is in 'All Mail' folder. The only reason you see it in Inbox is because gmail applied a kind of filter tag which they call a label. This means a virtual email is shown in the server Inbox. Thunderbird downloads the virtual copy and stores it as an email in imap folder. When you delete it and email goes to Trash, gmail sees this as delete the email which is in 'All Mail'.   </p><p>Why have you subscribed to see the 'All Mail' folder&nbsp;? It's just a duplicate of everything.  You can't use it for anything useful because it just full of everything - there is no organisation or reasoning to it and you should never move delete etc etc anything in 'All Mail' as it may effect emails you want to keep. It's really just too risky to contemplate. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
