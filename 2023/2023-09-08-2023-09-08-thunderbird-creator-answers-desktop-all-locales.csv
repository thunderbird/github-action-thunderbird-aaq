Now updated to Supernova and it doesn't do that anymore.  When I hover over Inbox, it just displays ""Inbox, xxxx unread messages"".  Is there a hidden setting to get it to show me just the new messages like before? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",scheung
