Forcing me to have to edit the event to change its name each time. However, it only does this when the reminder window is open on the screen as well (with previous reminders). </p><p>When you initially add the event, it allows you to edit the text in the box for only a tenth of a second and then switches to ""Untitled"" before you can react. At the same time, the reminder window flashes like it is refreshing each time. The only way to name it is to then slowly click and then click again, highlight, and change. Or, to double-click, edit, and do it from the window.  </p><p>Is this normal behavior? It's a Gmail calendar using native support (not using the ""Provider for Google Calendar"" extension anymore since it no longer syncs properly). I only have ten other extensions but they are all related to mail. I have the latest public version of Thunderbird. The theme is also the native dark theme.  </p><p>If I select ""Tasks"" in the left column menu and then drag to create one, it stays within the box allowing you to edit the text just fine.

In my case, it's almost always open as I have past reminders always waiting to be attended to (if it isn't in my face at all times, I tend to forget). Anyway, if I close remove all reminders and let the window close, it will let me drag to add events just fine.
