Over 25 years (starting with Mulberry) I have built up a custom folder hierarchy that makes work manageable, but Thunderbird 102.15 has broken this, now displaying nested subfolders at the top level sorted alphabetically. See the images for before and after. For example, there are now three ""Administrative"": I'm not sure where they are from but they appear to be related to my roles as lab leader, graduate program chair, and chair of a second graduate program. Or the list of persons, who are Colleagues or Students, who were formerly in those subfolders. Now I need to scroll through hundreds of folders (have not counted recently but in the late 2000's I had over 500.) Fortunately I have one old laptop that I did not update, which I used for the first image, and am stuck using that for email. </p> <ul><li> Is there a way to configure 102.15 to display IMAP folder hierarchies as in the previous systems?  </li><li> If not, how do I revert to 102.14 (and stay there forever, or until Tbird realizes they need to fix this)?  </li></ul> <p>Thunderbird is so important to me that I make an automated monthly donation to the project, but will have to cancel if this is not fixed.  </p><p>Thanks, Dan Suthers </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1602757;,dan_suthers

This was a mistake. </p><p>Then I noticed that T-Bird  was attempting to use a dead outlook account after upgrade to 115.2.0 and we don't know how this figured in.

So I restarted T-bird and that is when things went south.  </p><p>So I started using the Windows dos box and did a ping of 8.8.8.8 and  that worked.

Forcing me to have to edit the event to change its name each time. However, it only does this when the reminder window is open on the screen as well (with previous reminders). </p><p>When you initially add the event, it allows you to edit the text in the box for only a tenth of a second and then switches to ""Untitled"" before you can react. At the same time, the reminder window flashes like it is refreshing each time. The only way to name it is to then slowly click and then click again, highlight, and change. Or, to double-click, edit, and do it from the window.  </p><p>Is this normal behavior? It's a Gmail calendar using native support (not using the ""Provider for Google Calendar"" extension anymore since it no longer syncs properly). I only have ten other extensions but they are all related to mail. I have the latest public version of Thunderbird. The theme is also the native dark theme.  </p><p>If I select ""Tasks"" in the left column menu and then drag to create one, it stays within the box allowing you to edit the text just fine.

In my case, it's almost always open as I have past reminders always waiting to be attended to (if it isn't in my face at all times, I tend to forget).
