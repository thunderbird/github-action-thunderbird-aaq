I do have some sub-folders from a couple of years ago, but now I can't get a new one. I click New folder, enter the name, and click Create folder, but nothing happens. No error messages, but the new folder doesn't show up. Not on a second try either, nor in another folder. I've tried re-indexing Thunderbird (by deleting the global-messages-db.sqlite file), but no difference. I have Thunderbird 102.15.0 on a Linux computer. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",slager
