Check to see if current email provider offers the ability to forward incoming mail to another account. Many do. Another option is to see if new email host will import mail from another account. Gmail allows that. So, if you set that up, you could start using the new account and it would automatically read and import mail sent to prior account so that you could manage all from the new account. During the transition, you need to keep both accounts active, and I encourage you to notify others to ensure they start using the new address. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Have looked at more videos online &amp; checked other sites, but still the same prob. I have tried the regular gmail password &amp; have tried an app p/w like some videos suggested, but same prob. However, this may be a clue, when I tried setting up one of my deleted gmail accounts in TB again  as suggested by a video, I setup an app p/w, then I used it when on the account setup which should have worked fine, but it wouldn't accept this app p/w. It would only accept the regular gmail password, then I proceeded to end only to get the ""Secure connection failed"" error message. So based on that YouTube video, either password way should work, it did for the video author, the video said after 5.30.22 gmail changed some rules &amp; the video said using the app p/w is the way around it, but it wouldn't even accept the app p/w, it would only accept the regular gmail p/w, but then failed at the end w/the error message. Really lost on this one, really want TB to work, it's a great program, really need help. </p>",sunriver223,false,0,0

The oauth token was provided by the server and it is specific to the account and the password used to access the account.
