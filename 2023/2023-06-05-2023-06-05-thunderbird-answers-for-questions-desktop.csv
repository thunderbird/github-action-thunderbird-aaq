The main function of IMAP accounts is to sync your account folders in your client software with your account folders on the mail server. You needn't be confused by the fact that when you delete a message from your inbox, it goes into the Trash on BOTH your client folder-list and the server (online) folder-list. That just means that the Delete button does not remove messages from the server. But if you right-click on Trash in your account folders in Thunderbird, and choose Empty Trash (or if you go online and choose the server's Empty Trash Now option), SHAZZAM! That trash is wiped from both your Thunderbird Trash and the Web interface Trash. Gone, baby, gone. (I like the ring of the option GMail offers me when I open my SPAM folder online: ""Delete Forever."" Has a real permanent sound to it, eh? </p><p>BUT </p><p>If you have a message, say, in your Inbox, and you want to keep it forever, you might move it from your Inbox to your folder named Archives (or to another new folder you created under Local Folders -- you can create a bunch of them for different purposes). In that case, you removed that message from the server by taking it out of the server's system. Now if you go to the online Web mail site of your server and check your Inbox there, that message you just moved will not be there after the server syncs with your client program. And if you check for that message online in the Trash folder, it won't be there, either. The server no longer has access to it, now that you've removed it from the server's system. </p><p>""If someone can make sense of all this so I don't stress myself out over what can go where, I will greatly appreciate it."" </p><p>I'm trying, my friend.

You can do that in several ways: 1: create a filter that does it; 2: highlight the messages, right-click and copy; exit TB and in File Explorer copy the Mail\Account\*.* folders to Mail\Local Folders - If account is IMAP, you should first click File&gt;offline&gt;download to ensure you have all messages on PC.

Second, the Beta installs separately so as not to corrupt any preexisting release. That is why it did not pick up your profile. For me, I have found the safest way is to use the profile manager (windows key and 'r' key, followed by entering  thunderbird.exe  -p   and pressing enter. Then click the 'create profile' button, then 'next', then enter a name for profile, followed by clicking the browse button to locate and select the desired profile.) </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Using the inbuilt import tool I can get my email account settings, but only a fraction of the old email messages. </p><p>Given the extent of the problems, I uninstalled the beta version and reinstalled the last stable version of Thunderbird. </p><p>This picked up the old profile, but again with the same limited number of old email messages. </p><p>Before installing the beta version I took the precaution of making a backup of my profile. However, this also fails to import my old messages. I wonder if there is a limit on how many messages it will import. </p><p>I think I'm going to abandon use of an email downloading client, because over the years it has always eventually resulted in lost email archives. I may search for some email recovery software to see if I can restore and view again at least some of my old emails. </p>",online34,false,0,0

By going to Settings&gt;Mail&gt;Accounts&gt;&lt;specific account&gt;&gt;&lt;IMAP Account&gt;&gt;Advanced&gt;DELETED MESSAGES I was able to change it to one month or Never.  Be warned that the change will not stick if you don't go back two screens and select Done...thanks Apple!  Since I don't trust Apple (and regret getting them involved in my life at all), I set it to Never and manage deleting my trash messages with Thunderbird. </p><p>Note that whatever IMAP-accessing mail client you use with the shortest message deletion threshold will rule them all, as IMAP changes transfer across mail clients.  At least in my case, <em>this was most definitely NOT Thunderbird's fault (though I initially assumed it was)!</em> </p>",mozilla450,false,0,0

If your father's computer is still operable and receiving information from that account, you might be able to find the password in the email program (presumably Thunderbird) and use that to access the account on the web and set a new/stronger password, as well as manage it in other ways.
