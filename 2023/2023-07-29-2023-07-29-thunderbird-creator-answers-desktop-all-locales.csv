After that day it's been impossible to send or reply to messages from my Outlook account (I receive emails though). I have made no changes to Thunderbird's configuration since then.  Basically it's the Oauth2 authentication that fails. I briefly see a browser page for authentication, wait, wait, wait and then the mail is not sent and I get an error message related to servers timeout (attached). Sorry, my interface is in Italian, but anyway the message is something like: ""Unable to send email because of a timeout on the connection to the out server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>. Try again."" Is this a known bug? Any ideas? It's quite annoying to use the browser interface to send messages while I am able to receive them in Thunderbird&nbsp;:) Thank you in advance, guys! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1593582;1593584;1593587;1593590;,simona_riva
