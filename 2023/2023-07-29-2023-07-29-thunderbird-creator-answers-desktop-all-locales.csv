(so that I can have notifications available even after a long time) </p><p>Is there a way to have push notifications even when the program is closed? (I don't want to have Thunderbird always open, and it would be useful to have a service that uses few resources) </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,"",mirkoantenucci
