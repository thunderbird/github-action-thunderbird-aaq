The Name/email/password are all correct. I have tried connecting my 3rd email account (+New/Existing Mail Account) as the 2nd account on different profiles but I get the same error trying to connect my Outlook acc.. I have verified that Thunderbird is configured to accept cookies. Is there some issue with having 2 outlook accounts linked to the same instance of Thunderbird?? (I hope not!! - that would be a complete deal-breaker!) Is there anything else I can try?

Specifically. Can I create filters to send any message I mark junk to the junk file under Local Folders? I've tried and can't seem to get junk messages sent direct to that Local Folder Junk file. Is there some trick to how you create a filter? The way I've been doing it is: Open Message Filters, check ""Filters for: and click the email address. Then click New for a filter. Then, in the new filter, type in Filter name:. ""JUNK"". Leave ck mark in Manually Run, Getting New Mail as ""Filter before Junk Classification"" (Or should I use Filter after?). Leave ck mark in ""Match all of the following. Now, Subject, contains - and that's where the email address goes. Usually I have copied it from the junk message and paste in. And finally, Move Message to: Junk on Local Folders. So why don't this work? And as far as I'm concerned Spam should be the same. Do I need to create filters for both junk and spam?
