After that day it's been impossible to send or reply to messages from my Outlook account (I receive emails though). I have made no changes to Thunderbird's configuration since then.  Basically it's the Oauth2 authentication that fails. I briefly see a browser page for authentication, wait, wait, wait and then the mail is not sent and I get an error message related to servers timeout (attached). Sorry, my interface is in Italian, but anyway the message is something like: ""Unable to send email because of a timeout on the connection to the out server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a>. Try again."" Is this a known bug? Any ideas? It's quite annoying to use the browser interface to send messages while I am able to receive them in Thunderbird&nbsp;:) Thank you in advance, guys! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1593582;1593584;,simona_riva

(so that I can have notifications available even after a long time) </p><p>Is there a way to have push notifications even when the program is closed? (I don't want to have Thunderbird always open, and it would be useful to have a service that uses few resources) </p><p>Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1593576;,mirkoantenucci

That works for all the subfolders of my email address just as explained in the help. Try the same for ""Local Folders"".

Other folders in Local Folders still have their old columns and arrangements. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",symonjim
