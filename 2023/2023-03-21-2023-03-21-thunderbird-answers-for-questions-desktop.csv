This only happens when I am using the ""Remove Duplicate Messages"" add-on. This add-on has a setting as to what action to take when a duplicate email is to be deleted. I have selected ""Move to Trash"". So at least for the add-on, it is somehow deciding to define the Trash folder differently on my 2 computers. I have submitted a new issue to the owner of the add-on, but I have a feeling the addon is using some obscure Thunderbird setting to ascertain which Trash folder to use. Very strange. There is another item in the Community that made reference to a setting in the server portion of an account profile that is defined as ""what to do when an email is deleted"". I cannot find that setting on either of my computers. </p>",TampaTom,false,0,0

Most people will set up a  Pop account to use it's own set of folders. So in Folder Pane you see the name/email address of the Pop account and it's own Inbox etc. </p><p>However, it is also possible to set up a Pop mail account as a deferred account - more commonly known as 'Global Inbox'. In this case,  the Pop account is set up to use 'Local Folders' mail account. If set up correctly, you would not see the Pop account name folder in the Folder Pane and it would not use it's own set of folders. </p><p>This means it is possible to create eg: three Pop mail accounts, set them all up as 'Global Inbox' and therefore you would only see 'Local Folders' mail account in Folder Pane and it would receive all emails coming in for all three Pop accounts. </p><p>What is 'Local Folders' mail account? It's a special mail account created by default by Thunderbird.  It is designed to be used for Pop accounts that are created as deferred accounts. It is also designed to be a place where any emails from any accounts can be stored. So, if you had an imap mail account and you had so many emails on the server that you were reaching a full quota, you could get copies of wanted emails stored in Local Folders and then delete the copy on the server thus creating more space on server.  Local Folders mail account stores emails on your computer in your profile and no folder synchronises with any server. </p><p><br> Do you have any Pop account set up as a Global Inbox account&nbsp;? If yes, then when you delete any emails from that account they would end up in Local Folders Trash folder. </p><p>How to find out if Pop account is set up as deferred account / Global Inbox: </p> <ul><li> In 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Server Settings' for the Pop account </li><li> click on 'Advanced..' button </li></ul> <p>One of the following would be selected: </p> <ul><li> If a normal Pop account - 'Inbox for this account' </li><li> If set up as a deferred account - 'Inbox for different account' - 'Global Inbox (Local Folders)' </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
