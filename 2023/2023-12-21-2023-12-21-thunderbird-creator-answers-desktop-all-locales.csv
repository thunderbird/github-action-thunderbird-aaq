It worked, except that there is a ""#news"" folder under my new profile which contains literally hundreds of subfolders, none of which I have created.  I scrolled through to try and illustrate the problem and it took 92 screenshots to capture them all! </p><p>I tried deleting the ""#news"" folder and it seemed to work, but then when I clicked on the new Inbox it all came back again.  I'm including the first few of the 92 (!) screenshots I took of the subfolders so you can see the context and get an idea of what I'm talking about. </p><p>How can I get rid of this phantom folder (and all its ghostly subfolders) in a way that it won't come back?
