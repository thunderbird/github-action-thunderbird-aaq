It mostly happens after booting the machines in the morning, but sometimes it also occurs spontaneously during the day. Internet works well, so does sending e-mails. Shutting down and booting again will help sometimes, but I also have to restart the router upstairs (Netgear) again from time to time. I checked all settings, closed Surfshark VPN, contacted our provider that checked the connections up to their modem / router in our home, everything was fine. I then installed another router (ASUS RT-AC87U) that gave the same problem. Also installed a timer that switches on half an hour before booting both computers so that we do not have to switch it off manually and we are sure the router already had a reset. Another issue on both computers: when some times we cannot receive e-mails and we reset router or computers, some e-mails that had been deleted reappear in the Inbox as if we had not opened them...... You might imagine that I am at the end of my possibilities to find a solution. Would you please help me? Kind regards, Ed (I sent this question twice before, presumably to the wrong dept.) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",edschijf

In Thunderbird, I go to troubleshoot information, Profile folder, open folder, I get Location is not available error (see image).  I go to about:profiles, open folder (any, see image), get same error.  Profile manager does not see the old profile from old PC.  How do I make Windows and Thunderbird see and open the profile folder Thunderbird is using successfully?

(Go Daddy is my domain holder and I have email supply though them. Called them and tried to login separately. separate login in works, but I want all my mail in Thunderbird. I have 10 email accounts on Thunderbird that are from my websites! I cannot login to each all day long to get the mail- that is why I use Thunderbird- all in one place) 2) when mail comes in- it used to turn the <strong>email address</strong> blue when all mail was received. not now.  3) printing is an issue again (was in September at Supernova introduction too- I submitted a comment then too- got no answer)- it is only allowing me to save as PDF.  </p><p>PLEASE HELP! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",stacymista
