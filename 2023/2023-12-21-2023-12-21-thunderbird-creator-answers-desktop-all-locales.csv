It mostly happens after booting the machines in the morning, but sometimes it also occurs spontaneously during the day. Internet works well, so does sending e-mails. Shutting down and booting again will help sometimes, but I also have to restart the router upstairs (Netgear) again from time to time. I checked all settings, closed Surfshark VPN, contacted our provider that checked the connections up to their modem / router in our home, everything was fine. I then installed another router (ASUS RT-AC87U) that gave the same problem. Also installed a timer that switches on half an hour before booting both computers so that we do not have to switch it off manually and we are sure the router already had a reset. Another issue on both computers: when some times we cannot receive e-mails and we reset router or computers, some e-mails that had been deleted reappear in the Inbox as if we had not opened them...... You might imagine that I am at the end of my possibilities to find a solution. Would you please help me? Kind regards, Ed (I sent this question twice before, presumably to the wrong dept.) </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",edschijf
