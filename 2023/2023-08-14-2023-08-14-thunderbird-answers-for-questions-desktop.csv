But upon checking my mobile it has come in to my inbox OK for the same address attachment as well?? Doesn't seem to be a problem there.

The download will go to the profile, which I assume is the default on drive c. The actual location can be determined by clicking 'server settings' and viewing the bottom row that shows local directory. That would be the directory of the account and the message folders would be subdirectories of that (e.g., ...imapmail\&lt;youraccountname&gt;\INBOX and INBOX.msf)  The download does not destroy anything, so you won't break anything. Verify that you have it all after the download, as it's possible it may not all download. Then exit TB and COPY the message folder to the  Mail\Local Folders folder in the profile (NOT the imapmail folder). BEFORE STARTING, click 'synchronization&amp;storage' advanced tab to confirm that the folders may be downloaded. You need to individually download each folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
