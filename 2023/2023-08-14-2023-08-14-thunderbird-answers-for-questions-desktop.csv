Thanks. </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Please confirm you are using Thunderbird 102.14.0 <strong>Q:</strong> Is the folder which contains the email a 'Unified' folder or normal folder? <strong>Q:</strong>Does that folder have 'View' &gt; 'Sort by' set as 'threaded' or 'unthreaded'? </p><p><strong>Q:</strong>Please confirm the 'ignored' email is a top level email and not a subthread. <strong>Q:</strong>If you use 'threaded', does that email have threads? Is there a &gt; indicating a collapsed thread? <strong>Q:</strong>If yes, it's threaded and collapsed, please expand the thread - is the 'ignored' email now shown as one of the subthreads or is it still the top level thread? If yes, it's now shown as a subthread -  <strong>Q:</strong>When you right click on email to see drop down, does the 'ignore subthread' have a tick against it or not? <strong>Q:</strong>Regardless of whether 'ignore subthread' has a tick or not - click on 'ignore subthread' - does it remove the 'ignore' on email&nbsp;? </p><p><strong>Q:</strong>If 'threaded' try 'View' &gt; 'Sort by' &gt; 'unthreaded' and see if the drop down option to 'ignore thread' works. Please report on results. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong>When you right click on email to see drop down, does the 'ignore thread' have a tick against it or not? <strong>Q:</strong>If it has a tick, click on it, then right click on email to see drop down again, does the tick still display or not? </p><p>Thanks for info. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

There was a message about a thread being ignored, but that was just before my screen went dead (an unrelated problem) and I had to power-cycle the machine.  Eventually I found the way to show ""ignored"" items, but not how actually to fix the ""ignored"" status.  So Toad-Hall's answer from yesterday morning was just in time for me - thank you very much! </p><p>It all happened because a nasty little ""feature"" of Thunderbird:  the key combination to ""unread"" a message on Linux (and probably on Windows, too) is Alt-M, K, U.  It's very easy to type Ctrl-M, K, U, instead.  Now, Ctrl-M is harmless - just a shortcut for ""write a new mail"".  But the subsequent K is a killer:  I wanted to ""unread"" a message exactly because it was important and I wanted to to make sure I look at it again, instead I set an ""ignore"" flag!  Bummer. </p>",msohnius,false,0,0

Your question is too general. Most outlook users are having no problems. Some outlook users have difficulties, but that is not an unusual situation, considering the large number of users. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I do not know if it was from an e-mail from this site, or another site from a user who was having technical difficulties with using the software after the update. I just want to see if I can get feedback to see what kind of issues and how it is working for users who use the latest version. </p><p>Perhaps I can find out more about using this program and if I will update it too.

Ha összecsukom a például a <em>Beérkező levelek</em> mappát, akkor a mostani 13 helyett 16 jelenik meg, mert hozzáadja az elrejtett mappában lévő olvasatlan leveleket. Nálad nem így viselkedik? Vagy ha igen, akkor szerinted hogyan kellene működnie? </p><p>Üdv, Balázs </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0

Viszont, ha nincs szétnyitva a mappa akkor nem mutatja  a beérkező üzeneteket, a korábbi verzió mutatta ekkor is. Gondolom, valahol az opciós beállításoknál, ezt is lehet konfigurálni, de én elvesztem abban. </p>",hordos7,false,0,0

Most direkt megnéztem, ez már a 102-es verzióban is így működött, és nem találtam rá beállítást, amivel át lehetne állítani. Viszont az igényedre szerintem van megoldás, csak nem pont olyan mint eddig. A <em>Mappamódok</em> alatt (a három pont ikon alatt találod az <em>Új üzenet</em> gomb mellett) kapcsold be és próbáld ki az <em>Egyesített mappák</em> és az <em>Olvasatlan mappák</em> lehetőségeket. Nem részletezném a működésüket, mert eléggé magukért beszélnek, viszont az <em>Olvasatlan mappák</em> jó kis funkciója (a jobb felső sarokban lévő menüből érhető el) a <em>Tömör nézet</em>, ezzel közvetlenül azon mappák listáját kapod meg, amelyekben olvasatlan levelek vannak. </p>",meskobalazs,false,0,0

Nem is értem miért szüntették meg ezt a hasznos funkciót, számomra emiatt egy visszalépés az új verzió. Köszönöm a segítséged! </p>",hordos7,false,0,0
