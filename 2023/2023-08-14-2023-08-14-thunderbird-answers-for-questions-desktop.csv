The download will go to the profile, which I assume is the default on drive c. The actual location can be determined by clicking 'server settings' and viewing the bottom row that shows local directory. That would be the directory of the account and the message folders would be subdirectories of that (e.g., ...imapmail\&lt;youraccountname&gt;\INBOX and INBOX.msf)  The download does not destroy anything, so you won't break anything. Verify that you have it all after the download, as it's possible it may not all download. Then exit TB and COPY the message folder to the  Mail\Local Folders folder in the profile (NOT the imapmail folder). BEFORE STARTING, click 'synchronization&amp;storage' advanced tab to confirm that the folders may be downloaded. You need to individually download each folder. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have used 88% of 2300 mb so  I am guessing this is a lot of data. I just want to make sure I do this right so I don't lose anything.  When I ""download"" where is it going?  Are you allowed to contact me directly via phone so you can walk me through this at some point?  Thank you for your quick initial response! </p>",revsan,false,0,0

If IMAP, you would first need to verify that all folders can be accessed offline and then click File&gt;offline&gt;download. After confirming that you have them all, you could do as above for POP. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Look for the patterns (e.g., INBOX and INBOX.msf) as those are the message folders. As long as you COPY them to profile, you lose nothing and if you make a mistake, you can start over. Do all that with TB NOT running. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

What about the profiles that are in the list but not in About: profiles? </p><p>I'm not sure where they all came from 73t is 96 kb from 10 Jan this year (not in use) gas is 824 Mb from 10 Jan 2023 (in use) 29az is 3.42 Gb from 28 Jan 2023 j9q is 16.4 Mb from 28 Jan 2023 7f6 is 11.4 Mb from 12 Feb 2023 (not in use) I changed computer at the beginning of january 2023 .
