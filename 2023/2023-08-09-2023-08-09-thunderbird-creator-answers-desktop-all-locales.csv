What a waste of paper. </p><p>Typing - it only uses a Courier font and only types around 6 words per line. </p><p>Signature block - refuses to use the designated signature block, instead again just types everything in Courier. </p><p>Looks bloody awful and not at all professional when sending to clients. </p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that did nothing. </p><p>Have looked at reverting to the previous build but that doesnot appear to be an option. </p><p>Grateful for any suggestions, otherwise I will need to look at other options. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",annesch1

Here’s the first. (I’m not sure if I’ve chosen the correct topic.) </p><p>Under Server Settings I have:  </p><pre> ‘When I delete a message: Move it to this folder:   Trash on Internode’. </pre> <p>(Internode is my mail server.) This is unchanged from Thunderbird 102, but it no longer works as it should. I have a folder called ‘Trash’, but when I delete a message, it does not appear in that folder or any other, so I can’t recover or refer to deleted messages. In case it’s relevant, I’m attaching a screenshot of the ‘unified folders’ part of my folder tree with all folders opened. Some things there look odd to me. Drafts, Templates, Sent have subfolders (Internode, Local folders). Trash has none—is this connected with the problem? Junk is split in an odd way, but it seems to work as it should. Any help will be welcome. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",kim.bastin

This is for both my gmail and hotmail accounts. The only way I seem to be able to save attachment is my dragging it off the Thunderbird window, to a destination folder such as my Desktop. I also cannot attach files; get similar software stall. I can drag files into an email message however.  Using Thunderbird 115.1.1 on a Win10 computer, with Avast anti-virus. Same situation on at least the last 3-4 Thunderbird versions. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",thebugdoc01
