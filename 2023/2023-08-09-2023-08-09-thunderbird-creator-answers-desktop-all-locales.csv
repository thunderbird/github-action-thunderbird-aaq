This is for both my gmail and hotmail accounts. The only way I seem to be able to save attachment is my dragging it off the Thunderbird window, to a destination folder such as my Desktop. I also cannot attach files; get similar software stall. I can drag files into an email message however.  Using Thunderbird 115.1.1 on a Win10 computer, with Avast anti-virus. Same situation on at least the last 3-4 Thunderbird versions. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",thebugdoc01
