Here’s the first. (I’m not sure if I’ve chosen the correct topic.) </p><p>Under Server Settings I have:  </p><pre> ‘When I delete a message: Move it to this folder:   Trash on Internode’. </pre> <p>(Internode is my mail server.) This is unchanged from Thunderbird 102, but it no longer works as it should. I have a folder called ‘Trash’, but when I delete a message, it does not appear in that folder or any other, so I can’t recover or refer to deleted messages. In case it’s relevant, I’m attaching a screenshot of the ‘unified folders’ part of my folder tree with all folders opened. Some things there look odd to me. Drafts, Templates, Sent have subfolders (Internode, Local folders). Trash has none—is this connected with the problem? Junk is split in an odd way, but it seems to work as it should.
