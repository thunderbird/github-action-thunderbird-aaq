However when I use Sky or AOL the 'sending box' stays open for between 20-25 seconds before its sent.

I was able to copy the THUNDERBIRD folder (in the Roaming folder) to a thumb drive.  I did the opposite steps on the WIN 10 PC. </pre> <p>When I open THUNDERBIRD (in the 10 PC), immediately a Google screen appears, asking to insert my password.  I type the password in, which is VERY familiar to me, and I get an error message from Google stating that it is wrong.  It is NOT wrong!!!!!! Furthermore, I have 4 e-mail addresses, but only the main one shows in the column on the left side of T-BIRD. </p><p>David suggested that I close the previous thread; he also suggested that the problem may be due to something called ""OAUTH2"".  I have NO clue what this is or means, no clue how to go about investigating it. I've gone to local PC repair shops.  They don't deal with THUNDERBIRD.  I went to the local GEEK SQUAD outlet in a BEST BUY store, and they gave me similar stories. So!, I've been trying to move my T-BIRD data from this PC to the 10 since this past Christmas time, and so far have been unsuccessful.  And, trying to get assistance from Google / Gmail is out of the question. H-E-L-P!

Recently I upgraded to Thunderbird 115.1.0 and Thunderbird appears to have decided it would rather use an oAuth flow for CalDAV authentication. This would be fine, except the next time the calendars attempt to synchronize the authentication fails and the calendar is automatically disabled. I have not been able to find a way to go back to forcing app password authentication or to successfully retain oAuth authentication. Has anyone else run into this problem? Other potentially useful information: I'm running Debain Testing and Sway with Thunderbird installed from Debian repos.
