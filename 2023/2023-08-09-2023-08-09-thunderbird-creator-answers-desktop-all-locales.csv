Only having a problem with my Hotmail account inbox. I'm unable to see any messages in the inbox. The messages are there, but they don't show. If I click an area in the inbox, the message displays. The other folders in this account display. Only having a problem with the inbox. Hope this makes sense to someone that can help me me able to see inbox messages. I tried a PC restart, but that was no help. Compacted that folder too. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1596614;,illroute66

The issue started more than a year ago when I set up a new laptop with pre installed W10, so it was a blank installation of T-Bird.
