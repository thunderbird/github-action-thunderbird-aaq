If I highlight multiple messages, it only deletes the most current message. It also shows the highlighted messages as being read, even though they were not opened? </p><p>Can somebody please call me and explain what is going on and how to fix this.  I am not good with computers and online help never works for me. I already tried that tonight and got nowhere. Chatting never fixes anything. I don't understand the things that are being said. I am a talk on the phone with a tech and work through the problem kinda person. </p><p>Thunderbird is definitely running slow - I don't know if that means anything. </p><p>Can somebody please help? </p><p>Jimmy 908-963-4032 </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",JimFerrante

When I look at the profile, these folders do not have a corresponding .msf file, which I gather is the Thunderbird indexing file. I have tried exporting these folders separately, but that doesn't seem to work at all; no new profile seems to be created so nothing gets updated in Thunderbird. I have attached a screen shot and can provide others as required. I am a volunteer for Balance &amp; Dizziness Canada and some of the folders I need to export to Thunderbird have a lot of emails and are important for me to have available to refer back to. Many thanks for any help you can provide. </p><p>- Andrea Wilson, Webmaster, Balance &amp; Dizziness Canada <a href=""https://balanceanddizziness.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://balanceanddizziness.org</a> </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",ablewebs
