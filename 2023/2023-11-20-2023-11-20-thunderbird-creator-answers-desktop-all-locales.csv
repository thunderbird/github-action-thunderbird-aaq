If I highlight multiple messages, it only deletes the most current message. It also shows the highlighted messages as being read, even though they were not opened? </p><p>Can somebody please call me and explain what is going on and how to fix this.  I am not good with computers and online help never works for me. I already tried that tonight and got nowhere. Chatting never fixes anything. I don't understand the things that are being said. I am a talk on the phone with a tech and work through the problem kinda person. </p><p>Thunderbird is definitely running slow - I don't know if that means anything. </p><p>Can somebody please help? </p><p>Jimmy [removed phone# from public support forum] </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",JimFerrante

When I look at the profile, these folders do not have a corresponding .msf file, which I gather is the Thunderbird indexing file. I have tried exporting these folders separately, but that doesn't seem to work at all; no new profile seems to be created so nothing gets updated in Thunderbird. I have attached a screen shot and can provide others as required. I am a volunteer for Balance &amp; Dizziness Canada and some of the folders I need to export to Thunderbird have a lot of emails and are important for me to have available to refer back to. Many thanks for any help you can provide. </p><p>- Andrea Wilson, Webmaster, Balance &amp; Dizziness Canada [removed site] </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",ablewebs

Have been using Mozilla for years on a Surface laptop (windows 11), Cyberpower desktop (windows 10), and Android Note 20.  I've downloaded Thunderbird and it is working fine.  Where can I find user training videos for Thundbird, especially archiving?  Are there other ways besides on-line gifting in which I can contribute to the research that makes Mozilla and Thunderbird possible?

Quando scrivo una mail e allego un pdf, se ci clicco sopra mi da l'errore che allego in foto. L'errore non succede se ricevo una mail con un pdf in allegato, quello si apre regolarmente con AdobeReader. Ovviamente su impostazioni è già impostato AdobeReader come default. Ho notato però che se metto come predefinito il ""anteprima in thunderbird"" lui si apre regolarmente. E' come se quando compongo una mail lui non riconosce il lettore pdf predefinito.

How do I get rid of the extra Drafts and Sent folders?  See the image below.  The second and third are empty. </p><p>Yes&nbsp;:) there is more to it.  Here are the details.  I know how they got there and I did that to myself.  I keep my Thunderbird Profile Data in a MS OneDrive shared folder.  Yes, I know, this has some risk.  However I work overseas 1/2 the time and use two different computers.  This allows me to have each computer on a POP account and still have one set of data (and have Pop Accounts on my phones).  I have been doing this for more than a year, and have not had any consequences beyond the above.  I understand IMAP accounts, but do not use them for very good reasons, please do not recommend that. </p><p>I am generally careful to close T-Bird and then wait for OneDrive to update (I have learned how to ""force"" OneDrive to do so) before restarting the other one.  There have been several occasions where I did not do that.  Usually, I just get a bunch of repeated emails and some extra ""computer named"" versions of the data files.   Once in a while, another folder Drafts and Sent folder has appeared. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Derrick9
