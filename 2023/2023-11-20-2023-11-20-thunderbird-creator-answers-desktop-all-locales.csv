Everything works well except for one minor irritation that might be just a setting - but I can't find it! The mail is set to show in ascending date order and is unthreaded and in table format, if I scroll to the most recent mail at the bottom of the list it displays fine. However, I have 11 mailboxes and if I switch between them, although the mail is still in ascending order, the mail selected is not the last on the list, in fact it could be hundreds of emails earlier than the last one.  I have set each mailbox to show in ascending order and there are no extensions installed.  Having to scroll to the end of each mailbox as I switch between them every time is a time waster.  Just a guess, is there an index to the selected position in the table that isn't being preserved as mailboxes are switched?  It would be nice if the most recently received mail was always selected when the mailbox is opened. </p><p>Brian. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,thunderbird,tips-and-tricks,en-US,"",brian310

When I look at the profile, these folders do not have a corresponding .msf file, which I gather is the Thunderbird indexing file. I have tried exporting these folders separately, but that doesn't seem to work at all; no new profile seems to be created so nothing gets updated in Thunderbird. I have attached a screen shot and can provide others as required. I am a volunteer for Balance &amp; Dizziness Canada and some of the folders I need to export to Thunderbird have a lot of emails and are important for me to have available to refer back to.

L'errore non succede se ricevo una mail con un pdf in allegato, quello si apre regolarmente con AdobeReader. Ovviamente su impostazioni è già impostato AdobeReader come default. Ho notato però che se metto come predefinito il ""anteprima in thunderbird"" lui si apre regolarmente. E' come se quando compongo una mail lui non riconosce il lettore pdf predefinito.

How do I get rid of the extra Drafts and Sent folders?  See the image below.  The second and third are empty. </p><p>Yes&nbsp;:) there is more to it.  Here are the details.  I know how they got there and I did that to myself.  I keep my Thunderbird Profile Data in a MS OneDrive shared folder.  Yes, I know, this has some risk.  However I work overseas 1/2 the time and use two different computers.  This allows me to have each computer on a POP account and still have one set of data (and have Pop Accounts on my phones).  I have been doing this for more than a year, and have not had any consequences beyond the above.  I understand IMAP accounts, but do not use them for very good reasons, please do not recommend that. </p><p>I am generally careful to close T-Bird and then wait for OneDrive to update (I have learned how to ""force"" OneDrive to do so) before restarting the other one.  There have been several occasions where I did not do that.  Usually, I just get a bunch of repeated emails and some extra ""computer named"" versions of the data files.   Once in a while, another folder Drafts and Sent folder has appeared. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Derrick9

I did this by right clicking the folder and selecting 'Move to' and selecting the destination folder in Local Folders.  The emails appeared to move successfully. </p><p>About a minute after doing this I received two emails from Mimecast saying 'your message couldn't be delivered'.  The receipient email it shows is not one I have a record of previously sending to.  The email headers show the email appears to have been generated on that day and time with no previous activity, suggesting it is a genuine incoming email. </p><p>I am worried that moving the folders of emails to local folders has somehow sent emails out to recipients.  Is this possible?  Are there logs within Thunderbird that I can check to see exactly what it did during the move process? Unfortunately there is nothing in the headers of the emails I received to suggest what was actually sent to the address. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",tward100

Have initialized 'Lightning' and 'Provider for Google' addons.  Existing calendars appear to be synced.  That is, I can add events in Thunderbird, and they are visible in my Google calendar (and visa versa). Wish to add a new calendar for birthdates using the 'Birthday Calendar' addon.  'Birthday Calendar' displays birthdates pulled from 'Address Book', and has the added desirable feature of calculating/including 'age'.  Thunderbird appears to be correctly retrieving birthdates from 'Address Book'.  However, these new birthdate calendar entries do not seem to be reflected in my Google calendar. I do not see an option (in Google) to add this calendar.  Can someone guide me through the process of connecting this new 'Birthday Calendar' with Google? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",Grizz952
