However having installed 31.8 when I try to import the pst files, I'm told that thunderbird can't find mail to import. There appears to be no option to browse for the files. My outlook files are in the usual folder - documents/outlook files but thunderbird can't find them. I'm trying to import historical emails and haven't set up an email account yet in thunderbird. Would it make a difference if I set up the account then tried to import old emails or would something elase make a difference. Any ideas would be very welcome. </pre> <p>Regards Steve </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1619058;1619526;,mist979797

So I've been working on recreating my feeds account and after a few times it's been working more reliably with my 200+ RSS feeds. But I've noticed the behavior of the RSS feeds only updating every 100 minutes or so per the new default.  </p><p>I did re-import my feeds after changing the account settings default of ""Check for every new messages"" to say every 10 minutes rather than every 100 minutes, but it didn't affect existing feeds or new feeds added after that point. </p><p>As a longtime Thunderbird fan it's been quite frustrating especially with long relying on the RSS feeds. Is there anyway to force-override how often all RSS feeds are updated? Or any guidance to where those individual settings are stored so I can find/replace the values all much more quickly than updating on a per-feed basis? </p><p>Thanks many, Michael </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1620328;,michael644

[was Serious UI problem with recent version  #1],"<p>115.4.2  macOS 13.6.1 Using Menu&gt;Edit&gt;Find&gt;Search Messages, it appears to be impossible to change the width of one result column without changing the width of all columns. </p><p>I want to widen the Date column so that I can see the full month name, the date, and the year. I click on the bar at the right of the Date field header and drag it to the right. All columns to the left are widened.  The Date column barely widens.   I click the side of the window and widen it. All columns widen (not a problem). Date widens a bit.  I try to widen it using the bar at the right of the field.  Same trouble. I widen the window to full width of the screen.  Same trouble. The names of months with shorter names show in full, but not, for example, 'November'. Still can't see date on some; can't see year or time on any. I move the window to the left so all columns are off the screen except Date, Total, and Location. I widen Data. Correspondents appears on the screen (I guess that all columns are being widened). I widen the window all the way to the right of the screen. Now Recipient and Correspondents show, very wide, mostly blank (when there is only one name); there is a very wide column to the left, all blank, the column name invisible off the screen to the left.  I can now see most Data data, but, for example, 'November 11, 2023, at 10:2'.  I push the window further to the left off the screen.  I now see Correspondents (mostly blank to the right of a single name (the one I searched for), Date, Total, and Location; I see the date and time in full. I can't see any column to the left of Correspondents; in particular, can't see Subject. I move the window all the way to the right edge of the screen again. Now I can see the ""blank column,"" Recipient, and Correspondents (mostly blank space), Date with all dates and times showing in full, Total always blank), and Location (short mailbox names, so all show in full. </p><p>Why was this design chosen by the project?
