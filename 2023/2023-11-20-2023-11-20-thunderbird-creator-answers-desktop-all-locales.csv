Everything works well except for one minor irritation that might be just a setting - but I can't find it! The mail is set to show in ascending date order and is unthreaded and in table format, if I scroll to the most recent mail at the bottom of the list it displays fine. However, I have 11 mailboxes and if I switch between them, although the mail is still in ascending order, the mail selected is not the last on the list, in fact it could be hundreds of emails earlier than the last one.  I have set each mailbox to show in ascending order and there are no extensions installed.  Having to scroll to the end of each mailbox as I switch between them every time is a time waster.  Just a guess, is there an index to the selected position in the table that isn't being preserved as mailboxes are switched?  It would be nice if the most recently received mail was always selected when the mailbox is opened. </p><p>Brian. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,thunderbird,tips-and-tricks,en-US,"",brian310

I fixed it with a new password and it would not receive and email.  I was using firefox.  This happened 5 or so weeks ago.  I do not want to lose a lot of folder with old emails and the address book.  Then I remembered today I used to have to use IE instead of firefox with ATT security.  I got a reset from ATT and it would not work in firefox so I used Chrome and I could reset the password finally.  Now I have to reset the Oauth password for Thunderbird  (thb).  I cannot find my directions.  That is the easy part.  With Zoho I do not know how to put in the password in thb for the ATT and my Zoho acct.  Plus I want to add a 3rd and 4th accnts. </p><p>Then I see you are having a lot of the passwords are not working and people cannot log into thb.  Something to the affect the around version 60 or thb the was passwords were done was changed and if you did not run that version then you would not have the change that it is not in other new versions.  So I got a mess with tbd and passwords and how to do things.  I do not see how you can do this in written form like this.  Help, please help. My phone is a land line and it is 850-983-7427.
