I opened TB on the new PC to find out that some of my subfolders (about a third) as well as all the e-mails inside have disappeared. I tried deleting the folder and re-transferring again but cannot see those missing folders and emails. Does anybody have any ideas on how to solve the issue? As I am using the account for work, I need to recover all those missing e-mails and subfolders. Many thanks in advance for your help. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",chouxsteph
