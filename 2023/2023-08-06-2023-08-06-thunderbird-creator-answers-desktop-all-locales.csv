I like its old good interface which it had till 2 version. Therefore, I want to continue using TB2 version or get involved into a TB2 Fork, in order to continue using the old good interface it has&nbsp;:) I'm using Debian Linux and to have TB2 I install it manually. Since Debian 9 two libraries have been removed libnspr4-0d and libnss3-1d. Therefore, I keep the last (old/deprecated) packages ""libnspr4_4.12-2_amd64.deb"", ""libnspr4-0d_4.12-2_amd64.deb"", ""libnss3_3.26-1+debu8u11_amd64.deb"" and ""libnss3-1d_3.26-1+debu8u11_amd64.deb"" so to install my favorite TB2 I must downgrade libnspr4 and libnss3. Who can I contact to get/build the new libnspr4-0d and libnss3-1d libraries which would allow to continue using TB2 without the need to decrease their parent packages libnspr4 and libnss3 to old versions (mentioned above)? Alternatively, I'm ready to get involved into making fork of TB2, to apply there all the missing improvements, but to allow having the old good interface which I like and would like to continue using. Or maybe there already is such a fork - then please let me know, where to find it and how to contact the responsible Developer/s. If needed I can describe in detail the whole procedure of my manual installation of TB2 @ Debian 12. Thanks in advance and kind regards~~Piotrek~~pe3no </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pe3no

I opened TB on the new PC to find out that some of my subfolders (about a third) as well as all the e-mails inside have disappeared. I tried deleting the folder and re-transferring again but cannot see those missing folders and emails. Does anybody have any ideas on how to solve the issue? As I am using the account for work, I need to recover all those missing e-mails and subfolders. Many thanks in advance for your help. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",chouxsteph
