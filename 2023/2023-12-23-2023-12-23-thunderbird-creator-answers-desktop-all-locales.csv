The OpenKeychain app required just can't import it. I need to use a Certificate that got signed by my company. So even if I generate a PGP pubkic key with open keychain I don't get how i would turn that into a CSR that I could send to the it Department. Has anyone else had the same issue? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",gaaartner
