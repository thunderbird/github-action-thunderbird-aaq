I have Thunderbird on my home based computer and wondered if there is any option to have it mobile with me when we travel? My email is through COX. That routes to Thunderbird. When we travel, I have to obtain my emails from COX's Webmail. I do not have access to Thunderbird and all previous emails that have already downloaded. Do you know if this is an option to make Thunderbird a mobile access through internet source?  Thank you!! Christina </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",christinayeakel

The Thunderbird extension site opens up a new *browser* tab *within* Thunderbird itself. Following this train of thought, why can't I open links in new tabs within Thunderbird itself? </p><p>Say I have an RSS feed link that links to another article. I click on that, and a whole new browser window opens up instead of staying within the Thunderbird application. Rather frustrating to see, considering how Thunderbird *is* capable of displaying web pages. </p><p>Supposedly, extensions like Link in Tab fix this. More power to you if you've gotten them to work, but it's useless for me. I've tried fiddling with about:config and the TB config editor, but neither one worked for me. Any other resources I've come across through search is either mildly outdated (i.e. 2019-2021) or horrifically outdated (i.e. 2008-2012). </p><p>Is this feature that I'm looking for completely nonexistent within Thunderbird itself, or am I just doing it wrong this whole time and I need someone to point out the obvious solution? I am desperately hoping for the latter, but my intuition is telling me it's the former. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",hardened.reservist
