I have Thunderbird on my home based computer and wondered if there is any option to have it mobile with me when we travel? My email is through COX. That routes to Thunderbird.

Do you know if this is an option to make Thunderbird a mobile access through internet source?  Thank you!! Christina </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",christinayeakel
