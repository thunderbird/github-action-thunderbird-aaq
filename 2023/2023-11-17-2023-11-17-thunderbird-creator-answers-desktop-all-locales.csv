That is very confusing because all the time you are not sure who's tag is selected or even more problematic that you untag someone who was already tagged. Before if someone tagged e-mail message, the tag was synced in next second, nevertheless at which e-mail were you standing.

Or would I have to start all over again with making folders?  Because I'm getting really sick of sending everything out on my web mail?  I have e-mailed you before about fixing this, and I have several web sites that describe how to do it, but none of the methods are working.  So I thought today about uninstalling and reinstalling?  Or wouldn't that work?  Thank you. This is what is happening.  I can get the e-mail's in my computer, but the outgoing always hangs up?  So I have to use my web mail to send out messages, but I can receive them? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1618507;1618638;1628028;,gsdix

All my emails in my Inbox disappeared this evening when I wasn't at my laptop (I was in the room so I know no one else touched it). I repaired the folder which just brought back spam/deleted emails. Then I deleted the SQLITE folder and re-stared TBird but still just got the junk and no sign of my vital saved emails. I searched the Trash and they are not in there. I'm in a bit of a panic as there are about 30 emails that are absolutely vital to my business and I have to deal with them ... if I can find them!

I can't locate the setup and settings for my printer(s); that is, I cannot select the printer, specify single- or double-sided printing, print quality, etc.  Under the Config Editor, I can see more than a dozen settings for my default HP Inkjet printer, but Thunderbird must have set all this up for me; I have no idea what most of the listings pertain to, and no other printer, like my PDF printer, show up there.  I'm used to a Print Preview screen where the printer and its parameters can be set, but when I do a Ctrl+P, Thunderbird takes off and starts printing immediately on the default HP printer.  Can someone give me a clue?  Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,settings,en-US,1618511;1618516;1618574;,Electrojim
