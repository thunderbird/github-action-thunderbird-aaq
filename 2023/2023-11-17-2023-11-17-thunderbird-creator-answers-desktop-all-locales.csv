The Thunderbird extension site opens up a new *browser* tab *within* Thunderbird itself. Following this train of thought, why can't I open links in new tabs within Thunderbird itself? </p><p>Say I have an RSS feed link that links to another article. I click on that, and a whole new browser window opens up instead of staying within the Thunderbird application. Rather frustrating to see, considering how Thunderbird *is* capable of displaying web pages. </p><p>Supposedly, extensions like Link in Tab fix this. More power to you if you've gotten them to work, but it's useless for me. I've tried fiddling with about:config and the TB config editor, but neither one worked for me. Any other resources I've come across through search is either mildly outdated (i.e. 2019-2021) or horrifically outdated (i.e. 2008-2012). </p><p>Is this feature that I'm looking for completely nonexistent within Thunderbird itself, or am I just doing it wrong this whole time and I need someone to point out the obvious solution?
