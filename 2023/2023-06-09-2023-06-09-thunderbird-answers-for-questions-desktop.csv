When ""nothing happened,"" what happened was that Windows 10 took a picture of your whole screen at that moment, and saved it to the Clipboard. What you need to do then is find a graphics program on your computer and open it and PASTE that clipboard image into the program. The easiest graphics program to find is built in to Windows 10, and it's called Paint. Would you click the Start button and look through the menus you see, and see whether you can find Paint? It may be in Accessories. If so, double-click the name to open it and put your pointer in the open white space, and right-click your mouse and choose Paste.  </p><p>Wow!

Based on your suggestion and my findings, I went back into Outlook, grabbed one of the 111 problem files, and looked at the source: Even though the Subject and date stamp are shown correctly, the source is WRONG!!!!

I think I know: Since I've been sending this series to the same several people, I have created each new message by opening the previous message and selecting ""Resend"". I'm guessing that Outlook sees all the 111 messages as the same message repeated.

Fixing the data: I was able to save the errant messages to an MBOX file, edit that file, and re-import. This gave me a new/separate folder with the corrected messages.

I should be able to move these messages back to the correct folder and then delete the errant messages. </p><p>I've been able to use Outlook to show the messages with the correct Subjects and Timestamps, and match the Body to relabel the already-imported messages. </p><p>2. How TB handles my shortcut: Just as I was doing in Outlook, I opened a previous message, did [rt click] &gt; Edit as a new message, and created a new message from the old.
