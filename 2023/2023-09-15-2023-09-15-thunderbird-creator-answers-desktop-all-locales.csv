Then I either left-click and drag the messages to another folder, or right-click and Move To a different folder.  Initially, all the messages disappear from my Inbox, giving the appearance that they all have moved to the folder, but one by one, many of the messages reappear in Inbox. </p><p>The folder is not a local folder--It's a folder on the server.  It seems that the number of messages that successfully move is limited to about 200 messages, but it varies.  For example, I selected and moved 211 messages, but when they finished moving, 17 messages returned to the Inbox.  The messages that returned are not in the folder that I moved the messages to -- They either didn't move, or they moved and then returned to Inbox. </p><p>I'm using Thunderbird 115.1.1 with an IMAP Yahoo mail account. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1603820;,drkaden
