You have not closed the welcome to Thunderbird please give at the door tab that new installs invariably have.  This is just a matter of closing the tab. </p><p>2. You are seeing the standard welcome page that includes support links and donation requests in the reading pane (the part of the window that displayed the body of emails).  Clicking on an email in the list will replace that with the content of the selected email. </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I am guessing you have an antivirus program scanning mail as it is downloaded as well? Disable the email scanner and see if the issue suddenly fixes itself.  That is the most likely. </p><p>Next is actual file scanning.  Antivirus programs are in the habit of scanning the file system when files are opened.  Unfortunately Thunderbird does not hang around waiting for hem to finish.  If the file is not available it gets by without it.  The result for POP mail accounts that leave mail on the server is that at times the updated status of what has been downloaded is not saved in the popstate.dat file in the accounts folder in Thunderbird's profile. The result is,  the old information is what is available when the next fetch occurs.  Hence duplicate emails because the downloads are not logged.  This time you need to exclude the Thunderbird profile folder from on access scanning in the antivirus program. </p><p>Let me know how it goes. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Blocking port 25 for domestic customers also forces commercial customers to pay for the business product to host their own mail servers. </p><p>So is the mail server you are attempting to connect to provided by your ISP and they tell you to connect on port 25?  If not who is the ISP? </p><p>What is the source of the message?  I just edited an SMTP entry in my version of Thundbird 115 to use port 25.  It was happy to do so.  No message no mess no fuss.  The vague error you mention sounds like a server refusing to connect on port 25.   Or perhaps some sort of third party software blocking outgoing connections on port 25 (something third party antivirus product do frequently) </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0
