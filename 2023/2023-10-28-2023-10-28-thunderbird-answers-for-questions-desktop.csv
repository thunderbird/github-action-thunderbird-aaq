Blocking port 25 for domestic customers also forces commercial customers to pay for the business product to host their own mail servers. </p><p>So is the mail server you are attempting to connect to provided by your ISP and they tell you to connect on port 25?  If not who is the ISP? </p><p>What is the source of the message?  I just edited an SMTP entry in my version of Thundbird 115 to use port 25.  It was happy to do so.  No message no mess no fuss.  The vague error you mention sounds like a server refusing to connect on port 25.   Or perhaps some sort of third party software blocking outgoing connections on port 25 (something third party antivirus product do frequently) </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0
