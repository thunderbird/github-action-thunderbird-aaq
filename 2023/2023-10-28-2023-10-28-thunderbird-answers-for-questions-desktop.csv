I agree the new format looks different and I fully concur that the need for CSS to restore the prior view is a strong signal that this could have been done better. I discourage reverting to prior versions because they are at end-of-life. The new release does have its challenges, but most who stay the course eventually get it set as desired. I was one of those who struggled as well. However, what you requested was the prior version.

Unfortunately Thunderbird does not hang around waiting for hem to finish.  If the file is not available it gets by without it.  The result for POP mail accounts that leave mail on the server is that at times the updated status of what has been downloaded is not saved in the popstate.dat file in the accounts folder in Thunderbird's profile. The result is,  the old information is what is available when the next fetch occurs.  Hence duplicate emails because the downloads are not logged.

Blocking port 25 for domestic customers also forces commercial customers to pay for the business product to host their own mail servers. </p><p>So is the mail server you are attempting to connect to provided by your ISP and they tell you to connect on port 25?  If not who is the ISP? </p><p>What is the source of the message?  I just edited an SMTP entry in my version of Thundbird 115 to use port 25.  It was happy to do so.  No message no mess no fuss.  The vague error you mention sounds like a server refusing to connect on port 25.   Or perhaps some sort of third party software blocking outgoing connections on port 25 (something third party antivirus product do frequently) </p>,MattAuSupport,false,0,0

The third party outfit is called ""The Messaging Company"" and uses the same login details as the old westnet webmail, it also looks exactly the same once logged in. My problem is that Thunderbird doesn't even seem to attempt logging in, the bar at the bottom of the Thunderbird program that tells you if you are online or offline and login progress does not show any attempt by the program to login, it would say ""connecting to account ****"" and if it tried and failed you would get a failed to connect notification, but there is nothing. I use avast anti virus  and malwarebytes could that have become a problem </p>",brett.christoffel,false,0,0
