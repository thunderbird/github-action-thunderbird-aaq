IMAP is not a file system and moving more than a few mails between accounts is almost always going to fail in some way.  You are lucky,  it just goes slow.  Most people end up with lost mail, corrupt mail or just unexplained connection dropouts because their mail server is busy in the background with other things don't work like getting new mail. </p><p>The process itself is top heavy with each mail to be moved checked with the server to ensure it is the latest copy.  This is slow enough,  but most folk then have an antivirus program scanning each and every one of those downloads to make sure it has not virus. </p><p>Then the process is repeated to upload the same mail and it is again scanned to make sure things go slowly. </p><p>Additionally recent releases of Thunderbird have gone from asking for the 100 selected mails to be processed in a single trip to asking for each being processed to completion individually as far to much mail was being lost in the bulk updates with quiet but fatal timeouts and cache failures etc, individual errors were oft times just not reported. So Thunderbird is now more exact and more reliable,  but also slower in performing the action.  This is not really considered a big deal as moving more that a couple of emails from account to account is also a fairly rare event,  except for those trying to update an account from one provider to another without using server side tools.  Those folk are also rarely long term users,  often downloading the application transferring their mail and then removing it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Outlook, for example, moves dozens of messages between accounts without issue, and in a reasonable timeframe. Regardless of the specific comparison, to say that the occurrence of this action is not common and to discount the essentially crippling behaviour of Thunderbird for this activity does not serve the Thunderbird cause well. If other clients can do this reasonably well, so should Thunderbird. As a Software Engineer, I understand how such things may be challenging, but they are solvable if one is inclined to take the problem seriously and be thorough in analysis and resolution with performance a key component of the solution. I urge the Thunderbird developers to address this specifically and make it as efficient as it can be. Thanks. </p>",jeronymite,false,0,0
