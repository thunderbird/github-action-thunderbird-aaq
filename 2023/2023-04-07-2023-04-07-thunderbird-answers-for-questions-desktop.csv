If you use ""Tools -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Server Settings -&gt; Leave message on server"" to keep a copy of the original message on the POP server after Thunderbird checks for new mail (so that you can still access it via webmail),  then you should set the number of days it should keep the copy. </p><p><br> Greetings Firefox volunteer. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

You do not want any Anti-Virus messing about with any of the emails that get downloaded nor any of the files that store emails.  Do not scan incoming or outgoing mail and do not allow Anti-Virus to auto fix anything. In addition I suggest you do not allow it to scan any Thunderbird profile folder or it's contents as it can play havoc with files that store emails. </p><p><strong>Firewall - </strong> Thunderbird program should be set up as an allowed program otherwise it can be awkward about allowing access to internet. </p><p>Advise you never only rely on whatever is held on server because it is only one copy.

That may be part of your problem, as Thunderbird does 'housekeeping' at the beginning of each series.

In order for passwords to work in Thunderbird, I should uninstall the version I have, then research how many ""series"" there are, then download these old versions, then upgrade progressively to the latest version. And maybe this will work? Note that I have already upgraded, so there is no way to tell what remains of the original versions or what files are causing the problem (I already deleted all the common culprits that are recommended to eliminate). I realize this is an open source software, built on the backs of volunteers, but this method seems like a sure-fire way to eliminate old users. There must be a simpler way to use passwords. </p><p>Any other suggestions? </p>",0072,false,0,0

Over the years, Thunderbird makes changes and has code in place during the early stages of a release. By not keeping up, you can end up with a cumbersome upgrade approach. Depending on how many accounts you have, installing fresh might be a good option. But there are some excellent technical experts on this forum and if one of them sees this thread, they may have other options. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I do have 54 email accounts currently, and maybe 600,000 messages; with the sorting rules, starting over is a little tedious. Looks like I will have to do this one way or another. Not being a pro or anything, I am thinking that something in this version is linking to something in an old version, and that must be the problem. The other 100 threads on this subject suggested to delete 4 or 5 files (pkes11.txt, cert9.db, kg4.db, session.json), plus all older derivatives; in addition to reset the master /principle password; in addition to install the new version of the software. Obviously none of these worked. I suppose if I read a couple million lines of the code I could figure this out. Just hoping I get lucky and someone knows how to make passwords work. I am not even sure it is because I upgraded - all I actually know is that it does not work.  Again, thank you for the suggestion. </p>",0072,false,0,0
