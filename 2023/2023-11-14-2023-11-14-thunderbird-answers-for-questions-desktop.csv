I went into File &gt; Get New Messages for &gt; and the account was listed there... When I selected it TB <em><strong>DID</strong></em> now ask me for the Password and when I entered it (and ticked the ""Store"" it in Saved Passwords box), TB fetched the unread mails from the server and the account now appears in the Saved Passwords list with a pop3 entry too! TB now seems to be checking that server again now too when I click the ""Get Messages"" button. (However, this does seem to indicate some kind of flaw in the program that the Developers might wish to address here?) </p><p><strong>Edit: *</strong>solved"" was the wrong choice of word here, I should have said ""fixed"" or ""sorted"" as I still have absolutely no idea of <em><strong>why</strong></em> TB was behaving in this fashion! If anyone <em><strong>can</strong></em> explain it (or, even better, fix the program's code) then it might be a good idea to post an explanation in this thread for the benefit of future inquirers. </p><p>It would appear that, in the first instance, TB just lost the entry (in Saved Passwords) for what was my Default Account so (completely unknown to me, for some considerable time) I wasn't getting any of my mail to that account downloaded by TB. </p><p>My ""fix"" (above) seems to have sorted the problem but surely TB should ASK me for a password (if it's missing) when downloading messages from all accounts rather than just 'ignoring' that account and pressing on with the rest? </p><p>That definitely seems to me like a bug in the code that needs addressing in the next update? </p>",wb.cameron,false,0,0

And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency.  </p><p>NOTE: TB uses pixels, not points. If your font is very small, you may want to start with size 20 and then adjust. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

I have recommended Thunderbird to many who are not at all tech-confident (including my mother!) and I doubt they would be able to make the adjustments. I hope a future update can address this. </p>",dxaxhill,false,0,0
