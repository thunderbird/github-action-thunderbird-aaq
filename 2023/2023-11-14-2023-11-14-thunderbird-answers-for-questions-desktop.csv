And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency.  </p><p>NOTE: TB uses pixels, not points. If your font is very small, you may want to start with size 20 and then adjust. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Many email providers are getting tight on security and that is one of the tests to prevent spam. This usually happens when a person has several email accounts, yet uses the same SMTP server for all of them. You can fix this by going to account settings pane and scrolling down left side until you see 'Outgoing Servers SMTP' and then list the entries. There must be one for each email account and each one must have a matching email id to the account. You should also check to see if you are using any authentication such as password. For example, if you have three gmail accounts, you need three gmail SMTP servers, one for each email address. A simple way to keep track of them is to fill in the 'Description' field with unique indentifier for each one. Then, when looking at account settings pane, it will be easy to verify that you have set the right smtp server. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
