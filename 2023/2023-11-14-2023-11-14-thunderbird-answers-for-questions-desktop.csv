When I selected it TB DID now ask me for the Password and when I entered it (and ticked the ""Store"" it in Saved Passwords box) TB fetched the unread mails from the server and the account now appears in the Saved Passwords list with a pop3 entry too! TB now seems to be checking that server again now too when I click the ""Get Messages"" button. (However, there does seem to be some kind of flaw in the program that the Developers might wish to address here?) </p>",wb.cameron,false,0,0
