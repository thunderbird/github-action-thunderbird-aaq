And I attached examples of my own setting of Calibri 14 as my default.  Here goes: </p> <pre>- in Tools&gt;settings&gt;general, set your default font.  - then click the advanced button. Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent. This does not protect you from someone sending you a message in some god-awful font with 30 pt size, but this does provide consistency.  </p><p>NOTE: TB uses pixels, not points. If your font is very small, you may want to start with size 20 and then adjust. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Many email providers are getting tight on security and that is one of the tests to prevent spam. This usually happens when a person has several email accounts, yet uses the same SMTP server for all of them. You can fix this by going to account settings pane and scrolling down left side until you see 'Outgoing Servers SMTP' and then list the entries. There must be one for each email account and each one must have a matching email id to the account. You should also check to see if you are using any authentication such as password. For example, if you have three gmail accounts, you need three gmail SMTP servers, one for each email address. A simple way to keep track of them is to fill in the 'Description' field with unique indentifier for each one. Then, when looking at account settings pane, it will be easy to verify that you have set the right smtp server. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The FROM line is wheeler@wi.rr.com and the SMTP server is <a href=""http://Smtp-server.wi.rr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Smtp-server.wi.rr.com</a> and the user name, when you click on edit under SMTP server, is wheeler. There isn't anywhere to enter an email address under the edit menu.  When I click on account settings Outgoing Servers SMTP' there isn't a list of anything.  It just lists default.  My wife is getting the same error message when she tries to send emails on her computer.  Her computer, like mine, only has her email address configured in Thunderbird.  I see under SMTP server there is a button that says ""add"".  I can add the other email addresses, but I do not know how to add additional SMTP servers. Thanks! Eric </p>",zzolson,false,0,0

Check your SMTP server settings to ensure it shows the full email address in user name field and is using authentication and connection security.

It is a quality email mailing firm and the free account allows 1,000 per month. Your client appears to send just 40 per month, so should be easy. The side benefit is that the account also shows who is reading the report and who isn't. This also lets the administrator update mailing addresslist when people leave. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
