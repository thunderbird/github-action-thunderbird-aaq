I went into File &gt; Get New Messages for &gt; and the account was listed there... When I selected it TB <em><strong>DID</strong></em> now ask me for the Password and when I entered it (and ticked the ""Store"" it in Saved Passwords box), TB fetched the unread mails from the server and the account now appears in the Saved Passwords list with a pop3 entry too! TB now seems to be checking that server again now too when I click the ""Get Messages"" button. (However, this does seem to indicate some kind of flaw in the program that the Developers might wish to address here?) </p><p><strong>Edit: *</strong>solved"" was the wrong choice of word here, I should have said ""fixed"" or ""sorted"" as I still have absolutely no idea of <em><strong>why</strong></em> TB was behaving in this fashion! If anyone <em><strong>can</strong></em> explain it (or, even better, fix the program's code) then it might be a good idea to post an explanation in this thread for the benefit of future inquirers. </p><p>It would appear that, in the first instance, TB just lost the entry (in Saved Passwords) for what was my Default Account so (completely unknown to me, for some considerable time) I wasn't getting any of my mail to that account downloaded by TB. </p><p>My ""fix"" (above) seems to have sorted the problem but surely TB should ASK me for a password (if it's missing) when downloading messages from all accounts rather than just 'ignoring' that account and pressing on with the rest? </p><p>That definitely seems to me like a bug in the code that needs addressing in the next update? </p>",wb.cameron,false,0,0
