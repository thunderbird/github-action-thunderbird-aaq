I have never actually seen it running and was not aware it had any icon for the taskbar.  But I can see it reverting settings to those chosen during setup.  Although I might be a bug if it is removing things,  lets look for a quick fix. </p><p>When Thunderbird initially installs there is an option to have a desktop and or a task bar icon.  I am guessing you chose not to have the taskbar icon.  Try reinstalling from <a href=""http://Thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Thunderbird.net</a> and make sure the options for icons are set as you want.  Nothing should change except your icons hopefully will no longer be wandering. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If true, then the update may have lost your profile. My suggestion to pursue that would be to click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles'. That takes you to a pane showing available profiles. One of them may be your profile prior to the upgrade. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
