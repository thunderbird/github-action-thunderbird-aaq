If true, then the update may have lost your profile. My suggestion to pursue that would be to click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles'. That takes you to a pane showing available profiles. One of them may be your profile prior to the upgrade. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have not.  My AOL password works on other devices.  I think the problem has more to do with the configuration Thunderbird is giving me.  Using my desired email address as example@verizon.net  , Thunderbird is using the following: Incoming  POP3  SSL/TLS </p><pre>  <a href=""http://pop.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.verizon.net</a> </pre> <p>Outgoing  SMPT  SSL/TLS </p><pre>  <a href=""http://smpt.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smpt.verizon.net</a> </pre> <p>Username </p><pre>  example </pre> <p>I believe when AOL took over the Verizon emails, the POP server became <a href=""http://pop.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.aol.com</a> and the SMPT server became  <a href=""http://smpt.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smpt.aol.com</a>       Also, I've seen posts that say the username should be example@verizon.net  Instead of just example.  I've tried all the above combinations and none has worked.  Thanks for your help. </p>",wmattiace,false,0,0
