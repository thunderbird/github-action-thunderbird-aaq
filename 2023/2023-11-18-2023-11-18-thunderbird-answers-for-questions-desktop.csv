I have not.  My AOL password works on other devices.  I think the problem has more to do with the configuration Thunderbird is giving me.  Using my desired email address as example@verizon.net  , Thunderbird is using the following: Incoming  POP3  SSL/TLS </p><pre>  <a href=""http://pop.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.verizon.net</a> </pre> <p>Outgoing  SMPT  SSL/TLS </p><pre>  <a href=""http://smpt.verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smpt.verizon.net</a> </pre> <p>Username </p><pre>  example </pre> <p>I believe when AOL took over the Verizon emails, the POP server became <a href=""http://pop.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.aol.com</a> and the SMPT server became  <a href=""http://smpt.aol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smpt.aol.com</a>       Also, I've seen posts that say the username should be example@verizon.net  Instead of just example.
