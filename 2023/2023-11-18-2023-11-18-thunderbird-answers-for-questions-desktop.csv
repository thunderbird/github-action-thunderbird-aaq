I have never actually seen it running and was not aware it had any icon for the taskbar.  But I can see it reverting settings to those chosen during setup.  Although I might be a bug if it is removing things,  lets look for a quick fix. </p><p>When Thunderbird initially installs there is an option to have a desktop and or a task bar icon.  I am guessing you chose not to have the taskbar icon.  Try reinstalling from <a href=""http://Thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Thunderbird.net</a> and make sure the options for icons are set as you want.  Nothing should change except your icons hopefully will no longer be wandering. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

If true, then the update may have lost your profile. My suggestion to pursue that would be to click help&gt;troubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profiles' and click 'about:profiles'. That takes you to a pane showing available profiles. One of them may be your profile prior to the upgrade. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

That is set at the icon to the right of the 'new message' button. With unified folders, you can have just the inbox showing when that is all you want to see. If the message list pane shows the messages sorted to show newest at bottom, you can change that in table view' at the icon to the right of 'quick filter' </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
