We backed up the emails using Google's Takeout, which means now we have mbox files. I am the only one who is using Thunderbird (TB) in the company, so I have all the previous emails and my customizations and tags. However, the transition to 365 came with a fresh inbox, and now we are struggling to restore the emails using Outlook (emails come, but not fully). </p><p>My question is that can I migrate/ restore/ copy the previous inbox and add it to the 365 account inbox, which now has a few new emails since the beginning of April? I have both the .mbox file backup and my previous inbox from the same domain which is still on TB (I had to mess up the account settings for the previous one by deleting/altering some information in the server settings of that account to be able to add the new 365 account). </p><p>I saw on youtube that you can simply copy by dragging (select all and copy) the emails from the old account on  TB and dag them to the new one. This works but what about the ""Sent"" folder? does this mean emails will be duplicated? and what about the other people in my company who did not use TB and don't already have all their files from the old account on it? What is the best way? </p><p>I tried right clicking on the 365 account and using the ImportExportTools NG add-on to import mbox file option a message appeared ""impossibile to import in this folder (imap or newsgroup type)"". </p><p>Sorry for the lengthy query. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",mehran2

I usually end the task to kill it because when I open TB later I usually experience problems because TB hadn't closed cleanly the last time. I have used TB for years and this is a new wrinkle. The only 'add-on' I use is Theme. This problem occurs with TB release, TB beta, and TB nightly. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,"",SmiffTech

I have TB version 102.9.0 (64-bit).  I have sadly lost loads of message filters I had in TB before my machine died so I'm starting to rebuild them but, apart from the location of the menu that has message filters (I preferred the old location but I have a fair sized screen) I have a serious problem: the message filter dialogue pops up fast if invoked from the menu or from right clicking on an Email address and selecting the make filter option.  I can change things like ""any/all"" and the location (e.g. ""subject"", ""to"" ...) but when I go to select the destination folder things get unusable: as soon as it thinks I want recent, or any other root option the next step seems to hang.  It's not a fatal hang though it doesn't seem to respond to the mouse but it does respond to the escape key but that just backs me back to the selection of destination folders and again it's the same: no progress in minutes.  Only other clue I can offer is that this wasn't true on my pre-machine-crash TB of about 10 days ago which I thought was up to date but this is clearly a different version of TB.  Anyone else seeing this?  Any ideas?  Should I log it as a bug? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1574881;,cpsyctc
