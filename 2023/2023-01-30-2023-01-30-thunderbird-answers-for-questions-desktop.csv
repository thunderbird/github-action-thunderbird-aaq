I worked with a fellow yesterday and his problem was some anti spam toolbar injected, not installed by his anti virus.

I didn't get very far as I downloaded your hyperlinks and tried to put info into add-ons but I get this message ((( add-ons cannot be installed account ((( NOT VERIFIED ))) that's as far as I could get. I am at a dead end at this point. I did try correcting the problem thru Thunderbird and finally got it to recognize that but doing so ran into the same problem add-on cannot be installed NOT VERIFIED. I am at a loss trying to get around  that problem. Question If I can't get this solved can I uninstall Thunderbird and reinstall Thunderbird without loosing my email folders?, also my wife is on Thunderbird under her own settings and if I would have to uninstall my Thunderbird would that interfere with all her Thunderbird folder emails and   as she doesn't have this problem even thou she is on my network so to speak. Right now she had no problem with Thunderbird. Thank You </p>",law2432,false,0,0

Fundamentally you are also using Firefox and it requires addons to be verified when installed.  Double clicking the XPI file will see it attempted to be installed in Firefox as both applications use the same file type for addons. </p><p>You could also open the addon manager,  click on the cog wheel thing and select install from a file.

They were  somehow trying to install it into the browser.  I can only assume they had mistakenly accessed 'Menu icon &gt; Addons &amp; Themes' in the Firefox browser - you are not installing it in the browser. You will get the error. </p><p>There are two methods - either is valid. One method requires you to click on the hyperlink which opens in a browser, download a file to computer and then in Thunderbird - in Addons and Themes &gt; Extensions - locate the file to get Thunderbird to install it. The other method is done entirely within Thunderbird and Thunderbird does the install. The images I previoulsy posted should help. The first image assists when using Method 1. The second through to fifth image helps with Method 2. The last image is used once addon is installed. </p><p>I'll provide a bit more information. </p><p><strong>Method 1</strong> </p> <ul><li> Clicked on the following link to go to the folderFlags addon: </li></ul> <p><a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/folderflags/</a> </p> <ul><li> Click on the 'Download Now' button, the folderFlags.xpi file gets downloaded to your computer.

You are just checking it has been downloaded, so you can proceed to the next step in Thunderbird. </p><p><strong>Now in Thunderbird.</strong> </p> <ul><li> Menu icon &gt; Addons &amp; Themes </li><li> Select 'Extensions' (it has the jigsaw icon) </li><li> click on the gear wheel icon and select 'Install addon from file' - this was shown in first image previously posted. </li><li> A window opens and you have to locate that 'Downloads' folder to see the downloaded xpi file. </li><li> Select the folderFlags.xpi file and click on Open. </li></ul> <p><strong>Method 2</strong> This method is done entirely within Thunderbird. You do NOT use the hyperlink I provided.  I supplied a series of images - starting with the second image previously sent. In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Menu icon &gt; Addons &amp; Themes </li><li> Select 'Extensions' (it has the jigsaw icon) </li><li> In top search type: 'folderFlags' and clickon the magnifying glass icon. </li></ul> <p>A new tab opens in Thunderbird and it will have a list of addon extensions. The tab visually does look very similar to the browser, but this is in a Thunderbird tab - not a Firefox tab. </p> <ul><li> You should see folderFlags is at the top of the list - click on 'Add to Thunderbird' </li><li> You will now get a couple of pop ups where you need to click on 'Add' abd 'OK' to get it installed automatically. </li></ul> <p>Back in the Addons &amp; Themes - 'Extensions' - you will now see 'folderFlags' in the list and it should be enabled. </p><p><br> Once folderFlags is installed in Thunderbird you perform the last step. - See last image in the group I previously posted. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
