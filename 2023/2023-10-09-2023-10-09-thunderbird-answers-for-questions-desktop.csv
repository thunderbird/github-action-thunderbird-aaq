But the unread message count for each folder has been in every release I have used since V2. </p><p>Just to check myself,  I did a google search and this image <a href=""https://www.actsofvolition.com/images/lunaforthunderbird.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.actsofvolition.com/images/lunaforthunderbird.png</a> dating from a blog posting in 2003 <a href=""https://actsofvolition.com/2003/09/lunabluetheme/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://actsofvolition.com/2003/09/lunabluetheme/</a> </p><p>The image shows unread message counts per folder.  The only change I can see is that the counts have moved from being on the left and in brackets to being in a column and having a button like appearance. </p><p>Whilst I am sure change can be obtained using CSS,  this forum is bound by this policy on userChrome. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/userchromecss-js-usercontent-unsupported"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/userchromecss-js-usercontent-unsupported</a>  As for user options,  you have already determined that they are not available, if they were they would be on that menu. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Or only pop? 2. For the pop accounts in Account Settings &gt; Server Settings &gt; Advanced  do you see the radio button in NOT as set in this screen shot, but rather on the second radio button ""Inbox for a different account""  3. Is the folder pane headings just above the top Inbox, does it show Unified Folders or All Folders?  (you will see either those exact words or nothing) - feel free to share a screen shot. </p>",wsmwk,false,0,0

You can force Thunderbird on an older version to use your new profile using command line switches when invoking Thunderbird,  but any data that was converted in the update will be lost,  not downgraded. </p><p>I suggest working to fix whatever you see as broken in the new version.  I was trying to answer your other questions but this popped up first.  Perhaps slow down a little because going back is not simple or convenient as you think. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
