This feature does not seem to work when address book synchronization with Google via CARDDAV is enabled. </p><p>I have it set up this way and Thunderbird still offers me email addresses I've never used as first. Is this a bug in my setup or a limitation of the program? Is there a workaround for this? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1572623;1572731;1573090;,jirinkosar

A friend came by and I was explaining what I did so we had a look at the Account Settings.  When I pulled up the SMTP settings I noticed that the Port selection had been changed back to 587.  I checked the other Gmail accounts and they too had reverted to 587.  Bear in mind, I had previously changed all the accounts SMTP ports to the default, 465.  Now, the question is, “How did the ports revert to 587.  587 is the port chosen when Thunderbird sets up a gmail account even though it shows the default as 465.
