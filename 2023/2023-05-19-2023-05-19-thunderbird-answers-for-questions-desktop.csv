In 'TB-Signature' folder, put all the images you may want to use in the signature, so it's easy and organised to keep it all together. </p><p>Then in Thunderbird click on Write and do this: </p> <ol><li> Completely clear absolutely everything so it is totally blank.

Your signature is correctly displayed and it seems you used a table to help with controlling the various parts of the signature.

I will try to answer your excellent questions with the below summation. I installed an old saved version Ver 52.8.0 of Thunderbird on new Laptop and started Thunderbird, choosing to later create Email account data. Stayed in long enough to set few things including Auto Update to OFF and then exited (didn't want any surprises right now).  In a file manager I looked at the newly created folders and files in the TBird install. It did have a Profile with some files in the Profile root folder. But did not yet have a Mail folder. </p><p>I then (in file manager) copied the all the contents of my Postbox 3.x Profile (the Profile root folder files and Mail Folder, did not include minidumps) to the new created Thunderbird Profile overwriting everything with same name. (Postbox has similar mbox, msf file formats) </p><p>Then restarted Thunderbird and Popup came up saying migration updating or something like that. When it was done all my old Postbox email folders and email where there and all my account settings also came up good. I did not have to setup any new account or even give a login password. Everything came over as it was in my old Postbox profile.  I looked in TBird Options, Advanced, Update    it had a selection dot by Never check for updates (not recommended).  And in reference to this last sentence above, I need to make a correction to my original question wherein I said looking at new Acct settings that came with copied Postbox Profile it still had the box by Check for new messages at startup UNCHECKED. All my Mail and settings were there and functioning. That was my confused error of presentation, when I meant to type the Options-&gt;Never check for Updates. I apologize for my sloppiness therein. [ This is in fact the case since my old Postbox profile still has the [ ] Check for new messages at startup UNCHECKED, but that's not the same setting premise as software updates. I also leave this one unchecked since I like to choose when I download from server (not on startup). I'm still using my old Postbox to download from the Server until I decide on a new Email app. ] </p><p>But in any case everything came up the same in Thunderbird just fine. Because I wanted to check Thunderbird out a bit before I started taking stuff off the server with it.  So I must commend TBird on it's ability to absorb a moved Profile since that is important to be able to copy one's past Emails to a New app. </p><p>The only thing I'm curious of here is why it updated to ver 60.9.1 (32bit).  Again I realize updates are sometimes inevitable but I like to be able to decide on my own when that it is with any app or Windows itself. </p>",RB2124,false,0,0

At this point I will keep using Postbox and maybe even install the newer version of it. I own a lifetime Update  license to Postbox but just preferred the older version interface better.
