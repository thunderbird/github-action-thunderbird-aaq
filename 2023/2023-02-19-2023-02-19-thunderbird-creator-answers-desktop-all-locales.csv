That will force Thunderbird to create .thunderbird </p><p>2) You overwrite the created .thunderbird with your backup. </p><p>That is it. Thunderbird is restored. </p><p>There is hopefully just a 'small' thing missing about the versions. </p><p>I believe it is best if the Thunderbird version I restore to is the same or a newer version than the one the backup comes from. However a version that new can be hard to find in a main repo and sometimes it seems to go well in spite of the backup is coming from a newer version. </p><p>So my question is when it will go well and when not.? </p><p>Do we have a list somewhere so we can see how much older versions we can restore to from what and still be completely sure that it will do no damage to the mail database.? Will Thunderbird come up with a warning or reject the database if it is too new to be handled 100% safely.? Or how can I know for sure.? </p><p>I am trying to make a strict and bulletproof procedure so if you see something else missing or wrong please give me a hint. </p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;:-) </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1567229;1567503;1569515;,Jakob77

I will attach X number of pictures in an email on my phone and send them to myself.  I then access that email from Thunderbird.

I will right click the first one, choose ""Save Image As.."" and navigate to C:\Temp and save the file with a file name of my choosing.  I go back the Thunderbird and right click on the second image and select ""Save Image As.."".  Instead of it defaulting to C:\Temp, it takes be back to Desktop as my save-to location and not C:\Temp.  When I have a message with 5 or more files, this gets to be somewhat cumbersome and time consuming, especially when I am navigating to my Data hard drive and selecting a folder 3-4 levels down. </p><p>In Thunderbird, in Tools &gt; Settings, I see the settings for ""Files and Attachments"".
