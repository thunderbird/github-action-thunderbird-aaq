This uses a self-created certificate. Until now, TB always asked me if I wanted to accept this. This question is now omitted when I want to connect to a newly installed Dovecot server on a Raspi 4 with Debian 12. Since the Evolution Email program connects to the server, I assume that the configuration of the Dovecot server is ok.

Ya se que de momento no es posible pero me parece interesante. La utilidad (grande) creo que es evidente, gestionar cualquier asunto desde un único lugar (ThunderBird) ya que cualquier asunto tiene ficheros y comunicaciones y hoy por hoy hay que guardarlos por separado. Saludos cordiales, Josu </p><p>Hello, In Windows Explorer I have a tree structure that has an almost identical parallel in ThunderBird as can be seen in the attachment and my question is: could Windows directories and folders be managed from ThunderBird? I know it's not possible at the moment but it seems interesting to me. I think the (great) utility is evident, managing any matter from a single place (ThunderBird) since any matter has files and communications and today they have to be saved separately.

Also, the ""&gt;"" sign is not prominent enough to indicate that there are more emails in the result resulting the most confusions on workplaces.

Probably 100 times per hour or more.  It says ""Trying to sign you in"".  Often I will receive an error message in the lower right-hand corner indicating ""Authentication failure when connecting to Microsoft365"".  Obviously they are related. Since I have the two email addresses that use 365, I'm not sure which one is generating the problem. I think it has something to do with the Oauth security but I have no idea how to deal with this.
