This uses a self-created certificate. Until now, TB always asked me if I wanted to accept this. This question is now omitted when I want to connect to a newly installed Dovecot server on a Raspi 4 with Debian 12. Since the Evolution Email program connects to the server, I assume that the configuration of the Dovecot server is ok. How can I solve the problem without having to give up Thunderbird? </p><p>Thank you </p><p>Werner Hofmann </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",werner102

La utilidad (grande) creo que es evidente, gestionar cualquier asunto desde un único lugar (ThunderBird) ya que cualquier asunto tiene ficheros y comunicaciones y hoy por hoy hay que guardarlos por separado.
