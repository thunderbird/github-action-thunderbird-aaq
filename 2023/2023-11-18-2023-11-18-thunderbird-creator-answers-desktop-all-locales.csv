What does updater do to the taskbar pinned icon that it won't work until I remove, replace it, and go back to work?? </p><p>Updater should NOTHING to do with any of my taskbar icons, let alone the one for Thunderbird.

This uses a self-created certificate. Until now, TB always asked me if I wanted to accept this. This question is now omitted when I want to connect to a newly installed Dovecot server on a Raspi 4 with Debian 12. Since the Evolution Email program connects to the server, I assume that the configuration of the Dovecot server is ok. How can I solve the problem without having to give up Thunderbird? </p><p>Thank you </p><p>Werner Hofmann </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",werner102

Ya se que de momento no es posible pero me parece interesante. La utilidad (grande) creo que es evidente, gestionar cualquier asunto desde un único lugar (ThunderBird) ya que cualquier asunto tiene ficheros y comunicaciones y hoy por hoy hay que guardarlos por separado. Saludos cordiales, Josu </p><p>Hello, In Windows Explorer I have a tree structure that has an almost identical parallel in ThunderBird as can be seen in the attachment and my question is: could Windows directories and folders be managed from ThunderBird? I know it's not possible at the moment but it seems interesting to me. I think the (great) utility is evident, managing any matter from a single place (ThunderBird) since any matter has files and communications and today they have to be saved separately. Kind regards, Josu </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,es,"",jesus22
