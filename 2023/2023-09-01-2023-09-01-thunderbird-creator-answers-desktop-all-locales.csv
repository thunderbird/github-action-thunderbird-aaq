I updated to whatever the very last release is before v115, and when I was reading the Release Notes it said no more patches would be made for that version, and recommended upgrading to v115.2.0. I upgraded and now two of my three Junk folders are missing. After checking my settings (both accounts in question are set to ""Move new junk messages to: Junk folder on &lt;INSERT_ACCOUNT_NAME&gt;"" and doing a bunch of Googling I have no explanation as to why they've disappeared. As a test, I marked a message as Junk on one of the impacted accounts and the message disappeared from my Inbox and was nowhere to be found (I then had to press CTRL-Z to get it to reappear in my Inbox). </p><p>How do I restore the two missing Junk folders please? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",reed7

Downloaded install program to match my up to date version on the original computer (102.15.0 (64bit) which reports it is up to date (on release update channel).  Local mail of 15+ years. Large collection.  Copied contents from the two profile folders into the new ones created on the install (one with times.json, the other all my local mail plus).  Searched site for matching version (102.15.0) to install.  Copied contents of orig profile files to the files created in app data on new computer. Both using Win10.  Started over several times, using restore, deleting app data and/or reinstalling windows. Made different copies of App Data.  The address books, calendar, tasks, came thorough.  But there is no local mail. Have not connected for new mail. Have migrated before.  Figured out how to use your new help system (complicated and not sure I am posting in the correct place).  Have been working on this for about 10 days.   Stumped.  Missing some bits of knowledge. Have not downloaded any new mail. Would appreciate some help or advice.   Thanks. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",Renders

It has my name, photo and a link to my Website.  This was done as a new TB message and saved as an HTML file.  It worked just fine on a couple of outgoing emails, but to see how it looked at the receiving end I sent it to myself on another TB account.  Going to that account's Inbox and opening the email, the signature looked great, but to test the link I clicked on the Web address.  It took me to my Website and, of course, the link in the email turned from blue to purple, as one would expect it to do.  Trouble is, when I repeated the test, the second receipt had the URL link purple already.  And, just looking at the HTML file the signature points to using Firefox, it's purple there too!  So how did the signature file get changed, how do I fix this?  I've unchecked the TB setup box that says 'remember sites I've visited,' thinking that might be the cause, but the URL is still purple.  Thanks for any tips. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1600988;,Electrojim
