In addition, the opening splash screen fails to load. And, worst of all, a few select web sites will no longer load from any browser I try. I am ALMOST certain that this happened after the update to Supernova. See attached screenshot Several Thunderbird threads seem to indicate that I should check that ""Application Experience"" should be checked, but I have no such service on my machine. any help appreciated!!! </p><p>Running Windows 10 Pro on a i7-6700 @4.00 Ghz, 32 gb RAM </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",ps34

It has my name, photo and a link to my Website.  This was done as a new TB message and saved as an HTML file.  It worked just fine on a couple of outgoing emails, but to see how it looked at the receiving end I sent it to myself on another TB account.  Going to that account's Inbox and opening the email, the signature looked great, but to test the link I clicked on the Web address.  It took me to my Website and, of course, the link in the email turned from blue to purple, as one would expect it to do.  Trouble is, when I repeated the test, the second receipt had the URL link purple already.  And, just looking at the HTML file the signature points to using Firefox, it's purple there too!  So how did the signature file get changed, how do I fix this?  I've unchecked the TB setup box that says 'remember sites I've visited,' thinking that might be the cause, but the URL is still purple.  Thanks for any tips. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1600988;,Electrojim
