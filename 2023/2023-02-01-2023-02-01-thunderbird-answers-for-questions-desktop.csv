That you lost addon is unfortunate,  I lost them as well, but seriously I have bigger fish to fry than loosing addons I liked.   </p><p>However as you simply do not mention what they are I can not offer alternatives.  Most of the truly useful addon that existed in the past have been recreated with new names, new authors and often new features in the past couple of years. </p> <blockquote> MAIN QUESTION How can I get rid of the ugly light-brown background in some incoming messages? All I want is a white background in incoming messages (both plain-text and HTML, unless the HTML code asks for a different background). </blockquote> <p>I don't play with apple products,  but in windows I see a white background when the theme used is ""light"" although more is done with apple I think to try and align with the operating system theme,  so you might want to look at whatever is set to that same colour in native apple programs. </p><p>This discussion talks about apple transparency changing the background depending on the background behind the windows <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/jmn0fq/dark_windows_change_their_color_from_grey_to/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/jmn0fq/dark_windows_change_their_color_from_grey_to/</a> </p><p>I would guess you're dealing with an apple ""feature"" and possibly the only emails you are seeing a white background on are the ones that specify it.  The rest get the inherited colour from the Apple OS </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Using the ""Light"" theme that comes with T-Bird as an option apparently solves the problem. Although when adding a theme, I've yet to see a way to delete themes from the list of themes installed other than perhaps, editing a json file somewhere. (Folks did respond and I following instructions, but a theme delete option has yet to appear anywhere in my UI. Such is not a really a problem, since I am unlikely to mess with themes in the future—the point of trying new themes was to solve the non-white background in messages where the background was not spec'd in the HTML code. </p>",jeffb4,false,0,0

What the server uses is irrelevant as only the maildrop is polled for mail which becomes the inbox once it is downloaded. There are no folders server side in a POP situation.  None at all.  Everything folder related is local to the local machine.  Simple as that.

Many mail server operators have spam filtering and in doing so some add words to the subject line like [SPAM],  others just drop the message and say nothing.  As your issue is related to a modified subject and a missing folder,  SPAM filtering server side is most unlikely. </p><p>3. You are using mailwasher.  Why I have no idea.  I have tried to justify installing it for the last 10 years since I first encountered it on this forum. Folk having issues getting their mail kept mentioning it.  But I really don't grasp it as having a purpose, and I really mean any purpose at all.  I can see how it creates another pointless step in fetching mail and deletes mail you have read online and determined to be spam.  But functionally I just don't understand why that is better done on something other than Thunderbird.  In using Thunderbird to manage spam I am also training it's junk filter to better recognize what I see as spam. </p><p>4. You are using Kaspersky.  Kaspersky Labs is a Russian multinational cybersecurity and anti-virus provider headquartered in Moscow, Russia.  Can you trust them?     Try running Thunderbird in Troubleshoot mode and continuing when prompted while you download another test.  This should block the kaspersky interface.  Still going somewhere but the inbox? </p><p>Have you tried ensuring these settings are disabled <a href=""https://support.kaspersky.com/KTS/21.3/en-US/70766.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.kaspersky.com/KTS/21.3/en-US/70766.htm</a>  There is a reason they disable them on version upgrades.

Does it open it?  it is possible to find things that no longer exist in searches, especially when the code behind the location is not an integral part of Thunderbird.  If it opens,  then it exists obviously. </p><p>One thing is clear.  Thunderbird does not think the mail is spam.  It's junk flag is not showing red in the list.  Despite the messing with the subject line to say the message is spam, something Thunderbird has no capability of doing. So the issue is really a missing folder, or a third party product making a total mess in it's sandbox.  Thunderbird has a cache of folder information in the profile folder in a file called foldertree.json.  You might want to close Thunderbird and delete this file so the next start will be slower as the appropriate locations are scanned for folder files.  That might locate a poorly created folder that was probably not created using Thunderbird at all. </p><p>It may also be your global index is corrupted.
