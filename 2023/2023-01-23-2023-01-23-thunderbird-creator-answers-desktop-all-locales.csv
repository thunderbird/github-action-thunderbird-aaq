I now have a problem with ""address book"".  Problem could be either import or export or in the use of address book.  The problem may have started when I moved the address book from my old computer (Win 10 pro 64 bit, Thunderbird  102.6.1) to a new computer (Win 11-Pro, Thunderbird 102.7.0, 64-bit) Old computer is OK,  new computer  has error. </p><p>Error:  Start  to display ""inbox"" then  click -&gt; Tools-&gt; address book.  Address book displays, BUT display in on half line spacing, not the normal full line spacing -  if correct data displays correctly.  In half line spacing, lines overlay each other.  Also  I can not modify a contact and I can not add a new contact.  </p><p>I have  only one profile,  no extras  on Thunderbird.   When I click on a contact that  display incorrectly I get a grey box (almost the whole display) and I can not type into that box. Can not close that box, can not go back, can only close tab.  </p><p>Tried on web to backup address book.  In command prompt (the old DOS)  with current directory set to:  ""C:\""  typed  ""dir *.mab /s"".  Result:  ""file not found"".  I can not find any ""mab"" file anywhere on C:.  (Windows is  installed on C:.  One problem  you probably know, when Thunderbird is updated,  help files on Web are not updated.   (Example web states to   go to ""run"",  can not find ""run"" on Thunderbird menu).  Went through many sites on web, can not find file containing address book and can it not back it up, can not fix it,  can not where it is. Looked at profile at   What went wrong? I am out of luck.   </p><p>My background: Worked on PC since Windows 3,  I am comfortable on PC/Win,  repair PCs, etc.  </p><p>Sorry to bring you this, can  not figure this on out.

I was able to setup my Frontier mail account on the laptop, but I can't get my hotmail setup. I have tried to do it automatically on the laptop. But it fails. I've tried to use the settings I can see on the pc and do it manually, but I can't get the settings correct somehow and that fails also. My email client on the PC is outlook 2010. It is the same on the laptop. Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1561445;1562309;,davefrank41

Is it even possible to make such a plugin? If so, what is a good starting point for learning how to do so? </p><p>Cheers. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1561888;,janssensimon3
