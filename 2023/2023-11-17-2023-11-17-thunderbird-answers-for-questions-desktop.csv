If you do not have computer with you when traveling, I suggest you consider changing your email account from POP to IMAP. In doing that, you would have contact to your mail when using any available computer or smartphone. And maybe I'm not understanding your question. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you want the messages to be online, you can copy them in small groups, but that can be problematic as IMAP wasn't designed to work that way. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Then you select another folder. The Inbox is no longer containing anything 'new' because nothing has been downloaded since you last selected Inbox. </p><p>Senario: This time when you select to run filter on Inbox - it filters all relevant emails in Inbox, but in addition a new mail arrived during the process because you have set the check emails every minute which is hardly any time since last check, so it downloaded and got moved instantly. You would not have seen that email in the Inbox. That would trigger the folder which got the new download to become blue with new.  </p><p>Whilst you can set up Message filters to only filter upon manual selection, it is usual to also have it set up to do it automatically. I've got both selections set up in Message Filters as it does no harm. </p><p>If You have Message Filters automatically filtering upon download, then folders and emails get the 'new' flag; blue and star no matter what folder they get filtered into. But they only remain new and blue until you select the folder and stay in folder. You move away from folder then no longer new even if you did not read them. </p><p>When it comes to imap accounts, it may be worth checking to see if the folders are designed to auto check for new mail. Maybe you have new mail in folder but you would not know it because folder is not set up to auto check. Meaning when you select a folder it auto synchronises, downloaded new mail and shows this. </p><p>Right click on folder and select 'Properties' Is this checkbox selected&nbsp;: 'When getting new messages for this account, always check this folder'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
