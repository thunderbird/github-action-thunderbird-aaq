If you do not have computer with you when traveling, I suggest you consider changing your email account from POP to IMAP. In doing that, you would have contact to your mail when using any available computer or smartphone. And maybe I'm not understanding your question. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you want the messages to be online, you can copy them in small groups, but that can be problematic as IMAP wasn't designed to work that way. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
