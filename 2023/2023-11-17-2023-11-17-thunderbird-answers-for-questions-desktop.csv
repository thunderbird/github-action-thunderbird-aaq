If you do not have computer with you when traveling, I suggest you consider changing your email account from POP to IMAP. In doing that, you would have contact to your mail when using any available computer or smartphone. And maybe I'm not understanding your question. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you want the messages to be online, you can copy them in small groups, but that can be problematic as IMAP wasn't designed to work that way. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

If you want to know which folder they are in then enable the column header 'Location' But you do not really want to do this every time you want to find new mail so do this: </p> <ul><li> click on 'Save as search folder' </li><li> Give it a suitable name like 'New mail' </li><li> Create as a subfolder of the actual mail account name so it becomes a top level folder. </li><li> Click on 'Create' </li></ul> <p>Now you will have a special saved search folder as a top level folder in the account.  You do not select to save anything in this virtual type of folder. Whenever other folder indicate new mail or you just want to quickly check - use this  'New Mail' search folder. </p><p>From now onwards all new mail should be quickly visible via the search folder called 'New Mail' If you select another folder and read a new email then the search folder gets updated automatically to not include that email. If you select to read in the 'New Mail' folder then it's also not new mail in original folder. </p><p>This is how to get a quick view of what is new without ever needing to hunt it down. In the 'New Mail' folder you can easily  enable the column header 'Location' to see which folder it is in.  </p><p>Try it out, it's really a game changer. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Then you select another folder. The Inbox is no longer containing anything 'new' because nothing has been downloaded since you last selected Inbox. </p><p>Senario: This time when you select to run filter on Inbox - it filters all relevant emails in Inbox, but in addition a new mail arrived during the process because you have set the check emails every minute which is hardly any time since last check, so it downloaded and got moved instantly. You would not have seen that email in the Inbox. That would trigger the folder which got the new download to become blue with new.  </p><p>Whilst you can set up Message filters to only filter upon manual selection, it is usual to also have it set up to do it automatically. I've got both selections set up in Message Filters as it does no harm. </p><p>If You have Message Filters automatically filtering upon download, then folders and emails get the 'new' flag; blue and star no matter what folder they get filtered into. But they only remain new and blue until you select the folder and stay in folder. You move away from folder then no longer new even if you did not read them. </p><p>When it comes to imap accounts, it may be worth checking to see if the folders are designed to auto check for new mail. Maybe you have new mail in folder but you would not know it because folder is not set up to auto check. Meaning when you select a folder it auto synchronises, downloaded new mail and shows this. </p><p>Right click on folder and select 'Properties' Is this checkbox selected&nbsp;: 'When getting new messages for this account, always check this folder'. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
