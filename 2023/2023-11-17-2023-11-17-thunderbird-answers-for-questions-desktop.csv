Thunderbird is based on Netscape Communicator and has nothing regarding Eudora in it's roots. </p><p>For a very brief time about 15 years ago the Qualcomm paid some developers to build a Thunderbird addon called Penelope that worked with exactly one Thunderbird release that they marketed as Eudora OSE. It lapsed into history with the next Thunderbird release as the addon was a binary one and needed to be rebuilt for each Thunderbird release. Qualcomm only ever built the addon for a single release. So the Thunderbird Eudora links are very tenuous indeed. </p><p>Now I have no idea what Eudora did with SPAM,  I used it for a couple of weeks in he early to mid 1990s and hated it.   However from the posts over the years I get the feeling it offered some sort of block list for email addresses.  Thankfully Thunderbird ignores the sender when determining is an email is ""spammy"".  User insistence on marking mail as spam based on the from has other poor outcomes going forward  </p><p>Now  as I read your issue,  your junk mail is not going to the junk folder.  As I have never used that feature (I simply refuse to use anything but the learning filter Thunderbird comes built in with) I really can not comment specifically in relation to filter use. </p><p>What I do know is for mail to successfully be moved the storage file must be available for writes to update it.  Unfortunately most folk with the time to do spam filtering manually also have antivirus products scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder immediately after a file changes (add a new mail to the folder)  unfortunately your filter is also attempting to modify the file.  The file contention between a period of internal intense opening and closing of file and the scanner plodding among with it's 10 minutes per GB scanning sees the change simply fail silently in the background.   </p><p>So the first things that must be ensured for reasonable Thunderbird experience are.   1. The profile folder is not being scanned on each file change.  Prefereably it is excluded from everytinhg except periodic full system scans. 2. The profile location is not on a place where it is synced to the cloud,  or subject to streaming backups.  Essentially issues arise if it is moved from the hidden appdata folders it defaults to as third party backup and scanning software treads data in those hidden folder locations differently to say ""my documents"".  Even storage on network locations like a NAS can cause issues. 3. Wherever possible filters are run after junk classification.  While this is more important for IMAP accounts, it does allow for the filtering to be slightly delayed which also helps with contention issues.  Filtering after junk classification is especially important where you are marking mail as junk as the inbuilt junk filter should be allowed to go first.  All the thousands of junk mail in filters will affect how it reacts to new email.  It is also important to never use a filter to mark a message as junk based on the sender.  That will simply corrupt the learning algorithm as it only has regard to the message, not the sender.  Marking mail as junk based on sender can actually make the in built filtering worse and increase the numbers of false positives. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,2

POPfile inserts headers into the mail saying whether it thinks that a message is spam or not. Eudora filtered on that header. When I started using Thunderbird, I kept POPfile in place and it worked. But I later switched to Thunderbird's native filtering, which now works well too. </p><p>All of these use Bayesian filters, though POPfile also has a lot of other clues it can look at with assigned weights, and its Bayesian filter was actually rather weak. A Bayesian filter's accuracy is based on its training. It starts out knowing absolutely nothing. As you mark messages as spam or not-spam, it learns. A few thousand messages later and it's working pretty well, and I don't use POPfile any more.  </p><p>Thunderbird's Privacy and Security Options page has a  few options: Set your default junk mail settings.

Opening Trash.sbd showed the files and subfolders you mentioned.  None were marked as read only.  With Thunderbird closed, I deleted Old(2).msf and Old(2) with no problem, and when I reopened TBird indeed Old(2) was gone, so the problem is basically solved.  However since you said you wanted to try to figure out why the other folders won't delete from TBird, I've left them alone for the moment.  If you want me to try something else I'll be happy to do so; otherwise I'll delete them in the near future. </p><p>(I should mention that Trash.sbd also contains an empty subfolder named PersonalAdd.sbd, which does *not* show up in TBird.

Essentially I think Steve is correct,  your issue is the ATT mail key there and perhaps here as well.  Incoming and outgoing servers has separate passwords.  You possibly have more than one outgoing server configured as well.  But in none of your posted images is there anything about your outgoing server (SMTP) entries.  They are in account settings,  but listed under the outgoing heading not the incoming account settings.  There should be one outgoing server configured for each incoming one. </p><p>Fundamentally there are three main causes of email failure with ATT 1.

Which I think is 119,  or you have a pre-release version either Alpha or Beta. </p><p>So you think the UI on windows sucks.  So do I.  But I am also accepting of change based on user configuration.  Where I have issues is in change which forces me to do it the way some developer thinks I want to do it.  I do not expect it to meet my needs out of the box.  Nothing else does,  so why would Thunderbird.  But I expect to be able to make it look like it's predecessor version. </p><p>Version 115 brought major user interface changes,  the developers make some sort of feeble comments about it being much the same,  but it is not.  So really what is it you want to change be specific so someone can offer more than platitudes and agreement.  Copying stuff is rarely a success, unless you take the whole profile.  Of course you could import your profile from one of these other devices.  That has been an option for a few years now.  It is not just settings but contacts etc as well. </p><p>If you are indeed using version 119,  it has enabled the Firefox sync feature on the application menu.  Exactly what it offers is something you could experiment with.  But setting synchronizations between installs is one of the things I think is included. </p><p><br> Your threading comment is documented and is relatively simple to change the default.  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#w_changing-default-threading-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#w_changing-default-threading-mode</a>  It is however not operating system dependent. All new profiles default to threading after version 102. </p><p>I assume you like having a menu as that is still in the MAC version,  although I think it is missing from many Linux distros.  As they tend to build their own,  there is not really a Linux user interface because each Linux window manager is slightly different.  Good for choice,  useless for having a single user interface and really uncomfortable to compare to as there is no baseline at all.  The menu bar however is as simple as using the menu &gt; view &gt; Toolbars &gt; menu bar to turn it on. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It is one of the really excellent features of FF.   </p><p>Attached image is what I want (Mac) and what I got on Windows after all the futzing around. </p><p>--side comment re product development-- I think I am pretty typical.  If I find the UI gets in the way of working, I change the tool rather than try to conform to what some development team thinks is how I should work.  I tried really, really hard to use Gmail as that is the company standard.  But that tool archives emails for some unknown reason and does a lot of other ""efficiency improvements"" that are completely useless and mean I can't find email without doing numerous searches.   </p><p>Just because the developers think it is good, doesn't mean it is.  I don't know how many products have disappeared because the developers didn't listen to the users.   </p><p>So I thought I'd go back to what I know in TB.

I presume they're on my laptop somewhere as it seems i=unlikely they have been totally deleted? </blockquote> <p>Generally all folders but the inbox go missing on connectivity issues (I think there is another like sent that remains,  but I am a bit hazy on that.  The remaining folders (inbox) are all empty. </p><p>But is your account even IMAP? or is it POP,  something I would expect if you are looking to retain email in the account for more than 2 weeks. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

It's with claranet and they have an email limit and don't tell you when it's full and then you stop getting emails! So I changed the settings to clear everything over 2 weeks old. I'm not clear how this all works but once the emails are downloaded to my laptop I wouldn't have thought any connectivity issues would apply?

Every print needs to go via that where the settings are displayed.  Do you perhaps have the printing tools addon installed?  It offers a ctrl+P print option.  It also offers the traditional page settings which where removed when the print preview arrangement was implemented. </p><p><a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/printingtools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/printingtools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

You are absolutely right, it's working now just as you described and, no, I have no add-ons.  However, on an incoming email, if I go to File, the Print option does reference a Ctrl+P, but clicking on Print, or using the shortcut, I now get the Print Preview page just fine.  This is strange, because a bit ago Thunderbird was bypassing this step and sending data to the printer immediately.  Just a fluke, perhaps; I'll keep an eye on it. </p><p>While I've got you cornered, do you know, offhand, if there is a way to specify the Windows default System Dialog box for printer selection and setup, rather than the one that looks like the one below?  I can get there by clicking a hyperlink at the bottom, but would prefer to skip that step if possible.

The addon I linked to offers such a dialog for setting persistent preferences, including header and footer details that are non user set in the base product. 3.  The reality is most of us do not change the basic defaults for the printer each time we print,  they are set in the operating system and meet general printing needs most of the time unchanged.  The choice of double sided Vs single sided perhaps being the dividing feature. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0

Click the three dots to the right of 'quick filter' just above the message list pane and tick 'table view.' That will show a row across top of message list pane and one of the words is 'Date.' Click that to change order of sort. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Although I might be a bug if it is removing things,  lets look for a quick fix. </p><p>When Thunderbird initially installs there is an option to have a desktop and or a task bar icon.  I am guessing you chose not to have the taskbar icon.  Try reinstalling from <a href=""http://Thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Thunderbird.net</a> and make sure the options for icons are set as you want.
