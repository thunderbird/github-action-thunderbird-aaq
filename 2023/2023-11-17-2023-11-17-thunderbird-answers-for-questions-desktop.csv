Essentially I think Steve is correct,  your issue is the ATT mail key there and perhaps here as well.  Incoming and outgoing servers has separate passwords.  You possibly have more than one outgoing server configured as well.  But in none of your posted images is there anything about your outgoing server (SMTP) entries.  They are in account settings,  but listed under the outgoing heading not the incoming account settings.  There should be one outgoing server configured for each incoming one. </p><p>Fundamentally there are three main causes of email failure with ATT 1.  The user fails to use the mailkey is all instances,  for some reason having two saved passwords for two mail server appears to escape many. </p><p>2. The user has an antivirus product installed that is something of a problem.  This especially affect folk that have limited technical skills as they tend to be more paranoid about what can happen.  They are also more susceptible to the fear selling that antivirus vendors thrive on.

Where I have issues is in change which forces me to do it the way some developer thinks I want to do it.  I do not expect it to meet my needs out of the box.  Nothing else does,  so why would Thunderbird.  But I expect to be able to make it look like it's predecessor version. </p><p>Version 115 brought major user interface changes,  the developers make some sort of feeble comments about it being much the same,  but it is not.  So really what is it you want to change be specific so someone can offer more than platitudes and agreement.  Copying stuff is rarely a success, unless you take the whole profile.  Of course you could import your profile from one of these other devices.  That has been an option for a few years now.  It is not just settings but contacts etc as well. </p><p>If you are indeed using version 119,  it has enabled the Firefox sync feature on the application menu.  Exactly what it offers is something you could experiment with.

As they tend to build their own,  there is not really a Linux user interface because each Linux window manager is slightly different.  Good for choice,  useless for having a single user interface and really uncomfortable to compare to as there is no baseline at all.

Every print needs to go via that where the settings are displayed.  Do you perhaps have the printing tools addon installed?  It offers a ctrl+P print option.  It also offers the traditional page settings which where removed when the print preview arrangement was implemented. </p><p><a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/printingtools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/printingtools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
