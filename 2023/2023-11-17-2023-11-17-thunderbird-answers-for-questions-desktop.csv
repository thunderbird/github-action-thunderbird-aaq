The Thunderbird extension site opens up a new *browser* tab *within* Thunderbird itself. Following this train of thought, why can't I open links in new tabs within Thunderbird itself? </blockquote> <p>Because the more web pages you open in browser mode, the more likely you are to bump into issues that have been addressed by the Firefox team, but not the Thunderbird one. </p><p>Allesandro is correct in saying Thunderbird runs on the Mozilla platform.  He is not correct in saying it is running on Firefox.  They are not quite the same thing.   </p><p>Just as chromium the open source browser project developed a rendering engine. Google chrome and Microsoft Edge,  are both also using the chromium engine, but the three things are not quite the same thing.  Just as Microsoft is using the chromium engine Chrome uses, Thunderbird uses the Mozilla engine (used to be referred to as Geko) that underlies Firefox. </p><p>But Thunderbird does have a lot of the necessary and it is getting a little more focus as Oauith2.0 requires a browser authentication process as it is a web protocol being shoehorned into email by web companies (google first then Microsoft and yahoo got on the bandwagon. but there were no navigation button until about version 78 </p> <blockquote> Say I have an RSS feed link that links to another article. I click on that, and a whole new browser window opens up instead of staying within the Thunderbird application. Rather frustrating to see, considering how Thunderbird *is* capable of displaying web pages. </blockquote> <p>Perhaps,  but once you click the link you are in browser territory,  not longer in feed reader territory.  Even as a feed reader displaying HTML feed pages, Thunderbird's rendering is quirky at best (and I use it, but I do not love it) </p> <blockquote> Supposedly, extensions like Link in Tab fix this. More power to you if you've gotten them to work, but it's useless for me. I've tried fiddling with about:config and the TB config editor, but neither one worked for me. Any other resources I've come across through search is either mildly outdated (i.e. 2019-2021) or horrifically outdated (i.e. 2008-2012). </blockquote> <p>I just installed <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/link_in_tab/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/link_in_tab/</a> the next link I clicked it opened in a tab.  I have now disabled it as it is not behavouur I like,  but given hopw easily it worked for me,  the issue may well be in your computer, or perhaps is a feature of some security software.  It works for me is all I can say here. </p> <blockquote> Is this feature that I'm looking for completely nonexistent within Thunderbird itself, or am I just doing it wrong this whole time and I need someone to point out the obvious solution? I am desperately hoping for the latter, but my intuition is telling me it's the former. </blockquote> <p>I really don't know,  as I said the addon you mentioned just installed and worked for me on Windows 11.  But I do not have any third party security software that might block an unknown browser from connecting to the web. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Thunderbird is based on Netscape Communicator and has nothing regarding Eudora in it's roots. </p><p>For a very brief time about 15 years ago the Qualcomm paid some developers to build a Thunderbird addon called Penelope that worked with exactly one Thunderbird release that they marketed as Eudora OSE. It lapsed into history with the next Thunderbird release as the addon was a binary one and needed to be rebuilt for each Thunderbird release. Qualcomm only ever built the addon for a single release. So the Thunderbird Eudora links are very tenuous indeed. </p><p>Now I have no idea what Eudora did with SPAM,  I used it for a couple of weeks in he early to mid 1990s and hated it.   However from the posts over the years I get the feeling it offered some sort of block list for email addresses.  Thankfully Thunderbird ignores the sender when determining is an email is ""spammy"".  User insistence on marking mail as spam based on the from has other poor outcomes going forward  </p><p>Now  as I read your issue,  your junk mail is not going to the junk folder.  As I have never used that feature (I simply refuse to use anything but the learning filter Thunderbird comes built in with) I really can not comment specifically in relation to filter use. </p><p>What I do know is for mail to successfully be moved the storage file must be available for writes to update it.  Unfortunately most folk with the time to do spam filtering manually also have antivirus products scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder immediately after a file changes (add a new mail to the folder)  unfortunately your filter is also attempting to modify the file.  The file contention between a period of internal intense opening and closing of file and the scanner plodding among with it's 10 minutes per GB scanning sees the change simply fail silently in the background.   </p><p>So the first things that must be ensured for reasonable Thunderbird experience are.   1. The profile folder is not being scanned on each file change.  Prefereably it is excluded from everytinhg except periodic full system scans. 2. The profile location is not on a place where it is synced to the cloud,  or subject to streaming backups.  Essentially issues arise if it is moved from the hidden appdata folders it defaults to as third party backup and scanning software treads data in those hidden folder locations differently to say ""my documents"".  Even storage on network locations like a NAS can cause issues. 3. Wherever possible filters are run after junk classification.  While this is more important for IMAP accounts, it does allow for the filtering to be slightly delayed which also helps with contention issues.  Filtering after junk classification is especially important where you are marking mail as junk as the inbuilt junk filter should be allowed to go first.  All the thousands of junk mail in filters will affect how it reacts to new email.  It is also important to never use a filter to mark a message as junk based on the sender.  That will simply corrupt the learning algorithm as it only has regard to the message, not the sender.  Marking mail as junk based on sender can actually make the in built filtering worse and increase the numbers of false positives. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

This is all stored in the profile and it the part that is generally moved from machine to machine when you buy a dew device so you don't have to start all over again.  Removing the application does not change this part at all. Unless you use some third part uninstaller.

Reinstalling rarely if ever fixes anything other than operating system integration issues.  It can be a trigger for antivirus programs to actually get out of the way and let the application function,  and it can replace corrupt components.

Essentially I think Steve is correct,  your issue is the ATT mail key there and perhaps here as well.  Incoming and outgoing servers has separate passwords.  You possibly have more than one outgoing server configured as well.  But in none of your posted images is there anything about your outgoing server (SMTP) entries.  They are in account settings,  but listed under the outgoing heading not the incoming account settings.  There should be one outgoing server configured for each incoming one. </p><p>Fundamentally there are three main causes of email failure with ATT 1.  The user fails to use the mailkey is all instances,  for some reason having two saved passwords for two mail server appears to escape many. </p><p>2. The user has an antivirus product installed that is something of a problem.  This especially affect folk that have limited technical skills as they tend to be more paranoid about what can happen.  They are also more susceptible to the fear selling that antivirus vendors thrive on.

Which I think is 119,  or you have a pre-release version either Alpha or Beta. </p><p>So you think the UI on windows sucks.  So do I.  But I am also accepting of change based on user configuration.  Where I have issues is in change which forces me to do it the way some developer thinks I want to do it.  I do not expect it to meet my needs out of the box.  Nothing else does,  so why would Thunderbird.  But I expect to be able to make it look like it's predecessor version. </p><p>Version 115 brought major user interface changes,  the developers make some sort of feeble comments about it being much the same,  but it is not.  So really what is it you want to change be specific so someone can offer more than platitudes and agreement.  Copying stuff is rarely a success, unless you take the whole profile.  Of course you could import your profile from one of these other devices.  That has been an option for a few years now.  It is not just settings but contacts etc as well. </p><p>If you are indeed using version 119,  it has enabled the Firefox sync feature on the application menu.  Exactly what it offers is something you could experiment with.  But setting synchronizations between installs is one of the things I think is included. </p><p><br> Your threading comment is documented and is relatively simple to change the default.  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#w_changing-default-threading-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/message-threading-thunderbird#w_changing-default-threading-mode</a>  It is however not operating system dependent. All new profiles default to threading after version 102. </p><p>I assume you like having a menu as that is still in the MAC version,  although I think it is missing from many Linux distros.  As they tend to build their own,  there is not really a Linux user interface because each Linux window manager is slightly different.  Good for choice,  useless for having a single user interface and really uncomfortable to compare to as there is no baseline at all.  The menu bar however is as simple as using the menu &gt; view &gt; Toolbars &gt; menu bar to turn it on. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Because that didn't work, I was hoping that I could just move the UI configuration settings between the Mac and Windows since one version has what I want and the other is not acceptable.  That was my question ... despite being lost in all the ranting.&nbsp;:-) </p><p>I can't find the sync in Thunderbird that you allude to.  That would be very cool if it is there but I'm just not able to find it.  I have used Sync on FF forever.  It is one of the really excellent features of FF.   </p><p>Attached image is what I want (Mac) and what I got on Windows after all the futzing around. </p><p>--side comment re product development-- I think I am pretty typical.  If I find the UI gets in the way of working, I change the tool rather than try to conform to what some development team thinks is how I should work.  I tried really, really hard to use Gmail as that is the company standard.  But that tool archives emails for some unknown reason and does a lot of other ""efficiency improvements"" that are completely useless and mean I can't find email without doing numerous searches.   </p><p>Just because the developers think it is good, doesn't mean it is.  I don't know how many products have disappeared because the developers didn't listen to the users.   </p><p>So I thought I'd go back to what I know in TB.
