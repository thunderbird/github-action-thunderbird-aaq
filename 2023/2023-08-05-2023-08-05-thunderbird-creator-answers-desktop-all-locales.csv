This made me want to migrate from snap to flatpak. Unfortunately, I cannot get the migration to work smoothly. </p><p>What is the recommended way to migrate a Thunderbird profile? </p><p>I have tried Tools &gt; Export to export the profile to a zip file and then importing it in flatpak version of Thunderbird. This asked to authenticate each account again and it started messing with the folder structure by creating duplicates of every existent folder, so I had to discard this option. </p><p>The second thing I have tried is to: 1. Copy over the profile to flatpak profile directory: <em>$HOME/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/cache/thunderbird/</em> 2. Start the application with <strong>-P</strong> option. 3. Create a profile and specify the path of the profile. </p><p>The second option started fetching messages from many years ago and I could even see a bunch of emails with dates 1970-... (I think, can't remember exactly). </p><p>Do you have any ideas what to do to migrate the data without the need to clean up anything or reconfigure any settings? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",statue_molecule012

Ever since the recent Upgrade I can't send through my Microsoft HOTMAIL and LIVE email accounts and trying to fix it is impossible for this 73 year old man.  GMAIL goes out just fine and I have checked all the SMTP thingies and nothing works.  I'm going to cancel my monthly donation to you since I won't be using your product anymore and going (though I don't want to, to OUTLOOK and I'm willing to pay for it).  I don't know why you make this so impossibly difficult but I have a surgery coming up in a week and don't have the time or patience to try to fix this.  I'm really sorry.  I've enjoyed Thunderbird but this last Upgrade has really put me off.  I've got other things to do than sit for hours trying to figure this out.  Good luck.  I'm sure I'm not the only person in this position.

The same problem was reported 21 Aug 2022 by another contributor, so it would seem that this feature has been broken for some time. (I guess maybe not many people are wanting to migrate from SeaMonkey, so not many people are experiencing the problem.)

In most menues there is a scolling bar to fast go up an down in the list - not here... I think it's just a hook in a program's line to make it visible und useable.

Is there a way to go back to 102?  Either that or I may start using Mac Mail again due to all these bugs. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1595155;1595183;,chunnel
