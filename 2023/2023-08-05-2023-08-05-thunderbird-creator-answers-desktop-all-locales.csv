When I select ""Import from a SeaMonkey installation"" and click Continue, nothing happens. The other 4 options on the page each move me on to a further page, but the SeaMonkey option does nothing. The same problem was reported 21 Aug 2022 by another contributor, so it would seem that this feature has been broken for some time. (I guess maybe not many people are wanting to migrate from SeaMonkey, so not many people are experiencing the problem.) Can anyone advise on what I might be doing wrong, or, if this is a ""bug"", is there a mechanism for reporting it? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",pete109

When I want to tag an email, I have the Problem, that there is no scolling bar in the ""tags menue"". See red area in picture. In most menues there is a scolling bar to fast go up an down in the list - not here... I think it's just a hook in a program's line to make it visible und useable. And if it would work, to press a letter on the keybord to jump to the tags with this beginning letter... would be nice, too!

I use Thunderbird and it has been a good product but my emails first go to my IP then TB picks up from there .if email for example ( i will make one up ) is......

This doesn't happen with previous emails in that thread or with gmail, exchange, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>, icloud, etc....  Now, I have an issue where the pop ups for calendar notifications keep popping up non stop and either won't go away by hitting ""Submit to changes anyway"" or if they do go away, they immediately pop back up again.  115 is a big disapointment for me, it's been highly glitchy, many add ons no longer, some that should work, don't work properly, it was hyped a major upgrade and I see very little that distinguishes if from 102 in any meaningful way except some of the icons are more colorful.  Is there a way to go back to 102?  Either that or I may start using Mac Mail again due to all these bugs. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1595155;1595183;,chunnel
