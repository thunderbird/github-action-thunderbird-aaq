When I want to tag an email, I have the Problem, that there is no scolling bar in the ""tags menue"". See red area in picture. In most menues there is a scolling bar to fast go up an down in the list - not here... I think it's just a hook in a program's line to make it visible und useable. And if it would work, to press a letter on the keybord to jump to the tags with this beginning letter... would be nice, too!

When I select ""Import from a SeaMonkey installation"" and click Continue, nothing happens. The other 4 options on the page each move me on to a further page, but the SeaMonkey option does nothing. The same problem was reported 21 Aug 2022 by another contributor, so it would seem that this feature has been broken for some time. (I guess maybe not many people are wanting to migrate from SeaMonkey, so not many people are experiencing the problem.) Can anyone advise on what I might be doing wrong, or, if this is a ""bug"", is there a mechanism for reporting it? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,installation-and-updates,en-US,1595280;1595696;1596154;,pete109

Ever since the recent Upgrade I can't send through my Microsoft HOTMAIL and LIVE email accounts and trying to fix it is impossible for this 73 year old man.  GMAIL goes out just fine and I have checked all the SMTP thingies and nothing works.  I'm going to cancel my monthly donation to you since I won't be using your product anymore and going (though I don't want to, to OUTLOOK and I'm willing to pay for it).  I don't know why you make this so impossibly difficult but I have a surgery coming up in a week and don't have the time or patience to try to fix this.  I'm really sorry.  I've enjoyed Thunderbird but this last Upgrade has really put me off.  I've got other things to do than sit for hours trying to figure this out.  Good luck.  I'm sure I'm not the only person in this position.  Everything was fine before and now it all screwed up and I can't find any help anywhere. </p><p>Tom Toohey </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,troubleshooting,en-US,1595531;,tom.toohey

Copy over the profile to flatpak profile directory: <em>$HOME/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/cache/thunderbird/</em> 2. Start the application with <strong>-P</strong> option. 3. Create a profile and specify the path of the profile. </p><p>The second option started fetching messages from many years ago and I could even see a bunch of emails with dates 1970-...
