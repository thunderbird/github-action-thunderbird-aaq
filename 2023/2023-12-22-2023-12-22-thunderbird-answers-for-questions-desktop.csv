Did you mean to write "" moved last night's mail from the new inbox to my original inbox in the OLD profile, and then deleted the new profile""? If so, that move may have overlaid the older messages. You also mention that the missing messages were absent in both profiles. If compared after the move, that would make sense. If compared prior to the move, that might indicate the messages were already absent. And, maybe I'm missing some of the details. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You could subscribe to all the labels in your imap settings,  but that would still not show on any one mail what labels Gmail maintains for the base mail, only download multiple copies.

It allows for the Gmail accont to be treated as a current mail source and everything prior to the takeout download can be deleted from the GMail account. </p><p>Just be sure to change the delete setting to not move mail into the deleted folder in GMail as doing so, will restore mail deleted from the all mail folder back there as a new copy is uploaded from your local deleted folder. </p><p>Note that if you get takeout ZIp files by label,  they can be imported to Thunderbird local folders (local machine storage) using the import export tools addon after they are unzipped to MBOX files. If you do not,  the file is huge and the import is less structured.

A dearth of answers usually means no one has an answer for you. </p><p>I have just quickly looked at your previous postings and personally I would suggest you uninstall the McAfee product and see if you still have an issue.  It has been causing problems in Thunderbird (that I know of since 2012) because it keeps locking file in the Temp folder and scanning the files Thunderbird is opening and closing in it's profile folder causing what is called file contention,  so Thunderbird hangs waiting for McAfee and McAfee hangs waiting for Thunderbird essentially. </p><p>At the very least you should place an exclusion in McAfee to prevent it scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder while the application is running. </p><p>Thunderbird is a multi process application and in task manager multiple instances is quite normal.

The two companies, Mozilla Co and Mzla Co are not related except by their ownership by the Mozilla foundation (a US not for profit)  The members of the Mzla board are largely Mozilla foundation employees.  But the two companies do not share income streams nor operate under any form of common management.  Both share the foundations support site,  but as neither actually offer paid employee support this peer forum is all that is available. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
