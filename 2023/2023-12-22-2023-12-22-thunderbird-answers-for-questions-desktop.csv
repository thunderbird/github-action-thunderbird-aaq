Did you mean to write "" moved last night's mail from the new inbox to my original inbox in the OLD profile, and then deleted the new profile""? If so, that move may have overlaid the older messages. You also mention that the missing messages were absent in both profiles. If compared after the move, that would make sense. If compared prior to the move, that might indicate the messages were already absent. And, maybe I'm missing some of the details. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Back in the 1990s Microsoft noted that some 80% of new features requested for Word were already in the product.  Much the same goes for Thunderbird now. </p><p>Just to be clear,  you appear to be lumping Thunderbird and Firefox into a single development group.  That is not even close.  The two companies, Mozilla Co and Mzla Co are not related except by their ownership by the Mozilla foundation (a US not for profit)  The members of the Mzla board are largely Mozilla foundation employees.  But the two companies do not share income streams nor operate under any form of common management.  Both share the foundations support site,  but as neither actually offer paid employee support this peer forum is all that is available. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
