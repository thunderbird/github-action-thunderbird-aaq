Did you mean to write "" moved last night's mail from the new inbox to my original inbox in the OLD profile, and then deleted the new profile""? If so, that move may have overlaid the older messages. You also mention that the missing messages were absent in both profiles. If compared after the move, that would make sense. If compared prior to the move, that might indicate the messages were already absent. And, maybe I'm missing some of the details. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
