For example, in a screenshot of pop.theworld, I see inbox with 2 meg size and trash with 1.3 meg size. Also, look inside all .sdb folders.

We have no idea if the issue is with thuinderbird, Bitdefender or both. Last time it happened I fixed it myself after wasting tons of time contacting Bitdefender and reading Thunderbird contributers possible fixes. Last time it was as simple as changing from IMAP to POP. I didnt really want to but it worked. There are many goood minds on this site and sometimes people can find work arounds without contacting the vendors.  </p><p>As far as responsibility, Both Thunderbird and Bitdefender have a responsibility to the users. Thinderbird should ensure add ons are good and functional, safe etc. Bitdefender should be more responsive when asked to fix the issue. Just because it is typically the author that has responsibility that doesnt mean that is the right way to do it. Obviously that has not been working. Communication is key and that does not happen nearly enough these days. Its always point somewhere else and hope it goes away.  </p><p>Is the issue with not being able to remove it with Thunderbird, or Bitdefender? I was able to remove it both times, but is was a pain. It should be click on click off... </p><p>In the meantime users waste tons of time trying t figure it out while many do nothing to correct what is a probably a simple fix.  </p><p>Thunderbird does not support nearly as much email protection as is included with the Bitdefender program. Hence Bit defender has a seperate interface linked to their program.  </p><p>I'll be working with Bitdefender and will post a solution if they ever get around to it. If they dont and thunderbird doesnt, then I will likely move to another email service rather than try alternate spam filters as when bitdefender ant-spam works,  it works better than anything else I have ever used.  </p><p>Thanks for the rapid response. </p><p>Darrel </p>",darrelhart,false,0,0
