Thinderbird should ensure add ons are good and functional, safe etc. Bitdefender should be more responsive when asked to fix the issue. Just because it is typically the author that has responsibility that doesnt mean that is the right way to do it. Obviously that has not been working. Communication is key and that does not happen nearly enough these days. Its always point somewhere else and hope it goes away.  </p><p>Is the issue with not being able to remove it with Thunderbird, or Bitdefender? I was able to remove it both times, but is was a pain. It should be click on click off... </p><p>In the meantime users waste tons of time trying t figure it out while many do nothing to correct what is a probably a simple fix.  </p><p>Thunderbird does not support nearly as much email protection as is included with the Bitdefender program. Hence Bit defender has a seperate interface linked to their program.  </p><p>I'll be working with Bitdefender and will post a solution if they ever get around to it.

It has been causing problems in Thunderbird (that I know of since 2012) because it keeps locking file in the Temp folder and scanning the files Thunderbird is opening and closing in it's profile folder causing what is called file contention,  so Thunderbird hangs waiting for McAfee and McAfee hangs waiting for Thunderbird essentially. </p><p>At the very least you should place an exclusion in McAfee to prevent it scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder while the application is running. </p><p>Thunderbird is a multi process application and in task manager multiple instances is quite normal.
