I have found that G-mail which I have used since th 80's has ""mail merge"" and now I'm trying to create an organization letterhead to use for sending the many newsletters.

This is either based on a generic password I guess we can call it,  or a primary password.  As I am the only user of my password protected windows account on this machine,  I do not use a primary password as it serves little purpose for me.  My passwords are still stored on the local machine in an encrypted form,  but decrypting them is fairly trivial. </p><p>You have chosen to store the file on your local hard disk using a primary password,  this is something you chose to use to enhance the encryption of the password store.  It is not sent anywhere,  simply becomes part of your local Thunderbird install and is not actually stored anywhere that it can be accessed without the use of the primary password.  If it was stored in an accessible location then it would obviously be no more secure that the passwords with the generic encryption.  Hence it can not be sent to you because it is encrypted and can not be unencrypted with the password you no longer have.   </p><p>The situation you are in is equivalent to you buying a combination padlock for your shed door,  changing the combination and then forgetting what you changed it to.  Writing to the company that made the padlock will get advice of the type ""use bolt cutters"" if you can not remember your combination.  We are telling you much the same thing,  you forgot the password that protects your password storage file,  then we can delete it and you, as David explained, can enter those passwords again,  but we can not recover them or the combination that accessed the file because we literally do not know it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

Here are the basics, in case you do this again. When TB starts, it looks at the profiles.ini file on C drive, which is a text file that tells it where the profile is. Solving your problem can be done by moving the profile, or by moving the account. I prefer moving the account because that is easiest to explain - and it's the account that uses all that disc space. If you still have the original profile, this can be easy. If you've corrupted it, we'll have to slowly work through it.  I will assume here that you can reconstruct the original profile.  - exit TB - locate account in profile under Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; and copy to the D drive.  - start tb, and click the account settings page - at bottom, for local directory, click the browse button to locate and select the account folder on D drive.  - exit and restart TB and verify that all is ok - if all is well, click in windows file explorer to the Mail&lt;accountfolder&gt; in profile and delete the account folder as it is no longer used.  </p><p>Your other approach is to move the original profile to another drive. Do that with TB not running. Then start profile manager (windowskey plus 'r' key and enter   thunderbird.exe   -p     then select 'create profile' then next then enter a profile name and then click the browse button to locate and select your profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In Thunderbird avevamo 4 account, relativamente ai 4 famigliari presenti. 3 di essi son andati persi, in quanto in Thunderbird non si riusciva a ricevere più la posta. La prima volta, molti anni fa, son riuscito a recuperarli, reimmenttendoli in Thunderbird stesso e recuperando la posta pregressa. La volta successiva, 2 anni orsono, e in tempi successivi, non ci son più riuscito. Le mail dei tre famigliari esistono e ben funzionano in Google. Vorrei ripristinare tali account postali, anche in Thunderbird. Nella speranza di essere riuscito ad esprimermi a modo dovuto, restiamo in attesa di un vs riscontro, posto sia possibile il rientro in Thunderbird, per i 3 famigliari di cui le mail risultano sopracitate. Nella parola del precedente messaggio: ""indegnarcene"", è stata inavvertitamente posta la d al posto della s (insegnarcene). Ribadisco, per ulteriore chiarezza: 1) si possono ripristinare, in Thunderbird, dei precedenti account? 2) i citati 3 account, son esistenti in Google (come prima lo erano anche in Thunderbird). 3) potete ripristinarli voi stessi? 4) potreste, in alternativa, insegnarci come procedere, passo per passo? </p>",Aldomarola,false,0,0
