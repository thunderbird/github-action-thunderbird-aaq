This is either based on a generic password I guess we can call it,  or a primary password.  As I am the only user of my password protected windows account on this machine,  I do not use a primary password as it serves little purpose for me.  My passwords are still stored on the local machine in an encrypted form,  but decrypting them is fairly trivial. </p><p>You have chosen to store the file on your local hard disk using a primary password,  this is something you chose to use to enhance the encryption of the password store.  It is not sent anywhere,  simply becomes part of your local Thunderbird install and is not actually stored anywhere that it can be accessed without the use of the primary password.  If it was stored in an accessible location then it would obviously be no more secure that the passwords with the generic encryption.  Hence it can not be sent to you because it is encrypted and can not be unencrypted with the password you no longer have.   </p><p>The situation you are in is equivalent to you buying a combination padlock for your shed door,  changing the combination and then forgetting what you changed it to.  Writing to the company that made the padlock will get advice of the type ""use bolt cutters"" if you can not remember your combination.  We are telling you much the same thing,  you forgot the password that protects your password storage file,  then we can delete it and you, as David explained, can enter those passwords again,  but we can not recover them or the combination that accessed the file because we literally do not know it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,1

I am still confused about a few things, and maybe you can help me to understand what's going on.  After your previous message I looked into the difference between the IMAP and POP message delivery modes.  The Settings tab in my TB file says the system is using the IMAP mode.  However, there is a Local Folders sub-setting and that's where I found all my files.  So, as I understand it, Comcast delivers messages to me via IMAP and right into my Local Folders Inbox.  I presume the messages are then removed from the Comcast server to free up their storage space.  But, that seems to me to fit the definition of a POP mode, so it's a bit confusing to me.  Nevertheless, it appears that my TB program has now recovered and should work just fine. </p><p>However, I do have at least one remaining issue.  The previous messages that were UNREAD, but were filtered out by my Message Filters and were immediately deleted, were apparently stored on the Comcast server until they actually do delete them (looks like 2 months because the oldest one is dated 8/7/23).  Since I opened up a new TB account yesterday, per TB's recommendation, these messages have now shown up as UNREAD messages in the Comcast parent inbox, apparently waiting for me to read them.  Previously, they would have been delivered to my Local Folders Inbox, where all my mail shows up, and would have immediately been filtered out (deleted).  So, I don't understand what's going on with that.  There are over 3,000 messages of this type that are sitting in that inbox.  Related to this, is there some way I can apply my Message Filters to wipe these all out? </p><p>And, hopefully the final issue that I have to resolve is that TB has changed the way my screen is laid out.  There are now 3 vertical columns.  On the left is the familiar tree showing all the folders, which was there previously, but now there is a column in the middle that shows all the messages in a format that is not what I had previously, and then on the right is the selected message.  What I had previously was a simple listing of the messages on the upper half and the selected message opened up down below.  Why would TB change this?  I suspect this was done during the most recent update, which occurred on Thursday, if I recall. </p><p>And, as a final thought, once the dust has settled, I wonder if my setup with parent file folders and then local file folders is the normal way of setting up a TB directory.  It seems redundant to me in some respects.  And I wonder what I <em>should</em> have done to move my TB files off my C: drive instead of the simple Copy and Paste, which didn't work.  </p><p>Thanks again, David, for steering me in the right direction.  I'm not 100% there, but at least I can get to all my files! </p><p>Tom. </p>",AccordionTom,false,0,0

I could not find anything there related to ""account"" or ""accountname"" or my own username. </p><p>Then, since I had already copied all the files over to D:, I looked in there under Mail.  There are 4 folders:  Local Folders, <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a>, smart mailboxes, and smart mailboxes-1. </p><p>I must have corrupted the file somehow.   </p><p>Any thoughts? </p>",AccordionTom,false,0,0

Here are the basics, in case you do this again. When TB starts, it looks at the profiles.ini file on C drive, which is a text file that tells it where the profile is. Solving your problem can be done by moving the profile, or by moving the account. I prefer moving the account because that is easiest to explain - and it's the account that uses all that disc space. If you still have the original profile, this can be easy. If you've corrupted it, we'll have to slowly work through it.  I will assume here that you can reconstruct the original profile.  - exit TB - locate account in profile under Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; and copy to the D drive.  - start tb, and click the account settings page - at bottom, for local directory, click the browse button to locate and select the account folder on D drive.  - exit and restart TB and verify that all is ok - if all is well, click in windows file explorer to the Mail&lt;accountfolder&gt; in profile and delete the account folder as it is no longer used.  </p><p>Your other approach is to move the original profile to another drive. Do that with TB not running. Then start profile manager (windowskey plus 'r' key and enter   thunderbird.exe   -p     then select 'create profile' then next then enter a profile name and then click the browse button to locate and select your profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

In Thunderbird avevamo 4 account, relativamente ai 4 famigliari presenti. 3 di essi son andati persi, in quanto in Thunderbird non si riusciva a ricevere più la posta. La prima volta, molti anni fa, son riuscito a recuperarli, reimmenttendoli in Thunderbird stesso e recuperando la posta pregressa. La volta successiva, 2 anni orsono, e in tempi successivi, non ci son più riuscito. Le mail dei tre famigliari esistono e ben funzionano in Google. Vorrei ripristinare tali account postali, anche in Thunderbird. Nella speranza di essere riuscito ad esprimermi a modo dovuto, restiamo in attesa di un vs riscontro, posto sia possibile il rientro in Thunderbird, per i 3 famigliari di cui le mail risultano sopracitate. Nella parola del precedente messaggio: ""indegnarcene"", è stata inavvertitamente posta la d al posto della s (insegnarcene). Ribadisco, per ulteriore chiarezza: 1) si possono ripristinare, in Thunderbird, dei precedenti account? 2) i citati 3 account, son esistenti in Google (come prima lo erano anche in Thunderbird). 3) potete ripristinarli voi stessi? 4) potreste, in alternativa, insegnarci come procedere, passo per passo? </p>",Aldomarola,false,0,0

I have tried to remove every thing and do a fresh install but still the same not starting (both 115 and 112) luckily I had saved my profile with some of the double entry's removed  and put it back and then installed it again, So now I'm back to the original problem of the program  freezing and becomes unresponsive after 10 or so minutes of use. when I get time I'll make a new profile and see if this helps, I'll post what happens then.

Also I use the same core LOCAL FOLDERS for all my inbound accounts (now only one inbound mail account) online.  </p><p>Prior to this week, a folder would open after (I'd say) 2 seconds with mouse pointer sitting on it. This was still too short a time for me but I figured my shaking hand issues made my own moving a messages a bit harder (slower). Now that time is less than one second. The time it takes for me to to touch a folder long enough for a ""being dragged message"", to actually move to that folder, is more than enough time to also open the folder. Usually the folder opens well before a dragged given message moves to that folder. </p><p>Another thing that started about 3 to 4 weeks ago, is that I get unable to move error messages errors when running my message filters. This happens both in auto message filter mode and when I manually run message filters or manually run ""get messages"". Subsequent tries sometimes succeed and sometimes take up to 6 additional tries to finally get all the messages to be moved to the corresponding folders, from inbox.
