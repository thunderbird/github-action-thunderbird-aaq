Here are the basics, in case you do this again. When TB starts, it looks at the profiles.ini file on C drive, which is a text file that tells it where the profile is. Solving your problem can be done by moving the profile, or by moving the account. I prefer moving the account because that is easiest to explain - and it's the account that uses all that disc space. If you still have the original profile, this can be easy. If you've corrupted it, we'll have to slowly work through it.  I will assume here that you can reconstruct the original profile.  - exit TB - locate account in profile under Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; and copy to the D drive.  - start tb, and click the account settings page - at bottom, for local directory, click the browse button to locate and select the account folder on D drive.  - exit and restart TB and verify that all is ok - if all is well, click in windows file explorer to the Mail&lt;accountfolder&gt; in profile and delete the account folder as it is no longer used.  </p><p>Your other approach is to move the original profile to another drive. Do that with TB not running. Then start profile manager (windowskey plus 'r' key and enter   thunderbird.exe   -p     then select 'create profile' then next then enter a profile name and then click the browse button to locate and select your profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
