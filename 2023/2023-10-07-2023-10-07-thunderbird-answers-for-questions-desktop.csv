TB 102.15.1 and decades before, the Get Messages button had a expanding menu which allowed one to select which mail box you wanted to GET the mail from, when you use multiple email addresses. So we can close this case, please expand on how, with later TB versions, to add a ""Get Messages"" button to the unified toolbar at the top. Thanks, John </p>",vk4jkl,false,0,0

I suggest you try that one.  If that does not do it.
