This way, when I get to an email to delete or junk (most of 'em these days!) I simply use the mouse to click delete/junk/move, whatever it needs, then continue to scroll with the Down arrow. It seems with new Supernova that this is no longer possible. If an email is highlighted then I can arrow scroll as usual but as soon as I,say, delete one then I loose the highlight bar (it's gone with the deleted email) and the arrows no longer work until I use the mouse to highlight another email. Am I missing something here or has this characteristic been removed? (hope I've described this clearly) Thanks Chris </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",chris119

I have multiple email addresses, but I'm having problems for a good year or so with one of my gmail accounts that gets a lot of junk mail.  Gmail filters suspected junk mail and places it in a folder called spam.  I know how to use webmail and mark an email as not spam.  I also know how to setup a filter that says, Never send to spam.  Despite taking these steps, I have messages that within a minute of marking ""not spam"", end up moving right back to the spam folder.  I've been trying everything I can think of and then I found under settings that I could uncheck <strong>Show in IMAP</strong> for the Spam folder and it wouldn't appear in Thunderbird. &lt;see image attached&gt;  Once I did that, I could mark a message as ""not spam"" or just move back to my inbox through webmail and it will now stay in the inbox.  But that means I can't view the spam folder through Thunderbird, which isn't ideal. </p><p>So I need help determining what is causing the emails to move from the Inbox to Spam when IMAP is turned on for the Spam folder and I open Thunderbird so that I can hopefully stop Thunderbird from moving them.  I've tried unchecking adaptive junk mail, SpamAssassin, and Move new junk messages. &lt;see images attached&gt; </p><p>What can I do and where can I look to determine what is causing the emails to move when Spam is turned on in IMAP? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help, Elspeth Coats </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",webcoats
