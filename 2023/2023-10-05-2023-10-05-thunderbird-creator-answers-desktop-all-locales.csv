Over 25 years (starting with Mulberry) I have built up a custom IMAP folder hierarchy that makes work manageable, but Thunderbird 115 has broken this, now displaying nested subfolders at the top level sorted alphabetically. See the images for before and after. For example, there are now three ""Administrative"" folders that were formerly classified under superordinate folders for my roles as lab leader, graduate program chair, and departmental faculty member. Persons who used to be in Colleagues or Students subfolders are now at top level. Inexplicably, a few folders retained their hierarchy but most are flattened out. Now I need to scroll through hundreds of folders (have not counted recently but in the late 2000's I had over 500.)  </p><p>I was able to revert to 102.14 using backups, but will be stuck with this version for the rest of my career unless Thunderbird fixes these problems. Thunderbird is so important to me that I make an automated monthly donation to the project, but will have to cancel if this is not fixed. </p><p>If anyone has found a work around please LMK. And Thunderbird team, please acknowledge and LMK whether this will be addressed or are IMAP users left behind?  </p><p>Thanks, Dan Suthers </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1608731;1608904;1608969;1609026;1611860;1614536;1614538;1615053;1616244;1616281;1616294;1616337;1616340;1616498;1616500;1616793;1616797;1616877;1616893;1616966;1616969;1617086;1620171;1620337;1620359;1620365;1620406;,dan_suthers
