I have multiple email addresses, but I'm having problems for a good year or so with one of my gmail accounts that gets a lot of junk mail.  Gmail filters suspected junk mail and places it in a folder called spam.  I know how to use webmail and mark an email as not spam.  I also know how to setup a filter that says, Never send to spam.  Despite taking these steps, I have messages that within a minute of marking ""not spam"", end up moving right back to the spam folder.  I've been trying everything I can think of and then I found under settings that I could uncheck <strong>Show in IMAP</strong> for the Spam folder and it wouldn't appear in Thunderbird. &lt;see image attached&gt;  Once I did that, I could mark a message as ""not spam"" or just move back to my inbox through webmail and it will now stay in the inbox.  But that means I can't view the spam folder through Thunderbird, which isn't ideal. </p><p>So I need help determining what is causing the emails to move from the Inbox to Spam when IMAP is turned on for the Spam folder and I open Thunderbird so that I can hopefully stop Thunderbird from moving them.  I've tried unchecking adaptive junk mail, SpamAssassin, and Move new junk messages. &lt;see images attached&gt; </p><p>What can I do and where can I look to determine what is causing the emails to move when Spam is turned on in IMAP? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help, Elspeth Coats </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",webcoats

However, I have always used View/Source to check if an email is spam that got through without opening the email.  What happened to that option?  I do <em>not</em> want to open an email to view the source of it.  View doesn't have that option, and if it's hiding, I sure can't find it. </p><p>I've mentioned before, too, that sometime back Thunderbird removed the distinction between which emails were read and which weren't.  I've been hoping that function would come back, but so far it is still elusive, just like View Source. </p><p>Another thing that is frustrating is the removal of ""File"".  Yes, I do not like this new update.  As far as I'm concerned it is far from intuitive and clumsy.  I may have to find another email client to replace the one I have used forever.  Sad. </p><p>But, please, can someone point me to where I can restore the View contents that include View/Source at the bottom?  Am I going to have to poke around in the config to see if it's hidden there now? </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>""Not the bunny"" </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1608413;,enrjyzr
