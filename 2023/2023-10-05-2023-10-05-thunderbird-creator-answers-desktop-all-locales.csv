Thunderbird version is 115.3.1 </p><p>Here is a snapshot that shows: − a useless ""status"" bar <strong>without folder total/unread numbers</strong>, − menu bar and toolbar inverted,  − a huge list of message that <strong>cannot be reduced below 8 lines</strong>; why the hell someone as added this limit that didn't exist before!? We could reduce to one line if we want or… punctually need it.  − a <strong>TOTALLY useless message list header</strong> (name on folder panel, size in status bar, filter in upper toolbar − a NOT CONFIGURABLE message header, especially, impossible to <strong>choose the kind of button</strong> (text or icon, to get PLACE) in the action bar… that starts with a SPACE! Neither can we choose which buttons to move in the drop down list ""plus"". Actually, the message list header was used to display such actions. This would free space. − a useless empty space above the account panel; it would be much better to get back the receive All/this account button on top. − finally, the whole aim of a mail software is to… READ EMAIL… in <strong>a space as large as the private life warning banner!</strong> This is just nonsense, unacceptable. It started years ago for some of these designs, but now it is the worse I have ever seen; it makes thunderbird simply unusable.

Especially since there is no more title bar… (I just have found the <strong>ONE squared cm</strong> that allows it, with no menu bar…) </p><p>So, how can I set back old disposition or how can I set it in a pleasant and usable way?

I have multiple email addresses, but I'm having problems for a good year or so with one of my gmail accounts that gets a lot of junk mail.  Gmail filters suspected junk mail and places it in a folder called spam.  I know how to use webmail and mark an email as not spam.  I also know how to setup a filter that says, Never send to spam.  Despite taking these steps, I have messages that within a minute of marking ""not spam"", end up moving right back to the spam folder.  I've been trying everything I can think of and then I found under settings that I could uncheck <strong>Show in IMAP</strong> for the Spam folder and it wouldn't appear in Thunderbird. &lt;see image attached&gt;  Once I did that, I could mark a message as ""not spam"" or just move back to my inbox through webmail and it will now stay in the inbox.  But that means I can't view the spam folder through Thunderbird, which isn't ideal. </p><p>So I need help determining what is causing the emails to move from the Inbox to Spam when IMAP is turned on for the Spam folder and I open Thunderbird so that I can hopefully stop Thunderbird from moving them.  I've tried unchecking adaptive junk mail, SpamAssassin, and Move new junk messages. &lt;see images attached&gt; </p><p>What can I do and where can I look to determine what is causing the emails to move when Spam is turned on in IMAP? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help, Elspeth Coats </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",webcoats
