I used to be able to click on that and all of my unread email would appear while the read mail was hidden.  Pressing the UNREAD button again, caused all of my mail to appear again.  That button was extremely helpful and very fast to use. </p><p>How do I now get my UNREAD mail to appear easily and then revert to ALL mail to be showing once again?? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",shykat65

However, I have always used View/Source to check if an email is spam that got through without opening the email.  What happened to that option?  I do <em>not</em> want to open an email to view the source of it.  View doesn't have that option, and if it's hiding, I sure can't find it. </p><p>I've mentioned before, too, that sometime back Thunderbird removed the distinction between which emails were read and which weren't.  I've been hoping that function would come back, but so far it is still elusive, just like View Source. </p><p>Another thing that is frustrating is the removal of ""File"".  Yes, I do not like this new update.  As far as I'm concerned it is far from intuitive and clumsy.  I may have to find another email client to replace the one I have used forever.  Sad. </p><p>But, please, can someone point me to where I can restore the View contents that include View/Source at the bottom?  Am I going to have to poke around in the config to see if it's hidden there now? </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>""Not the bunny"" </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1608413;,enrjyzr
