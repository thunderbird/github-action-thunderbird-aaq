Imap setup. I never configured my account to (not) display specific custom/system Labels: I live with the default (plus a few that I created through TB): actually, I do not even know how to do it, if at all possible.  So, my TB displays: Inbox, Sent, [Gmail]-&gt;Drafts, [Gmail]-&gt;Sent Mail, [Gmail]-&gt;All Mail, [Gmail]-&gt; Spam, [Gmail]-&gt; Important, [Gmail]-&gt;Starred, [Gmail]-&gt;Trash, &lt;Folder/Label-1&gt;, &lt;Folder/Label-n&gt;, Local Folders (see snapshot 1). I just realized that I do not need All Mail and most of the [Gmail]-&gt;&lt;Folder&gt;s (with the possible exception of Drafts). Actually, this stuff eats up a lot of storage on my disk and causes a lot of internet traffic to sync-up. </p><p>Possibly connected to the above, Activity Manager keeps saying it is synchronizing All Mail and &lt;Labels&gt; even though there is no activity on neither side (client or server). It seems Activity Manager hangs forever. </p><p>Here are my questions: 1. Forget about this. I understand what happened here. Apologies!  How come I have two Sent folders: Sent and [Gmail]-&gt;Sent Mail 2. How do I remove All Mail locally to save storage (we are talking GBs here)? Being an imap folder: if I remove it on disk (e.g. deleting some [Gmail]/All Mail), it will be re-synchronized quickly; if I delete it from TB, I will basically erase all my Gmail on the server ... (well, it might get complicated: as the Inbox is still there and Gmail might repopulate its All Mail ... not sure). Neither one sounds good. 3. How do I make [Gmail]-&gt;* disappear from my TB folder hierarchy? 4. I've seen I'm not the only one noticing this, but Activity Manager says messages get deleted in this or that folder even though I did not try to delete anything (my mobile client only sync-ups when I ask to). It's hard to say what mails are referred to (see snapshot 2) as there are multiple trash bins and I actually deleted messages from that folder in the past few days. Can Activity Manager be trusted? If so, where are these ""delete"" commands coming from? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Franz </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1599837;,skyshado-info
