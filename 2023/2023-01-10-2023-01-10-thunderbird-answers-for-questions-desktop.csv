This does make it get data faster.

Everything is stored in your ""Profile"", (though not sure about multiple mail accounts as I have only one). Your Profile is located in ""C:\Users\**&lt;username&gt;**\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles"" If it/they are over 2GB in size you need to manually copy it/them. If less, then you can use the Export option from Thunderbird. </p><p>Hope that helps. Jules </p>",mozilla391,false,2,0

Make sure you have file explorer set to show hidden files. </p><p>1. Find the directory <strong>C:\Users\<em>your-user-name</em>\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</strong> on your old hard drive and copy it to the new hard drive. </p><p>2. Then install Thunderbird. </p><p>My file was about 17 GB in size because I had saved a lot of mail in local folders over the years. Thanks Jules for pointing me in the right direction.
