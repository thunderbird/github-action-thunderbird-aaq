Here is all you need to manage this threaded decision that has had many complaints since its release.

If this applies to just a few folders, just repeat the process as necessary. If you have many folders or plan to add many new folders, you may wish a different approach, below:  </p><p>More info:  To change default for *new* folders, In config editor, you can change default that applies to NEW folders you set up: mailnews.default_view_flags      0=unthreaded   </p><p>Config editor is available at Tools&gt;settings&gt;general and scroll to bottom right.  </p><pre> ------------ </pre> <p>To set many *existing* folders, follow these steps: (I creates a crude video that walks through the steps at    </p><pre>   <a href=""https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davidkirk.org/SettingDefaultFolderView.mp4</a>  that demonstrates the following steps: </pre>  <pre>   First, highlight a folder that you have set to unthreaded	    In the Message List view, in the column header, on the far right, open the options button that shows         context menu.&nbsp;:    At the very bottom is the option:    -&gt; ""Apply current view to...""    -&gt; ""Folder and its children...""    -&gt; Hover over an account    -&gt; In the next menu don't select a folder. Instead select the account name itself.  ALSO, for future installations of Thunderbird,  - install Thunderbird and exit prior to setting up accounts - create a simple text file with name of user.js with these lines:       // Set default threading to UNthreaded  ###   &lt;== this line is optional, just for documentation      user_pref(""mailnews.default_view_flags"", 0); - copy the user.js file into the profile - now, when you start Thunderbird, unthreading will be the default.

I reviewed all the Gmail account requirements to insure the account was properly setup. The comcast account requested my account password on accessing the inbox and stored it in the Password Manager for the imap account.  It did not store the smtp entry until I attempted to send an email using the comcast account.   When I tried to access the Gmail inbox I was presented with the Gmail username dialog, the password dialog and then the permissions dialog.  On selecting Allow, I got an authentication error from Thunderbird.  If the login information was incorrect I don't believe I would have reached the permissions dialog.  When I tried to send email using <a href=""http://gmail.smpt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.smpt.com</a> I went straight the the permissions dialog, bypassing username and password. The URL is in the <a href=""https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/legacy/consent?authuser=0&amp;part="" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/legacy/consent?authuser=0&amp;part=</a>&lt;...&gt;&amp;as=&lt;...&gt;&amp;client_id=&lt;...&gt;.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;pli=1&amp;<a href=""http://rapt.apps.googleusercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">rapt.apps.googleusercontent.com</a>&amp;pli=1&amp;rapt==&lt;...&gt; format. No gmail entries are in the password manager.  When I close Thunderbird and restart it, Thunderbird goes directly to the Google permissions screen bypassing username and password dialogs.  So I still contend Thunderbird must be storing some identification data somewhere other than the password safe.   I will return to Google to attempt to determine why they are rejecting my request. </p>",aorcutt1,false,0,0

I posted the gmail help site.  If I create the account automatically and login to google through their portal, I get to the permissions screen (which means I must have used the correct credentials) and select Allow but Thunderbird reports ""Unable to log in"".   If I then close the account page that account disappears.  If I create it again and manually configure it the account sticks around, the password is stored and the permission screen comes up when I open Thunderbird or try to access the inbox.  What is weird and why I opened this, is that if I delete the passwords from the Password Manager, nothing changes.  I never get asked to login to Google again.  I go straight to the Google permission screen.  If the password were missing, I should go to the Google login.  I even dropped and reinstalled 115 and imported Everything from an export of the previously working system and I still can't connect to Google.  Reminds me a bit of a turn I took in the banking industry where one of their security  people quipped, ""If you can't get to the data, we're doing our job right.""

Everyone suggests this, but it would seem nobody actually uses that add-on, otherwise they'd know it's limitations. Sure, IET-NG SAYS that it exports a single PDF, but I've never got it to work. Once upon a time, I contacted their support and they blew me off several times before saying, ""Yeah, that isn't a feature."" </p><p>PLEASE read the original post. Thunderbird ALREADY exports single PDF files. The problems are: a) you HAVE to name each file individually (just like IET-NG) and b) I'm not paying secretaries to combine PDF files when Outlook does it, plain and simple straight out of the box, no mods or addins needed. Besides, I'd be asking over a dozen people to learn AND ADHERE to a workflow that MUST be precise. That's not gonna happen with 5 people, let alone the number involved in this scenario. Also, we'd have to purchase the software for every workstation to keep everything in-house, as these are legal documents and CANNOT be processed through an online SAS solution. </p><p>Nothing against y'all, but EVERY time I post about this, I always get flack about ""why are you doing this? that's stupid!"" Others give complicated workarounds that would be either costly to implement or just completely unfeasible. </p><p>Again, the original posted question was ""Why can't TBird export multiple emails into ONE pdf file, as Outlook has ALWAYS done?"" There is currently NO TBird add-on solution that accomplished what Outlooks does natively. Select the emails, hit the print button, hit print button, name the file.
