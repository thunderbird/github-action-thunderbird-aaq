I reviewed all the Gmail account requirements to insure the account was properly setup. The comcast account requested my account password on accessing the inbox and stored it in the Password Manager for the imap account.  It did not store the smtp entry until I attempted to send an email using the comcast account.   When I tried to access the Gmail inbox I was presented with the Gmail username dialog, the password dialog and then the permissions dialog.  On selecting Allow, I got an authentication error from Thunderbird.  If the login information was incorrect I don't believe I would have reached the permissions dialog.  When I tried to send email using <a href=""http://gmail.smpt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.smpt.com</a> I went straight the the permissions dialog, bypassing username and password. The URL is in the <a href=""https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/legacy/consent?authuser=0&amp;part="" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/legacy/consent?authuser=0&amp;part=</a>&lt;...&gt;&amp;as=&lt;...&gt;&amp;client_id=&lt;...&gt;.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;pli=1&amp;<a href=""http://rapt.apps.googleusercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">rapt.apps.googleusercontent.com</a>&amp;pli=1&amp;rapt==&lt;...&gt; format. No gmail entries are in the password manager.  When I close Thunderbird and restart it, Thunderbird goes directly to the Google permissions screen bypassing username and password dialogs.  So I still contend Thunderbird must be storing some identification data somewhere other than the password safe.   I will return to Google to attempt to determine why they are rejecting my request. </p>",aorcutt1,false,0,0

I posted the gmail help site.  If I create the account automatically and login to google through their portal, I get to the permissions screen (which means I must have used the correct credentials) and select Allow but Thunderbird reports ""Unable to log in"".   If I then close the account page that account disappears.  If I create it again and manually configure it the account sticks around, the password is stored and the permission screen comes up when I open Thunderbird or try to access the inbox.  What is weird and why I opened this, is that if I delete the passwords from the Password Manager, nothing changes.  I never get asked to login to Google again.  I go straight to the Google permission screen.  If the password were missing, I should go to the Google login.  I even dropped and reinstalled 115 and imported Everything from an export of the previously working system and I still can't connect to Google.  Reminds me a bit of a turn I took in the banking industry where one of their security  people quipped, ""If you can't get to the data, we're doing our job right.""

Everyone suggests this, but it would seem nobody actually uses that add-on, otherwise they'd know it's limitations. Sure, IET-NG SAYS that it exports a single PDF, but I've never got it to work. Once upon a time, I contacted their support and they blew me off several times before saying, ""Yeah, that isn't a feature."" </p><p>PLEASE read the original post. Thunderbird ALREADY exports single PDF files. The problems are: a) you HAVE to name each file individually (just like IET-NG) and b) I'm not paying secretaries to combine PDF files when Outlook does it, plain and simple straight out of the box, no mods or addins needed. Besides, I'd be asking over a dozen people to learn AND ADHERE to a workflow that MUST be precise. That's not gonna happen with 5 people, let alone the number involved in this scenario.

I thought something had been corrupted since this view did not agree with the actual view I was seeing.  The only Spaces I use in Thunderbird is MAIL. </blockquote> <p>About the first thing I turned off was the spaces toolbar in V102.  While I could not get rid of it entirely I clicked the hide option so it is just a button on the toolbar.  Sadly it demands first place there, but in the new version I find myself opening it as it is the only way to get to things like the address book until I get around to customizing things.  Even then I don't like supernova,  far to many things are simply not there or incomplete.unless serious customization is undertaken is is now the only way to access the address book calendar etc. </p><p>The idea that the user should have control of the menu location has been raised in the feedback forum.  You might like to add your vote.  There appear to only be four of us so far that think having it in the middle is a rather poor choice. <a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/allow-the-user-to-place-the-menu-bar-at-the-top-of-the-window/idc-p/38004#M22023"" rel=""nofollow"">https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/allow-the-user-to-place-the-menu-bar-at-the-top-of-the-window/idc-p/38004#M22023</a> </p>",MattAuSupport,false,2,0
