Besides, I'd be asking over a dozen people to learn AND ADHERE to a workflow that MUST be precise. That's not gonna happen with 5 people, let alone the number involved in this scenario.

It has never been possible, with or without an add-on, to combine several messages in a single pdf file.

What is weird and why I opened this, is that if I delete the passwords from the Password Manager, nothing changes.  I never get asked to login to Google again.  I go straight to the Google permission screen.  If the password were missing, I should go to the Google login.  I even dropped and reinstalled 115 and imported Everything from an export of the previously working system and I still can't connect to Google.

I reviewed all the Gmail account requirements to insure the account was properly setup. The comcast account requested my account password on accessing the inbox and stored it in the Password Manager for the imap account.  It did not store the smtp entry until I attempted to send an email using the comcast account.   When I tried to access the Gmail inbox I was presented with the Gmail username dialog, the password dialog and then the permissions dialog.  On selecting Allow, I got an authentication error from Thunderbird.  If the login information was incorrect I don't believe I would have reached the permissions dialog.  When I tried to send email using <a href=""http://gmail.smpt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.smpt.com</a> I went straight the the permissions dialog, bypassing username and password. The URL is in the <a href=""https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/legacy/consent?authuser=0&amp;part="" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth/legacy/consent?authuser=0&amp;part=</a>&lt;...&gt;&amp;as=&lt;...&gt;&amp;client_id=&lt;...&gt;.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;pli=1&amp;<a href=""http://rapt.apps.googleusercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">rapt.apps.googleusercontent.com</a>&amp;pli=1&amp;rapt==&lt;...&gt; format. No gmail entries are in the password manager.  When I close Thunderbird and restart it, Thunderbird goes directly to the Google permissions screen bypassing username and password dialogs.  So I still contend Thunderbird must be storing some identification data somewhere other than the password safe.   I will return to Google to attempt to determine why they are rejecting my request. </p>",aorcutt1,false,0,0

But these are simple features that are very lacking in Thunderbird, without diving into the world of themes. </p><p>Generally, Thunderbird is lacking heavily in the accessibility department. The abrupt reply here ('it affects accessibility') kind of says it all. Mozilla is dictacting how the e-mail experience should be for users.

My previous workflow was to have the Work Inbox open while at work and only occasionally hover over my personal and other secondary Inboxes to see if there's anything new that needs attention. Now I can't do that without completely switching context. </p><p>It's really short-sighted to remove established features for reasons as vaguely defined as ""accessibility"".
