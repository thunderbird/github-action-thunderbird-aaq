First, it appears that new e-mail messages are starting to populate my inbox again, and they are again coming in in duplicates. All messages prior to today and dating back to 1/1/2022 are still missing in action. According to the inbox in my profile dated today it contains 7,219 KB of data. I know that it was much larger than this prior to this crash or whatever this event would be called. For example, my ""drafts"" folder currently says it contains 839,028 KB and there is not one draft in that folder. To answer your second question, I have the MS Defender antivirus which was installed with this version of Windows back on 7/19/2021. It tells me that everything is up to date and no issues have been detected. I assume that it scans my system periodically but I do not generally scan it manually or independently of whatever it does in the background.

Life distractions forced me to simply live with this problem, until this week when I was able to give it attention again.

I discovered that duplicate messages began to appear on the server as well and I got through to their support department, which discovered the source of the problem rather quickly and resolved it on their end. I'm embarrassed that it turned out not to be a TB issue, but the duplication of messages didn't show up on the server until now.
